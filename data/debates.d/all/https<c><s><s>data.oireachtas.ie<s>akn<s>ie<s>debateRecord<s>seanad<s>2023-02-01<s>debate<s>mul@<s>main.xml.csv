I thank him for being here. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has to attend a funeral and cannot be here, but she is aware of the issues I am about to raise. I hope there can be action on them. Danu Community Special School opened in November 2019 under the patronage of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, in a temporary location in the Hansfield Educate Together Secondary School building. It made do while it was there even though it was on the first floor, which is not ideal for a special school, and did not have its own distinct space. It then moved to what could be its permanent location, at Rath Dara Community College. There it is accommodated in an annexe of an existing school. It is not appropriate accommodation for this special school. This is the first special school that has been built in 15 years by the Department of Education, the first special school in Dublin 15 and DDLETB's first special school, but it is not what should be. It does not have the purpose-built accommodation tailored to the complex needs of the school that is required and it does not show the ambition these children deserve. It does not fit with the vision we all hoped for when we campaigned for this school. When I use the term "we", I mean the parents and school community in Dublin 15. Every child needs to be able to reach his or her full potential. I will address three specific areas of concern. The first is that I do not understand why the school was built by the DDLETB rather than through the expertise of the Department of Education for a special school. One can see this in the current accommodation. New schools such as Edmund Rice College, the national school in Palmerstown and Coláiste Pobail Setanta have a dedicated space, base or unit, whatever way one wishes to describe it as, that is tailored to the children and learning life skills. I visited Danu Community Special School and saw that, because the accommodation is not appropriate for these children, the teachers are burning a lot of energy doing things they should not have to do. The accommodation is not wheelchair accessible and the students do not have an appropriate outdoor sensory space similar to those present at many other schools. There is hoarding around the outdoor space and a lot of noise from traffic. The classrooms are not of a suitable size. There is not enough space to design a flow that accommodates the needs of children. There is supposed to be a living space like a kitchen or a mini-apartment but it is tiny. The school does not have facilities of its own, such as an assembly room or outdoor facilities. It does not even know where the perimeter of its outdoor space is. A second issue is that I do not believe the special education review committee, SERC, allocations for special schools are sufficient. They are based on primary schools. The school has one special education teacher and two special needs assistants, SNAs, per class. That is the same as a special class. Where is the special status that should be attached to a special school? The principal is in charge of 40 staff but, because there are only six teachers, she does not get the supports she should have for managing 40 people. It is severely restricted. I will address the other issues after the Minister of State replies.

It is vital that every child and young person with special educational needs be fully supported in the education sector, whether in mainstream, a special class or a special school. Significant investment and reforms have been made to ensure this is the case. A priority for the Government is to ensure that all children have an appropriate school placement and that the necessary supports are provided to our schools to cater for the needs of children with special educational needs. This year, the Department of Education will spend in excess of €2.6 billion, or 27% of its budget, on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs. In 2022, funding for an additional 980 teachers and 1,165 special needs assistants was provided. For 2023, the Department has further increased the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools. There will be an additional 686 teachers and a further 1,194 SNAs in our schools next year. For the first time ever, therefore, 19,000 teachers will be working in the area of special education, alongside more than 20,000 special needs assistants. Together, almost 40,000 qualified and committed people in our schools will be focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs. Children will undoubtedly benefit, as is right and proper, from the additional focus these resources will bring to their education. The 686 new teacher posts will support children in both mainstream and specialist settings, including 205 new posts in mainstream schools and 480 posts for new special classes and in special schools. The 480 posts in specialist placements will facilitate the opening of 370 new special classes, catering for more than 2,000 children, and support an increase of 250 new special school places in 42 special schools. Budget 2023 also provided funding for additional staffing in both the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. Both these measures will ensure our schools and students benefit from the additional practical support from special educational needs organisers, NCSE advisers and educational psychologists. The NCSE has a process in place for reviewing the level of supports allocated to individual schools such as scoil Danu, which the Senator mentioned. Where schools consider they may require additional resources, they can engage directly with the NCSE to seek a review at any time. This review considers the specific needs of the children enrolled in the school. The NCSE has advised the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan’s, officials that they are working closely with the school in question to ensure it is resourced and supported to meet the needs of the children attending it. I assure the Senator the NCSE will continue to work with the school on any issues that may arise. While the additional funding being made available to provide more special education teachers, SNAs and NCSE supports in our schools is significant, it is accepted that a range of additional challenges face our special schools. These schools support children and young people with the most complex special educational needs. As for additional supports, special schools receive significant funding and have been resourced to reflect their particular needs. The Department recognises the additional challenges that arise for them and is actively engaging with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, to address some of these issues. It facilitated a series of meetings with special schools in November and has focused on a number of issues special schools face. The Department is collating the feedback from these meetings and will work further with NABMSE on the priority areas to be progressed. It is committed to progressing these issues from both an administrative and a budgetary point of view.

It is a one-size-fits-all approach, as opposed to a child getting additional support where he or she needs it. As for the building, the classrooms are not purpose built and teachers are spending a long time doing things they should not have to do, such as minding doors as opposed to teaching in a purpose-built environment. Furthermore, the school is in a DEIS area and is conjoined to a DEIS school, but it is not getting DEIS supports such as hot school meals. Very important oversights need to be looked at. The hope, from a parent's perspective, was always that this would be an autism school that was a centre of excellence. That is what we should aspire to. The best site for the school is the urology building in Blanchardstown, where a purpose-built school can be accommodated, not just for the children who need it now but for the growing need in the area into the future.

She has visited a large number of special schools and special classes since she took office and has seen the excellent work done for and with students. I have no doubt she would be more than happy to visit the Senator's area and the school in question. There are challenges and the Department and both the Minister for Education and the Minister of State are committed to continuing to work to ensure school communities will be supported in the vital work they do in special education.
#BarryWard	unknown-#BarryWard-party	unknown-#BarryWard-dob	unknown-#BarryWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	6	I am grateful to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for coming personally to deal with this matter because it is one of tremendous importance, and we know how topical it is in light of recent demonstrations. "Demonstration" is a very soft word for what has been happening in places such as Ashtown, where there have been attacks on people from different national, ethnic or racial groups. There is a significant risk that as a country we are allowing ourselves to go down a road where racism is becoming normal or somehow quasi-acceptable. What are we going to do to tackle that? I acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery of Emer O'Neill, an anti-racism activist who has been vocal, as a black Irish woman, in talking about her lived experience. While I note the bravery of my colleague, Senator Flynn, in respect of these kinds of issues, almost all the rest of us in this Chamber cannot understand the lived experience of people in this society who look different, come from different backgrounds or are of different ethnicities or races. When they go for a job interview or anywhere else, it is immediately obvious, in most cases, that they are different. The result of that is often discrimination, even if that is unconscious on the part of the person carrying out that discrimination. Almost everything about them, whether that is the way they look to their name, their background, where they attended college or whatever it might be, can tell an employer or someone else they are dealing with that they are a little different from an "Irish" person. That has resulted, in a number of instances about which I have been told, in people changing their names, for example.When they then go into an interview for a job, the employer realises that the person is not in fact who they expected. Emer O'Neill may be a case in point, because she sounds like an ordinary Irish person and she is mixed-race. If she goes into an interview, she is different from what the interviewer is expecting. This can have a knock-on effect for a person. This is what we are talking about when we talk about lived experience and the fact that we, or certainly I, cannot understand what that is. The reality, though, is that it has a huge impact on individuals, but also across society. One of the major issues is that it forces people to change who they are, what they have been and where they have come from. This is a shame, because one of the great benefits of cultural diversity is that it enhances our society and makes us stronger as a nation and a community. It renders this a nicer place to live if we are not totally homogenous in terms of the make-up of our society. The other danger that comes with this situation is that if we let the message go out to our young people that somehow diversity is a bad thing or that somehow people of colour or people who are ethnically or racially different do not occupy positions of power or leadership, then they do not learn that this is a normal thing. They do not learn that it is perfectly normal to have people who are different from us in roles that involve leadership and power. Those young people who go to America or Britain for jobs, for example, and find themselves in a situation where their manager or their boss, or whoever, is ethnically different somehow do not understand how they are going to deal with that person. We are, therefore, doing a disservice to our young people if we do not deal with this issue. Regarding what the Minister's Department needs to do, and I know he is strong on this issue of integration, we also know there is an anti-racism action plan. I understand it is ready to go and yet we have not seen it. This has never been more urgent than it is today. We have seen what happened in Ashtown even in the last week. This anti-racism action plan has never been as urgent as it is now. Where is this anti-racism action plan? What will the Minister's Department put in place to help us all understand the dangers and the harm that racism does? Equally, what are we doing to support those who are subjected to racial or ethnic abuse, to show them they are welcome, that the Government supports them and to put in place measures to ensure they know they have everyone's support, and not just that of a small number of people?

I did want the opportunity to speak to it myself. In my follow-up at the end, I will come back to some of the recent incidents. In the last 12 months, however, we have seen the largest humanitarian effort made in the history of the State. Since the start of last year, more than 85,000 people have arrived in Ireland fleeing war and persecution. In these difficult circumstances, Ireland has provided shelter and security. This is something we can be proud of as a country. However, there is clear evidence that racism exists in our country and we know there are some people who feel its impacts in their day-to-day lives. The Government has responded to this unprecedented humanitarian crisis in several ways in the past year. Several existing programmes also empower communities by funding anti-racism and integration activities throughout the State. It is important to say that the response to racism is a State-wide and country-wide response. No one Department will have the monopoly in terms of this response. Regarding the actions taking place within my Department, we have a range of funding streams in place to support locally-organised diversity and equality projects. We have the asylum, migration and integration fund, the communities integration fund, the national integration fund and the European Social Fund, ESF. In more specific areas, we provide funding to gender equality groups and to Traveller and Roma organisations to organise local diversity and quality events. There is, therefore, a wide range of funding mechanisms to support primarily local responses, recognising that it is also often these local conversations that are the most effective in tackling racism. Turning to the Senator's question on the national action plan, in 2020 the Government established the independent anti-racism committee with a view to strengthening the Government's approach to combating individual and institutional racism, and build on existing strategies. This was part of Ireland's response to a UN global call to tackle racism. Extensive public engagement and consultation was undertaken by the anti-racism committee across 2021 and 2022. The committee has submitted its final report to my Department and I and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, intend to bring the national action plan against racism to Cabinet imminently. Our plan, and I spoke about this at the UN last week, is to launch it in early March. This is an important step. It will be our first detailed national action plan against racism since 2008. This has been a gap in our State's response to the issue of racism, one that will be filled rapidly. On some other responses on the criminal law side, which I think are also important, as the Senator knows the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022 is before the Oireachtas. It will update laws on criminalising hate speech and legislate against hate crimes for the first time in Irish law. Although hate speech is currently an offence, the legislation is complex and has not delivered in a meaningful way. The new legislation will enable prosecution of offences which are motivated by prejudice against protected characteristics, including race, nationality or ethnic origin. Obviously, we know that much of the recent rhetoric has been focused on migrants. We do have a migrant integration strategy and this works to promote social cohesion across the State. There are mechanisms within it for the State, Government Departments and State agencies to support migrants and their wider integration in society. As I said earlier, financial supports are important, but it is supporting communities and on-the-ground engagement with people who may have heard incorrect rumours and lies and demonstrating to them that they are falsehoods that is often the most effective way to tackle some of the incidents we have seen recently.

I acknowledge the work his Department has done in integration and in accommodating people who have come here fleeing situations. I also recognise what he said about funds. He also said that it is not any one Department's responsibility. This is, of course, true. As I look at the students from the Loreto school in Dalkey sitting in the Public Gallery here, though, I wonder what we are doing to educate children in this regard? What are we doing in terms of the national anti-racism action plan? I appreciate this is coming to the Cabinet now and that is great, but what in that action plan is going to provide for education for people so that we start at the very beginning to show people where things lie? I say this because the real danger, as things stand, when we look at what happened in Ashtown, for example, is that we are allowing a them-and-us situation to evolve, where Irish people, mar dhea, are being pitched against people who are not Irish. This is really dangerous and really damaging. The thing many of us do not understand is that sometimes people who are ethnically different are accused of playing the race card, as it is called. They never want to do that. They just want to live their lives and be part of our community and if we had any sense we would realise that we gain enormous benefit from their being part of this community. Let us, therefore, do everything we can to ensure they can play that role.

People are entitled to protest and to have a different view from the Government's. This is absolutely fair and this happens. It is really important, though, to call out several recent incidents. Senator Ward referred to an attack on migrants in Ashtown, which was fuelled by lies put on social media regarding someone having been the victim of an assault. In recent days, we have also seen a building in Dublin set on fire. Again, this was as a result of lies put around by far-right groups. There is a deep and disturbing strand of racism behind several of these incidents. We must be very explicit about this. It is worrying and requires an all-of-government response. It requires parties across the Oireachtas to respond. In my engagement with the Government and the Opposition, I recognise that many people are showing leadership in their local communities and at some risk to themselves because politicians across the spectrum in recent weeks have had their houses and offices picketed. I wish to recognise, therefore, that there is leadership being shown across the spectrum, but this needs to continue.

We are here this morning because it has been impossible not to notice the welcome news in the newspapers that €50 is going back into every household's electricity accounts as a result of an error made by ESB Networks.The bigger question is as to why domestic customers were subsidising large energy users for 12 years. In 2009, the Government gave an instruction to the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to implement a subsidy on a permanent basis. The instruction was for domestic users to subsidise the network tariffs of large energy users. Large energy users include data centres and pharmaceutical companies. Those entities are very profitable. The plan was basically an instruction to the CRU to rebalance things in favour of large energy. It was allowed to go on for 12 years and was couched in language about protecting jobs because of the financial crash. Many households were on their knees at that time and could have done without subsidising these profitable companies, but it happened. The CRU allowed it to continue for 12 years. The CRU notified the Government that it had made a decision last year that it would unwind this subsidy. I have asked the Minister of State to come before the House because the Department of his predecessor, An Taoiseach, made a submission to the CRU on the back of the decision to unwind the subsidy that domestic households were paying to large energy users. The Department criticised the decision and said that the CRU was acting contrary to a ministerial direction. It said that the decision was punitive to industry and big business and that it would probably cost big businesses approximately €70 million. What the Department did not say is that it cost households €70 million and that the position in this regard needs to be redressed. Does the Minister of State support the view of his predecessor and the Department that the subsidy domestic households are paying towards large energy users should continue indefinitely as a permanent measure, as the Government of 2009 indicated to the CRU it wanted to see happen, or does he support his other colleague in Government, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who stood up in the Dáil last week and claimed credit for the removal of the subsidy by saying he had instructed the CRU to remove it, because it was unfair, after 12 years? Which does he support? Does he support the Minister, who is trying to claim credit for putting money back in people's pockets, when it was us who were chasing this for months, or does he support the view of the Taoiseach and that of is own Department to the effect that this is a punitive measure and that the average domestic household should continue to subsidise large energy users such as Amazon, Google and big pharmaceutical and agribusiness companies, which are all very profitable, and foot the bill for them in this regard in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis? That is the question for the Minister of State. Does he support the view of the Minister or that of the Taoiseach with regard to who should be paying this subsidy?

I agree with her that it is very welcome €50 is being refunded into many people's electricity bills this month. However, I am under no illusion about this being a tiny amount compared with the substantial rise in costs that individual and businesses of all sizes have been faced with when it comes to energy prices, largely due to Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and the knock-on effect that is having on the Continent. It is important to remember the various measures the Government has brought in to support business through the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which has been extended as per the announcement today, as well as the three €200 electricity credits that will be rolled out to households; not to mention the 80,000 additional households that will be eligible for the fuel allowance. With regard to the matter of the reallocation of network costs, I remind the House that the CRU is the independent regulator of various utilities in Ireland, including the electricity sector. The allocation of grid costs to energy customers, which was the subject of the CRU consultation to which my Department's submission relates, is entirely a matter for the CRU. The CRU is the appropriate regulator to ensure that grid tariffs appropriately reflect the cost of providing grid services alongside national policy objectives such as developing a smart grid system and decarbonisation. The CRU is directly accountable to the Oireachtas, and questions on the allocation of grid tariffs would most appropriately be put to it. The CRU consultation to which my Department was responding was about a proposed change to electricity network tariffs, which was in response to the national energy security framework agreed by Government last April. It is important to stress the consultation did not relate directly to the earlier CRU decision to unwind the rebalancing framework for large energy users which has been determined beforehand, to which I believe the Senator is referring. It is clear from my Department's submission that the word "punitive" was used to describe the cumulative effects of both the significant proposals that were the subject of the CRU consultation and the previous decision to unwind the large energy user rebalancing framework, which did not form part of the proposal. The submission made no judgment on the decision to unwind the large energy users rebalancing framework, except to highlight that it had been done without consultation. The Government is focused on facilitating investment in our energy system to deliver price competitiveness over the medium term for all users. We are determined to deliver a diversified energy system with significant support for energy efficiency and renewables, alongside independent regulation in the event the CRU implemented its proposals only in part, with the changes aimed at protecting security of supply.

That information was obtained, via a freedom-of-information request, from email correspondence. The CRU is independent, and yet it implemented this decision on the instruction of a Minister in 2009. It is being blamed upon unwinding a ministerial direction and told that this measure was supposed to be a permanent subsidy to large energy users. That was the language in the Cabinet memo that was sent to the CRU. Does the Minister of State support the fact that domestic households have subsidised large energy users - profitable companies - by upwards of €800 million over the past 12 years? Does he support the measure being unwound? Should it be more than the error being corrected and money going back into people's pockets? People are getting excited about it being the whole amount they have been paying to these large energy users. It is not. It is only a small amount in the context of the error that was identified when the measure was being unwound. Does the Minister of State support the fact that domestic households were subsidising large energy users?

The Senator has been around politics in this House and beyond far too long not to know this is an extremely complex matter that involves a number of strategies. It is important to put to the House the fact that the Department has a keen interest in energy prices, not only for businesses and the implications for their competitiveness but also for individual users. The Department engages with the CRU frequently. The CRU has not indicated that the original proposals related specifically to extra large energy users, following input from stakeholders, although the system operators will continue to engage these and other industrial users to develop suitable energy demands seeing as that promotes security of supply. I stand over the submission that was made by the previous Minister. It was right. However, it is important to note that the submission was not just on one individual point. The work of the CRU should continue in that independent manner, and the Department will continue to engage it. I would be more than happy to speak with the Senator in more detail in order to work through this mater as we go along.

I would love to have seen the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, here but I imagine that he has other things going on. I hope the Commencement matter falls on his ears. One could go on forever about the health issues throughout Ireland, especially the University Hospital Limerick, UHL, fiasco closer to home. Prevention is better than cure. If one can stop someone falling into a river, it saves one having to pull that person out of the river at the other end. To that end, this matter relates to Sláintecare and the plan to have primary healthcare centres built around towns and villages in order that people can go there in the first instance, instead of having to go straight to an accident and emergency department, because they cannot find a doctor or GP, or a health centre, that will take care of them. The Minister has committed to me that he will increase the hours of the injury clinic in Ennis. That will be massive because the more services we provide outside of UHL, the more the pressure is taken off while we are waiting for one set of 96 beds to be built and then another set of 96 beds.However, we know many people are going to UHL because they have nowhere else to go beforehand. To keep it to the point, will the Minister of State give me an update on the Sláintecare plan to build a primary care centre for the north Clare area in particular? Of course, everybody everywhere wants to know about this sort of thing but there is a major problem in the area and the local doctors are at crisis point. I have had meetings with them regarding capacity, and if a new primary care centre were built, it would enable them to expand their services. This is unique because most places do not have enough GPs. We actually have enough GPs. We just do not have the physical building space. It is not a staffing issue. It is an issue of a lack of space and of rooms for the doctors and their staff. Will the Minister of State give us a clear timeline, please? We are lucky in north Clare, and it is such an amazing place. Many people are happy to live there, including very good GPs, and they have come together to try to get this sorted. They do not care if they have to build it themselves or if one is going to be built. However, they need to know what is happening because in the meantime they are at maximum capacity. As a result people are suffering, they do not have access and they go to UHL, which is where we do not want them to go.

He welcomes the opportunity to provide an update to the House on the development of primary care centres. A central objective of the programme for Government is to deliver increased levels of integrated healthcare, with service delivery reoriented towards general practice, primary care and community-based services to enable a home first approach. Primary care centres play an essential in the delivery of that objective, and significant progress has been made on the delivery of these centre nationwide, with 165 opened to date and a further 14 currently under construction. In Mid West Community Healthcare, which covers counties Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, 13 primary care centres are in operation. In County Clare specifically, there has been the recent addition of a new primary care centre on Station Road in Ennis. This centre became operational in quarter 4 of 2022. Furthermore, an additional two primary care centres are under construction in Mid West Community Healthcare. One, in Newcastle West, County Limerick, is due to become operational later this year, and one in Roscrea, County Tipperary, is due in early 2024. Primary care centres provide a range of primary care and community services throughout the mid-west, ranging from GP services to nursing, social work, allied health and disability services, dental, chiropody, ophthalmic, older person services, child health, and addiction counselling and treatment. A number of additional primary care centres to be located in County Clare are at earlier stages of the planning and development process. The Department has been informed by the HSE that the planning process for a new primary care centre at Tulla Road, Ennis, is ongoing and it is hoped this will be concluded in the near future. Once the planning process has been concluded, the new primary care centre can progress through the next stages of development. It will then be possible to provide more detailed timelines for the delivery of that centre. In addition, a primary care centre in Ennistymon, County Clare, is at the early planning stages. The HSE has informed the Department that a number of submissions have been received for accommodation in Ennistymon via the operational lease model. Subject to securing HSE board approval in March 2023, an agreement for lease will be entered into. The selected developer will then progress to planning stages, and subject to a successful planning application with Clare County Council, the HSE estimates a development programme of works for the delivery of the proposed primary care centre of approximately 18 to 24 months thereafter. Both of these primary care centres will be a welcome addition to the people and healthcare workers of County Clare, and I assure the Senator that this Government remains committed to the provision of primary care centres in Country Clare, Mid West Community Healthcare, and throughout the country.

It is great that they have opened 165 primary care centres to date. That is brilliant. I am glad we have some timeline on Ennistymon because I know from Clare County Council that it has not received planning permission. However, the lease agreement is the first thing. I hope we can expedite it. If we are talking 18 to 24 months after the lease agreement and after the planning has been approved, we are talking about another four or five years, which does not take the pressure off of UHL today or tomorrow. However, it is definitely good to have some timeline on it and I will do my best to work with the council and whoever gets the contract to get it built as soon as possible.

Primary care centres provide important primary care infrastructure. They can also support the delivery of integrated care by facilitating closer co-ordination and cooperation between health professionals from across different disciplines. They also provide a single point of access to services for the individual and can serve as a resource for the community more broadly by creating a focal point for health initiatives or providing community groups with a place to meet. It is for this reason the development of primary care centres is an important part of Sláintecare, and as part of continued Government investment in the development of primary care, there are now 165 primary care centres, as I mentioned earlier. Among these is the recently opened primary care centre in Ennis, and while further planned primary care centres for County Clare are at earlier stages of planning and development, no timeline for the opening of these can be provided at present. The Department and the HSE remain committed to the delivery of a strong primary care infrastructure in County Clare.

I believe this day is going to become a very important one on the calendar and, it is fair to say, that St. Patrick will not have it his own way from here on in, and will have a little competition. I support the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader. I refer to a big ongoing debate on home vacancies throughout Ireland. This is particularly bad in the west of Ireland when one looks at places like Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo, where this is at levels of 10%, 11% and 12%, as the Leader knows.  I have always stated regarding home vacancies that there were always issues which will not be easily solved. I never believed the figure up there in red lights and that there were all these vacant homes. There are still, nonetheless, a substantial amount of houses there. That is why I welcome the recent initiative by the Government of €150 million for local authorities to get working on this, once and for all. The money is there now. It will not happen overnight but I hope that all local authorities over the coming months will get their act together on this issue and, where possible, that houses which can be reconstructed and brought into the housing market are put there. The Government is trying to do everything it can in respect of housing, which I accept. The money and the commitment are there, together with the Minister and his junior Ministers who are committed. It is not an easy task at the moment.  When one looks at other countries, such as England, for example, it is having very significant problems with housing at the moment also, as is the case with some other European countries. We were talking to a Turkish delegation here yesterday and discussed their housing policy. It is remarkably simple and Turkey does not have a housing problem. We will talk about that another day. I welcome the Government initiative and it is a good one. It will bring a certain amount of houses back into use and that is what we all need. There are indications also that the present Government policy on housing is beginning to work. Some material was brought out yesterday showing that we have a very significant amount of first-time buyers coming into the market. New builds are way up and the Government has reached and overshot its targets in respect of the number of houses, overall, that have been built. However, that needs to increase more, which I accept. We need more houses but we will get it right. I want to return to an issue I have spoken about here in the past week with regard to respect for front-line workers and, in particular, An Garda Síochána. I briefly mentioned that there have been a number of vicious attacks on members of An Garda Síochána but I mentioned in passing that day also the effect this has on the families of members of the force, male and female. These types of incidents, where their children are at an age where they know what is going on, have an appalling effect on their mental health. There are situations where gardaí have been followed home from work by alleged criminals who say that they know where these Garda members are and where their children are. Every one of us needs to stand and support all front-line workers but, in particular, An Garda Síochána, who are the people we all call for when we are in bother and when we need them. I know that they cannot be there for everything and do everything but, in general, they do a good job. People say that there is a bad apple here and a bad one there. Yes, there is but, in general, we have a good Garda force, we need to support them, and the money is there for more recruits. Let us get it done but let us get everybody supporting all front-line workers and not accept any sort of abuse, which is just not on.

I want to wish everyone a happy St. Brigid's Day and to thank Senator O'Loughlin in Kildare for organising that event to make St. Brigid's crosses. It is a nice idea which I welcome. I am conscious today, speaking to both the Leader and the Cathaoirleach, that the three Ministers, Deputy McConalogue and his two Ministers of State, are currently in Portlaoise where the Minister is already giving an outline to a conference called National Dialogue on Women in Agriculture. This is very important and was headlined and discussed in agriland.ie, the Irish Farmers' Journal and a few other publications. It is also mentioned today on the radio. What was interesting was that the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, said that he is very concerned at the lack of women coming through semi-State companies. Perhaps it is not a question of coming forward but of not getting that opportunity of having those appointments confirmed. He was anxious, was going to be very proactive in this area, and was going to insist that he would not ratify appointments of board members if there was not a good, logical reason there was not an equal number or why many of these women were not coming through, particularly in the area of the agri-enterprises and agrifood sector.We know women play a huge and significant part in all forms of agriculture. I commend the Minister on all of that. However, I thought it was worth noting that there is only one woman from any of the political parties on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member, and that is Senator Lynn Boylan on my left here, who is an exceptionally good member. There is a challenge and an opportunity there and I mean that genuinely. There is a real opportunity for the parties to go back and look at why no woman has come forward or been allowed come forward. I do not suggest they are being stopped but it is a question. Committee members do not have to stay for five years: the committee stays. Maybe we have to look at that. Why have the other parties not had any women coming forward on the agricultural panel? They are elected on the panel but somehow they are not making onto the committee. I put that as a challenge.  Finally, I seek a debate on town, village and urban renewal. There was much talk in recent days about it and I had a Commencement matter debate on the topic yesterday. I will finish on this point. I raised with the Minister that €1.5 billion was announced for regeneration and we now know we have had the first and second calls. Yesterday we were talking about the third call and there will be a fourth. Out of all of that, in a circular to all the sitting county managers, which some chief executives forwarded to me, was a confirmation that only €144 million has been spent so far. It could be said projects have been worked up but I seek a debate. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage drew up a report on urban regeneration that had 39 recommendations and which requested that this matter would come to both Houses for a debate. It is time we had a debate. I have already sent a circular to the Cathaoirleach's office on that report that we might discuss at some time in the next few months, as was requested by the committee.

It is very welcome that we are now going to celebrate St. Brigid who was a powerful feminist who challenged the status quo, respected the environment and wildlife, established leading community movements and, I believe, inspired Grace O'Malley, Maud Gonne, Brigitte Bardot and suffrages all over the world. It is welcome that we recognise her today with a bank holiday. I also raise something most Senators would not have failed to notice, which is that households will now be getting €50 back in their electricity bill thanks to the work I have been doing in my office with Brian Marron in trying to chase up how it came about that households were subsidising large energy users - very profitable companies - and were doing so for 12 years. Through the freedom of information, FOI, documents we received, it was clear the recession was used as the excuse. It was going to save jobs in these large industries. At a time when households were on their knees and people were in mortgage arrears, their electricity bills were going to increase to subsidise these large energy users. It was clear in the Cabinet memorandum that this was something for which the industry had been lobbying for a long time. It was not due to the recession. It was a lobby request of large energy users of profitable companies and the Government at the time capitulated and instructed the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to introduce that subsidy. The question is, why was it allowed to continue for 12 years, long after the financial crash was gone. At a time where we have had a cost-of-living crisis for two years, it was allowed to continue. It is news to everybody because it is not very clear on one's bill that we were subsidising those profitable companies. Now we are going to get €50 back which is very welcome and is money back in people's pockets. Nobody is denying that but that is only the error in the calculation of that subsidy; it is not the entirety of the subsidy at all because that figure would be up in the hundreds of euro for households if we were to return what we have been taking from them to subsidise these large energy companies. We need to hear from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this issue. In the first instance, this is because he said in the Dáil that he had instructed CRU to unwind this subsidy when in fact, the CRU carried out that analysis and informed the Government it was going to do it. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment complained about how it was going against a ministerial direction by unwinding it. Consequently, we need to get to the truth here. Did the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, instruct the CRU to unwind the subsidy or, as the CRU has said, did it decide to unwind it only for the Department of the then Minister, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, to complain about the unwinding?

I am aware the Leader is doing work on that to perhaps tighten up the timescales on it but unfortunately, even with the current timelines, the funding that has been set aside in the agreement put in place last year will not be in place for the February payment, for example. I point out for the record that I am a postmaster myself but I have spoken to a number of offices, not just in my own county but around it, and particularly in Dublin, which will be in a very tight situation again. Will the Leader speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, who is the line Minister of State within the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on this matter, and ask that An Post put that payment in place for the February payroll because the legislation will not be in place in time for it to be paid out? Particularly in the city areas, where high rents are increasing, many offices are going to find it extremely difficult. The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers may be able to intervene.

It is always great to have a bank holiday but particularly one in celebration of a woman. Whether you believe in St. Brigid or goddess Brigid or a combination of both, her history, lore and mythology are very important to many people. I wish to reflect on a matter that has been talked about in both Houses which is what is happening in many of our communities regarding refugees and migrants. Some really serious things are happening, ranging from people expressing disquiet, annoyance or concerns, all the way to, as was reported in The Irish Times, an attack on a migrant's camp in Ashtown where some really violent scenes were described. In my own area in Dublin North-West, there have been some really aggravated displays. I am going to call some of it organised thuggery quite frankly. People have come out with hammers and hurls and whatever else they are having themselves and it is quite simply organised thuggery. That is all happening in the milieu of a vacuum around this situation, whether that be from a Government or another level. I feel this is running away from us and the situation in some areas is already out of control. We in the Labour Party had a public meeting on Monday night in Drogheda which was invaded by people who wanted to protest against refugees and migrants. An Garda Síochána was there and it was quite a het up event. I am sure it is not going to be the first of this kind of event. We are in a situation where public representatives and local groups have concerns that they cannot organise because people are coming in to protest against refugees and migrants. There also has been a weaponising of events. We have seen a fairly lively smearing of a reporter and a photographer who reported the Ashtown incident; the online abuse of whom is absolutely vile and beneath contempt and I stand with the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, and its statement on that. I sometimes wonder is it because one of the journalists involved was the one who broke the story of Savita Halappanavar and there is still a harbouring of annoyance 11 years on at her for doing that. I digress but there is an enormous amount of misinformation happening online at the moment. People are believing some things that seem almost fantastical to others and yet they are being shared around and believed fully. My colleague, Senator Sherlock, has talked about the role of the social media giants and their responsibility. We have seen and heard the benefits they have sometimes in spreading these things online. A debate about this is not necessarily the right thing but it is important the Government gets a hold of this. There is a vacuum of information and a plethora of misinformation. If we do not get a grip on what is going on, I fear someone will end up losing their life.

I thank my female colleagues for taking on this campaign and being responsible for achieving a bank holiday that we will have from next Monday on. I raise the issues of the legacy Bill, the Bill of Rights and the protocol Bill currently before the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. The situation we face with the legacy Bill is an especially difficult one. The Cathaoirleach was with us when we discussed these issues in Strasbourg before Christmas. I was part of a deputation that met Lord Jonathan Caine before Christmas and I also met him when he was here last September. I know from the UK Government's approach to this how intent it is on passing the legacy Bill. I think of the impact it is going to have on thousands of families throughout this country, on the Good Friday Agreement and on us trying to move on and share this island. The UK Government has taken a reckless approach such that every political and human rights organisation in this country opposes what it is doing. It goes completely against a victim-centred approach and is wrong. I appeal to the UK Government to withdraw the Bill and restart with a victim-centred approach. I ask the Irish Government to be ready to take whatever actions, legal or otherwise, are necessary to undo this legislation. I have a final point to make on the protocol Bill. The Bill will not be passed or resolved until such time as the legacy issue is dealt with in the UK Parliament, and that means months down the road. That is the sad thing.

On the day we celebrate St. Brigid and Irish women in general, I draw the House's attention to the book just launched by Company Quartermaster Sergeant Karina Molloy, entitled A Woman in Defence. She was on "The Late Late Show" on Friday night and has been on all the major media platforms over recent days describing her time in the Defence Forces. The period spanned 30 years and 278 days. I was asked to review the book for The Irish Times and was struck by the systemic and systematic nature of the sexual harassment and sexual assault that was perpetrated on Karina Molloy and her female colleagues during her time in the Defence Forces. It was systemic and systematic in that there was an explicit architecture of standard operating procedures, Defence Forces regulations and memorandums that made, and still make, the Defence Forces an explicitly discriminatory organisation with very little by way of aspiration to equality and diversity. In the book, Karina Molloy says that in her 30 years and 278 days of service she could only find three years in which she was not the target of a sexual assault, including attempted rape. Think about that. I believe the report of the independent review group, the judge-led inquiry, into the toxic, misogynist culture of the Permanent Defence Force is being give to Cabinet today and will be passed on to the Attorney General. Publication is due in about three weeks' time. That is going to be a watershed moment for our armed forces because I believe it will show there has been no change and, in fact, that the culture has deteriorated in the 23 years since I set out the warning in my PhD. I know the Leader's commitment to our armed forces; we are fellow veterans. We need to have a major debate here. We need to have the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, Deputy Micheál Martin, in the Chamber after the report's publication to figure out what is happening. As Karina Molloy says, as it currently stands, the Defence Forces are a dangerous place for women. They are not fit to purport to serve the State if that is the case.

I raise the issue of 44,000 pensioners who are due back pay. Most worked as nurses or in social care. There are some doctors as well and many carers. An increment of €500-odd was to be paid on 1 October 2021 and again in 2022, and there is another increment to be paid in February. In most of these pensions I would say there is a minimum of €1,500-plus, which is quite a considerable amount of money. Many of them could be up to €2,000 coming into February. The excuse that seems to be being given is there is some glitch in the system or something to that effect. It was agreed nearly three years ago at this stage that it was to backdated. Some of the payments were started More than two years ago. The Leader might bring this up. This is a very urgent question and many people are depending on and looking for this money, especially because some of them are not on the largest of pensions. I would appreciate it if the Leader would bring this up with the relevant Minister to see where the glitch is. I assume it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGrath. We are being told there is some glitch with the payments or how they cash them or whatever else. It is there, it is agreed and nobody is disputing it but the people have not been paid. It is 3% backdated over recent years so it is well due at this stage.

Go raibh maith agat agus Lá Fhéile Bríde chomh maith. I reiterate the call I made last week for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, to come to the House for statements on the job losses we are seeing. Tech firms continue to make the headlines, with PayPal and HubSpot doing so this morning, but hospitality and retail are also suffering in the form of having to reduce jobs. The news yesterday from Tesco in the UK has also sent a chill down the spines of many people. A number of Members have spoken of the shocking atrocities and attacks in Palestine that have been taking place, though Operation Breakwater, for many years now. The past nine months especially has seen about 150 Palestinians and 30 Israelis dead. With the new Israeli Government we are going to see those records broken this year and Palestine itself in danger of hitting new lows in the brutalisation of its people. I ask that the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, would come to the Seanad because Ireland cannot continue its usual formula of words. I do not mean to be disparaging when I say that but something needs to change in the international response in the EU and at the UN Security Council. We need to hear from the Minister what Ireland's approach is going to be. There is the long-standing call that we recognise the state of Palestine, we had the Bill from this House on the purchase of goods from illegal settlements, and there is the failure by the State to recognise what is going on in Palestine, which is apartheid. I ask for the Minister, Deputy Martin, to come to the House.

The common application system was set up in Limerick 17 years ago when it happened that an awful lot of children did not receive school places. It has worked relatively well over the last 17 years but there is the odd year when a glitch happens. A lot of students apply for the same school and there is an over-subscription. I compliment the Department. Earlier in the week I think about 68 students were set to receive no school place. The Department has started to work through it. I acknowledge the communication from the office of the Minister, Deputy Foley, and from the Department this morning stating that they were aware of the situation. However, this issue needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. For those 24 students, it is not a very pleasant experience to receive no letter of offer. Tomorrow they are going to receive a letter telling them to contact the schools inspector in Tusla. Those children have done nothing. They see that their classmates have received letters of offer. This needs to be resolved as quickly as possible. I ask the Leader to support my call on the Minister and the Department to resolve it as soon as possible.

A related factor that has been unacceptable for years, which my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, has raised several times, is the tendency of some of the posher schools, frankly, to reject applications from people living on their doorsteps and to favour applications from people outside the city. The word I would use there is "class". There is a class distinction going on among some Limerick schools to reject local people from within the city. I call for urgent action on that issue. It is entirely unacceptable that children will not have a school place and will be told in writing that they have no school place on Thursday. The issue of nursing home charges has come to the fore in recent days. I am calling for a debate on elder care. I do not remember Fine Gael or its sister party, Fianna Fáil, ever standing up at election time and saying they want to privatise elder care. Over the last 30 years we have gone from 80% public care to 80% private care. Some 80% of nursing homes are operating on a for-profit basis. As a trade union official I can tell the House that those nursing homes refuse to accept trade union representation. They refuse to accept workers' rights. This is not a one-off issue but one that is prevalent throughout the private nursing home sector. I do not believe the Irish people have ever been consulted about this. We need to have a serious conversation about how we can plan for elder care in the future using decent, public nursing homes. That is the future that people deserve and it is worthy of a debate. It is high time we had that debate.

This has been raised many times and we all know the CE schemes are a vital part of the social fabric of rural Ireland in particular. They keep local development and local endeavour going, whether it is cleaning graveyards, maintaining local football pitches or, as in the case of Ballylongford in north Kerry, the local laundry service. The problem is that the model and set-up of CE schemes have not kept up with the times. Most voluntary committees now are facing skyrocketing charges for their insurance, energy costs and so on, yet the funding for CE schemes has remained static at €13.80 per participant, I think. That problem is compounded by the fact that participants are becoming increasingly difficult to source. Communities find they cannot get suitable applicants. Perhaps the entry requirements should be changed as well. There are many suitable people, like Ukrainians, who would be very interested in working on CE schemes but many of them are debarred under the set-up of the schemes. I hope the Leader will bring that to the attention of the Minister and maybe we will get a discussion on it here in due course. I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, on the statement he made yesterday in which he insisted that any group that puts forward nominees for State boards in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine will not be considered unless 40% of the nominees are female. That is a very important statement by him and one we all agree with. There is one flaw that I see, however. Applications for all State boards will not be accepted now from anybody over the age of 70. I know many people in the community who have great wisdom and experience and would be prepared to contribute on various State and semi-State bodies. Uachtarán na hÉireann can be over 70, as can a Member of the Seanad or the Dáil. I know one or two who are over 70.

I have great sympathy with Ciarán Mac Guill, scoláire agus fear Gaelach, writing from France in The Irish Times during the week. He writes that until now, St. Brigid's feast day has been an authentic, community celebration of the historical Brigid, a fifth century abbess who founded monasteries and contributed enormously to the growth of the early Irish church. He says that it is paradoxical that brave new secular and politically correct Ireland should indulge in the hijacking and cultural appropriation of a religious feast day. We all know what a great modern sin cultural appropriation is supposed to be. It does a disrespect to the historical St. Patrick to go on too much about myths and legends about driving the snakes out of Ireland. In the same way, looking at our proceedings here, some would say that some of them came back.

We should focus very much on the historical St. Brigid. At some point, I would like a debate on media coverage of migration issues. I wonder whether such coverage is making the tense situation in parts of our country better or worse. There are many unanswered questions, no matter how one looks at it, about the terrifying report in The Irish Times at the weekend alleging an attack involving a German Shepherd dog and people wearing balaclavas. It appears that while the newspaper reported that the journalist Kitty Holland had witnessed the attack, that was not the case. At this point, there is no footage available to substantiate the claim, either of what happened or the aftermath. There are no reported or identified attackers or victims. There is a claim by the newspaper that it is worried about defamation. Perhaps the Garda is looking into the matter. We have a right to expect high standards from our media regardless of who worried we are about racist attitudes. Many people have not been to the Bunny Carr school of communication, but it does not make them racist if they have concerns that they express badly. Whether it was inadvertence, a lapse in standards, ideology or a case of overegging or exaggerating a story, this needs to be looked at. Social media abuse of the journalist in question is absolutely abhorrent. However, there is another side to this. I hope The Irish Times will look into what happened and come out with an explanation in due course. There are questions about the report that we need to ask.

I do not know, perhaps I would. Who knows. I would have to be here for 42 years if that were to be the case. One of the first issues I raised when I became a Member of the House two years ago was the concept of flexible travel tickets and commuter tax saving tickets. We have had various discussions with the National Transport Authority, NTA, over the past year. The goal of introducing a commuter ticket has fallen down its list of priorities. The NTA previously stated that such a ticket would be introduced in the first quarter of 2022. It went from being so close to the finish line and being ready and implemented to being so far down the list of goals and objectives that it is no longer getting a fair hearing. One of the reasons for this, which I understand and accept, is that at the time the NTA was focused on introducing the 20% cut in fares across the board and introducing the 50% cut for people between the ages of 18 and 23. These have been achieved. They have all got across the line. I will not get the NTA to change its mind by getting up in the Seanad. What will change its mind is the Minister making a direct appeal. It is not up to the NTA to decide what is its priority. This is something that will benefit commuters throughout the country. It was so close to being introduced but, for some reason relating to technology, it has not been. I accept that if we are to have a commuter ticket, it would need to be accessible across all rail and buses. Obviously, this is different in certain sectors and whether someone on a public or private bus or at a particular rail station. The reason I am raising this is because we need the Minister to tell the NTA that we need it to revisit this and that we need to really consider it being introduced. This must come from the Minister and the Department directly. This is what I hope to see.

I will start with the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which provides qualifying businesses with supports of up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas up to €10,000 per month, or €30,000 in certain cases. This scheme has been in place since last September and is administered by Revenue. Figures I came across recently have been surprising in the context of the low uptake. While 15,275 businesses have registered for the scheme, only 9,148 have to date begun to claim what they are entitled to. So far, €17.4 million has been claimed but €13.24 million is yet to be paid out. When we look at the number of claims it is clear that perhaps more needs to be done in creating more awareness among the business community of what reliefs are there. The Government recently introduced a scheme for those paying rent for private rental accommodation whereby they can claim a tax credit of €500. The parents of a student going to college can claim it for their son or daughter. It is a good scheme and I know the Leader has been trying to highlight it and get the message out. It speaks to a larger issue. Many credits available to businesses and individuals go unclaimed. Last year it was revealed that €620 million that individuals could have had in their pockets went unclaimed. At a time when people are struggling and families are finding it tight to make ends meet perhaps the onus is on the Government to create more awareness of the various schemes and reliefs available to individuals so that people will get what they are entitled to.

Sometimes we have an old perception that they just mind children for a couple of hours until the parents return. In fact, they are educators and they do phenomenal work. Many times when my child comes home I am amazed at what he has learned during the day. The Government has recognised this and the challenges for parents with regard to costs of childcare and supporting childcare providers. This is very welcome. I hope that in the next budget it will be done again. It has made a significant difference for families throughout the country. There is speculation that we will support child minders. This is very important. They do the same amount of work as childcare providers. We do not have enough childcare providers the country to cope with the demand for childcare. It is important to recognise the work that childminders do. They are registered legitimate businesses and they need to be recognised as such. One of the challenges for them is registering with Tusla because of the complications that come with it. For example, they could not take on a second person in their homes if they were registered with Tusla. Many of these childminders would not continue if they had to do this to be able to receive some form of support. I ask that the Department and the Minister look at it. Are they devising a scheme to support people who have childminders as opposed to childcare providers? This all come back to the fact that we do not have enough childcare providers. Many people have grandparents who step up to the mark because they cannot go anywhere else. They cannot get a childcare provider and they cannot get a child minder. We need to be able to recognise this because they play a key role. We could give them a top-up payment on their pension or a tax break of some kind. This would be important because they play a key role.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	53	I very much welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance on the extension of the temporary business energy support scheme. It has helped thousands of businesses in rural and urban parts of the country to deal with the exorbitant cost of energy. There is one flaw when it comes to businesses in rural areas that use gas and that are not on a mains or metered. Those on metered gas qualify for the TBESS. Those who do not have metered gas do not qualify. This is a clear example of discrimination between urban and rural. This was brought to my attention in recent days by a busy business in County Clare. It tried to apply for TBESS but was told it did not qualify because it was not a business with metered gas. This is an anomaly. I am sure it was an oversight but it is a discriminative situation. In comparison with urban areas, rural Ireland is being discriminated against in the context of TBESS. Imagine a situation where people who needed unemployment assistance could only get it if they lived in the city and those who lived in rural Ireland could not get it. This is the same thing. This is a system to support businesses to stay in business during the energy crisis.The scheme should be altered to include businesses that use gas tanks or bulk tanks to support the supply of energy to their businesses. It can be done and it can be verified. People can get their gas bills from last year and submit them to show the difference in the same way one can do with electricity bills. I appeal to the Leader to contact the Minister for Finance, to rectify this anomaly as soon as possible.

I hope they really have a good day. I hope that we learn something from all of this welcoming of St. Brigid and Lá Fhéile Bríd, and all of this. I do not think we have over the years. Anyway, now to get down to the serious issues. I have mentioned Jadotville in this House for the best part of eight years. We have a report that has, largely, been rejected by the families of those whose fathers and brothers were recommended for military honours. After the debate in the Seanad with the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, after the publication of Jadotville independent review group report, I was under the impression that no action would be taken. I was quite taken aback to find that a new Defence Forces regulation, DFR, has been written, and that this Defence Forces regulation provided for two things. It amended the requirement for a person to have actually witnessed what had taken place in order to make a recommendation for a military honour or a medal. It also lifted the time bar. The independent review group specifically deals with one person, the late Commandant Pat Quinlan, a man deserving of a military medal for gallantry. I believe that most of us agree with that. However, the last surviving commissioned officer, retired Captain Noel Carey, and two of the last surviving senior NCOs have now submitted to the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces 34 recommendations for medals. If one can waive the timeframe and waive the requirement to actually have witnessed the event, then surely the recommendations of those who actually saw what happened would carry a weight that should be respected. We are not saying, and never have said, that all 34 should get medals. We are saying that they should have been afforded a proper medals board. I am aware that the Leader herself wore the uniform and she will understand that we should respect military honours. A man from the Leader's own county, Billy Kedian who died in the Lebanon has never been properly honoured by the State, and there are several more. I am again starting the campaign to get the Chief of Staff to go back over the last 100 years to look at every action and see who is entitled to be recognised.

It is greatly needed. We know there are busy roads and there are no footpaths. One can live in the country and yet not get a chance to go out and have a walk safely on roads at all. It is great to see the projects, and particularly in my own hometown of Ballinasloe where we have had the completion of loop walks. This is a great way for people all over the town to do a 5 km loop, and especially around Beechlawn, which is getting the funding to finish. It has been difficult for county councils. I acknowledge the active travel teams. Costs have increased and the projects that would have looked to be completed a year or two ago now have costs that have increased. On the Roscommon side, more than €1 million is coming into the Ballaghaderreen town development. This also includes funding for schools. It is the safe routes to schools programme that was launched about two years ago and now we are seeing the next round of funding for schools to apply to the programme. More than €100,000 in funding is coming in for Summerhill in Athlone. There are other footpath projects coming into the county also, including Castlerea, Boyle, Ballinlough and Bealnamullia just outside Athlone. It is really wonderful to have the funding for safe routes to schools and for safe places for families to walk and to cycle. This is government funding that will make a real impact in rural areas. It will encourage people to get out for a sunny spring walk on St. Brigid's Day.

I extend a happy St. Brigid's Day to all Members. Pretty much every Member who spoke this morning acknowledged the day. This is the first year that we will have our new bank holiday, which is great. It is one of the positive things following the pandemic that we were able to do for our citizens, to get that extra day off for people. At the beginning of the Order of Business this morning, Senator Murphy spoke about home vacancies, which is a particular challenge in some counties. The Senator referred to Roscommon, Mayo, and other counties. It may be 10% or 12% in some areas, and we must try to address this. The Senator rightly acknowledged some of the really good schemes that have been announced by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, such as the Croí Cónaithe scheme to try to tackle vacancies. Money has also been announced very recently for the local authorities to apply to purchase by compulsory purchase order buildings in town centres to get them back into use for retail, for offices and, very importantly, for residential as well. There is a lot of work happening. The Senator is correct to point out that the Government's housing plan is starting to work. It is turning the tide and numbers are going in the right direction. Anyone who suggests that it can happen very quickly or overnight is not being true to the realities of the challenges that have had to be faced, and especially in the past number of years. Senators Boyhan and O'Sullivan commended the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, on his decision not to accept recommendations for applications for membership of State boards under his Department where there is not at least 40% female candidates. This is to try to redress the imbalance that is there. This is very good. Senator Boyhan also acknowledged that the Minister, and his two junior ministers, the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, are in Offaly today at a women in agriculture conference, which will also address the issue. I wish the Ministers well in that regard. Senator Boylan spoke on an issue to do with the CRU and the rebate or subsidy that is coming to households. I am not completely up to speed with all of the details raised by the Senator this morning but I acknowledge the work by the Senator and her office in bringing that issue to the fore. It is great to see that the refund is being processed. Senator Carrigy spoke this morning about the communications Bill, which I dealt with yesterday. We are working on that. There is a proposed schedule to have all Stages of the Bill completed by the end of February, and we will expedite that. We will look to get agreement from all groups. There will be a group leaders' meeting later today. We will look to accelerate the passage of that Bill so we can make the payroll for the postmasters for the month of March. I believe there is agreement across the House to do that, and it should not be a major difficulty. Senator Hoey spoke on migrants and refugees. The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, will be in the House on 15 February to discuss that issue. There will be an opportunity for Senators to raise their concerns during that debate. Senator Blaney spoke about the legacy Bill, the Bill of Rights and the protocol Bill currently making their way through the legislative process in the UK. On a number of occasions the Senator has outlined the severe negative impact the passing of that legislation would have on the families and on the Good Friday Agreement. Senator Clonan spoke about a new book by Karina Molloy, entitled A Woman in Defence, which looks at the culture and the challenges for women in our Defence Forces, which at this point are well articulated and well documented. We will request a debate with the Minister for Defence at the earliest opportunity. Senator Davitt spoke about the issue of the pension back payments due to some 44,000 pensioners. About €1,500, or possibly more, is due to each pensioner. The Senator has asked for some assistance in getting answers as to why there is a delay. I will get in touch with the relevant Department to try to get some answers for the Senator on that issue. As she did previously, Senator Sherlock spoke about the job losses being experienced in the tech sector currently. We will request a debate with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, around job losses in the tech sector in particular. I believe that PayPal has today announced some job losses. I believe there is a restructuring or resizing of the tech sector that had expanded very quickly during the pandemic and is now consolidating a little bit. I do not believe there is cause for huge concern and we will still find there will be great opportunities from the tech sector.We are, of course, home to many of the large tech companies. The Senator also requested a debate on Palestine with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Senators Maria Byrne and Gavan spoke about the shortage of school places for 24 students in Limerick. The Minister, Deputy Foley, will be in the Chamber on 15 February. The debate that had been requested was on teacher shortages, but we will request to expand that debate to include school places, which will be an opportunity to raise the Limerick issue directly with the Minister. I can only imagine it is a very difficult situation for those children to be in. It should not happen. There should be a school place for every child. I assume the Department will work tirelessly to resolve the issue as soon as possible for those kids. Senator O'Sullivan spoke about community employment, CE, schemes and their importance. He is right that they are part of the social fabric of rural Ireland and many jobs would not get done if we did not have CE schemes. There are particular challenges in getting people to go on schemes now. There are ,many other job opportunities and the scheme must compete with them. Anything we can do to remove barriers that prevent people joining the scheme would be very worthwhile. CE participants should be allowed to remain on if they so wish because we just cannot get replacements. We can debate the CE scheme as soon as possible. I take the point Senator O'Sullivan made about the age restriction whereby participation on State boards is capped at 70 years of age. I agree with him that people beyond the age of 70 have as much to offer if not more sometimes because of experience and life experience. Seventy years seems quite an arbitrary cut-off age, which is not a fair way to assess any person or human being. Senator Mullen spoke about today being St. Brigid's Day. He drew our attention to the historic St. Brigid as opposed to the one who has been discussed more recently sometimes. I take on board the point he raised. Senator Mullen raised a particular issue concerning media coverage of the migrant situation. He suggested that perhaps the coverage is not always to the standard that one would expect from some of our national media outlets. I also take on board his comment in that regard. Senator McGahon mentioned flexible travel tickets. I suggest that he raises this issue directly in a Commencement matter with the Minister, because he asked quite a specific question, to see where that is at and how we can progress the issue. I appreciate he raised the matter in the previous term. Senators Gallagher and Conway spoke about the fact that the temporary business energy support scheme has been extended. Senator Gallagher spoke about some businesses not being aware that they can apply because the uptake is not as high as it could be and there is still money to be drawn down. He made the same point about the rental credit whereby many people who could apply have not done so. He suggested that we spread the word and create more awareness of the schemes. Senator Ahearn spoke about childcare and the fact that childcare providers are educators. He raised a particular issue around childminders and the plan to regularise the area to some extent. It will probably take some time to do that because, for different reasons, people may not want to enter into a set system. However, a lot of work is done in the sector that is not part of the remit of the Department and is not recognised. Substantial reform is occurring in childcare and we have done a lot of work in reducing the cost for parents. People can see that in their childcare bills this year and it has been a huge help, but there is a long way to go on that yet. The Senator is right that it is important we recognise that, because the early years for a child are so formative and important, we must invest and regulate the sector properly. Senator Conway spoke about the temporary business energy support scheme. He raised a particular issue concerning non-metered gas and that businesses in this case were not permitted to apply. I suggest to the Senator that he tables a Commencement matter to the Minister for Finance on the topic because it is quite a specific question. If that does not yield results, I ask the Senator to come back to me and we will try to get further answers. Senator Craughwell raised an issue concerning Jadotville, as he has done previously. He also raised the issue of a request to the Chief of Staff to go back over the past 100 years to ascertain those who may be due recognition but who have not yet been recognised. Senator Dolan spoke about the active travel announcement that was made this morning, which was great to see. It is significant that many of those projects - I believe the Senator said half - are outside of the big urban areas and in rural areas. My county of Mayo received €4.5 million. That will be put to very good use on cycleways, walkways and encouraging people to get out of their cars. People will only get out of their cars if they have a safe way to travel to and from where they want to go and it is great to see that money being spent in that way. The bigger picture is that such a scheme helps emissions reductions, greener initiatives and cleaner environments. It was a good news story this morning and a good way to finish the Order of Business.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to the Chamber for this important debate on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. I know she has been working very hard on this issue and for those affected by it. We are working to have the best services available for all people on this island. Tackling challenges as they arise is very important.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	64	I am pleased to join Senators here in the Seanad to discuss the very important topic of child and adolescent mental health services. We had a debate in the Dáil for two hours yesterday and a further debate lasting three hours last Thursday to discuss the Mental Health Commission's report. I know the Seanad had invited me here prior to the publication of that report. I was happy to oblige. All of us in Government have listened most closely to the views and contributions expressed over recent days.I have welcomed the opportunity to address a number of issues raised by my Dáil colleagues over the past week. The Government recognises the challenges facing CAMHS and the value of the findings highlighted in the Mental Health Commission's interim report on CAMHS. It is important to point out that, this time 12 months ago, I stood before the Seanad to discuss the Maskey report. As a result of that report, I asked the Mental Health Commission to expand its report on CAMHS. I funded that work in order that it would be able to report fully on all 73 CAMHS teams. It was important that I be provided with this relevant information to help me make the best changes possible to ensure that our CAMHS teams were working well throughout the country. The findings of the interim report highlight areas where services can be improved to benefit CAMHS throughout the system. The Government remains fully committed to the delivery of a high-quality, safe and compassionate mental health service for all, which is reflected through the delivery of our programme for Government commitments on mental health. Therefore, I welcome this opportunity to highlight the services and supports available to young people experiencing mental health difficulties and their families. It is important to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Government as a whole and me that young people are aware of the services available to them, as well as the work that is ongoing to improve CAMHS. The Mental Health Commission's interim report is one of a number of reports and audits currently ongoing into CAMHS. They, the reports and audits arising from the Maskey report and the final report of the commission will serve to provide important information on how mental health services can be improved. They will also provide an opportunity to highlight good practice throughout the system and to share best practice. Nonetheless, and as the Minister and I indicated last Thursday and again last night in the Dáil, the interim report's findings identify several issues that are not acceptable to anyone. The Minister and I supported the commission in carrying out its annual thematic report into CAMHS. We await the final report on all nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and welcome the role the commission plays in ensuring high standards of service provision in our mental health services. All areas of concern identified by the commission in carrying out its interim report were escalated at once to the HSE for immediate action and resolution, including the review of open patient cases that the HSE is undertaking. This will initially consist of a review of all open cases where the patients have been prescribed medication by their CAMHS consultants or doctors and who have not been seen in the past six months by their CAMHS teams. In addition, the Department of Health will work with the HSE to develop immediately a model of care for prescribing practices in CAMHS. This review of open cases will provide an assurance that these children and young people are receiving appropriate care that reflects their current and future needs. It will include a focus on physical health monitoring of those on medication. Regarding the interim report's recommendation on regulating CAMHS, the need to regulate CAMHS has been built into the provisions of the upcoming revised mental health Bill. We all empathise with young people and their families who may be worried about receiving the care they deserve. Much good work is being done by our CAMHS professionals across the country, and it is appropriate to recognise their strong commitment to vulnerable young people and their families. Recognising the challenges and concerns in this regard, it is important to note that the majority of young people who experience mental health difficulties have access to a variety of services and supports. Of those who seek care from CAMHS teams, the vast majority experience positive outcomes in terms of care and recovery. This is important work, as recovery is always possible. Annually, CAMHS teams receive and triage nearly 21,000 referrals and deliver 225,000 appointments for children and young people requiring assessment and intervention. Between 2020 and 2021, CAMHS experienced a 33% increase in demand and saw 21% more cases with the same staffing levels. Currently, there are 80 consultant psychiatrists in post working across 73 teams. The HSE is continuously working to ensure that all funded positions are filled and staff are available to provide this important service. Recruitment began this week for a new post of youth mental health lead at assistant national director level in the HSE. As opposed to just one post, four and a half whole-time equivalent posts will be associated with this. A further new post of national clinical lead for child and youth mental health has also been announced. Recruitment for it will start quickly. We had an intense and passionate debate in the Dáil last Thursday and last night, with positive contributions overall from all sides of the House. We must always bear in mind that, while any deficiency in CAMHS needs to be acknowledged and addressed insofar as possible, we must also be conscious of the sensitivities and needs of those using CAMHS. The Government is accepting of constructive criticism, but we must all offer reassurance to the public and instil confidence in the strong and important health services that are operating every day. As we debate the report of the Mental Health Commission and other issues relating to CAMHS, I am conscious that there are children sitting in waiting rooms the length and breadth of the country and there are 73 fantastic CAMHS teams working. The children's parents are also supporting them. We must be conscious of these factors. It is important for me as Minister of State to be able to build confidence in the CAMHS structure. A balanced and evidence-based approach, including listening to the lived experiences of service users, is always the best way to analyse concerns collectively and find the solutions we all seek. Real change in mental health services has been under way in recent years and will continue through implementation of the widely agreed Sharing the Vision policy. There is a record €1.2 billion allocation in 2023, representing a significantly increased investment by the Government of €220 million since June 2020. Importantly, dedicated funding for CAMHS is administered as part of the overall HSE mental health allocation every year. In addition, funding has been provided for two new CAMHS telehubs and there is a dedicated €6 million to expand the capacity of community mental health teams nationally, with a particular emphasis on CAMHS. For those who need access to the specialist supports and services that CAMHS provides, it is acknowledged that children and their families can experience varying waiting times. Some 93% of urgent referrals to CAMHS are responded to within three days. Steps are also being taken to reduce waiting times actively. In collaboration with local CAMHS, a waiting list initiative is under way in six CHO areas, specifically targeting areas where children and young people have waited for longer than nine months. Focusing on the specific issues impacting each area, one-off funding of more than €1 million was allocated in May for CHOs 1, 2 and 7 and €1.23 million was allocated in June for phase 2 in CHOs 6, 8 and 9. Targeted activity is also being used to reduce waiting lists for primary care services. Up to the end of 2022, waiting list initiatives in primary care psychology services have resulted in a reduction of more than 3,500 young people on these waiting lists. These important and welcome initiatives ensure that young people access care supports as early as possible. For every one child leaving the list, though, two more are presenting. The number of presentations we are seeing makes for a difficult situation. The continued reduction in the number of children admitted to adult units is a priority for the Government. In 2022, 20 young people of 16 and 17 years of age were admitted to adult facilities. The majority of them stayed for less than five days. Such admissions took place for a variety of reasons, including clinical decision-making and geographical considerations. On foot of recommendation No. 36 in Sharing the Vision, a youth mental health transition specialist group has been established by the HSE and is focusing on a more seamless transition for young people and integrated care pathways. Work by the Department of Health and the HSE to respond to the recommendations of the Maskey report is ongoing. The new mental health Bill has been selected for priority drafting for the spring season and work is continuing on introducing it in the Oireachtas as early as possible this year. I look forward to taking the Bill in the Seanad soon. I hope for Senators' support for this large piece of work. I wish to take this opportunity to mention the Mental Health Commission's important and independent role in supporting and assisting us in developing and improving mental health services.

Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuil an deis againn inniu an tseirbhís ríthábhachtach meabhairshláinte CAMHS a phlé léi. Tá go leor plé déanta againn, mar a luaigh sí, de bharr fhoilsiú thuarascáil Maskey le déanaí agus leathnú an athbhreithnithe. D’iarr an tAire Stáit an t-athbhreithniú sin a leathnú. Níl againn ach tuarascáil eatramhach faoi láthair ach is léir go bhfuil fadhbanna in áiteanna áirithe fós. Cé go bhfuil a fhios againn go léir na fadhbanna a luadh i dtuarascáil Maskey agus sa tuarascáil eile, is fiú iad a lua arís. Ina measc bhí diagnóis neamhiontaofa, oideas míchuí, drochmhonatóireacht ar chóireáil agus go leor leanaí i mbaol dochair shuntasaigh. Tá sé dochreidte i ndáiríre. Bhí ionadh agus uafás ar go leor daoine óga agus a dtuismitheoirí faoin tuarascáil sin. Tá siad ag brath ar CAMHS ag am an-deacair ina saol. Níl sé maith go leor nach gcuirtear cúram den scoth ar fáil dár ndaoine óga ar fud na tíre. Bíonn an-eagla ar thuismitheoirí go minic nuair a bhíonn deacrachtaí meabhairshláinte ag a bpáistí. Uaireanta ní bhíonn a fhios acu cá bhfaighidh siad an chabhair agus an tacaíocht. Tá sé an-tábhachtach gur féidir leo an tacaíocht sin a fháil ó CAMHS go tráthúil agus gur féidir leo muinín a bheith acu as an tseirbhís. Is léir ón tuarascáil níos leithne go raibh eispéireas an-dearfach ag go leor páistí agus a dtuismitheoirí. Is léir freisin go bhfuil na gairmithe sláinte atá ag obair sa tseirbhís tiomanta dá n-othar agus go bhfuil siad ag obair go dian gach uile lá ar son na bpáistí agus ar son na dtuismitheoirí freisin. Úsáideann breis agus 20,000 duine óg CAMHS in aghaidh na bliana agus bíonn eispéireas dearfach ag formhór dóibh. Tá sé suntasach gur tháinig méadú 33% ar atreoruithe, rud a rinne an tAire Stáit tagairt do, agus tháinig méadú 20% sna cásanna lenar déileáil CAMHS ag an leibhéal céanna foirne. Tharla sé sin in 2020, nuair a bhí an-chuid brú ar an gcóras sláinte. Tá sé suntasach agus is fiú é a lua arís. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an tAire Stáit tiomanta d'fheabhsú seirbhísí mheabhairshláinte sa tír seo, go háirithe CAMHS. Tuigim go dteastaíonn an tuarascáil dheireadh uainn, atá le teacht i mBealtaine, chomh maith leis na trí iniúchadh eile, chun pictiúr iomlán a bheith againn. Is féidir dul i ngleic leis na fadhbanna i ndiaidh dúinn an pictiúr iomlán a bheith faighte againn. Tá na páistí ag iarraidh an tacaíocht atá de dhíth a fháil anois. Tá súil agam leis an tacaíocht sin go mbeidh siad in ann ag bogadh ar aghaidh lena saol. Tá sé deacair orthu ach tá súil agam go mbeidh siad in ann é sin a dhéanamh leis an tacaíocht chuí. Is gá caighdeánú, atreorú agus cúram CAMHS a chur ar fáil ar fud na tíre. Go n-éirí an t-ádh leis an Aire Stáit leis an obair sin. Tá sí de dhíth.

I do not think a month goes by without this issue being raised in this Chamber, and I support that. It is certainly an issue of national importance and deserving of our attention but our proclamations or statements are worth nothing if they do not lead to action that will make a difference for people on the ground. I tend to see very little evidence that disproves the impression that many people have of the HSE, that it is an unchangeable monolith, bloated by middle management and mired in bureaucracy. Last week, Professor Martin Curley, the appointed head of digital transformation in the HSE, said that the executive had no vision for the digitalisation of the health service and efforts to change this are being impeded by bad actors. It is a perfect snapshot of the system. Efforts to grow, change for the better or, God forbid, revolutionise some aspect of the service are not met with an understanding of the need for assistance in realising change but are disrupted and blocked at every turn by senior administrators who watch Ministers come and go and who, every four years, get a new programme for Government to use as a doorstop. We are pouring more and more money in and the results are getting worse, according to Professor Curley. We are spending the equivalent of what and or Austria are spending but our performance is far poorer. We are a world-class spender on healthcare for what is certainly not a world-class service. This is not due to the people on the ground, our nurses, doctors and healthcare assistants who are giving everything they have and are being stretched to breaking point every day. It is due to fundamental flaws at operational level and to middle to high-ranking pencil pushers for whom the only change that matters is to their salary or pension. This is the backdrop against which our statements on the provision of child and adolescent mental health services in this State are being made. It is also the answer to so many of the questions heard previously and being posed again today. Why has X not happened? Why has Y not been progressed? Why are families still having to deal with Z? It is because the health system does not work and no Minister seems to have the power to change that. Last week we saw the publication of the interim report arising from the independent review of CAMHS. It found that across the country, children and young people accessing mental health services were open cases and had been lost to follow-up care. In many cases, children were reaching their 18th birthday with no planning, discharge or transition to adult services or any advice about medication. Others were without any appointment for two years or failed to receive any appointments for a review of prescriptions or monitoring of medication. Evidence was found that some teams were not monitoring anti-psychotic medication in accordance with international standards. Children were taking medication without appropriate blood tests and physical monitoring. The report also identifies significant staff deficits across many HSE teams and CHOs. Team members were working beyond their contracted hours, often without compensation, in order to continue to provide a service. There was evidence of stress and burnout in a significant number of team members. We were not even supposed to see this report. The inspector, Dr. Susan Finnerty, had planned to wait until the full report was completed later this year but decided to publish the interim report due to the serious concerns and consequent risks for some patients that were found. These were not few and far between, cherry-picked examples. Four out of the five CHOs that have been examined so far require urgent and targeted action in order to address the ongoing risks relating to them. The report also found long waiting lists, wide variations in acceptance rates, unacceptable variations in care, and a lack of capacity to provide appropriate therapeutic interventions. It found absent or poor care planning, a lack of CAMHS emergency and out-of-hours services, staff shortages, a lack of clinical governance and a lack of joint working with other agencies. The report also references a lack of child-centred care and administrative support, as well as a lack of ICT systems. The good news is that on foot of the interim report, the CEO of the HSE has committed to conducting a review of all open cases in all CAMHS teams, with a particular focus on identifying and accessing open cases of children who have been lost to follow-up and physical health monitoring of their medications. We have had our statements. Knowing what needs to be done has never really been the problem. The problem lies in the doing. If it does not get done and if these problems remain unaddressed, the consequence will not be that we report a quarterly loss or that a party takes a hit in the next opinion poll. It will be more dead children and teenagers and many broken hearts and broken families. Preventing that might be worth rattling the HSE. One thing I find absolutely unforgivable relates to the recent tragedy in Creeslough.The Government pulled out counselling supports after one month and moved it online. That is unforgivable. It was the biggest national tragedy in ten years but those people are not being provided with ongoing counselling services.  The most vulnerable children in the country are those in care. When they leave child services, they get a few sessions every year on the adult services. That is not good enough. They need more. They might get ten sessions if they are lucky but some children need ongoing therapy, possibly for many years, right up to the age of 23. The Minister of State needs to consider that. Those children when they leave child services are not getting enough counselling support through adult services.

The Minister of State's personal response on this issue and her work in this area have been extraordinary. I am very grateful to her and am a great admirer of her commitment and the compassion she shows in every interview to which I have listened, as well as in how she responded in the Dáil. An important point to pull out of her speech is that the teams have triaged 21,000 referrals and 225,000 appointments have been delivered. Every one of those appointments is delivered by people who are incredibly committed and compassionate and absolute professionals in the delivery of services. It is important for parents to hear that because I know, as a parent, I panicked when I heard some of the recent revelations. It would be a frightening prospect for a Member of this House, let alone for those who do not have access to the sort of information we have, to consider what would happen if his or her child develops a psychosocial disability and requires a response to it, and where the State is going to be in that regard. In this context, it is important to remember that an awful lot of delivery happens exceptionally well all of the time. However, we cannot speak about this and not have a "but" somewhere. The briefing we got from Mental Health Reform, which I am sure the Minister of State also received, as well as hearing about in the Dáil last night and in the statements, highlighted the things that are needed. It highlighted the acute areas and gaps. An issue that also comes up in other disability services is the lack of memorandums of understanding with the private sector. Why do we not fill the gaps more intentionally and accept private assessments and services? At the height of Covid, we were able to do that with private hospitals. This is an ongoing; it is not new. Why can we not move to fill the gaps while we recruit? I accept the point made by the Minister of State in her remarks that there has been a 33% increase in demand and, in terms of cases, a 21% increase in a short period from 2020-21. In the context of Covid, that was probably understandable but perhaps it would have happened anyway because life is very different now, especially for young people. The pressures on them are completely different, so there is more potential for needing an assessment, whether it goes on to full service or not. Within the service, there is inconsistency in the threshold for acceptance. I was contacted by the mother of an 11-year-old child who has a diagnosis of autism and an intellectual disability. They tried to access CAMHS via the local team and put together an in-depth application setting out the reasons they needed to access the service and proving that all other avenues, such as the use of therapy and engagement with the team, had been exhausted. The child is self-harming, suffers from chronic anxiety and exhibits behaviours like bashing his head off the wall, table, or bannister or kneeing himself in the face but CAMHS twice came back to the family saying he did not meet the criteria for mental health assessment. The family had to threaten CAMHS with the possibility of family breakdown and a requirement to find him a residential or foster placement but CAMHS still would not agree to see him. It has provided for four engagement sessions with the team only but not with the child. What is the threshold? Is it clear? It is clear that it is not consistent across the country. That comes out through the report and some of the commentary we received on it. At what point does a child trigger the necessary criteria to assure the provision of services? It appears that whether a child is accepted depends on who is doing the assessment. The email to which I referred is one of several I received in respect of children exhibiting similar behaviours and families that are desperately seeking help. We need clarity on this. I appreciate that is not something that can be done through a statutory instrument or whatever as it needs the engagement of professionals in the area. A review is certainly required. We cannot have a two-tier system. We cannot have a system whereby parents detect a growing psychosocial issue with their child and then those who have the resources can go down a private route and get a response for the child, while those who do not have the resources experience fear in respect of whether their child is going to be treated. We need to address that. I appreciate all the work the Minister of State is doing and thank her for it.
#PaulGavan	unknown-#PaulGavan-party	unknown-#PaulGavan-dob	unknown-#PaulGavan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	71	The Minister of State is very welcome, as always. It is important that we are having this debate today. The report of the Mental Health Commission is another indictment of the state of medical services. It outlines familiar failings such as a lack of staffing and capacity. The author outlined five areas of particular concern, namely, shortage and high turnover of staff, a lack of capacity to provide needs-based therapeutic programmes, poor monitoring of medication, a lack of clinical governance and, finally, long waiting lists that are impacting the safety and well-being of children. The Minister of State will agree that mental health is as important as physical health and to see such concerns raised about the treatment of children and adolescents must be treated as a major concern by her and the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly. The fact that there are 140 lost children in one CAMHS team alone is abhorrent. As the Minister of State is aware, the area in question is the mid-west, the area from which I come, covering counties Limerick, Tipperary and Clare. Children on medication not having a follow-up for two years is entirely unacceptable. It is inexcusable that some children on antipsychotic medications were not monitored. Whichever way the Minister of State frames it, this report is damning in terms of service failures. Its author, Dr. Susan Finnerty, put it aptly when she stated that she "decided to issue an interim report because of the serious concerns and consequent risks for some patients that we have found across areas of 4 out of 5 Community Healthcare CAMHS". Four out of five areas. This is not just one problematic team; it is a problem that spreads across nearly every area. Later in the report, referring to a particular CAMHS area, she stated "it was unclear at what stage these children would be re-assessed". Maybe we should not be shocked. We already knew the Government had not provided enough resources to mental health and that, of that scant funding, only 10.8% of the mental health budget is assigned to CAMHS. It is clear this funding needs to be dramatically increased, as does spending on mental health more generally. CHO 3, which covers parts of the mid-west, including Limerick, has been under pressure for quite some time. That is evident from the percentage of referrals the team accepts. In 2019, of the 1,856 referrals it received, 75% were accepted. In the first half of 2022, only 65% of 849 referrals were accepted. The referrals that were accepted are then taking too long to be seen. I have been dealing with a family with a child born in 2016 who was referred to CAMHS.One year after their referral, they have no appointment and have been advised they will be waiting another year. A child who was referred at six years of age will be nine by the time he gets seen. There is too much lost time and too many lost children. There is a real lack of out-of-hours services and this is contributing to the overcrowding of our emergency departments. In November last year, 741 young people presented at emergency departments. In my county of Limerick I look forward to the long-awaited launch of the 24-7 mental health de-escalation unit. This will handle out-of-hours calls and triage and ensure that those with out-of-hours mental health concerns are directed to where they can receive the appropriate care. It is imperative that this team is staffed and resourced appropriately. If successful, this model must be rolled out throughout the State. I urge the Minister of State to act on the interim report and take immediate actions to address the litany of failings in our child and adolescent mental health services. As a priority she must review all open cases and ensure that the so-called lost cases are offered support and a necessary, albeit belated, follow up. The Minister of State should ring-fence the budget for CAMHS and work towards the recruitment and retention of professionals in the field. I will finish by making a few suggestions on what we believe should be done. Early intervention is key. All children and young people deserve the opportunity to reach their potential. Children and young people must have access to mental health services when and where they need them. Services should be extended to 25 years of age to prevent the cliff edge at 18. The majority of acute long-term mental health difficulties develop between the ages of 16 and 25. We are calling for multi-annual funding for CAMHS to be able to operate and forward plan to be able to staff teams properly. We are calling for integrated IT systems to improve quality of care. We want accountability in mental health services and so we are calling for a national clinical director for mental health, a role that was removed by the Minister, Deputy Harris, in 2016. I cannot stress enough the importance of accountability. It is at the heart of all the issues we are discussing today. Sinn Féin wants to empower CAMHS to be able to respond to issues raised in the Mental Health Commission's interim report. That report did not come as a shock to any family with experience of accessing CAMHS. They know only too well that the Government has been failing young people as waiting lists have dramatically increased under its watch. We must introduce national standards for monitoring antipsychotic medication. We must develop a joined-up and comprehensive health and social care workforce strategy to increase education places and training opportunities between the Department of Health, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the HSE, regional health areas, hospital groups and higher education institutions. We must increase undergraduate and postgraduate courses and training places for mental health professions based on evidence of required staffing levels and projected population needs to reduce reliance on overtime and international recruitment. Our mental health services are in crisis and we can do much better. We owe it to our children and young people who deserve hope, solutions and mental health services that are fit for purpose.

I have been contacted by people for whom CAMHS has let them down or has not been right. I have also been contacted by parents where it has worked for their child. The system can work for some people. Unfortunately, we are not here to talk about those people but we are here to talk about the people for whom the system has not worked and who have been let down by the system. I am sure in the trials and tribulations of our job, all of us were contacted about CAMHS before the publication of this report. I remember one case that really stood out and did not make sense to me. It was a trans adolescent who had an eating disorder. CAMHS in their area said it could not help. There were multiple issues. We tried to help and do what we could. The parents sometimes wondered if they had been living in a different area whether the CAMHS in that area would have been able to help. I occasionally think of that young person who would now be nearly in adulthood and how they got lost in the system because they were too complex for the system. We cannot let people fall through the cracks because something is deemed too complex. They were in deep distress and in deep need and were let down in that area. The Mental Health Commission's interim report into CAMHS is a damning indictment of the crisis in our mental health services. The report illustrated how disjointed and under-resourced CAMHS is and how a failure of clinical oversight is putting children's safety at risk. The report highlights the following: the dysfunctional system of long waiting lists; poor clinical governance; staffing problems; children who have got lost in the system; a lack of capacity to provide appropriate therapeutic interventions; and a lack of emergency CAMHS out-of-hours services. I will come back to the last piece in a minute. There was evidence of some teams not monitoring antipsychotic medication. Mental Health Reform was deeply alarmed that some CAMHS teams are neglecting to monitor children who are using antipsychotic medication, which is very worrying. I am sure it is very frightening for parents to hear that their child might not be monitored on something like this. They were taking medication without appropriate blood tests. Physical monitoring is essential when on this medication. These practices could have some serious repercussions for children's and adolescents' physical and mental health both immediately and in the future. In one particular CAMHS team there were 140 lost children. They were not literally lost but children who should have had follow-up appointments, including for review of prescriptions and monitoring of medication, but did not have an appointment. This happened as a result of paperwork or staff changeover. In addition, the Mental Health Commission stated it identified another team that had open cases of children where there was no documented review for up to 2 years. This risk had not been identified by this CAMHS service. Another team were attempting to identify an unknown number of cases that had been lost to follow-up following a change in staffing. Other teams had commenced a six-monthly review of their open cases following the Maskey Review. Last week two presentations on digital patient records were made to the Joint Committee on Health. It was very clear at that meeting that we are not where we need to be in the introduction of electronic digital patient records. It is not acceptable for records to be lost because of staff turnover. Obviously, we welcome the review of all open CAMHS cases, but further actions are required. The recruitment of a youth mental health assistant director was promised in the budget for 2023. As far as I am aware, recruitment has not yet begun on this.

I wrote this speech yesterday morning so I can just scribble that right out and skip to the next page. It has begun in a timely and efficient manner. There must be a reinstatement of the national director for mental health in the HSE who needs to report directly to the CEO of the HSE. The programme for Government contains a commitment to reinstate this position, but recruitment for this position is not where it needs to be. There has been no national director for mental health since 2016. I was president of USI in 2016, which feels like a lifetime ago. That is a long time for us not to have that national director. We need to reform the Mental Health Act 2001 to ensure children's rights are protected when they access mental health services. Current legislation is significantly out of line with international human rights standards. As a matter of urgency the mental health (amendment) Bill needs to be progressed this year. We cannot have a postcode lottery as to who gets services depending on where they live and the CAMHS service to which they are linked. That practice needs to end. I agree with a previous speaker that we need to extend the age. People going in aged 16 know they will not get seen before they are 18. Extending the age will prevent those young people falling between two stools. It is up to the Minister of State and her team along with the Minister for Health. We need to get things right for our children because if we cannot, what hope do we have?
#FrancesBlack	unknown-#FrancesBlack-party	unknown-#FrancesBlack-dob	unknown-#FrancesBlack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	75	The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is very welcome to the Chamber. I thank her for coming to the Seanad to update us on the issues in this important debate. I agree with colleagues who have said that when CAMHS works, it works really well.I thank her also for her commitment. Nevertheless, the recent report of the Mental Health Commission regarding the state of CAMHS is truly alarming and very upsetting. I am grateful to Dr. Susan Finnerty and everyone else at the commission who worked on the report and brought this to our attention. I welcome Mr. Stephen Sheil from Mental Health Reform to the Gallery. I spoke about this report in the Chamber last week, so I will try not to repeat myself. By now, we are familiar with the dire findings of the report and the hundreds of children lost in the system who went without follow-up, the children who were prescribed antipsychotic medication without proper medical monitoring, and the chaotic record-keeping and case management procedures that are exacerbating a crisis caused by persistent staffing shortages and chronic failures in governance. It paints an unbelievably grim picture. Imagine how you would feel if it were your child. It is devastating to think your child would not get the services he or she needs. This crisis is severely damaging to the welfare and safety of some of Ireland's most vulnerable children. It puts a great strain on families and caregivers. As colleagues said, 741 children with mental health difficulties ended up in emergency departments for days because they were experiencing an acute crisis. Let us think about that. That they could not find help elsewhere is devastating. It is also very stressful and demoralising for the healthcare workers, who have to spend their professional lives working within a dysfunctional system, dealing with people who are at their wits' end with the stress and worry. These workers are drained, not only by the inherently difficult and emotionally intense nature of their work but also because they have to apologise to young people and their families on behalf of a broken system they lack the power to change. My concern is that the dysfunction of CAMHS has become almost a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is impossible to recruit and retain the necessary staffing levels when frustrated and burnt-out workers keep leaving due to the problems created by the understaffing. CAMHS needs a significant overhaul, including ring-fenced funding, which other Senators raised, a minimum safe staffing level and enhanced accountability mechanisms. There needs to be an holistic approach to this issue, including more college places for CAMHS professionals and competitive salaries that reflect the difficulty of the work involved and the high cost of living in many parts of Ireland, particularly Dublin. The report notes the issues faced at the level of clinical leadership due to the shortage of consultant psychiatrists. The description of how scarce these professionals are throughout the CAMHS system is truly alarming and I hope it will serve as a wake-up call that the recruitment and retention of these consultants is vital. This shortage could, however, provide an opportunity to explore further a shared responsibility model of multidisciplinary team leadership, something the Minister of State is passionate about. This would be in line with the holistic person-centred model of care envisioned in the Sharing the Vision strategy. Ireland has just been reviewed in Geneva regarding its compliance with its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and this report indicates we have a long way to go towards vindicating the rights of children with mental health issues to get the highest quality healthcare. It is unfortunate there has been a lack of progress in this area. There were 32 admissions of children to adult mental health units in 2021, up from 27 in 2020, but when the UN committee asked the Government when the number of children admitted to adult mental health units would be reduced to zero, the response, unfortunately, was that Ireland may never reach that goal. This shows a distinct lack of ambition to adhere to international human rights standards, which is deeply troubling. I would love to hear more about the recruitment of a youth mental health assistant director being made a priority. That is very good news and I am happy to hear about it. The Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Mental Health, which I chair, recently conducted pre-legislative scrutiny on heads of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act, and this report underscores the vital need for the reform of that Act to proceed swiftly. It also highlights the need for provisions in the revised Mental Health Act to codify children's rights and ensure the provision of CAMHS will be shaped at every stage by the principles of care, dignity and security, which underpin children's rights under the convention. The subcommittee will have representatives from the HSE in within the next fortnight to discuss this report, and I look forward to hearing from them what actions they will take to rectify the issues raised in the report. This crisis in CAMHS demonstrates how much work needs to be done in the mental health sphere, and I appreciate the Minister of State knows that. For too long, it has not had parity with physical health and that disparity can be seen throughout the system. There are the beginnings of a societal and political understanding of the need for change, but we have a long way to go, and in the spirit of parity between physical and mental health, the Sub-Committee on Mental Health should be given the resources necessary to be an independent committee. I have spoken to the Minister of State about this previously and acknowledge she is supportive of it. I thank her for that and hope we can build on that support. A society's worth should be judged by its treatment of its most vulnerable members. If Ireland cannot provide a dignified standard of mental healthcare to our children who are suffering, it makes all the talk of economic growth, budget surpluses and the corporation tax take seem delusional and pointless. It needs to be made a priority because our children deserve so much more.

I welcome also the Minister of State. This is a difficult and challenging subject and she is dealing with decades of underfunding. Trying to scale up quickly is a big challenge. When the report was published last year regarding the situation in Kerry, we were all quite shocked and appalled. The correct decision was made at the time, following on from the report, to examine the situation in the other areas and groups and to provide that an interim report would have to be published after work was carried out by a number of those groups. It is disappointing to think the nuts and bolts within the services were so poor that they were really only cobbled together and that they are not something we can stand over as a modern, effective, compassionate, caring and supportive CAMHS. Nevertheless, we have to start somewhere, and the level of investment that has been put into the services is unprecedented. What was revealed in the most recent report, especially in the mid-west, where there was a description of 140 people as "lost children", was horrifically upsetting to hear, but the actions being taken to engage with the families of those 140 children are a step in the correct direction, even if it should truly never have happened. We need a system that is properly fool-proofed whereby that kind of thing will never happen again. Another issue of concern to me, and it is one that is happening and has happened, relates to the idea of engaging with people over Zoom or by other means online. A young person cannot be properly assessed online. There has to be face-to-face contact. I do not think anybody would have confidence that tele-supports such as that are appropriate. That is not how we want to do business and I would certainly not be happy to stand over it. I hope that will come to an end. We have seen the interim report, and I dread what is going to be in the final report. Whatever it is, we will have to take it, deal with it and build capacity. Clearly, the funding is there, but there is a serious problem with retaining professionals. I do not know how we should deal with the lack of availability of professionals, whereby positions that are being advertised are not even being applied for. Perhaps we need to reconsider the terms and conditions that are on offer, because if they are attractive enough, people will apply.I am sure that many of the professionals from this country who have moved abroad would, under the right circumstances, consider coming back to Ireland. We need to think outside the box. Where we need to have new remuneration for specific posts, it should be considered. It is frustrating that advertisements are published to hire the necessary professionals and very few people, if any, apply. One must ask what the problem is. In respect of what is available from universities and colleges, a job of work can be done with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to see can we come up with new programmes to encourage more young people to go into caring professions and qualify. That is a challenge across the healthcare sector but it is a particular challenge in this area. The Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health will be doing a deep dive into the issue. Perhaps the Minister of State will come before it to allow for a more intimate question-and-answer session over a period. I again commend the Minister of State on her genuine commitment to trying to improve the lives of young people in this country.
#LynnRuane	unknown-#LynnRuane-party	unknown-#LynnRuane-dob	unknown-#LynnRuane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	78	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is an important conversation but it feels like it is just a conversation. I do not feel urgency in the room. It all feels a bit nice. We are talking about the lives of people and children. I do not know if the Minister of State has experience of communities with a high concentration of young people with severe mental health issues who are trying to access CAMHS. In west Tallaght, in particular, it is extremely difficult. We spoke earlier about numbers and triage. In that triage space, people are being told that the service is not for them. Women in my community wince if they are referred to CAMHS. They think they cannot go near CAMHS because there is no point and no one will see them. That is the culture that exists now. CAMHS is not understood as a place where people feel they are going to get support and help. They do not even feel they will get through the door. When one gets past the triage space and into the service, it is great. However, the barrier that exists makes it too difficult for people who are trying to get through the door. There are girls in Tallaght, especially teenagers, who are self-harming to bits. Their bodies are in bits when they arrive at CAMHS. They are told they are not suicidal enough. If they are not experiencing suicidal ideation, they are told the service is not for them. There is something seriously wrong if that is the measurement of mental health. You should not have to be almost about to take your life before being allowed access to the service. That needs to be rapidly reconsidered. That lack of service will lead to suicidal ideation and these people will not be in a service that can deal with it when that happens. There is a also massive problem in respect of the transition to adult mental health services. Getting an assessment at an adult mental health service is extremely difficult unless a patient is presenting with psychosis or suicidal ideation. I agree what has been said by others about 18- to 25-year-olds. It would match with youth work strategies. We all acknowledge that young people are defined arbitrarily as being under 18. The transition piece is important. The target at the moment is six months but referrals cannot be given while a child is under 18. That means patients must wait until they turn 18 before a referral is made. They are dropping off the system as they try to access services. Many other Senators have spoken about medication. Children are being lost and it feels as if nobody is taking responsibility. It feels like it is considered a nice phrase that these children have been somehow lost in the system. They just got lost. It is the result of complete negligence. It is neglect on the part of a State service not to know who is on medication and who needs follow-up. Some children were given a prescription for two years without any review by anybody. Other places recommend that patients go into the likes of Linn Dara to be observed while they move onto some of these medications because they can be serious. Those medicines may have psychoactive properties and relate to psychosis, even if they are used for many other things. Some psychologists will only prescribe some medications if a patient enters Linn Dara for a period of time to monitor the effects. That is how serious a matter this is. The fact that many children were not monitored at home and did not have their prescriptions reviewed is neglect. There is also a postcode lottery. Only two out of five CAMHS are capable of dealing with eating disorders. Four of five can cater for intellectual disabilities. Only one can cater for ADHD. Considerable numbers of young people in the prison system with ADHD also have comorbid mental health issues because they did not receive care. The shortcomings in care spring over to the justice system, antisocial behaviour and everything else. People with ADHD need support at a younger age to allow for interventions. The numbers of people with ADHD who do not receive support and who then engage with the justice system is concerning. Integrated care and needs-based wraparound services do not exist. According to the interim CAMHS report, there is a blame game among service providers about which organisation should accept referrals to services for treatment. Families are bounced back and forth from CAMHS to other primary care and disability services. However, a child or young person cannot be on multiple waiting lists. They must cautiously seek help, knowing that an upcoming appointment with a primary care service could remove them from the CAMHS waiting list. That a child cannot be on two waiting lists at once makes me wonder at the logic of decisions being made around people's access to support. This report is savage. I have been working in the area of health equity in the community for years. In my lifetime, I cannot remember a time when we had a functioning CAMHS. I do not know when that existed. When we say CAMHS is in crisis, do we need to acknowledge that a functional and accessible service has never existed under our current model? The interim report reflected the concerns of the Mental Health Commission around the risk posed to children, risks which the HSE claims to have heard nothing about and has no record of, possibly due to a lack of infrastructure or IT services. The blame lies with the health services and the Departments. We need to stand over the report and aggressively address these issues because at the end of the day, children are dying. We may not have statistics for that now because deaths may not be associated with the fact that a young person did not receive an appointment. It is hard to do that. However, there are people who presented with self-harm or eating disorders for many years, did not get the support they needed and are now dead. We need to accept that is neglect on the behalf of the State.

I acknowledge the fact that the report would not be out there without the Minister of State asking for it. I acknowledge that and the work she has done. I know she has an interest in the area. My concerns regard CHO 3. The Minister of State would not expect anything else from me. The report on CHO 3 was the most damaging of the lot. Some 140 children were concerned. I hope they have all been contacted and I believe they have. A number of families contacted me about children who were 17 or 18 and still in school. We kept being told that those children were in the system and would be contacted. My understanding is those families were only contacted very recently. Two of those children are now over 18. That is frightening. Children have to be able to access services. I know that some children receive many follow-up calls and might be seen at a clinic. However, if they need to be admitted for one reason or another, they must access adult services because there is nowhere for children in the CHO 3 region.It was a shock for their families to receive the report and hear highlighted in the news the stories of people being oversubscribed with medication. I know from speaking to some of the families that they experienced this horrific set of circumstances. I acknowledge that so many who work in the services do a very good job and are very responsive. I apologise for not being here for the Minister of State’s opening statement; I was at a committee meeting. Perhaps she could highlight some of the responses to date and the current position. When will we expect to see the proposed resolutions to some of the issues highlighted, certainly by the families and especially regarding CHO 3? Some people I know would benefit from a telephone call or from seeing the doctor in person. How long are the waiting lists in CHO 3? Perhaps the Minister of State cannot answer that today but perhaps she can revert to me on it. Is there a plan to have a CAMHS unit in the mid-west that people can access? Some have to go to Cork and others to Dublin. I thank the Minister of State.

Along with Senator Black, I am on the sub-committee on mental health. It is important to be really clear about what CAMHS does. It was outlined in the report that the services provide assessments and treatment for young people up to 18 years of age. The report goes through the various conditions treated. Included are depression, problems with food and eating, self-harm, psychosis, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and anxiety. The report speaks to some of the agencies and groups that support CAMHS. It is quite difficult to read. I realise it has not covered all the CHO areas. It refers very much to children. One hundred and forty files have been lost in the system for two years. This is really hard to hear. It is very difficult to see what the children, their parents and families are going through but I appreciate that the Minister of State is obtaining the information to develop and implement a very rapid response. Five out of the nine CHOs have been reviewed. My area covers Galway, Roscommon and Mayo, which are in CHO 2. The team there has been in touch with us. Early last year, it gave us an update. I will be looking for another update now. Self-harm and eating disorders are such an issue, particularly for young people. When will the final report be issued? The report we have is an interim report. The Minister of State mentioned in her opening statement that over 80 psychiatrists are working in this area. I have a question on the recruitment and retention of psychiatrists dealing with the workload in question. What telehealth or e-health supports are being made available? This is a huge area. Even in respect of initial engagement, there should be so many opportunities in terms of telehealth. What innovations is the Minister of State considering? So much funding is put into e-health. What is happening is very frustrating for most of those who work in and use the service. I am sure the Minister of State has similar thoughts on that. Another role of mine involves the education committee. We brought out the report on mental health supports for children in schools and at third level, in tertiary education. There were a number of recommendations. One, which I called for last week with Deputy Dillon and through Fine Gael, concerned the Youth Mental Health Pathfinder project. The Minister of State spoke about this recently in the Dáil and said there are so many Departments involved. Which Department is taking the lead? Is the Minister of State taking the lead in driving projects like this? She mentioned she is working with several Departments on this. Who is taking the lead? Is any progress being made? It could really make a difference. Our schools and colleges are seeking to provide supports to young people. This report follows on from a report on bullying, including cyberbullying, produced by the education committee. Again, the findings on the impact of cyberbullying on young people were really shocking. It all leads to different types of mental health issues, including anxiety, stress, withdrawal and self-harm. It is amazing how all these are so tied together. The bullying report came out a year and half ago. With regard to supports available through the FUSE programme and engagement with schools, schools are crying out for counselling supports. Qualified counsellors themselves feel they are not qualified. An article in The Irish Times yesterday referred to the impact of bullying and described how to identify the symptoms. This does not relate solely to CAMHS, but the society and culture we live in have so many impacts on young people. If the Minister of State could comment on any of these points, I would really appreciate it. I thank her for her time.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	81	I thank everyone for being here for this debate. I appreciate the attendance of everyone who sat through the entire debate. I always look forward to coming into the Seanad to listen to the various contributions. I will try to answer as many of the questions asked as I can. It is important to note that significant investment has taken place in community organisations that provide vital early-intervention services for children. While €125 million was spent on CAMHS last year, an awful lot more money is provided from my budget. Jigsaw, for example, was funded with approximately €12 million in 2022. It provides essential early-intervention supports for children and young people aged between 12 and 25. It had more than 2,600 appointments last year and 85 mental health workshops. Along with funding Jigsaw, we also fund MyMind. A sum of €1 million was provided last year to continue to deliver free-of-charge counselling sessions to clients in over 14 different languages. It is important to recognise that there are many who do not speak Irish or English and that we ensure they are catered for. I thank Mental Health Reform for its continuing advocacy. I also fund that through my budget so it will be able to hold me to account and inform everyone of the challenges we have. There are many. There are a couple of points I want to make. Evidence shows that only 2% of children will need the support of CAMHS specialist services, with the majority of mental health supports for children and young people delivered through the communities. That is why I fund the communities through the budget. A further €1 million was provided through Mental Health Ireland for community and voluntary agencies last year. I had a meeting last week with the consultant psychiatrist to tease out an issue raised quite a lot, which I have asked about myself. I am referring to the level of referral across the various CHOs. The rate is as low as 38% in some areas and as high as 81% in others. I was informed that a decision is not made by just one person. When a child is referred – by a GP, for example – the multidisciplinary team considers all aspects of his or her referral. In many cases, the child will be assessed and the multidisciplinary team will determine whether he or she meets the criteria. Many parents contact me and believe their child should be in CAMHS but I say I am not a medical person and do not have a clinical background and therefore must put my faith in the fact that the consultant psychiatrist and multidisciplinary team, working with the psychologist, dietician, occupational therapist and mental health nurse, make the determination. However, I am concerned that the rate varies widely, from as low as 38% in some CHOs to as high as 81% in others. Five CHOs were examined: CHOs 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. It has to be recognised that there were no issues raised in one CHO. If that is the case, it shows it can be done. There was a lot of talk about CHO 3 in respect of 140 lost files to be followed up. CHO 3 informed the Mental Health Commission in March that it had 140 files that had not been followed up for quite a while.I am always open to correction on this but my understanding is that a medical consultant had left the practice and only three and a half posts had been in place. This figure has increased to seven. This is the reason. The team itself was proactive and informed the Mental Health Commission that 140 files had not been followed up. They have been followed up since. I know the staff were not place immediately to do this but it has happened since. It is positive that they have been followed up. Across the other three CHOs, a further 28 files were still open. At this stage, they have all been followed up on. I have requested, as has the Mental Health Commission, that all open files be examined. Last week I met Dr. Colm Henry, Mr. Damien McCallion and Ms Yvonne O'Neill from the HSE. They will look at all open files. Open files are those where the child or young person has not been seen in the previous six months. Approximately 3,500 files must be looked at. This is the estimate for the entire country. When I speak about doing a review of CAMHS, I want it done across all 73 teams. This is the only means by which I can find out what the picture is on the ground. I spoke about the acceptance rates. These which tie in with the postcode lottery. Something I have been doing since I became a Minister of State two and a half years ago is funding the clinical programmes. When I came into the post, there was funding for three eating disorder teams. There is now funding for nine. It takes 12 to 18 months to put in place a multidisciplinary team. We almost have six going and another three are funded. By the end of this year, all nine should be in place. Mention was made of ADHD. It is very important to point out that 40% of referrals to CAMHS are for children with ADHD. The report refers on page 20 to medication management and states that it was pleasing to note that in the majority of the sample of the files reviewed, physical monitoring was completed for children and young people with ADHD on stimulant medication. This has to be acknowledged. I have to look at the report in the round. I was very concerned about many issues and I have escalated them to the highest level to which they can go. At the same time, my main concern when I asked for the reports and audits to be put in place was coming off the back of overprescribing in Kerry. The evidence is that in 40% of ADHD cases physical monitoring has been done. This was not the case when I received the previous report. The report also states that CAMHS staff work extremely hard to try to provide a good service. We are aware that many young people and their families have received excellent care and treatment. Many teams are innovative in trying to mitigate the risks posed by the lack of staff. I recognise this. Another discussion I had with the HSE last week was on looking at the teams that are under-resourced as against some of the teams that are well resourced. It is a bit of a postcode lottery and we are putting a focus on it. I was very concerned about mention in the report that in some cases there was no documental review for two years. This is simply not acceptable. I have zero tolerance of this. I want to touch briefly on admission to adult wards. I spoke about this earlier. Last year, there were 19 cases where young people had to be admitted to adult wards. There are some instances where it happens with the best will in the world. I will speak about a case where a 17-and-a-half-year-old male was admitted to a psychiatric ward in Donegal on one particular night. A bed was found for him in Merlin Park in Galway. The person was extremely upset. A decision was made that for his own safety the best thing to do would be to move him in the morning after he had slept. Sometimes decisions are taken in the best interests of the health and well-being of the person by a medical practitioner who is way more qualified than me to support that young person. I know we have been accused breaking various laws on this. My worry is whether I could stand here as Minister of State if a 17-year-old or a 17-and-a-half-year-old person was denied access to a department of psychiatry in an adult unit if nowhere else was available and that young person left the facility and the outcome was death. This is why I have to try to weigh it up. I do not ever want to see a young child in an adult psychiatric facility but there are occasions when we must balance the risk and I have to be conscious of this. There is a risk there. Thankfully, the people involved in the 19 cases last year were all aged 16 and 17. I have spent a long time discussing this matter with consultant psychiatrists. No consultant psychiatrist wants to put a young child in an adult facility. I have to say that when they are in an adult facility they are monitored 24-7. Somebody sits outside the door looking through the glass window. This happens. This is the one thing I want to say about it. There is balance of risk. There is a little bit of a grey area and it is done on a case-by-case basis. There will never be a situation when we will have acute inpatient services for children in every county in Ireland. This just will not happen. It would be remiss of me not to say this. A key recommendation of the Maskey report was that we would look at online supports to see what we could to. At present we are using it in Kerry with a doctor who worked previously in Ireland. I will make several points to allay the fears of Senator Conway. Every young child the doctor has diagnosed he has seen in person. He flies in and sees them in person. After the diagnosis has been made he sees the child online. That child is not in his or her bedroom or sitting at home. That child is in the CAMHS unit in Kerry. A member of the multidisciplinary team is sitting beside them. We have been told to be innovative and to look outside the box. We have a fantastic e-mental health hub in Roscommon. It used to be the old Rosalie facility. I visited there with the then Minister of State Deputy Feighan. It gets support from the CAMHS team and the inpatient team in Galway. It does work. There is funding in the budget to roll out two more of these. This year €6 million has been provided. We have to think outside the box in respect of issues such as this. I know I have gone over time, but I have one more point to make. We are looking at age limits. Reaching 18 is a very difficult time in the lives of young people. They might be doing the leaving certificate or going to college. They might have been receiving the support of an eating disorder team for four years and then they reach a cliff edge. A sub-committee of the national implementation and monitoring committee has been formed to look at best practice, and whether services should continue to the age of 21, 23 or 25 years. I am open to persuasion on all of this. I certainly believe that at a minimum it should be extended to the age of 21. Jigsaw works for those aged between 12 and 25 years and it works very well. I am open to persuasion regarding age. I want to urge a note of caution. This will work very well in the community services but it will not work in the same way in inpatient services. We cannot have a situation where we have a 12-year-old girl who weighs five or six stone and who has an eating disorder positioned beside a young man of 21 who is psychotic. For community services, it could work very well . However, there would have to be a lot of work and research done on inpatient services. I thank Senator Black for all the work she does with her committee. I fully support her call for a stand-alone mental health committee. I am happy to come before the Seanad, the committee and the Dáil. The more we speak about mental health and the resources we need, the better. I have been very taken today with the number of constructive recommendations that have been made. Everybody wants to see a better service, and I thank the Senators for this. I thank the Acting Chair for her indulgence.

I am seeking to include passports. As drafted, the subsection provides that, where a person does not already have a driving licence, a learning permit or a foreign driving licence, only a personal public service, PPS, number suffices as a suitable form of identification when applying for a vehicle licence. While I appreciate that a PPS number is different from a public services card, there was overreach in the requirement for a public services card to access services. Given the process for accessing passports, a passport should be accepted as a suitable form of identification instead of pushing someone to have to provide a PPS number, particularly in light of the history around this issue with people being incorrectly pushed to provide public services cards when applying for driving licences.

This proposal would add a passport to the possible details that could be captured with vehicle ownership records. I appreciate the thinking behind the amendment, but it would not work. We are trying to capture identifiers - a driver number, if available, or a PPS number if there is no driver number - so that we can link vehicle ownership records to existing or future driving licence records. This will help us to ensure that, for example, fixed-charge notices are delivered to the correct addresses. The driver number, if available, will give us a direct link to the existing driving licence record. Where a person does not have a driving licence record, he or she will not have a driver number, but if we capture the PPS number and the person later obtains a driving licence, we will be able to make the link. Collecting a passport record would not help us, because we do not have anything to link it to a driving licence record. There is also the fact that, as written, the amendment would mean capturing the passport, not the passport number. Even if we had a way of linking passport numbers to the driver licensing records, the amendment would not work. I am satisfied that we have adequate cover through the use of driving licence numbers and PPS numbers in the Bill. This will help to ensure that people receive fixed-charge notices, penalty points and disqualifications, as appropriate.

It is a valid point, but I reserve the right to table an amendment on the matter on Report Stage. A passport is a form of identification that can be used in obtaining a driving licence. The Minister spoke about looking for a driving licence number, but it is not a requirement that someone have a public services card in order to obtain a driving licence. He or she can apply for a driving licence based on a passport. It is an acceptable form of identification for the driving licence, which is regarded as an acceptable form of identification under the Bill. Given the valid point about passport versus passport number, I will not press this amendment, but I will return to the matter with a variant on Report Stage.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	86	Members will be aware that one of the matters dealt with in this Bill is the legislative underpinning for a motor insurance database. This is a project that was developed over a long time. The aim behind it is to provide a resource to combat uninsured driving. Uninsured driving is a menace. Drivers who drive while uninsured are typically guilty of other road traffic offences and are a danger to the public. The cost of uninsured driving ultimately falls on law-abiding citizens through higher insurance premiums. This database will enable the Garda to identify uninsured drivers more easily and get them off our roads. Legislation was first put in place to underpin this database in 2010. At that time, the full outline of what the database would look like and what would be needed to underpin it in legislation, was far from clear. As a result the 2010 legislation was very vague. It was amended in 2016 and to a further small degree in 2018 as the project developed and there was a clear idea of what would be needed. Some of the provisions were commenced in 2019 and details of a large number of policies have been uploaded to the database. However, to complete it we need further amendments, which are included in this Bill. The Bill addresses three principal areas relating to the database. First, it adds a new section 56A to the Road Traffic Act 1961 to require provision of certain information by clients to insurers when taking out motor insurance. The reason is that as insurers will have to provide certain information to the database, they will need to be able to acquire it from the client. Second, it updates provisions to comply with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which came in after the most recent substantive amendments to the provisions in 2016. This involves providing clarity on what data can be shared, with whom and for what purposes. I wish to acknowledge the constructive engagement from the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in developing these provisions. Finally, it creates provisions to capture the details of vehicles held on fleet policies. These are policies covering a range of vehicles that may join and exit a fleet multiple times over one year. It is essential to keep track of these changes. It is in the interests of both the public and fleet owners for this to happen. Some Members may be aware that some road haulage operators have said they are being unfairly targeted here, which is not true. There are many holders of fleet policies, not just hauliers and they are all being treated alike. I am sure that on reflection, they would want to be sure that their vehicles, like any others, were kept up to date on an insurance database used by the Garda to ensure their insurance is in place. Today, I am proposing three amendments to finalise and refine the measures already in the Bill. First, I am introducing a definition into the Road Traffic Act for the term, "vehicle identification number". This is because the term will be used further on in the other amendments. Second, I am proposing to substitute the new section 56A as it stands in the Bill. The changes are not enormous, but it is much simpler to replace the whole section 56A than to make multiple small amendments. The same is true for the third change, where I am proposing to substitute section 78A. The principal changes relate to the fleet policy issue. The new version of section 56A will specify the information, which a fleet owner or motor trader will need to supply to the insurer in order that the insurer will be able to provide that information to the database. However, a fleet owner or a motor trader will also be required to supply details of their drivers and vehicles directly to the database. In the case of standard policies, this information will also be provided by the client to the insurer, who will then provide it to the database. The reason for asking that it be provided to the database directly by the fleet owner or motor trader is that vehicles, drivers and fleets can change through the year. This information needs to be updated as appropriate. This is the most efficient way to do it, and is in the interest of fleet owners. After all, they do not want to be in a position where one of their vehicles is not up on the system and appears as being uninsured or where a driver is not registered as covered. In line with UK legislation, we are also allowing that vehicles held for up to 14 days will not need to notified to the database, only those held for longer. In section 78A we are updating the requirements on insurers to provide the data, which they will have regarding fleet policies. Members may also wish to note that in both section 56A and section 78A we have dropped references to the driver number on driving licences issued prior to January 2013. This is because such licences would have been valid for a maximum of ten years and are therefore no longer in circulation.

I imagine they will be. I also have a couple of questions for the Minister. He has already partly answered one of them in relation to the question of a fleet. I was wondering where that fit in terms of haulage and hauliers. I think it is a step forward to have proper accountability when it comes to haulage fleets. It is my understanding that a haulage company with a fleet of vehicles is not under fleet in the excluded section. Rather, it is the case that a haulage company would come under the requirement for every individual using a vehicle to be named in the insurance. Will the Minister clarify that? I will not stray very far but an area I have long highlighted concerning toll roads is the fact that many large vehicles often take smaller back roads to avoid paying tolls . We have seen significant consequences in Slane, County Meath, and other places with accidents arising from that. I have often called for measures that would require owners of the vehicles in haulage companies to set up an annual toll road payment, rather than it falling to individual drivers, who may or not choose to pay tolls. Making it an obligation would be a really sensible safety provision. I think it is good that we are putting an insurance obligation on the owners of vehicles, regardless of who is driving. We should similarly look to an obligation in respect of an annual toll road payment to ensure against the creation of perverse incentives for individual, possibly self-employed, drivers to leave toll roads and take more dangerous back roads. I am signalling that as an opportunity. It is an issue I might return to on Report Stage. Amendment No. 12 is creating a new database. I appreciate the Minister mentioning that he has had engagement with the Data Protection Commission but I would like to see the outputs of that engagement in terms of protections. The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, will be the named data controller and there will be data protection officers. I also appreciate there will be a review after 18 months but one of the key things will also be an advance data protection impact assessment. Will the Minister clarify if plans have been made for the setting up of a data protection impact assessment with regard to this new database? What other protections or safeguards are there to ensure compliance? I also want to signal something else because I may bring amendments in respect of it on Report Stage. The new section 78A(11) states that the information may be made available to the recipients as specified in one place, but also "to such further recipients as may be specified in the regulations for such further purposes as may be specified therein." Again, one is talking about a data protection impact assessment in terms of the database but also a data protection impact assessment in terms of the regulations. In general, I am always cautious about signing over anything where we refer to such further purposes as may get decided or to such further recipients as might be specified. That is just a little vague. The one thing we know with data protection is that it is always better to be clear about who might receive the information and for which purposes and that we do not have a situation where things might be added without them being properly screened.  Does the Minister have answers to those questions relating to amendment No. 10? It would also be useful to get more information on amendment No. 12. I may also bring some amendments.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	88	There seems to be some sense behind the Senator's suggestion on how we address the issue of large vehicles avoiding tolls, which brings traffic to areas we do want it in. However, it is not for this piece of legislation, which relates to the insurance rather than the toll management systems. As I said in my introductory remarks, it is to the advantage of hauliers to be treated like all other fleet owners. As I recall, any company or organisation with more than five vehicles is described as a fleet. Many hauliers might have only one or two trucks and that will not apply but where it does fit within the definition of "fleet", it is absolutely appropriate that the database be updated in the way set out here. On the data protection issue, this does provide for designated data controllers and GDPR legislation then applies a whole range where one is designated as being the authority with responsibility for managing it and it sets out the whole series of what is required including the date of birth, the policy number, the period of cover and so on. It is setting out what some of that information is, so it is providing an up-to-date approach. As I said in my introduction, it is applying GDPR principles in how we do this. The replacement section 78A(11) introduced by amendment No. 12 would make the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, subject to regulations made by the Minister. We want to have access where data protection inputs are required and where those regulations are put in place to meet data protection rules. This amendment is, as I said, providing for us to be compliant with the GDPR. I think the Senator might agree when I say the GDPR has been one of the most progressive pieces of European legislation and put some good regulatory controls in place. Our own Data Protection Commissioner has obviously been very involved in the drafting of these regulations to ensure we are compliant with the European legislation.

On data protection, specifying what the information is one part of it but specifying who is accessing the information and for what purposes is the other part. The GDPR is not simply about being clear what the information is but being clear what purposes it is used for and who is accessing it. We might have the same information gathered but the information does not belong to a body. The MIBI may have that information but it does not own it as it is still the information of others. Instead, the bureau has use of that information for certain purposes and that is why I am looking at that little bit of ambiguity. I am happy to engage in between Stages with the Minister because I will be crafting some amendments for Report Stage and do not want to craft any unnecessarily. I am looking for clarity around what is envisaged in that because it is just a little loosely worded at the moment. That is fine. I am sure we will come back to it on Report Stage and I am happy to engage in between if that is useful.

I have a note on that I would like to give, for the information of the House. It is just to have clarity on it. Members will be aware the Road Safety Authority, RSA, is responsible for the delivery of the driving test. This was the original core purpose of the authority, which was originally to be called the driver testing and standards authority. When first published as a Bill, the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 was called the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill. Recent discussions with the Attorney General indicated there was some obscurity in the legislation about the role of the RSA in delivering the driving test. On the advice of the then Attorney General, we agreed late last year to introduce an amendment to remove any obscurity in the law and reaffirm the role of the RSA in delivering the driving test. Section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 deals with certificates of competency, which are the certificates issued when a person passes a driving test. Under section 33, the Minister may by regulations designate a body as the issuing authority for the purposes of certificates of competency and it is then the responsibility of the issuing authority to test applicants for a certificate or to call them to be tested. We are here amending section 33 by introducing three new subsections. These will become sections 33(1)(1A), 33(1)(1B) and 33(1)(1C). The new section 33(1)(1A) clarifies the RSA is the issuing authority and has been since 1 January 2007, which is when the RSA took over the delivery of the service. The new section 33(1)(1B) confirms functions under section 33(4), which are essentially functions of issuing or refusing certificates following tests, are deemed to have been carried out by persons appointed by the RSA to carry out the tests. This is to remove any doubt about the status or RSA testers. Section 33(1)(1C) is a standard formulation so that in the case where the operation of sections 33(1)(1A) or 33(1)(1B) might conflict with the person's rights, these subsections still operate so as not to conflict with those rights but otherwise be of full effect. It is largely technical in nature, a Chathaoirligh, but I was keen to explain it in detail.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	95	I move amendment No. 13:In page 21, to delete lines 24 to 27.This amendment seeks to remove from the Bill the provision that would permit An Garda Síochána to enter "any place including the curtilage of a dwelling" without a warrant or to seize a vehicle a garda believes has been, is being or will be used dangerously.Curtilage includes gardens, paths, driveways, yards, garages or sheds used in conjunction with a house. While the Bill specifies that gardaí cannot enter a dwelling proper without a warrant, we are concerned that permitting gardaí to seize a vehicle other than one in any public space or on any public road, regarding which there are existing powers, blurs the principle that gardaí should not enter a home without a warrant. That is a very long-established principle. While it is completely reasonable to be able to seize a vehicle in a public space that has been, is being or will be used dangerously, the reference to a vehicle that is likely to be used dangerously is quite open to interpretation. The Minister is blurring the power to enter somebody's home or personal land. It is based on a somewhat speculative assessment regarding use. With a warrant or some other safety mechanism, reasonable grounds of some kind must be shown. The legislation does not refer to a garda entering the curtilage of a dwelling for a clear, specific, measurable purpose, such as to investigate the loud sound of an alarm, but to entering on the basis of a feeling that a vehicle might be used for a certain purpose, or used dangerously at an undefined point in the future. The reason for entry is setting a very low bar and may be ignoring the long-established practice whereby a garda must have a warrant or other very good reason for entry. Curtilage includes the likes of garages and sheds in conjunction with a house. If entering garages, for example, there could be a blurring of the lines because one could be entering the same building as the house. This needs to be examined in order to tighten the requirements for entry or limit the areas that may be entered. Currently, the legislation is too loosely phrased.

I understand from talking to my colleagues in Dublin, particularly Deputy McAuliffe, that it is a matter of gardaí having access after the event. Naturally, they would have information that an event took place, so it is a matter of them being able to search a storage area or garage. A working group was set up when Deputy McAuliffe was mayor of the city and, as the Chair will be aware, the matter was included in the programme for Government. The initiative is welcome. There have been major accidents across Dublin, although the problem is of very little relevance in Galway city.

We included a number of measures in the Bill to ensure the Garda will have the necessary powers to deal with this problem. Among other things, we are creating a power that will allow the Garda to enter the curtilage of a dwelling, but not the dwelling itself, to seize machines of the type in question that have been used illegally. The amendment proposed would delete this power and therefore I cannot agree to it. We are not talking about an unreasonable power. I understand the point the Senator is making - it is valid - but one of the difficulties with addressing the problem of scramblers in parks and other places is that it would be dangerous to the users, gardaí and others who happen to be nearby to try to stop them when they are being used dangerously. It is therefore essential and safer to allow the Garda to seize them where they are kept. I am afraid I cannot therefore accept the amendment and I ask the Senator to withdraw it. I accept her logic but hope she understands that, in addressing this issue, trying to take a vehicle in full flight in the middle of a park, or in dangerous circumstances, requires us to consider other mechanisms.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	98	I am not suggesting that vehicles need to be taken in full flight. If we start to go down a slippery slope, however, where will we stop? What will we not enter a dwelling or its curtilage to take? There are many things that would be much easier if gardaí had access to people's homes or homes' curtilage without a warrant but there is a reason there are caveats and protections in this regard. Following a general principle that I believe to be reasonable, more permission is usually granted in law for investigation and prosecution. We will come to this when talking about cameras. It is one thing to do something for prosecution or investigation but another to do it on the basis of speculation about events that have not occurred. This amendment is quite blunt in respect of removal. I will signal on Report Stage that a key point of concern is not just the reference to having been or being used but the phrase "likely to be driven". It is fine when following somebody in a vehicle that one can identify as having been used in a certain way but the wording "likely to be driven or used" is really blurring the line. This is because, when speculating on what is likely to be used, one is neither prosecuting nor investigating an offence committed; rather, one is in a zone of speculative or preventive action. In that context, the Minister is just blurring the line establishing what comprises an intrusion on rights. One would need to have a reasonable evidence base suggesting a vehicle will be used. I accept our amendment requires a flat deletion but I believe, with respect, that some nuancing of the legislation is needed, including on the question of garages directly attached to a house.

I believe the wording of the legislation delivers exactly what the Senator is looking for. It states, "A member of the Garda Síochána may, for the purposes of exercising a power under subsection (1), enter without warrant". As stated in subsection (1), it is only where a member of the Garda Síochána "reasonably believes that a vehicle has been, or is being, driven or used (or is likely to be driven or used) in any place in which it is, or is likely to be, dangerous to any persons present". Therefore, it is only where a garda has a reasonable belief that a vehicle was being driven in a manner very dangerous to others that subsection (3) comes into effect. A court would interpret that. It would not be possible for a garda to wander into someone's front garden without meeting any of the conditions in subsection (1). That would not be within the law. I hope that provides some of the reassurance the Senator is looking for.

#VictorBoyhan	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-party	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-dob	unknown-#VictorBoyhan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	102	I move amendment No. 15:In page 40, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:“(a) in Part 4 of the First Schedule, by the insertion of the following after 26:“27Offence consisting of contravention of Article 44(1)Parking in a disabled persons' parking bay without a disabled person's permit 13”.”.I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House. This is sort of a recurring theme. I recall discussing this with the Minister twice in the House. Basically, to cut to the chase, I propose the introduction of a penalty system for those who park in disability bays. I am conscious the Cathaoirleach is hugely involved in advocacy work for the disability sector. I, too, have and I have been a director of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind for many years. I see this as an ongoing issue across the country. I am a former councillor in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and this has been actively pursued by it, in addition to a whole load of other measures that would open up our public realm, car parking spaces and public roads for people with disabilities to access around them. It is very important. There are not enough of these designated parking bays at the moment in certain locations. However, that is not what I am dealing with today. It is important that people who have a disability and go through the proper criteria and application for a disability permit to park their car be supported in any way possible. What are the disability organisations and advocacy groups telling us? They say it is a major problem. They say that they go to places where cars are parked in them. There is an issue of enforcement. The local authorities operate, under by-laws, certain parking regimes, as does An Garda Síochána. I spoke to one garda in the traffic unit about this and the garda told me much of it is a resource issue. Gardaí are under fierce demand, which we can understand. There are other priorities as well, and I respect and understand that. Everyone knows what a disability bay is. It is about applying the law and respecting the special status and designation of these parking bays. I want - and I know the Minister and everyone in this House does as well – to see people with disabilities integrating fully in their work and their community, be it their parish life or whatever they want to do. These spaces are at a premium and there needs to be penalty. I just checked something out. The rationale for this Bill is that it will introduce penalty points for people who park in disability parking bays without appropriate permits. At the moment, people who park in a disability bay without the appropriate permit are subject to a fine of €200. This increases to €300 if it is not paid within 28 days. This is covered by regulations that are set out by the Department and, under the by-laws, each local authority has discretion to set times for parking in various different pay-and-display or parking regimes that exist within their local authority area. We need to ensure that the laws are applied consistently and fairly so that people with disabilities do not face extremes or possibilities of difficulty in accessing their parking bays. The introduction of a penalty points scheme would deter people nationwide from parking in disability bays. That is fair. I will go on and speak on the other amendment so that covers me, instead of getting up and down twice. It is important. Again, the rationale for amendment No. 75 is the same. I understand that parking in disability bays should be a criminal offence and this is what this will do. The Minister told me before that he did not think it was necessary to make this a criminal offence but I believe it is. I want to be clear that I think this is a criminal offence. It might sound a bit punitive, harsh and draconian, but it needs to happen. That is the language I am getting back from people who have disabilities who find it difficult to park. That is the language I am hearing from city and county councillors all around this country. They are saying that this is an issue. As I noted earlier, it is about policing and administering the system. For anyone who has had penalty points, three is one thing, but when one gets another three and it is six, now one is getting a bit exercised about everything. It is right and a strong message. We should clearly send a message of zero tolerance of people who take advantage of disability parking bays and park in them. The Minister has had time to reflect on this because I have raised it twice with him before. I would like to think we can stand shoulder to shoulder together today in solidarity and send a clear message that this what we believe is the right regime. Disability sectors are asking for this. I was told that this might not be the appropriate legislation. There is clearly a place for this in this legislation. Clearly, we can slot this into the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 and I would ask for the Minister’s support.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	103	I hear the Senator’s passion and clear commitment to the issue. We are absolutely in agreement that the improper use of disabled parking is extremely selfish and causes grave disruption for people with disabilities who need access to those spaces. They are provided to people with mobility difficulties who need access to parking close to shops and other amenities and where the bays are designed to be wider to allow for people who have difficulty getting in and out of vehicles to have the space that they need. As the Senator said, when someone parks illegally in a disabled parking bay, they face a fixed-charge penalty of €150, rising to €225 if it is not paid within 28 days, and rising further to €300, which is well above the usual fixed-charge rates. Most other parking offences incur a €40 charge. This penalty is now the highest of all the fixed-charge driving and parking offences. I share the Senator’s concern about the issue. I acknowledge, as he said, that he has raised the issue with me before of whether we should go further and apply penalty points for the offence, which is now before us as the Senator’s amendment. I am afraid that I have not changed my view. As I indicated in the past, I do not consider this is the appropriate place for penalty points. Ever since they have been introduced, penalty points have been focused on offences that involve driving and moving traffic, which is to say, offences causing danger and not just inconvenience. They are driving penalty points offences. The fact that the only parking offence to attract penalty points is dangerous parking, which is parking that could cause a risk to moving traffic, is an example of that definition. Penalty points are there to enforce traffic safety and affect driving safety. That distinction is something that we should retain. For now, penalty points for parking in a disabled space is not appropriate, but we would be open to increasing the fines further, and we have recently increased a number of the fines for on-street parking and other offences. The proposals here would undermine the focus on the penalty points system on driving offences involving moving traffic and I do not believe it would necessarily combat the illegal use of disabled parking bays. We could do that with higher fines, which would be more appropriate. I would also like to take the opportunity to point out to the Senator that in this Bill we are making amendments to enable prosecution for fraud where people make a false application for disabled parking permits that will, I hope, help reduce the incidence of fraud and, therefore, free up spaces for those who are legitimately entitled to use them. With regard to amendment No. 75, I share the Senator’s concerns about the misuse of disabled parking spaces. As I indicated, it carries the highest fixed charge for parking offences and I am happy in that score, although it is always open to reconsideration. In this case, Senator Boyhan is proposing that a person who does not pay the fixed charges goes to court and is convicted should receive a class D fine. This is a fine up to a maximum of €1,000 at the discretion of the judge. While I appreciate the intention, I have to point out that this would mean reducing the fine against what it is today. It would actually have a slightly counterproductive impact. The rules for disabled parking bays are set out in regulations made under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. This means that the offence of a misuse of a disabled parking space is an offence under that section. In turn, the penalty for such an offence is the general penalty under road traffic Acts, which is a fine of up to €1,000 for the first offence, €2,000 for second or subsequent offence, and a fine of up to €2,000 and-or up to three months in prison for a third or subsequent offence of the same type within a 12-month period. A class D fine would, therefore, be the same as the current fine for a first offence, but a reduction of the penalty for second and subsequent offences. I know that is not the Senator’s intention and I appreciate his intention. However, the amendment would actually weaken it, strangely, because of that technical issue and the existing of ability to fine someone who is guilty.

I will take the response to amendment No. 15 first.Being fined is not a problem for people who are very wealthy. In some cases the fines are paid by corporate companies. There are not many people for whom it is not an issue but there are those who just pass the buck down the road. It may be a company vehicle, somebody else's vehicle or they do not have a problem paying the fine. One clear thing to be sure of is that if we give people penalty points and they accumulate the maximum number they will be off the road. The Minister is not going to support this. I am asking the Minister to support introducing a regime and system that would put off the road people who are deliberately and willingly going out and taking advantage of pay and display areas without a pay and display permit, which is a totally illegal activity. The Minister is not prepared to take a heavy hand with them and stand in solidarity. That is what I am taking from what the Minister has said. He is open to respond and counteract this if he feels I am misrepresenting him in any way. My takeaway is that he is not prepared to put these people off the road. People accumulate fine after fine. My local authority uses parking fines. People accumulate them and they just keep paying them. I got into a truck the other day with perhaps 50 fines thrown on the floor. That is terrible. The Minister is not supportive at this point in time. I have been touch with him about this twice. I have raised this as a matter in the House twice. Does the Minister accept that a penalty point system would put people off the road eventually? This is the reality of it. I know it. I do not think the Minister has any difficulty in accepting it because it is the fact. People get fine after fine. I do not support the Minister's proposal. I will pursue this today because it is important to do so. I thank the Minister for his response and his engagement. He has the power to support the amendment and recommend its support in the House. It is ultimately a decision for the House to support this amendment, which would put people off the road if they took advantage of this situation. This is what I am asking for and I would like to hear the Minister's response. With regard to amendment No. 75, I fully accept what the Minister has said. He has set it out very well. It has been a learning curve for me. I fully accept the advice of the Minister's officials that it would not be the right to do because the penalty would be reduced. At present after a certain stage in the process there is the possibility of imprisonment. I accept this and I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 75. I will pursue amendment No. 15 but I would like to hear the response of the Minister.

I will pick up on a couple of points the Minister made. His position needs re-evaluation. He mentioned that the penalty point system is designed to tackle dangerous driving. He said the parking offence is dangerous parking. The Minister described dangerous parking as parking that is a danger to vehicles. Dangerous parking is parking that is a danger to road users and should be construed as such. Dangerous driving is not solely about the car. It is matter of road users and how cars are used in the proper way. It is also about other drivers. One of the requirements to pass a driving test is that people show appropriate consideration for other drivers and other road users. It is not simply inconvenient, as it was framed, if a disability space has been wrongly occupied by a car that does not need one. It is dangerous for a driver with a disability who may not be able to access a safe parking space as a result and who may have real physical difficulties as a consequence. It is not inconvenient; it is dangerous. Disability parking is not a perk or compensation that we give to people with disabilities. Disability parking is a road safety measure and a driving safety measure. In this sense, Senator Boyhan's proposal fits appropriately in the penalty system and should be considered part of regulating against dangerous driving. Frankly, persons who repeatedly engage in such behaviour show themselves to be reckless in respect of other road users and other drivers on the road. In this context it is appropriate. It is not simply about penalising them. For the general safety of our roads this behaviour should be identified and tackled with the accumulation of points. I urge re-evaluation of what we are looking at when we consider dangerous driving. If dangerous parking is already there, this is another form of it.

I was uncertain as to that fact. Our office pushed for the increase in fines. As I said, we have never been shy about trying to protect this. To respond to Senator Higgins, when I speak about dangerous driving I am concerned about the people and not the vehicle. We also try to protect vehicles but we are all of a similar view that it is the human being we are looking to protect in how we regulate dangerous driving. There is an important point on the use of penalty points and how we designate certain tools to protect people. I believe there is a benefit in focusing fines or penalty points for parking. They are completely different approaches with regard to taking people off the road. My concern is that we might dilute some of the effect and what I believe has been the significant role of penalty points in driving behaviour. If we broaden it out there is a risk that we could dilute or lose some of it. It is a subjective call. My call is that we are best to take this approach. There may be instances where there is dangerous parking. Again, this is a judgment call. It is for the courts or others to decide what is appropriate. Senator Boyhan said that people do not pay attention to fines and that people can accumulate multiple fines and he is right. The fines are actually much higher now than were originally quoted in the response I had drafted. In these circumstances, someone using disability parking bays would start running into fines of thousands of euro. This would have a deterrent effect on people's behaviour. In a number of jurisdictions clamping as well as fines has an effect. No matter how wealthy people are, they have the same feeling when they see their vehicle clamped and they cannot move. There are various ways in which we can provide dissuasive measures. I am not convinced that broadening the scope of penalty points, which might dilute some of the impact they have on driving behaviour, is the approach to take. This is where we differ. The Senator is welcome to press the amendment but I will not agree to it.

I have consistently raised this issue. This is a request from disability sector advocates. We speak about being holistic. The Minister is very able and capable of making holistic arguments on a range of transport issues. I believe this is important. The alternative is fines or putting people off the road. Let us keep it all very simple. If accepted, this proposal would put people off the road for a considerable period of time rather than allowing them to buy their way out after deliberately abusing a system that was not put in place for them in the first place. Before we go to a vote I want to look at the other options. The Minister has responsibility for transport and he engages with the traffic unit and the Garda Commissioner through his staff and Department. I do not like using the words "instruct" or "demand" so instead I will use "ask". Would the Minister be in a position to commit today, using his high-level contacts, to ask the Garda Commissioner and the transport unit to carry out a blitz on this in the next three months?It would be some comfort if the Minister gave a commitment that he will put out some sort of blitz, an ask or instruction or resource them. The Garda tells me it does not have the necessary resources. There is a hell of a lot of demand on the excellent An Garda Síochána. Will the Minister give comfort to the people listening today that he is committed to using his powers, functions and contacts with An Garda Síochána and the enforcement agents to have a three-month absolute penetration and blitz to ensure that this is done, and run a public campaign about it? That would be helpful. I am a reasonable and pragmatic person. I know the arithmetic of this House. I could call a vote and so many people would bounce up here and we will not win it. One could trot out the auld press release and say the Minister did not stand in solidarity with people with disabilities and make a whole load of political mileage out of it, but that is not what I am about. I am about advocating to have action and I would be happy if the Minister could give a commitment that he will strongly use his influence to have a blitz for the next three months to tackle and address this serious issue.

The timing would be appropriate. One of the things that did happen during Covid-19 was that much of the behaviours on our roads such as parking, use of bus lanes and other areas worsened when people maybe felt there was not the same policing operation in place due to the restrictions. I will look at that and see what is possible to try to make sure the resources are applied so we enforce the laws we have, as well as strengthen them.

On that basis, if the Minister will assure us he will give the House that commitment, I am happy to withdraw these amendments.

To explain the background, in 2002 the system of fixed-charge notices for certain offences relating to traffic and vehicles was introduced. Under this system, which applies to lesser offences, An Garda Síochána issued a fixed-charge notice in advance of taking a case to court. The recipient has 28 days to pay the charge and then a further 28 days to pay the charge, plus 50%. Only if there is no payment after 56 days will court proceedings be initiated. The legislative basis for this system was updated in the Road Traffic Act 2010, making a number of changes, including the so-called "third payment" option, which means that when people get a summons, they also get a third and final chance to pay the fixed charge, plus 100%, and have court proceedings discontinued. The 2010 Act states that offences under section 139 of the Finance Act 1992 were to be fixed-charge offences. The intention was for offences relating to number plates to be fixed-charge offences. However, there was a mistake in what was done in 2010 and also an unintended consequence. The mistake was to declare all offences under section 139 to be fixed-charge offences. This was never the intention and section 13(j) of the Bill rectifies this by specifying that it is only offences under sections 139(1)(b), (bb), and (c), the number plate offences, which are fixed-charge offences. Specifically, these offences relate to not displaying the registration plate or displaying it in a manner not corresponding with regulations, where a vehicle is unregistered, to use it in public places in contravention of prescribed conditions and to display a false registration. The unintended consequences of the 2010 provisions were that the Revenue Commissioners, who used to have powers to enforce number plate offences, lost that power. Remember that registration of vehicles and assigning of registration numbers are tasks carried out by Revenue. When the 2010 Act provisions were brought in, they meant that no action could be taken in court under section 139 offences until the Garda had issued a fixed-charge notice and 56 days had passed without payment. At that point, the Garda could begin court proceedings. It was never intended that the Revenue Commissioners would lose the power of enforcement over these offences. Either the Garda or Revenue could enforce them before the 2010 provisions came in. The mistake in making all section 139 offences, and not just the number plate offences, into fixed-charge offences compounded the problem. As I said, the Bill already addresses that mistake. In order to restore the Revenue Commissioners' ability to enforce the registration plate offences, I am proposing the present amendments to allow them to issue fixed-charge notices in these cases. The amendments proposed now are to Part 3 of the 2010 Act, which deals with fixed-charge notices. In essence, they add in powers for the Revenue Commissioners so that they will be able to issue fixed-charge notices for number plate offences. This will restore their ability to enforce these offences, which had existed before the enactment of the 2010 provisions, and will mean that, as was the case before those provisions, both the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners will be able to act against those offences when they detect them.

These vehicles have become very popular in recent years and have a great deal to offer as an environmentally-friendly form of micro mobility. At the same time, the laws needs to take account of them like any other vehicles in the general interest of public safety. One starting point is that e-scooters already fit the criteria to be classed as mechanically-propelled vehicles, MPVs. It follows that they cannot be used in a public place without tax, insurance and an appropriate driving licence. They cannot be taxed because they are not a type approved and there is no appropriate class of driving licence. This means that they are currently illegal to use in a public space. The Bill will change this. It will create a new class of powered personal transport, PPT, which will be legal to use and distinct from MPVs. The class of PPTs is a wider category than e-scooters and allows for the possible emergence of other similar forms of micro mobility in the future. In line with the way the law handles MPVs and other types of vehicles, the amendments to the Bill will establish PPTs as a category, as well as stating which specific provisions in the law do or do not apply to them, as they would to MPVS, while leaving the question of construction, equipment and use of the vehicles for regulations. We are breaking new ground and as we progressed through the Dáil we made a number of amendments to the PPT provisions. I have a few more to propose today. They are primarily about one core change with a number of consequential changes based on that change. One of the most vital aspects of the introduction of any new concept into law is to have a clear definition of what it is we are talking about. It is also important to get that definition right because everything else will depend on it.In the case of PPTs, it is essential we have a definition, and we are providing one. As we are talking about a class of vehicles, we have included in the Bill a definition of PPTs that relies on three parameters familiar from other definitions of vehicles, namely, weight, speed and power output. There has been much discussion on the best way to approach this definition and of the values to be set. In the Bill as it stands, when each of these parameters is mentioned, it is added that the Minister may subsequently set a different value for that parameter. I am now proposing to revise this. The specific wording expressed in respect of each of these parameters is being removed and I will add a general provision stating, "The Minister may prescribe, for powered personal transporters or different classes of them, a maximum weight unladen, a maximum design speed, or a maximum continuous rated power or combined maximum continuous rated power different to the weight, speed or rated power referred to in the definition". This is not simply a tidier way of saying the same thing; it is different from what is currently in the Bill in one crucial respect, namely, that different values could be set in regulations for different classes of PPTs. For the time being, e-scooters will be the only class of PPTs we will be addressing in regulations but we allow for the possibility there may be others in future. It may be that different weight, speed or power output limits would be appropriate for different types of PPTs. We are, therefore, making allowance for this via the proposed amendment. As I indicated, it is a core change and most of the other amendments proposed with it are consequential amendments following from it. As regards amendment No. 26, while I understand what Senators Ruane and Higgins have in mind, the amendment misses an important point. In the Bill, we are introducing a new class of vehicles known as PPTs. This class will be distinct from mechanically propelled vehicles, the category into which e-scooters automatically fall at the moment. It will also be legally distinct from bicycles. The Senators’ amendment to add “except for pedal cargo bicycles” into the definition of PPTs is, therefore, unnecessary and irrelevant as PPTs do not include any type of pedal cycles. In that light, I ask the Senators to consider withdrawing the amendment. If they wish to press the amendment, I should point out that not only will it make no difference, it will also raise the problem that a pedal cargo bicycle is not defined in law. In any case, they can rest assured that the kind of vehicle of which they are thinking could not be mistaken in law for a PPT because it does not have a power source. There is one further issue in the amendments to which I wish to draw the attention of the House. When it comes to consideration of the weight of a PPT, a question arose as to whether the battery should be included in the weight. I am proposing an amendment to state clearly that the battery should be so included. Weight is, among other things, a safety issue, being related to the momentum of a vehicle and the potential damage it might cause in a collision. In practice, these vehicles will be used on roads with the battery installed and it should be considered as part of the legal weight limit.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	121	I have an amendment in this grouping. With respect to the Minister, the definition that has been put forward in terms of PPTs is not necessarily clear that it is solely designed in terms of e-scooters. My concern relates to cargo bikes, such as those that may be used by families, as well as the definition of pedal bicycles here. Where do cargo bikes fit in? I have sought to include them here, in the PPT space, but I would be happy if I felt confident they were included under the definitions in respect of pedal bicycles or mechanically powered vehicles. There is an ambiguity in terms of where and how they sit, however, and that is what I am seeking to address. Our amendment specifically seeks to ensure there is clarity in respect of pedal cargo bicycles. The increased use of cargo bikes that are largely electronically assisted is a positive and transformative initiative in terms of their usage for transport, leisure and last-mile delivery. They can be used by small businesses as well by families. Their increased usage is constructive and can contribute to freeing up cities. In the context of moving towards the ten-minute town or the 15-minute city, it is important to ensure persons can transport loads of various kinds without automatically having to revert to using a car to do so. I have no doubt about the enthusiasm of the Minister in respect of cargo bikes. I have lots more on the many benefits of e-assist cargo bikes. A study by the University of Westminster has shown their environmental benefits, as well as the benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. What I am looking for is where they fit in. There is a clear restriction under the definition of PPTs, which refers to vehicles "constructed for the carriage of a single person, but not designed or constructed ... for the carriage of goods", while the definition of "pedal bicycle" refers to "person or persons". There are two issues here, one relating to the carriage of goods and the other relating to the carriage of multiple persons. A "pedal bicycle" is defined as being "a bicycle which is intended or adapted for propulsion solely by the physical exertions of a person or persons seated on it". That does not cover family bicycles or the family usage of cargo bikes, especially electric cargo bikes. The next part of the definition, which refers to "a bicycle capable of propulsion solely by the physical exertions of a person or persons seated on it, and equipped with an auxiliary electric motor" may cover it but there is no specific reference therein to the carriage of goods. I am concerned there could be an inadvertent interpretation of the PPT piece to suggest the carriage of goods on a cargo bike is legally ambiguous and those transporting goods in such a manner are not covered or protected by these measures. I am happy not to press the amendment but I am seeking clarity in respect of the carriage of goods under the definition of pedal bicycle in particular or in terms of mechanically powered vehicles, although that is a much lesser speed. The issue in that regard is a maximum design speed of 6 km/h. Most electric cargo bikes have a maximum speed of 25 km/h. I am open to it not being put in that space but I am seeking clarity from the Minister in respect of where it sits.

The treatment of such bicycles is dealt with in a separate section of the Bill. As regards cargo bikes in particular, it depends on the power capacity. Where there is a maximum continuous rated power greater than 0.25 kW, there are particular legal requirements. Anything below that is treated in the same way as all other pedal bicycles. There are a range of cargo bikes, tricycles, recumbents and other new mobility and e-mobility equipment coming into the market, but anything that falls within that pedal bicycle category is not PPT and not subject to the legislation in respect of PPTs.

The only reference to the carriage of goods is a prohibitive reference that is attached to the PPT. There is no positive reference to the carriage of goods in the definition relating to bicycles. It is unclear. It is sometimes the case that if one kind of vehicle is prohibited from carrying goods but it is not made clear that another category of vehicle is allowed to carry goods, a presumption of leakage between the two could be created. I do not need to press the amendment at this point because the Minister is clear about the different purposes of the PPT, but I am not satisfied we have been given the reassurance we need in terms of cargo bikes within the pedal bicycle definition. We might come back to that on Report Stage.

A cycleway is a specific track intended for cyclists and is not the same as a cycle lane, as defined by markings on a road. It is our intention that powered personal transporters will be able to use cycleways, however, cycleways are first and foremost for cycling. The amendments I am proposing here are designed to ensure that the cycleway will provide for pedal cyclists in all circumstances. Without these amendments we could end up in the odd situation that a track which allowed only pedestrians and PPTs, for example, for which cyclists could be excluded, would be a cycleway. These amendments are to avoid that prospect.

Specifically, amendment No. 35 defines the use of CCTV as excluding the use of facial recognition technology such that any powers created in respect of CCTV throughout the Bill could not be interpreted as permitting the use of FRT. Amendment No. 46 inserts a new section specifying that facial recognition technology may not be used in any cameras operated by the road authority, nor may any data from the cameras be processed later using FRT, either by the road authority or a third party.  I am aware that the Minister has amendments coming up in the next section which explicitly says that they are removed, but as it does refer to any other data-gathering devices, I will come to those again in the next section. Interestingly, when drafting this Bill, the Minister made a point of specifying the artificial intelligence, AI, which the cameras can be used with, namely, automatic number plate recognition. It is strange then that we do not think to specify what artificial intelligence should not be applied to the footage from these cameras.  This must be the third or fourth legislative item to come through this House in the past year which casually creates powers of surveillance but does not insert any safeguards in primary legislation around how data from the surveillance can be used. Similarly, we saw careless provisions in the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, and we also sought to amend those at the time. The only safeguard in this Bill is that the Minister may make regulations in respect of how the data can be processed. We continue to treat mass surveillance of the public with a cavalier attitude when what we are dealing with is an infringement upon fundamental rights to privacy. We are five or ten years behind the rest of the world in this respect. Europe is on the cusp of legislating to control the use of AI but the Government seems intent on ignoring the way the winds are blowing. Again and again we see legislation with powers of surveillance being drafted in an open-ended way, so that it is never clear what technology is allowed to be used for surveillance, and which is not. We are living in a world where surveillance technology is evolving in new and sinister ways every day, yet the Minister's legislation seems oblivious to these developments.  By inserting safeguards around the use of FRT for surveillance purposes, we would be putting ourselves ahead of the curve in respect of European regulation. It is strange that we seem to be stuck five years in the past in respect of legislating for the use of AI and I hope that the Minister will seriously take into account and consider these amendments. I also hope that he will seriously reflect on the way the Government legislates around these issues.

I completely agree with her that this issue about the regulation of facial recognition technology, artificial intelligence and machine-based learning technology systems is something which we have to treat with real attention. It is a significant issue with regard to getting the balance right between the deployment of technology, the protection of human rights and a good justice and judicial system. I will treat the two amendments, Nos. 35 and 46, slightly differently, if I may. While I understand the logic behind amendment No. 35, I do not intend to accept it, not because I disagree in principle with some of the motives behind it, but my disagreement is purely on a technical point. What is proposed in the definition is that there is a risk that it would make it impossible to install or use any camera if it happened to be capable of capturing facial information. That would effectively mean that we could not use any camera, so that objection is purely a technical one.  The nub of the issue is contained in amendment No. 46 because this is very complex, and understanding how we get the regulation of technology right in this is an amendment I would be willing to come back and consider. I might ask my Department to look in more detail at some of the legal wording to ensure that we are not inadvertently creating difficulties. There is and can be no intention in my mind to use technology such as this without the Oireachtas passing legislation to designate certain areas for the use of technology in an appropriate way. I am happy that we should consider legislation to ensure that that is not an outcome of this legislation. It requires further consideration and I would like to come back on Report Stage, consider the amendment in the meantime, perhaps try to address the concerns that are raised but ensure it does not inadvertently create any other difficulties for us.

TII and local authorities use CCTV cameras to monitor traffic and to assist with enforcement. For traffic management, traffic monitoring cameras are used to monitor and manage the movement of general traffic, public transport and the various different active transport modes. They allow TII and local authorities to identify incidents, accidents, unusual congestion, delays and other events, and take appropriate actions. Enforcement cameras or other devices can be located at toll plazas or on overhead gantries along roads such as M50 for the enforcement of speed limits or traffic lane control, including the red X and move lane arrows regulatory signs. At each enforcement location the system of enforcement cameras monitors vehicles and captures necessary information such as numberplates to support this. These cameras are generally fix mounted and generate images that are used for post-image capture processing such as automatic numberplate recognition. Some of the devices currently may not fit neatly into the definition of cameras or CCTV, for example, devices that clock speed. The present amendment will allow for a wide range of options for managing traffic while making sure that appropriate protections are in place for the sharing of data, for data-sharing agreements, for the safeguarding of data and for the directions, guidelines, standards and regulations.
#LynnRuane	unknown-#LynnRuane-party	unknown-#LynnRuane-dob	unknown-#LynnRuane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	134	In the same vein as what I said during our discussion of the previous amendments, I have concerns about the Government amendments as they seek to broaden the technology that will potentially be used for surveillance. Again, without any appropriate safeguards attached in this legislation, they amend all mention of cameras to "cameras and other data-gathering devices". This, once again, extends surveillance powers in what I would see as a very concerning way. Indeed, the provisions on cameras in the original draft of the Bill are already concerning in and of themselves. Many times over the past year we have seen open-ended provisions around technology being introduced. The speed at which data-gathering technology is developing is beyond anything with which we can keep pace. If the Minister is referring to the need to allow motion-sensor cameras, for example, then that should be specified in the primary legislation. If he is referring to other technology, we should specify what that is. The phrase “data-gathering device” is an absurdly broad definition and could apply to any number of devices which incorporate intrusive artificial intelligence. We are repeatedly seeing the Government choose not to be cautious when it comes to granting powers of surveillance in legislation. For me, that is at odds with the direction of movement at a European level. It is at odds with the recommendations of human rights and civil liberties organisations. Will the Minister clarify why this provision is necessary? Will he clarify why this provision is any better than a more specific provision which would name and define specific technologies to be used? Why does this provision need to be so broad?
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	135	This is the wrong direction of travel. It is literally saying any tool can be used for any kind of data. It does not clarify. The definition for cameras has been extended to include "other data-gathering devices" The definition of "data-gathering device" proposed by amendment No. 36 is extraordinarily vague, wide and dangerous: "‘data-gathering device’ means any device, apparatus or equipment used or capable of being used for the gathering of data”. Again, it is any device and any data. There is no clarity. There is neither a narrowness about the technology, as my colleague has put forward, nor even an absolute clarity around which kind of data might be gathered. That is extraordinarily vague and wide. Frankly, the amendment needs to be very significantly and seriously re-evaluated. If motion sensor or speed sensing equipment is needed, let that be clarified. If a mechanism is to be put in place around the recognition of other appropriate technologies with suitable safeguards, data protection and all attached to that, put forward a mechanism. Simply changing what is meant by "cameras" to mean anything is very concerning. We have seen very worrying factors and we do not need to look far for them. We can look to China where there have been extraordinary levels of state surveillance and detailed pieces. Even if we do not have facial recognition technology, and we clearly do not have protections against that here, we may be still looking at profiling or crowd profiling. There is, for example, the new extreme legislation that has been introduced in the UK on public gatherings and people's rights to be together in public. There are a lot of very concerning areas here. If we are looking to authorise any device being used for the gathering of data, which could be any data, it is creating a public realm that is not really a public realm or shared space but which becomes a surveillance space where a person does not know what data are being gathered in respect of him or her. That person does not know for what purpose those data are being gathered and he or she does not know what devices may be tracking him or her. That is very different from saying there are speed cameras or cameras performing particular functions when it comes to automatic plate recognition. I urge the Minister to re-evaluate all of the insertions of the phrase "data-gathering device" and, in particular, to re-evaluate the definition of "data-gathering device" he put forward in amendment No. 36.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	136	I agreed in the previous amendment with the broad concern the three Senators set out around how we use facial recognition technology and artificial intelligence and the general risk - reality in many jurisdictions - of the surveillance of citizens that is totally inappropriate. I absolutely accept that. I said in my response to the earlier amendment that we all seek to get the balance right. There are instances where we need technology to protect citizens and it is appropriate, subject to the correct regulation. This amendment is coming from the need for this, and the definition is set within our Department, so I will give two very specific examples. First is the collection of data from a speed gun. Is that a camera? What sort of device is that? A second example would toll tag readers, where a person going through a toll barrier swipes a car or has electronic tolling or fast tolling. Again, this technology continues to evolve. Going back to some of the original legislation, would we have foreseen the development of that technology? No. We have to provide some flexibility that there are technological devices evolving which we want to provide for and regulate. That is why this amendment is needed. It is to allow us to use some of the data from the likes of those speed guns or toll tag readers for the benefit of citizens, not for surveillance. That is why the amendment is being proposed.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	137	We could all come up with many forms of data-gathering devices. If toll tag readers or speed guns are needed, then specify them. To say technology evolves all the time and moves so fast that we might need to use it before we have time to legislate for it is a very dangerous message to send. The Minister has recognised the concerns about artificial intelligence, the use of algorithms and facial recognition. If, in some other legislation, the Government is running to implement things before they are regulated or before there is proper regulation and monitoring of them, it is not the case that we should be in such a hurry to use any new technology that can be used to gather data that we would not have time to legislate properly for it, regulate it and monitor it. I do not agree that we should be able to have the flexibility to use as quickly as possible whatever is available in terms of data gathering and surveillance. It is appropriate, and it is the precautionary principle at an EU level that is being discussed in terms of legislation and directives at an EU level, that we should think first and legislate or regulate first before we go using whatever new thing might be seen at a trade fair or taken up by An Garda Síochána or anybody else who thinks it would be great and would love to use it.Therefore, it is appropriate that the Minister specifies and takes appropriate action, be it regulatory and legislative, in respect of any new data gathering devices or technologies that are being introduced. To do the opposite is reckless.

I fear we could end up in a situation where we would have to go back to amend primary legislation in an evolving area where we have different types of electronic devices which might want to use the data. I agree with Senator Ruane's earlier contention that we need to regulate how devices using facial recognition technology or artificial intelligence, AI, which could have a surveillance component, may be used. That is a separate issue in my mind to the case as to whether we should specify every single type of device in primary legislation. That is not exhaustive and I am quite certain we may want to use the data from other devices for very good reasons such as protecting lives, making sure we have better environmental output and better safety conditions. Let us absolutely regulate against surveillance as appropriate but I do not believe that requires primary legislation in every piece of legislation to define each and every device.
#LynnRuane	unknown-#LynnRuane-party	unknown-#LynnRuane-dob	unknown-#LynnRuane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	139	I have two points to understand. Many places around the world where we have seen more and more use of AI and facial recognition, have all set out in the beginning with the intention that these were not for surveillance. Then the mission creep begins where something that was there to protect society becomes something that is then used for surveillance because of the access to the data. As regards the other point of being able to go back to actually amend primary legislation to add in that evolving data, in all the years the drugs Act has been in place, every time a new component of a drug came on board there was a way to come back in and add drugs to the Schedule. Even while not being overly specific, we have to be able to say what the intention of legislation is and have some sort of a Schedule that can be added to with regard to including certain types of data gathering devices. If we do not have any sort of ethical framework, which we do not have in Ireland when it comes to the use of AI, no piece of legislation like this or any of the rest of them that brought in any use of AI or facial recognition, should actually come before a framework is introduced that is underpinned by the ethics in the use of AI. Right now if we are not embedded in any sort of ethical framework, we are doing this without actually understanding what that means for Ireland.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	140	It is the same thing. It is not simply a matter of saying we do not want to use the facial recognition technology on all this data that we gathered for whatever reasons. This is the thing with data. One does not get to gather data, potentially any kind of data, without having clear purposes as to why it is being gathered and what is being done with it. Again, we do not have the mechanisms or the framework. It is putting the cart before the horse as the AI directive has not yet been finalised in terms of the EU. That is still being finalised, debated and fine-tuned right now. Why would we not wait either until we have developed our own ethical framework around these datum before we introduce their use? This is gathering of data from the public. Why would we introduce a wide frame that allows any kind of device, literally any kind of "device, apparatus or equipment" that can be used for the gathering of data, and have that in play before we have either our own ethical framework or even the AI directive from Europe clearly in place? It is open season and simply saying we do not want to use it for a particular purpose later on is a fishing expedition. The Minister has given great ethical examples for which it may want to be used but again, he needs to make the case for those as per the precautionary principle. There are many non-ethical reasons that data gets used. Data can be used commercially, it can be used for profiling and in terms of targeting certain communities. There are many reasons data may be gathered in this context and in this very wide frame. There are lots of devices that give all kinds of interesting information and lots of people who are interested in all of those different kinds of interesting information. There is a reason we need a framework for how it is done and how it is analysed. The algorithms in respect of facial recognition are one part of it but there are many other parts that need to be regulated. The fact that everyone was gung-ho on facial recognition and now the dangers are being recognised is itself a cautionary tale against whatever other innovations may come up quickly in terms of data gathering. I do not think the Minister is hitting a balance here. He is opening up a very wide door in this definition and any kind of thing could come through it. He really needs to narrow this piece of legislation. It does not need to be by primary legislation. It may be regulation, the amendment of a Schedule, or other mechanisms but there needs to be a mechanism whereby the public are really clear that when any new data gathering device is going to be used there is a clear process by which it will be properly considered, there will be thought around what data will be gathered, how it will be gathered, stored and used, and what the purposes and safeguards are. They need to know there is a clear mechanism in place and this very wide definition is not it.

It is an issue obviously with mobile phones where there is a very serious issue around all the information, controversially. We have to be careful here not to try to address this whole complex issue through a piece of traffic management regulation. If we are starting to get down to specifics and that every device might be a data sharing device, we would have to start with this very room and my colleague here beside me with the headphones because they have an internet of things and world data sharing connecting capabilities: the screen in his hands, which records votes and who is speaking; the laptop; the microphones; all the other devices in this room - I could go on and list a whole range of devices - are collecting or have the potential to collect data. We could go into a very difficult legislation system here for the road traffic system, where similarly so many different devices are connected to an internet of things, and try to address this very important justice issue around how data records people's movements, actions, behaviours and so on but I do not think that will actually address it by trying to list every single thing. In the traffic management area, the same thing applies. I did not disagree with the Senator's original argument that we need to consider particular facial recognition technology and AI and so on and how data is used, but we do not get that by just trying to list every single device that might have implications on how the data could be used. It is better to recognise that there are devices which could be used in that regard such as the lights of speed guns or e-tolling equipment. They classified them to give us the ability to have those types of devices. Yes, we need to regulate them in terms of their implications for facial recognition technology and-or the use of AI but we will not solve that problem by just trying to list every device.

The Minister is the one seeking to expand the scope of this Bill. This is us responding to the expansion he has proposed. Frankly, his expansion includes every single thing. That is what the definition he is proposing effectively is. One could argue we should not try to have to name every single thing but the answer is also not to use every single device which is what he has here. It is literally any device for the gathering of data: "any device, apparatus or equipment". It is the Minister who is proposing this expansion and inserting it into the Bill. If he has specific cases which he has repeatedly used, he should address those specific cases but simply put that he wants to have an absolutely expanded scope. This debate has been brought on by the Minister's attempt to widen the scope of what is covered by the definition of cameras.Most people have an understanding of cameras. I am sure people will understand if the Minister says cameras, speed guns or even specifies certain categories of device but his phrase is "any device, apparatus or equipment used or capable of being used for the gathering of data". Therefore, it is not us introducing a big, wide topic but the Minister's amendment that is opening up a big, wide topic. If we wanted to address it in an efficient way for the purposes of this road traffic Bill - we can come back on all the regulation and the justice issues - the easiest way for now would be for the Minister to narrow the scope within his Bill to the actual purposes of the Bill in terms of the relevant devices there. Then we can all debate the wider issues at a later stage and be informed by the conclusion of the EU debate.

As the Minister has said, facial recognition or artificial intelligence, AI, are not included. In some circumstances, we need to avail of everything we can when there has been a dangerous accident or somebody has broken the law and I can see why all devices would be listed in this. However, this debate has raised an important issue. We need to introduce separate legislation around AI and facial recognition that is completely separate from this Bill. There is a huge piece of work to be done and I would happily work with the Senators on it because I have seen some of the stuff the AI can do and it is quite scary. I can see why in this case of a road traffic Bill, all devices that can be used to implement the rules of the road and the laws around them would be needed in this circumstance. I am trying to mediate here as I can see both sides. There is definitely a valid point on wholly separate legislation that is not part of a road traffic Bill, around AI and facial recognition.

Maybe there is an amendment that is not these, but which references devices that are related to the Road Traffic Act. It could specify the only devices that can be used are ones related to the violations brought to the fore in the Act and will catch speed and dangerous driving if something has happened. We would then be defining that it is not just any device for gathering data for any purpose but that it is related to the Act itself. As the amendment is written it could be anything for any reason. It just refers to "any device". Then, all of a sudden, we will have all different types of data-gathering devices on motorways and roads. We might have them in estates as well to monitor different minor roads. They are covered under this Bill rather than them being specific to road traffic incidents or related to speed. Even if it is not what we are saying about naming different devices, there is definitely a different way that is much more responsible than the way it is currently worded. Maybe the Minister should go back to what those amendments look like between now and the next Stage.

One could look at it the other way. One could say that by being specific in primary legislation, which may only be amended by going through this House and the Dáil, we could end up with a situation where other devices are gathering data that are completely unregulated and outside any control system. That would be a big risk and as Senator Higgins says, the technology is evolving so fast.

It is better to do it that way than try to set out in primary legislation what exactly each and every device is.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	150	The Minister might wish to respond to Senator Ruane's proposal. It is a really good compromise. It is not as strong as my proposal of naming each device but it is making it very clear that it is only to devices attached to a very particular and explicit purpose, namely, the investigation and prosecution of particular offences under the Road Traffic Act. That does not tie it to the device but ties it very narrowly to the purpose in terms of what are relevant data-gathering devices for this Bill to be legislating about. Frankly, the idea everything is unregulated if it is not in the Road Traffic Act does not really stand up. We have a Data Protection Act and we already have a presumption that we must have a clear, necessary and proportionate rationale for processing data. Therefore, it is not the case it is a free-for-all unless it is in this Bill. That would be a wrong and inaccurate message to send out from the House. It would be useful for the Minister to give a response to the point put forward by Senator Ruane around not naming the specific devices but the specific purposes. I am aware that later on, the Bill talks about the purpose for which they may they be used but we say it should be restricted to devices for that purpose, in order that some of the dangers I have highlighted would be ruled out. This could include data gathering for commercial purposes and other things that might be added in. It would be useful if the Minister could specify and tie it to the specific functioning of the Road Traffic Act.

Therefore, everything works. Once you are designating something as a "data-gathering device" then the broader European GDPR and other regulations kick in. As Senator Higgins said, this is an evolving area where we are awaiting European legislation on AI and facial recognition technology. It is better to apply the principles of European rules, including those of the European Court of Justice, around this and not try to use the Road Traffic Act and the specific definitions of technologies as a way of trying to do the same thing, because it changes with respect to some of the devices we may look to use. However, I absolutely agree on the need for them to be regulated by good European and Irish law.

It is not as if just because all the devices are there people are allowed do whatever they want with them, because there is the GDPR. I am wondering if that is the protection we have, because it includes all devices; if there is data protection and the GDPR then all those devices have to obey that.

A legislative basis will be used as the rationale, namely, we are gathering data about you based on the Road Traffic Act but there is no constraint within that Act that says the data we are gathering about you will only be related to road traffic.

The concern here is we have legislation being proposed that will give a very much wider permission for the gathering of data and that creates that dynamic. There are questions about the compatibility of the legislation with the GDPR in that context but we can come to that.

The proposed section 77A(6), to be inserted by section 45 of this Bill, sets out that the Minister must set out the regulations to "provide for data obtained using cameras operated by or on behalf of a road authority".It also sets out, in some detail, that a data protection impact assessment and so on should be carried out under the terms of section 84 of the Data Protection Act 2018. This is not providing a free-for-all. The debate here is about whether we identify each device in law. That is separate to whether there should be legislation.
#AliceMaryHiggins	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-party	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-dob	unknown-#AliceMaryHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	158	To identify each device was one solution. Two solutions were put to the Minister. There is no amendment which states that each device should be identified. We have clarified that the problem is the Minister's proposal that all devices of any kind that gather data should be allowed and included under the definition of "camera". We have suggested two solutions. One is that we specify only such devices that are related to these offences and the other, which I put forward, involves specifying the particular devices. Those are two solutions we have suggested in the context of the proposal put forward by the Minister, which relates to all data. Data gathering is a form of data processing. The Minister saying he will put in regulation as to how a person will use data that have been gathered does not reassure us as to the purposes for which data might be used. It does not give us assurances that a future Minister may not decide to add a load of other purposes for what that data that is being gathered might be used for. The Minister does not get to fish for lots of data and then decide later what purposes it may be used for. There is a question of the needless gathering of unknown amounts of data for unknown purposes by unknown devices. This is not controversial. It is probably one of the widest and loosest definitions I have ever seen. To be clear, what we are voting on here is not a narrow definition put forward by us. It is an extraordinarily wide definition put forward by the Minister. What we have very reasonably suggested are ways that it might be made a little narrower and more effective. If it is the case that the Minister is pushing ahead then, obviously, we will just have to oppose his proposed definition. Let us again be clear what we are voting on, however, which is whether we are okay with any device that gathers any data, possible for any purpose, and that being included within the definition of "camera".

I am proposing to replace the words "maintenance works" with “maintenance (including maintenance works)” as well as providing for TII to consult the Garda Commissioner, as required, with regard to traffic signs. The change from "maintenance works" to “maintenance (including maintenance works)” is based on legal considerations that the new wording would more fully capture the range of activities that could be covered by what we might generally think of as maintenance. It may seem a small matter but I am assured that, in legal terms, the new wording is more appropriate.

We have observed significant restrictions on the authority and power of local government in recent decades and we fear this provision will exacerbate this as it relates to permissions for large schemes and road development. Irrespective of concerns about the legitimacy of the decision-making within An Bord Pleanála, it is very important that local authorities and councillors reserve the right to make decisions about what is included in their development and local area plans and that applications for works in a relevant area take their provisions into account. Development and local area plans play a very important role in terms of democratic participation in the planning process and in decision-making about how we want to live together. They provide a vision for our villages, towns and cities and inform where development ought to take place.The plans' provisions are not decided on a whim. They involve detailed consultation with the relevant electorate and deliberation between elected representatives. We are told that when decisions are made in our local area, the priorities, principles and rules of the area and the development plans matter. They are meant to inform, in large part, the planning decisions that can be made. It is our view that to contravene them undermines the democratic planning process. We ask that the Minister consider this deletion in order to uphold the planning process and democratic participation within it. Similarly, amendment No. 41 seeks to narrow the circumstances in which An Bord Pleanála may materially contravene a local area or development plan. As drafted, the section provides that the board may do so if a proposed scheme or road should be approved having regard to "any relevant policy" of "any Minister of the Government". It is our assertion that this is not in the public interest and is open to abuse by future Governments. The amendment seeks to replace the term "any Minister of the Government" with an explicit reference to the Minister for Transport and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications. While we are of the view that policy decisions of a particular Government should, in and of themselves, not be put forward as a rationale for the contravention of democratically informed local area or development plans, we have proposed a modest amendment that would take account of the policies of relevant Departments, given their specific, relevant remit and their expertise in matters related to transport and transport-related development. Like amendments Nos. 40 and 41, amendment No. 42 seeks to limit the circumstances wherein An Bord Pleanála could contravene local area or development plans. The subsection, as drafted, provides that the board may contravene these plans having regard to the "pattern of development" in an area in the time since the plan was developed. As drafted, we fear the subsection is open to abuse and could see the wide-scale contravention of local area and development plans. Such plans are integral to the democratic planning process. They are updated on a regular basis to take account of changes within local areas and within the understanding and perspectives of an electorate and elected representatives. An Bord Pleanála should not have carte blanche to precipitate these changes, as we fear would be the case should this amendment or a suitable alternative not be incorporated into the Bill.

In section 44, we are allowing An Bord Pleanála, in certain limited circumstances, to approve a scheme or road development that contravenes materially a development plan or local development plan. The first criterion under which the board will be allowed to do this is where the proposal is of strategic regional or national importance. We are bringing in these measures because they are essential to progressing the BusConnects projects. Amendment No. 40 would remove the key criterion of strategic regional or national importance. Amendment No. 42 would remove the criterion of having regard to the pattern of development and to planning permissions granted since the making of the local area plan. This would mean that changing local circumstances could not be taken into account any more than could wider national circumstances. In effect, these proposals would make measures in the Bill toothless and risk holding up vital national infrastructure. I appreciate there is always a concern in the matter of planning to balance local and national interests. In the current situation, however, it is clear that balance is not being struck correctly. If we are to be able to deal with major issues such as the need to improve our public transport network, we need planning laws that allow us to do so. The provision allows that the board shall approve proposals if it considers that the criteria set out are met. It still has the final word but we are allowing it more options in order to balance national and local interests. Amendment No. 41, in proposing to replace the wording "any Minister of the Government" and limiting the application of the provision to two particular Ministers, would limit possible future developments that might have a real imperative for national and strategic reasons but are outside the remit of the Ministers named in the amendment. If we want to capture the concept of national and strategic importance, as we do, this is something that could at different times come under the remit of different Ministers. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. I would appreciate if the Senator would consider withdrawing amendments Nos. 40 to 42, inclusive.

The amendments strengthen the provisions around how the Minister regulates the use of cameras and data from the cameras. The amendment proposes that the Minister "shall" rather than "may" make regulations. As I have outlined in regard to previous amendments, the safeguards around use of surveillance in the Bill are not strong enough. It is not acceptable to create open-ended powers for authorities to use any data-gathering technology they wish and then say the Minister might make some regulations about that. If we are not going to insert safeguards in the primary legislation, we must, at the very least, ensure the Minister is compelled to regulate for safety.

As we know, large scale infrastructure projects and road development can often necessitate the removal and destruction of trees and hedgerows. This amendment would permit the Dublin Transport Authority to acquire land to protect and preserve semi-mature trees and hedgerows, taking particular account of those that are more than 20 years old. Mature trees and hedgerows play a critical role in carbon sequestration and the promotion of biodiversity. It is important that we provide specific protection for them in legislation. This amendment would achieve this by providing that the authority could purchase land or acquire land by CPO to preserve mature trees and hedgerows. We acknowledge that this might not be the most appropriate placement of this amendment given that the relevant sections relate exclusively to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008. However, we would welcome engagement with the Minister and his officials regarding how the protection and preservation of mature trees and hedgerows can be ensured when large-scale infrastructure and road development is occurring. Amendment No. 62 is a simple amendment which seeks to include specific protection for local amenities which are affected by the impact of the development of public transport infrastructure under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008. This section currently provides that the authority could take any measure required to mitigate the impact of public transport infrastructure on a site, building or structure. However, we feel it is important to include specific reference to local amenities, given the important role they play within communities in terms of social infrastructure in Dublin. Amendment No. 63 seeks to protect the public realm when it is affected by the impact of the development of public transport infrastructure under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008. The section currently does not make any specific reference to the public realm despite the fact that large scale public transport infrastructure development regularly impacts on the availability, functionality and quality of the public realm in Dublin. This amendment would correct what we feel is an important omission and would ensure that where there is an impact on the public realm in the development of transport infrastructure, the authority could take action to mitigate the effects so that the public realm remains accessible, functional and of good quality. Amendment No. 64 seeks to include specific protection for accessible parking where public transport infrastructure is being developed within the remit of the Dublin Transport Authority. If we are to reduce the number of cars on our roads we will need to disincentivise car use in our towns and cities. Reducing the availability of public parking will be an important tool in achieving this. However, we must ensure that accessible parking is maintained in tandem to ensure our villages, towns and cities remain accessible for persons with a disability.

Sometimes trees cause a hazard. My issue is that in many instances the first option is to cut them down. That is a huge part of the problem. Senator Ruane may agree with me when I suggest that cutting trees down should be the last resort. Trimming and lopping can be done by good tree surgeons. This might be a potential amendment to appease the Senator and me; we will now have biodiversity officers in every county in Ireland thanks to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan. We need to rethink how we manage our hedgerows and our trees because too often, butchery happens. Cutting the tree down is quick and gets it out of the way. However, we really need to look at the possibilities of just trimming or lopping instead. By doing so we would not have as big an issue. Even if the trees are only 20 years old and they are a potential hazard we need to manage them but it does not mean that we need to cut them all down. I often get phone calls from people asking why so many trees are being cut down. Hedge cutters are doing their job but some of them cut down all the trees while others trim them. This is something that we will bring to Report Stage and I will work on the issue, which may appease Senator Ruane's concerns.

In my experience, where schemes have been put in place in Waterford, while it may have necessitated the moving of disabled parking spaces, they have always been replaced as closely as possible to where they were originally. That can probably be achieved by regulation or by issue of a circular in that regard, if necessary. In my experience, local authorities have always been to the fore in providing parking for people with disabilities and that is how it should be.

I have personal experience of not just disabled parking but parking in general where local authorities have allowed people to go in and cut down 200 or 300 year old trees to create a car park. In one instance, they did not really need to cut down the tree. It could have been left at the side because cutting it down did not provide any more car parking spaces anyway. There seems to be this idea of gutting and clear felling. It is no longer acceptable to think that we can cut things down that take hundreds of years to grow. It is good that we are having this debate but I feel that the local authorities need stronger proscriptions regarding what they can do and will allow to be done. We have a planning application at the moment for a nursing home, which is badly needed in Ennis, but where it is to be located will require the felling of many mature trees. I cannot find any way to stop them doing it. The local authority does not seem to have taken the matter into consideration. We know there is a climate and biodiversity emergency. We can no longer allow local authorities or private design in ways that do not avoid, where possible, the destruction of our natural habitats.

For instance, usual mitigation measures for which lands are compulsorily required of which has been accepted and for which there is very little legal debate include items such as new access arrangements, lands for noise mitigation or landscaping and such other mitigation measures. However, the type of mitigation measures envisaged on Busconnects are not the usual type of measure.For instance, replacement car parking is location-specific and so it is unlikely there will be suitable lands available on the open market at the required location. Therefore, the power to acquire such lands compulsorily is necessary. The provision makes specific reference to the power to compulsorily acquire land for any mitigation whatsoever, rather than including specific details. The inclusion of the wording in amendments Nos. 62 and 63 will not add, in my mind, to the Bill, and are potentially confusing. In the case of amendment No. 64, it would actually limit parking to disabled parking only, which would limit the mitigation measures envisaged in delivering the BusConnects project. In that regard, I am afraid I cannot accept the amendments and would prefer if the Senators would withdraw them.

The majority of these amendments are about language and the intention of language. Amendment No. 65 seeks to delete the word "desirable" and substitute "necessary". As it currently reads, the Bill states: "The National Roads Authority may provide in respect of national managed roads such information signs and warning signs as it considers desirable." It does not seem to be the most appropriate language to use. Really it should read "information signs and warning signs as it considers necessary". Again, the word "desirable" is used in section 50(d). We are seeking to delete "desirable" and substitute "necessary". Amendment No. 67 seeks to insert the phrase "or mobility" after the word "safety" on page 60, line 1 of the Bill. Amendment No. 68 seeks to insert the phrase ", or which causes a nuisance to road users, especially vulnerable road users, in terms of accessibility and legibility" after the word "users". Amendment No. 69 seeks to insert the phrase, "Where a regulatory sign is removed from a national managed road, the relevant local authority shall be notified of the removal." Again, it is about ensuring extra safety measures are provided. Amendment No. 70 seeks to insert the phrase "Where a private individual removes or significantly alters a hedgerow, or other established growth in the vicinity of a national managed road, the relevant local authority shall be notified." It is about safety and information. Considering what Senator Garvey said earlier about people butchering the hedgerows and trees in the vicinity, the local authority should be notified of such removal. That is it. Apologies if that is not very clear, but I am trying to read the amendments as I am reading the Bill. 
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	187	In section 50 of the Bill, we are providing a number of amendments to section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, which deals with provision of road signage. The principal aim here is to ensure the necessary powers for the TII to deal with signage on a new class of what will be called national managed roads. The only such road intended for now is the M50. What the Bill does is that it separates out existing powers for provision of signage from those being given to TII - still referred to, Senators may wish to note, as the National Roads Authority, NRA, in law. Amendments Nos. 65 and 66 propose to replace references to signs which are "desirable" with signs which are "necessary". I understand the Senators’ wish to limit the signs which can be provided to those strictly necessary. However, the word "desirable" is the word already used in section 95 in relation to signage put up by road authorities. It would be odd if we put a tighter restriction on signage provision where a road was under TII management than where a local authority was in charge. The term "necessary" would place an unreasonable limit on signage provision by TII as opposed to local authorities, and therefore I cannot accept amendments Nos. 65 and 66. The position is similar with amendments Nos. 67 and 68. The Bill will amend section 95 of the 1961 Act to allow for TII to provide signage on national management roads in the same way that a road authority does on roads within its ambit. Section 95 provides for the removal of signage where the Garda Commissioner has requested the removal on the grounds of the safety of road users, and in the Bill we are replicating this provision in respect of TII removing signage. Amendment No. 67, which proposes to add removal where the signage interferes with the mobility, as well as the safety, of road users would place a different standard under section 95 for TII signage as opposed to road authority signage. Amendment No. 68 would likewise add conditions to TII signs that do not apply to road authority signs. I believe the two should remain the same basis, which is what we have proposed in the Bill. Amendment No. 69 would require notification to the relevant local authority where TII removed a regulatory sign from a national managed road. I do not see the value in this. The road will be under the management of TII, which will be providing the signage. I do not think we need to create a requirement to notify the local authority, which is not managing the road.  Finally, with regard to amendment No. 70, which would insert into section 95 of the 1961 Act – which deals with signage, let us remember - a requirement that "Where a private individual removes or significantly alters a hedgerow, or other established growth in the vicinity of a national managed road, the relevant local authority shall be notified." I am very much in favour of protecting the natural environment. However, I do not see how this can possibly belong in a section of the law on signage. In any case, the proposed amendment does not say who is obliged to do the informing. In effect, no one would be. I therefore request that this amendment, and also amendments Nos. 65 to 69, inclusive, be withdrawn.

I meant to raise it when we were discussing hedgerows and trees. With regard to An Bord Pleanála, for the record I want to make sure that it is very clear that we should only be acquiring land in instances where it is needed for BusConnects or active travel. We must ensure that it is not going to increase carbon emissions. Otherwise, we are going against the climate action plan. I want that to be on the record of the House. I will seek to bring an amendment on Report Stage. It is important that we acquire land to progress our modal shift and to reach our huge target of halving the carbon emissions from transport. Cutting trees is one part of it, of course. It is also important that we are only acquiring land to reduce our carbon emissions and not to increase car use. As Sarah McInerney - who has not always seen eye to eye with me - said on RTÉ radio last night, if you build for cars, you get cars. If you build it, they will come. Let us be careful about how we use our acquisition and ensure that we continue to focus on not contributing to carbon emissions.

The first relates to State-owned vehicles. State-owned vehicles are exempt from motor tax, and almost 6,000 vehicles are exempt in this way by virtue of being State-owned. Over half of these are Garda vehicles. There are also a significant number of vehicles owned by the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, the Office of Public Works, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, under the auspices of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport. The exemption also applies to a small number of vehicles held by State agencies. I understand, based on legal advice, that it is prudent to amend the legislation to provide a modernised basis for this exemption. I am therefore proposing to amend the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 to add State-owned vehicles to the list of exemptions from motor tax provided under section 1 of that Act, and also to allow for the exemption to be extended to vehicles owned by such State agencies as may be prescribed in regulations, having regard to the level to which they are funded by the State. The second matter dealt with in this amendment is the amendment of Part I of the Schedule to the 1952 Act to remove the word “large” from the reference to a public service vehicle. In the early 1990s, a concessionary rate of motor tax was introduced for school buses. In order to qualify for the concession, which carries an annual rate of tax of €95, a vehicle must be a large public service vehicle within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act 1961, that is, it must have more than eight seats, excluding the driver’s seat, and must be used exclusively for school transport or for transport to and from school-related physical education activities. The vehicle must either be licensed under article 60 of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 1963 or be owned by a statutory transport undertaking. In the former case, it is usually referred to as an Article 60 licence. An Article 60 licence is issued by An Garda Síochána where it is deemed that there is a need for the provision of a school transport service. Over the years, the owners of some passenger vehicles with eight seats or fewer have been issued with an Article 60 licence. These are vehicles used particularly in remote rural areas where transport is not always easy to obtain. As they have an Article 60 licence, these vehicles have traditionally been given the concessionary tax rate. However, it has come to our attention that this is not strictly correct, given that the vehicles are not large public service vehicles. This has sometimes resulted in operators being charged motor tax at private rates, which can go up to €2,400 annually. I understand that this is causing financial hardship and may impact on the continued provision of such services. The result would be a loss of service in some areas, particularly rural areas, where alternatives are not readily available.  I am, therefore, proposing to delete the word "large" in the appropriate place, so that the services in question which use smaller vehicles will be able to benefit from the exemption. In the interim, my Department has issued a circular to all authorities advising that the rate can continue to be given to these vehicles, pending a legislative amendment being put in place.

It is important that the research from ZEVI is not just about e-cars. I may consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage. We should also research car-sharing of e-cars, not just sales. GoCar is working very well. I hope research expands into that area, and the fact that there is a big difference between a small Renault Zoe in terms of weight, cost, pollution and space, compared with a large electric SUV. It is not all about getting everyone out of cars which run on fossil fuels into e-cars. As we well know, there is a huge challenge in terms of access to space for children and people who would like to walk and cycle safely. I hope the Minister could assure me that the research will not just be about how we get everybody switching from petrol and diesel to e-cars. If every car on the road in Ireland is changed from an e-car rather than one which runs on petrol or diesel, that will not solve any of the issues around space for our children to walk and cycle. We do not see the same level of research available for active travel, for instance. It is great to have ZEVI research on cars, but who will do research on active travel ? The NTA, local authorities, TII, the NRA and many State agencies deal with cars, but it is not the job of any one group to examine space.  ZEVI has a very clear remit to examine e-cars. I would like some assurance, through an amendment or otherwise, that there is a focus on modal shift, that is, getting people out of cars and using public transport and bikes and walking. I do not trust the current State agencies and local authorities as a collective to do that. It is everybody's job and it is nobody's job. That is my major concern. There is no co-ordinated office for research and development for active and public transport. Transport researchers in technical universities do not have the same resources as ZEVI. We need to look to that and consider having proper researchers that are not biased because an agency has hired them to find a certain result. We need proper research, through universities, that is unbiased and promoted in the same manner in which we are doing now, that is, through legislation for ZEVI and e-cars.

His presence to address this critical Private Members' motion speaks volumes of his commitment to this issue. It is a critical for us in the mid-west. For some years people in the mid-west have suffered considerably as a result of the overcrowding in the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick. It is very appropriate for Fine Gael to use its Private Members' time to highlight the challenges and difficulties faced by people throughout the mid-west at the accident and emergency department but also to look to the future and identify what needs to be done. In many ways it is a campaigning motion. The Minister is fully aware of the issues and challenges. He has visited the emergency department on a number of occasions. He has seen the positives but has also seen the negatives. The motion acknowledges the apology by management at University Hospital Limerick for the experience people have faced at the accident and emergency department, not just in recent weeks but for some years. That apology is important. It states a lot. It states that people understand the trauma, difficulties, challenges and stress that people face. This evening's debate is about solutions. There are a number of very clear solutions to the problem. No instantaneous solution would resolve the problem outside capacity building, but a number of things can be done. The first thing that the motion proposes is that the Minister would seriously and genuinely reconsider providing an elective hospital for the mid-west. While we very much welcome the three elective hospitals announced for Cork, Galway and Dublin, we believe because of the problems with lack of capacity, the mid-west should have been one of the regions for an elective hospital to be located. That said, I believe a fourth elective hospital would be appropriate. We do not want to take an elective hospital from any of the three locations identified, but we believe that the Government should consider Limerick for an elective hospital. We also feel very strongly about the need for the second and third 96-bed units that have been discussed and identified as a priority. The Minister and the Taoiseach very kindly engaged with both Opposition and Government Oireachtas Members from the mid-west about three weeks ago. During that discussion everybody agreed that there was a serious lack of capacity in University Hospital Limerick. The way to address that is by building capacity. We very much welcome the beginning of construction of the 96-bed unit that is under way at the moment. I hope it will be delivered on time - whatever about within budget. We want the UL Hospitals Group to submit its plans for a second and third 96-bed block. Once those plans have been submitted to the Government, it needs to be turned around in a matter of weeks. By the end of quarter 2 or quarter 3 or certainly by the end of 2023, there should be a Government commitment to the second and third 96-bed blocks. Everybody agrees that capacity is an issue. If capacity is an issue, let us deal with it and let us have a Government commitment that funding will not be a problem and that it will be delivered as quickly as possible. The third element of the motion that we feel very strongly about is the surgical unit, which has received Cabinet approval.I thank the Minister for his ongoing commitment, particularly in the provision of a surgical unit. He has seen the benefit of the surgical unit in Tallaght University Hospital and that it has alleviated significant pressure on the hospital's emergency department, ED. We believe the same will happen in Limerick but we want the surgical unit built as a matter of urgency. Whatever needs to be done to deliver that as quickly as possible needs to happen. This motion articulates and supports that position. The fourth thing we want to see happen relates to Shannondoc. We believe Shannondoc should be located on the grounds of UHL simply because 50% of presentations at UHL are not referrals. They are people who turn up because they cannot access a GP in time and panic. They are not blue-lighted nor are they referred. On that basis, we want Shannondoc located on the grounds of UHL so that non-referrals that come to the hospital can be redirected to Shannondoc. In such a scenario, if it is identified they need to attend the accident and emergency department, they can be facilitated with a referral letter and, if not, they can be dealt with by Shannondoc. These are four proposals we in Fine Gael believe will deal incrementally with the situation at the ED in Limerick. They are not a panacea that will solve all the problems but taking those four steps would be a significant move forward in that regard. Overall, the reconfiguration that took place in 2009 put the cart before the horse. The facilities had not been equipped or developed before the reconfiguration happened. Had the facilities been in place, we probably would not be here discussing this issue now, but that is history. What we must deal with now is how we move forward. This motion is important and it is important we discuss it in the Seanad. I sincerely hope it receives all-party support because it is critically important to the people of Clare, Kerry, Limerick and north Tipperary. I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has come to the Chamber to address this motion, which speaks volumes.

I thank the Minister for coming here to address this all-important motion. I acknowledge the amount of investment - up to €98 million over recent years - put into the University Limerick Hospitals Group. While many parts of the hospital are working, there are parts that are not. I know the Minister is well aware of this and that he has visited the hospital. I acknowledge, as did Senator Conway, that when the management of UHL came before the Committee on Health, they apologised to people - the staff, the people who have visited the hospital, patients and their families - and that must be acknowledged. As Senator Conway outlined, this has been going on for an awfully long time. I come from Limerick city, which is the third largest city. We have the main hospital and the level 2 hospitals - St John's Hospital, and Nenagh and Ennis hospitals. Croom Hospital is also part of the UL Hospitals Group. I know protocols have been put in place recently and that Mallow hospital has been used. There have been enhancements at Ennis Hospital. I understand some of the protocols put in place at Ennis have helped in the reduction of trolley numbers at UHL. However, as the third largest city, we deserve better than what is going on in terms of delivery to the people of the mid-west. Senator Conway spoke about the elective hospital but we also need, in addition to the accident and emergency unit, an enhanced trauma ward and an enhanced minor injuries unit so that when people attend the emergency department who do not necessarily need to be there, they can be treated and looked after in the enhanced unit. The Government recently sanctioned the elective clinics, which is an issue I have raised with the Minister before. That needs to be accelerated, as does the delivery of the 98-bed blocks. We also need to see staff being recruited along with this because there is no point in building units if-----

While I acknowledge the number has come down, we are still at the top of the list. We have the top med-tech and biopharma companies. We have a lot of companies that are relocating. I was at the launch of the rebranding of Legato as one of the top and fastest growing healthcare companies.Many companies are locating operations in the mid-west. A large number of them are doing so because they are involved in the area of healthcare, which is top of the agenda. In the context of primary, secondary and tertiary care, we need our health authority restored to the city of Limerick as a matter of urgency. We need a full trauma centre, which should be based at UHL, as well as the accident and emergency unit. We need full capacity in the oncology centre. We need to be top in terms of the cancer care strategy because the oncology unit, which is a fantastic unit under the UL Hospitals Group, needs to be a leading centre, especially in light of the number of experts based there. Those experts need departments at St. John's, Ennis and Nenagh. I read the consultants' letter. While they say it would not be efficient to restore full accident and emergency units, better use needs to be made of those hospitals. We need to look at those hospitals to see how we can deliver better services to the people of Limerick, Ennis, Tipperary, Kerry and the mid-west in general. Limerick needs to be chosen as a centre for major healthcare resources and initiatives. This would tie in with the research between those healthcare companies that are on our doorstep and the expertise in the hospital. I read the letter from the 87 consultants. They are extremely concerned. At the weekend, 11,000 people marched through the streets of Limerick. This shows that people are very worried about the future of the hospital. To go back to our asks, we need the provision of the 96-bed blocks and the elective clinics to be accelerated. We cannot wait for this to happen in two or three years. We need to find a building, kit it out and start carrying out these procedures. Many people had their appointments cancelled in the recent months because the accident and emergency department was overcrowded and it was a case of all hands on deck. We have four asks. If the Government supports those asks and takes action in respect of them as soon as possible, we will see a fully restored healthcare system that people are not afraid to use. My big fear is that people are staying at home because they are afraid to go to hospital. I pay tribute to the staff. They have worked in very difficult circumstances. When the emergency was called on 4 January, people came in from home and put their shoulders to the wheel. We have to keep that going forward. The Government needs to be seen to support the people of the mid-west and to show leadership. The Minister put the crisis management team into the hospital, but we need to see delivery going forward.

It is the first time he has heard them, but it is good that he is here. It is always important that we are courteous and respectful to Ministers. The Minister is part of a tripartite coalition Government made up of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. These are not new issues for any of these parties involved. I presume they have been discussed by those parties at length. None of this should be a surprise. I thank Senators Conway and Maria Byrne and their party colleagues for bringing this issue to our attention. It is always important that we shine a light on matters of this nature. I am conscious of the arithmetic in this House and the vast numbers on the Government side. One of the real challenges for parliamentary democracy is that the Opposition is so small and the vast number of Members on the other side have collaborated on everything. They have power but they also have responsibility. They have to shoulder that responsibility in the context of things that do not go well as much as they do when it comes to things that do go well. That is an important point. When they have such power collectively within Parliament, it is right that they should be questioned. All we have available to us is that we can shine a light on an issue. At the outset, I thank the those who put this important motion together. As Senator Maria Byrne rightly stated, let us cut to the chase. There are four asks here. I am of the view that the Minister, everybody in government and those on all sides of the House want to see these implemented. However, there is the reality of how they are going to be implemented in a timely manner, and how they are going to be implemented in accordance with the wishes of the medical practitioners, all of the hospital staff and the management structures that are in place, and to the satisfaction of patients and their families, which is an ongoing challenge. The other issue is resources. This is not a blame game. We all know what the problem is. We need to assess, in a positive way, how we are going to get out of the mess at UHL, and we need to look at hospitals that are somehow outperforming others. We need to compare like with like, although I acknowledge that no two hospitals are the same. I thank the 87 consultants who highlighted this matter in The Irish Times. The story also appeared in other newspapers. Today, I received a back issue of the Limerick Post from a member of Fine Gael in the west who said that he knew this was coming up and that I might have a look at it. The article in that newspaper was more or less about the same letter,. However, I thought it was interesting to look at the local angle taken in the Limerick Post, a publication with which I am not familiar. What the consultants said was extremely concerning. We all have to be worried about it, particularly in the context of issues relating to overcrowding and the relentless demands on services for many years. Much of this involves having adequate resources, and that is where the Government comes in. I am sometimes amazed, in my observations of the Dáil and Seanad, at how Government Members come into the Houses and are highly critical of something, and rightly so. However, they are in government; they have got to get solutions and they have to work together. It is too easy to hang the Minister or somebody else out to dry. They are in government. As stated, it is a tripartite coalition Government. They have to take the good with the bad, put their shoulder to the wheel and lead. We are called upon as politicians to be responsible and to lead. I want to touch on a few points, in particular the issue of care, dignity and respect for the patient. People are vulnerable. It is unacceptable that people have to wait days and days on trolleys. We are hearing stories from Ennistymon and other hospitals. The Limerick Post reports people sitting on trolleys for three to four days. I am aware of the case of a woman whose daughter, who is 19 or 20, was admitted to the hospital in Ennistymon with heavy bleeding and gynaecological problems. She was not offered the opportunity to wash or take a bath for four days. That is the reality. The woman and her daughter spoke to me this morning and asked me to raise the matter here. They thought I might be embarrassed and would not want to do so. Why would I be embarrassed? Four days on a trolley and she was not provided with washing facilities or supports. That is clearly not satisfactory. I could go on with a litany of issues. The reality is that the consultants involved have highlighted the issue. They have put pen to paper and they have said there are grievances, shortages and issues. However, there is a bit of hope. The consultants' letter states:The recent Deloitte report clearly outlines the disparity in support and resourcing. We welcome the recent engagement of the Taoiseach and Minister for Health and their acknowledgement that UL Hospitals group require specific support to build additional bed capacity to serve the demographic demands.It is positive that they welcome and are open to engagement. They want dialogue, they want to get on with it and they want to do what they are trained to do, which is to provide these services. The letter also states that they are “calling on the Minister for Health to bring this about through engagement with the clinical stakeholders and allocation of adequate resources.” That is it. That is the gist what my colleagues are saying. I support them. I look forward to discovering how we might do it. The real focus in these four asks is whether the Minister has the resources to act on them in the short, medium and long term. How does he propose to get the resources? Can he expedite his vision, his plan and his commitment? What positive messages can he send out, not just to these consultants, who are only part of the picture, but also to the people in the region and the patients? How are we going to move matters on and fix the problem?I thank the Minister and I thank the proposers of this Private Members' business.

So the number is running at more than twice the level of the next nearest hospital and three or four times the level of most other hospitals. The Minister will know that 12 years ago Enda Kenny declared, "I'll end the [scourge] of patients on hospital trolleys". That promise was posted all across the country. It was a key electoral promise that went a long way to securing two seats for Fine Gael in Limerick City. In 2011 - Fine Gael's first year in power - there were 3,500 patients on hospital trolleys in UHL. Last year - 11 years later - 18,000 patients were on trolleys in UHL. So during Fine Gael's 11 years in government the number of patients on hospital trolleys had multiplied by five times. That is its record. You would think that there would be some acknowledgement of these facts somewhere in this Fine Gael motion, especially as 11,000 people came out on to the streets of Limerick a week ago but no. In a truly surreal move, the motion barely references the crisis. There are 946 words in this motion and you have to read down as far as the 774th word before there is a reference to "the serious difficulties experienced over the last couple of months." Crucially, the motion in no way explains how we got to this point of crisis. Thankfully, 87 doctors who work in UHL were kind enough to publish a letter reminding us of how we got here and it states:The origins of this ongoing crisis date back to the poorly resourced reconfiguration of hospital services in the midwest in 2009. The 640 beds to support this were never delivered.That is a fact that needs to be said and acknowledged by both Fine Gael and its sister party, Fianna Fáil, that implemented the disastrous reconfiguration. The result of that reconfiguration cannot just be seen in the HIQA and Deloitte reports but as Mr. Ger Kennedy, who is a SIPTU representative who represents those workers in hospital told me today, it can be seen across the graveyards in the counties of Limerick, Clare and Tipperary because we know from medical research that was carried out in the UK that of the patients who spend more than eight hours in an emergency department on a trolley, one in 67 of them will die.

In fact, I am giving the facts that were supplied by the doctors who actually work in UHL and who refer to "the chronic under resourcing of the region". To be frank, what I am seeing here this evening is Government politicians pretending to be in opposition when Senator Conway and Senator Maria Byrne voted for each and every budget for the last number of years in this Chamber, and each one of those budgets resulted in "the chronic under resourcing", to use the words of the doctors in UHL. Those are the facts of the matter. In terms of dealing with the crisis as it is today, I have a few points to make to the Minister. Shannondoc collapsed at Christmas, which he knows. I appreciate that he arranged a meeting for us after Christmas but when I asked a simple question about how many missed calls were not picked up, its manager could not tell me. Shannondoc does not even count the amount of missed calls in an essential service. How can that be? The number of healthcare assistants who were allocated to the emergency department was 26.6 in 2017 when it was due to deal with 170 patients a day, which has since gone up to 250 patients a day. Does anyone want to hazard a guess at how many additional healthcare assistants were allocated by management? It is a round figure; it is zero. Can the Minister explain that to me?

How does that make sense? The Minister might explain why doctors who published previous letters said, themselves, that a witch hunt was conducted by the management team, not to deal with the issue that these doctors raised, but to find out who publicised the issues. I wish to make clear that I have no confidence in the senior management team in UHL and I believe that the Minister has a duty to act in that regard. On the future configuration, I cannot believe that after two and half years in government, the Minister cannot tell us definitively whether we need an elective or model 3 hospital. The motion states: "to accelerate the start date of the new surgical clinic", but the Minister does not have a date for the surgical hub. So, in two and half years, we have seen further failures.  I ask the Acting Chairperson for more time on account of the long interruption, and I think my request is only reasonable.

We have had 11 years of Fine Gael failures and their pretending to be in opposition is not going to save them. The people of Limerick are outraged by what has happened UHL.

As the Minister knows, this matter is the biggest issue in the region of counties Clare, Limerick and Tipperary. It has been the biggest issue for the last couple of months. I listened to what was said by Senator Boyhan. He was very critical of previous Governments so he must have forgotten that he was a member of a political party where the leader of that party was the Minister for Health in a Government the Senator has criticised. We, as a Government, have massively invested in health over the last number of years. There has been no shortage of investment in health by this Government or previous Governments involving Fine Gael. We have seen success in the health service and other parts of the health service in other areas of the country. Trolley numbers have been an ongoing issue in UHL and we hear about it every winter. The Minister has put forward a winter plan and plans are in place for when there is a surge but it always seems to be the case that Limerick has the highest trolley numbers.While we have invested in hospitals - we have had big investment in Nenagh and a 40-bed modular unit built in my town, Clonmel - the part the people cannot understand is how a 40-bed modular unit can be built in Clonmel and the trolley numbers there come down after it has been built whereas 60 beds are provided in UHL and the trolley numbers there are still going up. The people I speak to in Tipperary, Limerick and Clare cannot understand that. That is not the Minister's fault or the Government's fault. We are putting in more beds and in one hospital it is working and in another it is not. We need to be honest about why it is working in one place and not in the other. It is as simple as that. It is not complicated. These are not simplistic and populist lines that it is completely the Minister's fault and so on. It works in my home town, Clonmel, but it is not working in the whole of the Limerick region. Management needs to step up in that regard. I thank the Minister for the meeting we had. A couple of weeks ago we had a meeting to which he invited all public representatives and Oireachtas Members from all parties, and the Taoiseach came in on it, to have an open, frank discussion. The Minister was there with the management staff from UHL. It was a long meeting and was very frank, and it needed to be. The Minister will know that I brought up in my contribution the fact that HIQA did a report on UHL a year and a half ago and it was very critical of the management of UHL. I got a response two weeks ago from the CEO of UHL to questions I asked. I asked her what her view was on the HIQA report, if she had made any changes on the back of the report and what she had done about the criticism of the management within UHL. Her response was that the inspectors came on a bad day. That is utterly unacceptable as a response. What sort of confidence does it give the people in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary when the head of the hospital says the reason a critical report was done was just that the inspectors came on a bad day? It is just not acceptable. Other people can stand up here and say it is the Government's fault, the Cabinet's fault or the Minister's fault. There is a management issue if people cannot answer a simple question about a report that was done a year and a half ago. They have not prepared even a genuine bluff answer; it was just that they came on a bad day. This is a massive issue for us in the region. That is why this motion has been tabled. People need the confidence they can go to a hospital and get the care they deserve. People in Clare, Limerick and Tipperary have made decisions not to go to a hospital simply because they believe it is in their best interests for their health not to go to a hospital. That is a crazy situation to be in. I will make one last point. It seems the opening of Ennis Hospital to the ambulance service carrying out triage and sending patients to Ennis Hospital rather than University Limerick Hospital has been quite successful. The Minister might be able to answer this in his contribution. I know they are assessing that and will make a decision on the back of that, but Nenagh hospital needs to be opened up for that too. I believe that would relieve some of the pressure, certainly for that area of north Tipperary. I thank my colleagues for tabling the motion and thank the Minister.

A lot of what I will cover has come from party colleagues of mine in Limerick or people I know in Limerick who have contacted me to discuss some of the issues they are concerned about. I also have correspondence from a student who got in touch. I ask the House to bear with me as I jump from one device to the other because the people contacted me in different ways. My colleague, Councillor Conor Sheehan, who is a Limerick city north representative, outlined to me why UHL is 50% more overcrowded than every other acute hospital. I spoke about this last week so I am sorry if we go over a similar topic again. Councillor Sheehan said he believes that this is primarily a matter of resourcing and that the hospital is underfunded and understaffed, with fewer beds per capita than the six other acute hospital groups. He said this has been highlighted over a number of years by many Members of both the Upper and the Lower Houses. My party colleague Deputy Alan Kelly has spent years talking about Nenagh, St. John's and Ennis hospitals and the impact this would have, and we are seeing the result of the closure of all these facilities now. There are figures suggesting UHL is possibly 50% more overcrowded than other hospitals. Many of us would probably agree that when St. John's Hospital, Nenagh General Hospital and Ennis Hospital were downgraded, UHL never got its fair share of resources to create the centre of excellence that was promised. That was demonstrated by Dr. Gerry Burke, who was the clinical director. I believe he met with all Oireachtas Members based in the mid-west in, I think, 2019. His research shows that five of the hospital groups had 25% more hospital doctors, 27% more consultants, 50% more health and social care professionals and 7% more nurses and midwives than UL Hospital Group and that ULHG needed 130 more doctors, 120 nurses and 200 health and social care staff to bring it up to the same level as the five other hospital groups. I know some work has been done since that meeting.

Those were the figures at the time. I think Dr. Burke said at the time that the hospital needed an additional €40 million a year. I do not know if the Minister has figures to hand as to how close the figure has gone to €40 million since 2019 or if it has gone over €40 million. My colleague, Councillor Sheehan, said he does not believe anything will change until the resourcing issue is dealt with and that it is important the Government, the HSE and the Department of Health officially accept there is a funding and staffing deficit at UHL. He has outlined that about €40 million over three years will be needed to tackle overcrowding and to bring ULHG up to the same standard as the other five hospital groups. Beaumont Hospital in Dublin serves a similar population and a similar catchment area, but the difference in the number of doctors, nurses and administration staff is remarkable and does not seem to make sense. I am speaking of only one Labour Party councillor in the area, but there is a whole Labour Party councillor team in Limerick. I do not want to forget the rest of my colleagues, all of whom have called for the opening hours-----

I should start ticking everyone off. All of them have called for the opening hours of Ennis and Nenagh hospitals and St. John's medical assessment unit to be extended from the current hours of 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. to divert more non-critical patients away from the emergency department in UHL. Friends of mine or people I know in Limerick have got in touch with me about other matters. This is not directly related to accident and emergency but I think it is related to UHL and other areas. One person highlighted that Limerick has no 24-hour sexual assault treatment unit and no Saturday unit, which means it can operate only when the other clinics are closed, which in turn means, in practice, that someone who has been sexually assaulted may have to wait 12 hours without eating, drinking, changing clothes or moving until the clinic opens. Someone got in touch to say they felt that was an issue in the region. Someone else got in touch to say the lack of community mental health services in the region is an enormous problem. What is there is predominantly psychiatry, waiting lists and short appointments. There is the length of time it takes medications to work and wild over-reliance on medications that are barely at placebo levels of efficiency, which have made what is there seem pointless to many people and exacerbated the crisis. The child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS are a disaster, as we know, and there is nowhere for a distressed person to go except into an accident and emergency department, which is obviously part of the issue in the region. This person also said the services are not equipped to deal with dual diagnoses - neither, to be fair, are a lot of the services - which is ridiculous and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Addiction is a symptom of distress. There is a severe need for holistic services all under one roof in the community. There are waiting lists in the order of months or a year for anything at the moment. Another person got in touch to say people need proper community care alternatives to hospital emergency departments. There has to be a stronger co-ordination between community care facilities and hospitals to ensure step-down beds - we spoke about this last week and have spoken about it many times - are available in the community for speedy discharges and to ensure home help is readily available for people. A recently qualified doctor in the region got in touch with me to say she knows people are not coming into UHL accident and emergency department when they need to do so because of fear. She knows that is costing lives, and that is heartbreaking.

I am speaking in support of my colleagues regarding what has turned out to be an extremely serious issue. It has been highlighted by the Senators from Tipperary, Clare and Limerick. Whatever has to be done should be to be done in order to address it. If I might digress for a moment, I wish to put a number of issues relating to my area on the record. Longford does not have a general hospital. The main general hospital that serves the people of Longford is located in Mullingar, where excellent care is provided. We do have St. Joseph's campus, however, a facility with which the Minister will be familiar. Among the issues I wish to highlight is the fact that until recently there was only one palliative care bed on St. Joseph's campus. I have raised this matter on a number of occasions since I was elected. A second bed has been added while the development relating to the new configuration at the campus is taking place. However, the figures show that a greater need exists. We should not have a situation where there would not be a bed available to allow a person to pass away in their home area. A 20-bed unit is being developed in Tullamore, but I want additional bed space to be provided at St. Joseph's. There is an issue whereby MIDOC GP CLG went into administration just before Christmas. This issue was made known to the Minister recently. A new contract with the doctors has not been agreed. A temporary contract is in place, but we need to have a permanent contract sorted out immediately. I hear talk to the effect that it will hopefully be in place by the end of March. That is not acceptable. I am aware that the matter does not come fully within the Minister's remit. However, we need to progress the negotiations with the doctors and get the permanent contract in place in order to provide the people in my home county with certainty as to the fact that the service will be available. We had an issue a number of weeks ago where a locum was not available and people were referred to Mullingar to access MIDOC service there. I do not think that is acceptable. There is also the issue of the radiology department. We have a fantastic radiology department that needs to be upgraded. We should not have a situation where people go to Mullingar when we have the service available in our county. If we want to reduce the large number of patients in accident and emergency departments, we should upgrade the facilities that we have. I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to the Minister. Councillor Peggy Nolan, who the Minister knows well and who is a fantastic advocate for the hospital, and I would like him to come and meet us in order that we can show him the fantastic facility we could have if we got investment and additional resources.

We are having a very interesting debate about the UL Hospitals Group and where matters stand. The first line of the motion is really important. It is amazing that €24 billion is being spent on health. That is the core issue: we are now putting as much money as is required into the health service. I will speak openly about what we have in my part of the world. We have the best medium-sized hospital in the world , namely, Bantry General Hospital. The management of the hospital have worked on its potential in the past few years. There are 17 house doctors, six consultants and an overall staff of 300 at this hospital that is located in a remote area. The biggest factor that comes into play is confidence. When there is a bad story about Bantry, staff do not want to go there because they are of the view that it is being talked down. This is no longer about money; it is about trying to get staff into the system, building confidence and making sure that said confidence is built in order staff will follow the approach that has been adopted. Unfortunately, a really important aspect of this debate is that if people continue to talk down both the health service and the those on the front line and the work that they do, then staff will not come to a particular district or hospital. If we are talking about remote locations, we have to look at Bantry. It is what it is, but it is a fantastic location. We need to start talking up what is being done. Twenty four billion euro is an amazing amount of money to put into the health service. Capital development has come through. The unemployment rate has fallen below what was a 20-year record. We need people. The only way to attract people is to build confidence and start talking up what we have done. That is what we need to do. We are making the investment. We are going have a world-class health service in a matter of years. It takes time to build a service. If we continue to talk it down, unfortunately, people will not go into it.

I acknowledge my colleagues, Senators Conway, Byrne and Ahearn, for tabling this comprehensive Private Members' motion. It is unusual to have such a specific regional topic brought before the Houses. It is important to acknowledge that, because the Fine Gael group decided to use its slot, which comes up every number of weeks, to highlight a specific hospital in a specific region. It is also important to highlight the issues of concern in University Hospital Limerick and in Ennis and Nenagh, as Senator Conway has done in the Joint Committee on Health. It is a very important topic, which is why we are discussing it. It has generated a lot of publicity in recent months for the wrong reasons. I pity the staff, who work in difficult circumstances in all of our hospitals but particularly in hospitals that are under pressure and have been in the headlines in recent months, as Limerick has been. There are fluctuations at different times in different hospitals, but it is unusual for there to be such a prolonged period of problems as there has been in Limerick. It is unfair on both the staff and the patients and puts pressure on them. Unfortunately, I have even heard of people in Galway who have decided not to attend hospitals because they are listening to true stories about the pressure Limerick is under. That is a concern I have. The motion lays out the comprehensive investment that has taken place in Limerick over a number of years and in the associated hospitals in Ennis, Croom and Nenagh. It is important to acknowledge the investment that has taken place because there has been an accusation that members of Government voted for budgets. Certainly, in the case of Fine Gael, we have voted, since 2011, for budgets and capital plans that have allowed for investment, and that has to be acknowledged. However, there is a need for more beds and more capacity such as the 60-bed ward that was completed and opened. There is a need for additional investment, as highlighted. I note too the reference to the reconfiguration of the vacated emergency department. That was done in Galway and the additional ten beds have improved the situation there. Looking at that example and at other hospitals, the provision of small numbers of additional beds, where it can be done and they can be staffed safely, improves the situation. However, there is clearly a need for additional capacity and additional beds in Limerick, and I commend the Senators on their contributions. In the case of the Saolta hospital group, we can see the difficulties general and community hospitals and nursing homes have in finding staff. Despite international trawling, the last notice I received showed 13 empty beds in Áras Mhic Dara sa Cheathrú Rua. Tá fadhbanna ansin ó thaobh na ndeacrachtaí atá ann chun altraí a fháil don ospidéal agus don ionad sin agus sa Chlochán, áit a bhfuil easpa foirne freisin ó thaobh altraí. Tá spás, airgead agus leapacha ann ach nach bhfuil Feidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte in ann altraí a fháil. It is a staffing and recruitment difficulty in terms of being able to get nurses. For example in Clifden, County Galway, they put out a specific call for staff. There were a number of expressions of interest and a number of people called to interview.Five were offered jobs. One accepted a job offer but would not be available until 2024. That is one specific regional hospital in Galway. It goes to show the difficulties in recruiting. Once upon a time, it was the case in this country that there were no jobs. Now there are jobs available across a variety of sectors but it is difficult to recruit people. We need to continue looking out for international nurses to fill those vacancies because it is hugely important that they are filled. The situation has a knock-on effect on the emergency department and the discharge of patients. That knock-on effect puts emergency departments under pressure, of which we have seen many example. The HSE has stated that we must learn from both success and failure. Which hospitals have performed well this year? I know not all hospitals are the same, but which hospitals have performed well in recent months and what lessons can they give to other hospitals that are having difficulties? University Hospital Waterford has been mentioned as a successful example. What is the hospital doing that explains its success? Is it a management issue or a capacity issue? Why are other hospitals, such as University Hospital Limerick, falling down? I again commend my colleagues on bringing forward this motion.
#AislingDolan	unknown-#AislingDolan-party	unknown-#AislingDolan-dob	unknown-#AislingDolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-01 00:00:00	Gnó an tSeanaid - Business of Seanad	262	I welcome the Minister to the House to speak about the issue of emergency departments, which is crucial across many areas. I thank Senators Conway and Maria Byrne for bringing forward the motion. There is pressure on emergency departments. Senators have raised issues, particularly in respect of University Hospital Limerick. I want to speak specifically about the Saolta University Health Care Group area in CHO 2, which includes Portiuncula University Hospital, Roscommon University Hospital and University Hospital Galway. There are three issues, the first of which is capacity in our emergency departments, how space is used within hospitals and how hospitals are trying to manage. The second issue is the reduction in the number of nursing beds, the step-down facilities that hospitals can use when community intervention teams are coming to help people discharge. The third issue relates to GPs in the community. The Minister will be fully aware that the catchment area of Portiuncula University Hospital contains almost 400,000 people. It is based in east Galway but covers an enormous area. It is the hospital for Athlone, a town of more than 20,000 people. It also covers counties Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly and Tipperary, as well as Galway. It experienced its worst ever January for the number of patients on trolleys. The hospital, based in Ballinasloe, has close to 1,000 staff. I fought hard in 2019 to secure a meeting with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris. At that meeting, we were able to move forward a project of the senior clinical team in Portiuncula for a 50-bed ward block. Funding was allocated to move that project on to the next stage. The ward is now under construction. People in Portiuncula can see that the new ward is under construction, which is wonderful, but the process started back in 2019. It should have started five or six years earlier. The new ward is now under construction but the hospital does not have any additional beds right now. There are 13 single beds. Enormous pressure has been put on services. The hospital is converting the outpatient department to allow for eight single en-suite rooms. It will also have two additional rooms. Staff are trying to make these changes within the hospital but the hospital dates back to the 1940s and contains multi-bed wards and so on. One can only imagine the situation. There is, however, an amazing team there who have been striving for years to cope. The general manager and the senior clinical team at the hospital have now applied for ten additional bays in the emergency department. That submission has gone from Saolta on behalf of Portiuncula University Hospital to the Department. The Minister will be looking at the issue with the HSE and its new interim chief executive, Bernard Gloster. It is crucial that we consider capacity issues, modular construction or the building of some type of additional accommodation around emergency departments. There is enormous pressure here. The emergency department in Portiuncula University Hospital cannot cope with the pressure, which is the result of Covid-19, respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, and the other viruses that are circulating. The Minister will also be fully aware of the other challenge in my area, that is, our older population. It is a regional area. It does not have a large, city-centre, urban population. We are spread out and managing a more regional, sparse and widely dispersed population. The population is older and has different needs. The challenge is the reduction in the number of nursing home beds available in the Saolta area. I am sure the Minister is aware that we have lost nearly 150 nursing home beds. Small nursing homes in Roscommon and east Galway have closed. Areas such as Kiltormer and Dysart have been affected. These were small nursing homes and I understand there are issues in respect of their feasibility. I am asking for innovation around how we support nursing homes that have beds available as step-down facilities. We cannot lose more beds in an area that is struggling so much at the moment. We simply cannot lose more beds. Is there any type of co-operation model within smaller independent nursing homes? I know there are also larger corporate entities. I am asking about how we look at this. I urge the Minister to come up with some other solutions around nursing homes and how we access those beds. I also raise the issue of GPs. I thank the Minister. We worked hard with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on the issue before Christmas. We had meetings with GPs in our area and €436,000 was allocated, with the support of the Minister and the Government, to help GPs in that area. The money provided Westdoc facilities for GPs all around the Ballinasloe and south-east Galway area. We hope that will relieve the pressure on hospitals and emergency departments. It is crucial that the access to diagnostic services that has been provided for GPs under the winter service plan can be continued. There are phenomenal multidisciplinary teams in Roscommon University Hospital. The National Ambulance Service, as it has in Ennis hospital and University Hospital Limerick, is looking at how to identify patients on the basis of their level of need and considering whether Roscommon University Hospital can support those patients. It is important that there is a referral for these medical assessment units. The Mayo Roscommon Hospice Foundation is wonderful. The Minister attended its Roscommon palliative care unit in November 2021 and we had a wonderful launch. The facility is due to open shortly. The staff are being trained there in the coming weeks. There will be an additional eight beds. Staffing will come from Roscommon University Hospital to allow the hospice to operate. Like many other things, it has taken too long. I know there are many challenges involved, but we need access to those beds. It will be crucial for that to happen in the coming weeks. The staff will be trained and we need the facility to open shortly. I also ask that consideration be given to Sacred Heart Hospital and that 50-bed unit. It is all about capacity. I know that the brand-new chief executive of the HSE will be working hard to consider how to provide immediate capacity. To conclude, there is €24 billion in the budget. The Minister has a lot of support. There has been a 17,000-strong increase in staff. We have nearly 140,000 staff in the Minister's area. Three is so much we can do. We need to consider immediate access to additional and modular accommodation and the expansion of emergency departments.

This is a constructive motion. I have listened carefully to the ideas that have come forward in respect of what needs to be done. I share the concerns that have been raised about some aspects of urgent and emergency care in the mid-west. Those concerns do not only apply to the mid-west. There are concerns in Cork, Galway, parts of Dublin and Letterkenny. There are concerns around the country. However, we are talking specifically about the mid-west and University Hospital Limerick. I want to say clearly that having people on trolleys and waiting for ward beds for long periods after admission is unacceptable. The numbers in Limerick have been far too high, particularly in respect of those who are waiting for a long time and particularly when it comes to elderly people or patients who are more frail or sick. It is unacceptable. It is not something that our healthcare providers want. It is not something that anyone in the Oireachtas wants. I have visited University Hospital Limerick several times. I have been in the emergency department several times. I have met patients and their families. I have been in many emergency departments around the country because I wanted to see and hear first-hand what was happening, what was working and what was not working, and what was being experienced.What we are seeing in Ireland is being seen across Europe. We had three particularly bad days several weeks ago. Some of the high numbers over the winter are due in part to the unprecedented combination of Covid-19, flu and RSV, which is causing emergency department pressures, not only in Ireland but also in some of the best resourced and best-run healthcare systems in Europe. We need to be conscious of that context. However, regardless of the pressures this or any winter, it is simply unacceptable to see this number of patients waiting on trolleys for admission to hospital. It is not a new problem but it is a problem we must and can solve. I met with the emergency department, ED, task force earlier today and we discussed various ways this can be addressed, not as a winter issue but in terms of access to urgent and emergency care. Last summer the figures were far too high. As I said to the ED task force, my Department and the HSE, this is not about solving a winter problem. This is about ensuring we have an urgent and emergency care service that gets people the care they need throughout the year. We will do additional things in the winter when we are dealing with the extra pressures. Demand for care, including urgent and emergency care, is growing. We know that. While our public health service and governments have tried to respond to this for many years, there has been a deficit in capacity. Our public health providers have been trying to respond to growing demand without the toolkit or firepower they needed in terms of beds, diagnostics, workforce, community care and many other things. What are we doing about that? This Government is responding in a completely unprecedented way in fundamentally increasing the capacity of our public health services. We have added nearly 1,000 hospital beds, more than 360 community beds and 65 critical care beds, and we have increased the HSE's workforce by more than 17,000 people. That is thousands of additional nurses, doctors, dentists, healthcare assistants and many other healthcare providers. It is not enough. We are addressing deficits that have been building up over many years, but we are addressing them and we are doing so more quickly. We are building capacity in the system more quickly than it has ever been done. There is much talk about recruitment crises and finding it hard to get healthcare professionals. That is true across the world, and in some hospitals and specialties it is also true in Ireland, but in fact this year will be the fourth year in a row of record recruitment into our public health service, the HSE. We need to recognise the level of Government commitment to the matter of public resources and the response of the HSE in hiring people. In the context of today's debate, I have engaged extensively with the University Limerick Hospitals Group about the pressures being dealt with there. Many Senators were at a meeting I convened for Oireachtas Members with the hospital group, which the Taoiseach also attended. It was an important and constructive meeting and I took a lot away from it. We know that part of the solution is more capacity in the hospitals and, critically, in the community. I will talk first about the capacity that has already been invested in UHL and the UL hospital group. As per the motion, a new emergency department was put in place in recent years. We have heard calls for more beds. What does not get covered very often is that, since Covid-19 started, there are 150 additional beds in the group, 132 of which are in UHL. The workforce and consultants in UHL have said they need more beds. We agree. We have already added 132 beds. I also turned the sod recently on another 96-bed block. That is a lot of additional beds. The leadership in Limerick has said more staff are needed. Again since Covid, the workforce in UHL has increased by 1,000 healthcare professionals. That is a huge increase. I apologise, I do not know what the protocol is. I can keep going for a few minutes, but when the bell stops, I will have to go to the Dáil to vote. I apologise to the Chair and Senators.

In 2019, the hospital budget was €265 million. It is now €315 million. There has been a large increase of money, workforce and beds. In the emergency department, extra emergency medicine consultants have been sanctioned. Under the safe staffing framework for emergency departments, 21.5 additional whole-time equivalent nurses have been sanctioned for UHL and 19.5 of those nurses have already been recruited. Senator Gavan pointed out, at least technically correctly, that UHL did not receive any increase in the number of healthcare assistants for the emergency departments. What the Senator did not say is that the reason UHL did not get any more healthcare assistants is that it was already at the high level other hospitals aspire to. When the ratio was increased, it turned out that UHL was already at or above the increased ratio and was already at the safe staffing level, which is clearly an important part of this. We have invested across the group. There is a new injury unit in Ennis Hospital. A state-of-the-art complex was opened in Croom in 2021. The motion calls on the Government to do more to alleviate the pressures we face today. It is all well and good for us to say we have added a lot of capacity, but critically it is not enough as patients are still, at times, receiving a level of service that is not acceptable to any of us. We have to keep going. The motion calls on the Government to continue to invest and we are doing exactly that. The National Ambulance Service has a protocol we are aware of that was put in place for the medical assessment units in Ennis Hospital. I am delighted to be able to say it will be in place in Nenagh hospital in the coming weeks and we will also roll it out shortly thereafter in St. John's Hospital.

I was talking to the HSE about that earlier today. I have more information I can come back to on another day, but I will wrap up. The core message is that we will continue to invest in UHL and in the hospital group. We will continue to invest in the workforce and in beds. We are putting a surgical hub and much more capacity in place. The other part of this is that we need changes to working practices, to patient flow through the hospitals and to integrated care pathways between the hospital and the community. Many of those changes are also required. We need both. We have seen the team in UHL respond in recent weeks and drive down the number of patients on trolleys. There were eight patients on trolleys in UHL this morning. In the past week the average has been about six. The team has responded well and we need to acknowledge that. I will finish there. I thank colleagues and will now have to leave to vote in the Dáil.

We are delighted to hear the protocols will be extended to both St. John's and Nenagh hospitals because that was one of the significant requests in our motion. We now know that element of the motion will be actioned. That is fresh news. The healthcare community in the mid-west will welcome it this evening. On my behalf and that of Senator Byrne, I thank the House for its support for this motion. It is a critically important motion. While we are in government and are supportive of the Government, our job is also to hold the Government and the Minister to account and bring the Minister to the Seanad to explain and give details to the House about what is happening. That has happened here this evening. The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the senior Minister, has been here.He attended the briefing for all Oireachtas Members in the mid-west a couple of weeks ago. He has visited UHL and did the official sod turning on the 96-bed block that is now under construction. That speaks volumes. I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever in the Minister’s sincerity in working with all stakeholders to resolve this problem. To sum up, our motion has delivered the extension of the protocols to both St. John’s and Nenagh. Senator Maria Byrne, the Fine Gael group and I are delighted with that news this evening. We want to see the other two 96-bed blocks fast-tracked. I think there is a commitment here that will happen. I encourage the senior management team in UHL to advance its plans as quickly as possible and get them to the Government. I think they will find that the Government will not delay in sanctioning the money. We will see the surgical unit happen. I want it to happen as quickly as possible. That has proved its worth in Tallaght. It has responded to the crisis in Tallaght in a positive way and I believe it will do the same in Limerick.  On the elective hospital, we have not got the type of clarity we would like on that issue. Hopefully, we will in due course and the Government will see the logic and rationale behind the elective hospital and the need for it to contribute to dealing with the capacity issue in the mid-west region. Process and management in UHL is critical. Progress has been made and we have seen that with the dramatic reduction in the trolley numbers. The process change has to continue. Marches and protests have happened – all of that. People are entitled to do that and I support and welcome it. However, if there are alternative governments proposing, we need to know exactly what they will deliver if they go into government. Will we see a reversal of reconfiguration? Will we see the opening of a 24-hour consultant-led accident and emergency service in Ennis and Nenagh? This Government is not promising that because the clinicians do not support it; the clinicians do not believe it would be safe. Hard questions now need to be asked of Opposition Members. Is this what they are proposing? Are they promising the electorate that we will see a 24-hour consultant-led accident and emergency service in Ennis and Nenagh? If that is the case, they should come out and say it. We will start asking them the questions that need to be asked. The people need to know if that will happen. If that is what they are promising, that is well and good. Let us go to the people and have that discussion. However, you cannot have it every way and you cannot have it both ways. They have to say precisely whether they will open level 3 hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis. Perhaps that is what they will do. These questions have to and will be asked.  Overall, the Seanad is supporting what we are trying to achieve in this motion. We had good news this evening. It is an excellent motion. I thank all Members across the House and all parties for participating in it. I commend the motion to this House.
