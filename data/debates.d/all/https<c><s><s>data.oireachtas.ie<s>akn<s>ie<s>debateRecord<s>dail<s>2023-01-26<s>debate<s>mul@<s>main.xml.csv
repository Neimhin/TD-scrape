The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is availing of the wide range of offers of accommodation made to it, including the use of office buildings and sports facilities, to address the accommodation shortfall. These options are necessary to provide shelter to international protection arrivals, to meet basic needs and to prevent homelessness. The Government is focused on how to continue the sustained support for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, including those already here as well as those likely to be further displaced by the ongoing conflict. As part of this, the Government agreed that a move from an emergency response to a more mainstreamed approach, including a reduced reliance on serviced accommodation, is appropriate. This includes an increased focus on rapid-build housing and a new call for vacant homes led by local authorities. I can confirm that the Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid-build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. The rapid-build homes will be constructed on State-owned land. The Office of Public Works, OPW, is leading the development of this accommodation in conjunction with the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. The objective is to install 500 units by March-April 2023. My Department, at the senior officials group on Ukraine, has communicated the potential challenges arising for the tourism ecosystem, particularly in those parts of the country where high proportions of the tourism accommodation stock are directed to humanitarian purposes. The recent report from the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, which called for a reduced dependence on tourism accommodation and a geographically balanced spreading of such usage across the country, is relevant in this context. My officials are engaging with a range of Departments, with input from colleagues in Fáilte Ireland, on how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of long-term use of tourism accommodation. Analysis is being done on those towns or areas most impacted in this regard, with a focus on the sectoral skills at risk and the businesses suffering most from the lack of tourism accommodation. My Department will engage further on that analysis in the period ahead.

That is 22% of the country's tourism accommodation capacity, including 15% of hotel rooms, to provide shelter for those fleeing Ukraine and the thousands of other asylum seekers from other countries. The fear is that the tourism season starts in early March and, judging from what the Minister has said, the figures are particularly high outside Dublin. There does not seem to be a real plan. The OPW said earlier in the week that 200 rapid-build homes would be available between early and mid-2023. The Minister has said there are 500, but I have seen no evidence of that and there is no guarantee or commitment. The fear is that the tourism sector will not be fully open for the early part of the tourism season. What plans are there for those who are currently in hotel rooms? Where do they go?

The Government has approved the construction of rapid-build homes, with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals and family units. These will be built on State-owned land. After a programme of engagement with public representatives and local authorities, work has begun on the first phase of sites in Cork, Cavan, Claremorris, Mallow and Thurles. Following further engagement and the completion of suitability assessment work, further sites will come on stream in the coming weeks. I met the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, in December following the publication of its report on the impact of the Ukrainian conflict. Officials in my Department and Fáilte Ireland meet representatives of the tourism sector monthly. These meetings are hosted by Fáilte Ireland. The hospitality and tourism forum that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, and I will co-chair will meet next week to hear and address concerns.

It is not an ideal medium-to-long-term solution for the families involved. We are six weeks away from when the tourism season starts. The Minister is not responsible for sourcing accommodation, and I am not for one moment saying she is, but she is responsible for the tourism sector. Apart from the OPW's 200 rapid-build homes that may be ready between early April and mid-2023, there does not seem to be a plan, which has been the problem from the start. There are no figures. We do not want to reach a point of chaos. The ITIC has been saying this since November, but the Government has had since last March to plan. We are in unprecedented and difficult circumstances, but that is being compounded by the Government's lack of planning.

There will be up to 6,000 beds available in the coming months through the combination of rapid-build homes, the work on vacant homes that is being led by local authorities and the refurbishment work led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I am in regular engagement with the tourism sector and am fully cognisant of its concerns. I will meet it again through the tourism and hospitality forum with the Minister, Deputy Coveney. We are also concerned about the impact on ancillary businesses. We will consider supports for tourism and hospitality in the coming weeks.

In return, those companies are supposed to give quality employment and training and comply with all relevant legislation. The Minister may have heard Equity saying that people are being forced to waive their rights to intellectual property, royalties, the equitable remuneration they are entitled to and so on. Film crew have said that their rights under a series of employment legislation are not being vindicated. How will the Minister respond to these concerns?
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	8	I thank the Deputy for raising the film industry in the week that is in it. This is an opportunity to congratulate Irish people on their Oscar nominations. The annual global spotlight on the Oscars is now shining on Ireland's culture, our beautiful scenery and, most particularly, our creative talent. The House will join me in congratulating the casts and crews of "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin", including Colm Bairéad and the team, Kerry Condon, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Martin McDonagh. I also congratulate other Irish nominees - Paul Mescal, Richard Baneham and Jonathan Redmond - on their nominations. It is a pleasure to be able to name so many Irish people who are making their mark on a global stage. Success breeds success and Ireland is a more attractive location for film-making as a result. I understand that the Deputy is referring to matters raised at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's examination of section 481. I am aware that the committee has taken evidence from many witnesses and organisations as well as from officials from my Department. As I understand it, many different views were expressed to the committee, with most witnesses underlining the importance of section 481 to the audiovisual industry and to Ireland. I respect and am passionate about the rights of workers, but as I have stated previously, this matter does not fall to my Department. Employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the mechanisms for dealing with disputes - the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. These are the appropriate avenues for complaints relating to employment law. I ask that, if the Deputy is aware of wrongdoing, he please bring that information to the WRC. I understand that the intellectual property issue raised by Equity focuses on the question of whether residuals are paid. This is a matter for consideration by the members of Equity in conjunction with SIPTU. If they so decide, they can enter into negotiation with the organisations and companies that engage them. I wish to bring to the attention of the House that our Oscar-nominated films were made during Covid. They should be applauded for this. Every one of the cast and crew of the films worked under difficult restrictive protocols at all times during production. I am so proud of our film industry today.

Those films and all other films in this country are funded with public money and are subject to the requirement that we get quality employment and training and that the intellectual property rights of writers, performers and so on are guaranteed. Equity has made it clear that its members are being forced to waive their intellectual property rights, which is in breach of the copyright directive and our legislation. Film crews have pointed out that, for example, their rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act are being ignored and abused by film producer companies that are in receipt of large amounts of public money.

Regarding the protection of workers, significant changes were made in 2019 to section 481 and how it operated. There is an increased emphasis on upskilling and life-long learning as well as much greater scrutiny. I hope that these changes will ensure that any alleged malpractice prior to 2019 is not repeated in today's audiovisual industry. In addition to those changes, the "Safe to Create" programme that I launched in October provides for a dignity at work framework whereby all workers should have the right to expect a workplace that is free from bullying, harassment, humiliation, intimidation, victimisation and any other negative behaviour. Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, would strongly refute any claim of blacklisting in the Irish film industry. SPI can demonstrate its commitment to its relationship with the unions and is doing additional work in the areas of skills development and training. We are doing whatever we can to protect workers' rights.

Time and again, it has made it clear that its members are being forced to waive their rights to intellectual property and to sign contracts saying they are getting equitable remuneration when they are not. When I asked the president of Equity directly what would happen if someone did not sign the contract, the answer was that the performer would not get the job. Regarding the declaration requirement that a producer company indicates to the Minister any legal or Labour Court issue that arises, has Metropolitan Films, for example, informed her that a finding was made against it in the Labour Court over a breach of a collective agreement with film crew? Have some of the other film producer companies indicated that there are cases going to the High Court arising from cases in the Labour Court where companies in receipt of section 481 relief did not even bother to turn up and where they were named as having been in breach of legislation? Is the Minister aware of this kind of stuff?

In relation to the copyright, I repeat that the buyout of contracts relating to intellectual property rights as well as copyright issues in general falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am aware some witnesses in that committee expressed a view that there should be an agreement between employers and workers in Ireland on whether and when residual payment could or should be paid, but any general agreement on the payment arranged for actors and whether it includes residuals is first and foremost a matter for the trade unions and their members and thereafter dependent on its members' preference as a matter for engagement with employer representatives. I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards.

Táim ag súil leis an bpost nua atá agam ag obair ar son muintire na Gaeltachta, na Gaelainne agus freisin mo chuid Ghaeilge a fheabhsú. Faoi réir na socruithe reatha atá i bhfeidhm maidir le ceapadh bhord an údaráis mar a leagtar amach iad faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012, ceapann an tAire seachtar comhalta don bhord, an cathaoirleach san áireamh, agus ceaptar an cúigear eile de thoradh ainmniúcháin a lorg ó na húdaráis áitiúla ábhartha a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta faoina gcúram acu. Is ar bhonn róta a cheaptar comhaltaí i leith na trí chontae Gaeltachta is lú: Corcaigh, Port Láirge, agus an Mhí. Faoin Acht, ní rachaidh téarma oifige na gcomhaltaí thar tréimhse cúig bliana agus ní cheapfar comhaltaí chun oifige ar feadh níos mó ná dhá théarma i ndiaidh a chéile. Ceaptar an seachtar a luaigh mé de thoradh comórtas poiblí a eagraítear faoi scáth na Seirbhíse um Cheapacháin Poiblí, PAS. Sa chaoi seo tugtar an deis don phobal a bheith san áireamh le bheith ceaptha ar an mbord. Ós rud é go ndeachaigh bord reatha Údarás na Gaeltachta, a ceapadh i mí Eanáir 2018 ar feadh téarma cúig bliana, in éag i lár mhí Eanáir, thosaigh an Roinn i mbun na socruithe chun bord nua a cheapadh i mí Dheireadh Fómhair seo caite, tráth a iarradh ar an húdaráis áitiúla ábhartha a gcuid ainmniúcháin don bhord nua a chur chun na Roinne. Fuarthas na hainmniúcháin sin faoi thús mhí na Nollag. Mar gheall ar mhoill nach raibh aon smacht ag mo Roinn air áfach, ní bheidh ar a chumas PAS tús a chur leis an gcomórtas poiblí go dtí tús mhí Feabhra, rud a chiallaíonn nach mbeidh bord iomlán in ann a bheith ceaptha go dtí deireadh mhí Márta nó mar sin. Le dul i ngleic leis an moill seo, tá mo Roinn ag breathnú go gníomhach faoi láthair ar na féidearthachtaí bord a cheapadh ar bhonn eatramhach go dtí go mbeidh bailchríoch curtha ar na socruithe i gcomhar le PAS agus bord in ann a bheith ceaptha faoi réir na gnáthshocruithe a bhaineann leis sin.

Ceann de na fadhbanna bunúsacha anseo ná an teip ar PAS. Cén fáth gur theip ar PAS tús a chur leis an gcóras nó leis an mbealach chun na ceapacháin seo a dhéanamh nuair ba chóir? Beidh an bord ag imeacht i mí Eanáir agus ní bheidh bord nua ag tosú díreach i ndiaidh sin le cathaoirleach nua roghnaithe ag an Aire Stáit. An fhadhb atá againn anois ná go gcaithfidh PAS a chuid oibre a dhéanamh agus tógann sé sin roinnt míonna.

Tá an socrú sealadach seo pléite ag oifigigh na Roinne le feidhmeannaigh ón údarás agus táthar sásta nach gcruthaíonn sé deacracht nach féidir a shárú do cheachtar den dá eagraíocht.

Tá sé go dona nuair nach bhfuil cathaoirleach ag an údarás chun déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an straitéis á leanúint. B’fhéidir go mbeidh tréimhse de roinnt míonna ann nach mbeidh bord nó cathaoirleach ann chun déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an straitéis á leanúint.

Is drochlá é agus is trua sin ach níl a fhios agam fós cén fáth go raibh an fhadhb ann agus cén mhoill a raibh ann maidir le PAS. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nach raibh PAS tar éis an chórais a chur i gceart chun an ceapachán sin a dhéanamh.

This campaign was launched in May, as the busy season was just about to get under way. With those recruitment and retention issues in mind, what proactive measures is the Department of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media taking to address and resolve the current recruitment and retention difficulties?
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	22	The latest research by Fáilte Ireland shows that while recruitment is still a significant challenge for tourism businesses, the situation is improving and employers are making positive strides. The number of vacancies across the industry has fallen, from 40,000 at the start of 2022 to 22,000 today. Overall, positions have become less difficult to fill while staff retention has become less difficult too. For employees, hourly rates of pay have improved, compensation for working unsocial hours has become more common and job security among workers has grown. My Department participates in the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Departments and the education sector. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are also working with industry and across government to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.For example, in 2022, my Department and Fáilte Ireland worked closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure processing times for work permits were significantly reduced. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have also worked with that Department to increase work permit application success rates by providing information sessions to the industry. In 2023 and the years ahead, my Department and Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with industry and recruitment experts to share best practice guidance on retention and building capability. With regard to working conditions in the sector, Fáilte Ireland's research indicates that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. Around 70% of businesses surveyed indicated they are increasing their pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other benefits. Fáilte Ireland has also launched a new employer excellence programme to help participating businesses to improve their employer practices and enhance their reputation as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of their workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across their businesses. Further initiatives undertaken include a transition year work placement programme to give transition year students a high-quality work placement and a major recruitment awareness campaign called "works for me" to encourage people of all ages to consider a career in the industry. When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the industry, it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required, and that is the approach my Department and I will continue to pursue.

I appreciate there is a lot in her response and that she has committed €15 million. However, in June last year, the Irish Examiner ran the headline "No 'quick fix' for hospitality staff shortages" in which Dr. Deirdre Curran, a lecturer at NUI Galway, who had conducted research on the industry, stated that the pandemic had worsened the problems but there were also significant instances where staff had been emotionally and physically abused. She stressed the importance of listening to workers in the industry. I know the Minister is hoping and is in a position to do something about it by retaining the 9% VAT rate. If it reverts to 13.5%, it will have a significant impact and put pressure on the hostelries and the hospitality sector, and the most adverse effect and impact will probably be on the employees.

We are convening a meeting next week with all the stakeholders. I suspect the 9% VAT rate will be one of the issues that arises in that meeting. I have made it clear that I am in favour of the extension of the lower rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector. The decision ultimately lies with the Minister for Finance, but I have made clear my position on it. I am acutely conscious of the challenges the sector is facing, including cost inflation and economic uncertainty in key tourism markets. I am also aware our necessary humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine has impacted on the availability of tourism accommodation. I will continue to work with the Minister for Finance and Cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks.

That must continue to thrive. The Minister mentioned our film industry. We can expect an influx of tourists given, we hope, our success rate at the Oscars and not just the fact that Irish films have been nominated. Wexford is especially heavily dependant on tourism. We employ slightly fewer than 10,000 people in the tourism and hospitality sector. We have some of the finest hotels and we are about to develop Duncannon Fort, close to where I am from, and make significant investment, which I hope will be in the range of €2 million to €3 million. We must bear in mind that all the attractions are in rural Ireland. It is significant investment. We need to look at how we will retain jobs and ensure it is viable for the employees to work in this sector. We must not forget that we are developing Rosslare Europort. It is in Wexford. It is the hub and our most direct point to Europe and we expect an influx of hundreds of thousands of visitors in the coming year.

In December 2022, the Department of Rural and Community Development announced significant funding for Duncannon Fort under the town and village renewal scheme. That is in recognition of the amazing attraction it is. I am acutely aware that the tourism industry supports 250,000 jobs and the vast majority of those are in the regions, outside the capital city. I grew up outside the capital. It is a vital industry in my remit and I am acutely aware of the need to help our towns and village to thrive. I am co-chairing the hospitality and tourism forum with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who, as someone from outside the capital, is aware of the immense value of tourism and the concerns of the wider tourism ecosystem. That is absolutely on our radar and we will do our best to support it.

The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry here in Ireland this year. Though the strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year is very welcome, significant headwinds face the sector in 2023. To assist businesses, including hotels, the Government introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, in budget 2023. The TBESS is designed to support businesses, including hotels, with their energy costs over the winter months and will run until 28 February 2023. The TBESS is administered by the Revenue Commissioners who have designed a special online platform for businesses to register for, and claim under, the scheme. From a tourism perspective, I am continuing to direct significant resources to supporting the sustainable recovery of the sector. I secured €15 million in additional funding for overseas marketing of Ireland. This budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million in continuation of the investment in skills development and retention. This provision will facilitate the continuation of work by Fáilte Ireland to address the employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. My Department and Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with the industry and across Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles. A €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing was also secured to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have secured additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. While the hotel sector faces many challenges, I am confident the supports the Government has put in place will ensure Ireland's hotels are well positioned to maintain current levels of recovery and to grow sustainably in the coming years.

Many of the hotels in west Cork are closed at present due to energy costs and overheads. Those who are not housing refugees, and many hotels in west Cork do not, cannot afford to open their doors. I am pleading on their behalf. I see that they are closed Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. It is an astonishing situation we find ourselves in. It is spread across cafés and pubs. They are not opening their doors. Something is wrong. The Minister stated she is putting help for energy costs in place until 28 February 2023. The costs will still be there. A gentleman with a business contacted me recently who said his electricity bill for two months was €13,000. His profits from last year will pay that bill but he was shuddering in fear about the next bill coming in the door. What are businesses doing now? They are shutting their doors. They will not open the door. It is shocking for west Cork and other places in dire trouble and in need. I plead with the Minister to continue the TBESS and to put further measures in place to enable them at least to open their doors during the week.

I met him there when my family and I were on holidays. I am conscious of the impact on the wider tourism ecosystem, including the businesses he referred to. As regards the TBESS finishing on 28 February, the Government is discussing what will happen next, the supports that are needed and looking at detailed analysis.We in Ireland are absolutely resolute in our solidarity with and support for Ukraine and we are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. We have never seen so many people arrive in such a short timeframe as we welcomed the population size of Galway city in under a year. It is time to remember that Irish people have, over generations, sought shelter and opportunities abroad. Ireland has a long history of supporting other nations in times of trouble and this is the right thing to do. My officials are engaging with several Departments, with input from colleagues from Fáilte Ireland, on how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of the long-term use of tourism accommodation. It was never meant to be long term. It was meant to be short to medium term. This is not just from a hotel's point of view but also for the families in the hotels.

We have fantastic hotels. I have met with the sector. It includes such hotels as the Celtic Ross Hotel, Fernhill House Hotel, the Emmet Hotel, the Parkway Hotel, the Schull Harbour Hotel and the Blue Horizon Hotel in Kinsale. The bottom line, according to some people running these hotels, is that their family members are working for free. They are not taking any money now because they are losing and haemorrhaging money very badly. Their biggest worry is keeping the door open and the only way they can do that is if family members work free of charge. This is an unbelievable situation in which they find themselves at this time. I refer to the 9% and 13% VAT rates that would be a cushion, about which I wanted to ask a question today but it was not accepted. It will be a huge issue if the 9% VAT rate is not retained. We will see closures left, right and centre in west Cork and other areas. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in such a situation as it is happening anyway. I see it myself. When I go back today, I will see restaurants and pubs closed in each of the beautiful towns of west Cork. Something is wrong somewhere. They cannot keep begging for the Government to do something about it. I certainly believe further help is needed in west Cork.

My Department and I have extensive and ongoing engagement with the sector. As I said earlier, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I will convene and co-chair the tourism and hospitality forum next week in order to engage and hear concerns. On the 9% VAT rate, as I made clear to Deputy Verona Murphy, I have always said I am in favour of an extension to the lower rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector, that I am acutely conscious of the challenges facing the entire sector and I will be engaging with the Minister for Finance and Cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks.

That includes women in leadership positions such as board members of national governing bodies, NGBs. The sports action plan sets a target for all NGBs to achieve 40% gender representation on their boards by the end of this year. It is a priority to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% target reflects this prioritisation. The most recent board composition snapshot, which was published in December by Sport Ireland, shows that the average percentage of women on boards of national governing bodies of sport has increased from 24% in 2019 to 36% in 2022. For local sports partnerships, the average percentage has increased by 2% over the past year with women accounting for 39% of board members. The snapshot also highlights that 33 sporting organisations have already achieved 40% or more female representation on their boards. Sport Ireland will continue to provide support to NGBs towards achieving the essential target of 40% and will monitor and report on progress. Achieving the 40% target is one of Sport Ireland's grant funding priorities from this year onwards and the future funding of any NGB that fails to meet the target, by the end of this year, will be impacted. I acknowledge significant effort is being made by sporting bodies around gender diversity on their boards. Good progress has been made by many NGBs towards achieving the 40% target. However, a number of NGBs still have a way to go to meet the target and I encourage them to place a real focus on this task during the year. It is absolutely essential.

I see challenges myself. In Carlow, an issue that constantly comes up is securing female coaches for female teams. Another obstacle is Garda vetting. This is an enormous issue. On the ground there are challenges that mean there are situations in which young women cannot access sports locally because clubs do not have enough women coaches. What else does the Minister of State think we can do to support this on the ground? This is very important. I welcome the Minister of State's statement. I also have figures to hand. The local sports partnership saw an increase of 2% over the past year, with females accounting for 39% of board members. However, The Irish Times reported that 17 NGBs have 20% or fewer women on their boards, including the so-called "big three", that is the IRFU with 13%, the FAI with 17%, and the GAA with 20%, as well as the board for Ireland's most successful Olympic sport, the Irish Athletic Boxing Association with only 17%. What else can we do? While I know the Minister of State is doing his best, we need to do more.

I want to be clear to all the national governing bodies, including the big national governing bodies that, to be fair, are doing a lot for sport and women in sport. To be clear, the grant funding to those organisations is now closely aligned to our key policies, one of which is the achievement of 40% gender balance with female representation on the boards of NGBs. I have met some of these bodies - not all - and the importance of this has been on my agenda in every conversation I had so far. This is only one step, albeit a very important step. If this target is not reached, there is no doubt there will be significant funding issues for those NGBs. My officials are beginning discussions with Sport Ireland as to how we do this. There is a range of funding sources from Sport Ireland, the Government, Irish Athletic Boxing Association and all levels that would be affected by this. We must support women in sport at every level; that is a start. However, we have to encourage women and allow them to come up through the ranks in organisations. That will be equally important.

I was reading into this and speaking to woman about it. I know that support is being provided for dedicated leadership training programmes for women, including governance related, technical training, coaching, refereeing and team management. Sport Ireland is supposed to monitor NGB progress against targets and report annually on whether additional measures, such as gender quotas, are warranted. On the targets, I know the Minister of State will follow up on this. It is important that we encourage the use of targets and that we make sure to meet our targets. We have some of the finest young women in the world who can offer so much. They are so proud of our Irish heritage and love to be involved in the different sports. We must ensure we pay, look after and encourage them. I know the Minister of State is absolutely committed to doing this.

Any level of inequality would simply not be tolerated. We have to work to get more facilities because I expect, in soccer at least, that more women will be participating. I know the Deputy will be working hard in Carlow on that. Much works needs to be done. We have not made any decision as to where the significant funding cuts will be if boards do not meet these reasonable targets. I would not propose, nor have we made any decisions, to cut any of the women in sports funds.

It is expected that the legacy framework will be published on the website of Galway Culture Company, the successor trading entity to the Galway 2020 company, in the coming weeks. The website of Galway Culture Company, which is fully bilingual, has been live since last Monday and sets out the key high-level programme aims and actions under the legacy framework. The €1 million funding from my Department will be broken down to support the delivery of these programme aims as follows: €300,000 to facilitate EU and international relationships and funding, €500,000 to develop and support place-based cultural programming and €200,000 to provide supports to the cultural and creative sector. Galway Culture Company, operating within Galway City Council and led by a board comprising local and regional leaders of organisations with a role and remit in the support of culture and creative industries in Galway, has already commenced work on facilitating EU and international relationships and funding. For example, it has established an ecosystem of EU supports comprising the key agencies on the board of the company. This inter-agency ecosystem is working to share knowledge and co-operate on EU funding applications. It has already been successful in the award of funding for the stimulating performance of ecosystems in creative territories and regional actors, SPECTRA, project under the Horizon Europe programme. This project is being led by the Western Development Commission in partnership with CREW, Atlantic Technological University and Galway Culture Company as well as a number of partners from other EU countries, including Germany, Bulgaria and Denmark.  Galway Culture Company is working to develop the legacy framework of Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture and to build on the learnings and outcomes of Galway's many European and global designations, including European Capital of Culture, UNESCO city of film, European Green Leaf city and European region of gastronomy.  Over the coming months, open calls will commence for projects under place-based cultural programming as well as the development of actions to support and enhance the capacity of the Galway region's cultural and creative sector. Regular updates on all actions and initiatives, as well as relevant EU and international funding opportunities, will be provided on the website of Galway Culture Company.

I understand this company is gone as of this month and no longer exists and we now have Galway Culture Company. The only creativity here seems to involve the various organisations, including the organisation of the management of the city council, with regard to what they did with the €1 million. The 2020 has gone by the board. The website of Galway Culture Company states that it was established to opportunities to engage with EU and international partners and local place-based programming that honours the relationships, buildings on the learnings - whatever that is - outcomes and legacies of Galway's many European and global designations, including European Capital of Culture, UNESCO city of film, European Green Leaf city and European region of gastronomy.

Here she is left with this gobbledegook regarding Galway Culture Company, which has just been formed by various groups in the west of Ireland. Where do the artists come into any of this? Forgive me for being so naive to think that 2020 was about enhancing artists, working with them on the ground and leaving a legacy - a legacy on many levels, including buildings just like was done in the city in Croatia. Nothing like that has happened. The Department set up a specific monitoring unit because of the debacle relating to the Pálás Cinema that cost €9 million plus at the time and is losing money. We were to learn. The word they keep using - learnings - is a dreadful word. It means nothing. The capital of culture no longer exists, the company no longer exists and a new entity is being created as we speak. It is longer than pregnancy. I have no idea what it is about except that it is gobbledegook. I ask the Minister to take a hands-on approach to this.

The Deputy may be referring to physical infrastructure as legacy. The bid book for Galway 2020 upon which it was awarded the designation of Ireland's 2020 European Capital of Culture set out that any new cultural infrastructure to be delivered would be part of Galway's culture strategy 2016 to 2020, Everybody Matters, which is developed and managed by the local authorities. The bid book also stated that infrastructure was not part of the European Capital of Culture project, which would rely on existing infrastructure and infrastructure that came on stream between designation and delivery through existing plans and developments. Infrastructure is not and never has been part of the direct delivery and legacy of Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture. I am running out of time but I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards.

Tá sé seo ar aon dul leis an moladh ón gCoimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán maidir le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar sheirbhísí Gaeilge, go ndéanfaí scrúdú ar rannpháirtíocht na n-óg, cláir óige agus úsáid níos fearr a bhaint as na meáin dhigiteacha. Cuirtear san áireamh ina leithéid de shamhail hibrideach freisin cumas teicniúil teoranta sheirbhís iomlán FM agus baintear cothromaíocht amach idir lucht féachana FM agus níos mó daoine óga ag dul i dtreo seirbhísí agus ábhar digiteach. Tacaím go láidir le níos mó ábhar agus seirbhísí Gaeilge a sholáthar agus iad a chur ar fáil níos leithne, go háirithe do dhaoine óga. Más féidir an cineál seirbhíse seo a chur i bhfeidhm, ba mhaith liom é a fheiceáil ag tarlú. Níl sé i gceist agam tuilleadh plé a dhéanamh ar na sonraí, toisc gur faoi Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann mar an rialtóir neamhspleách atá sé seirbhísí craolacháin raidió a cheadúnú.

I will firstly address copyright and intellectual property rights. The legislation sets out that "The right to equitable remuneration conferred by this section shall not be waived by the performer and the performer shall not assign the right to equitable remuneration except to a collecting society". However, the contracts that producers are forcing performers to sign state that the artist agrees that the consideration herein constitutes equitable remuneration for the assignment of all rights pursuant to the above and represents a full buy-out of all rights. The producer companies that the State is funding are breaching the rights of writers, performers and actors.

The Deputy is following up on the previous question. It is an excellent use of his time.

I understand that the Deputy's question on blacklisting refers to a situation when a person or persons are denied fair opportunities for work or they are discriminated against for one reason or another in gaining employment or both. Employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the mechanisms for dealing with allegations of breaches in the employment laws of the State are under his aegis. These mechanisms are the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court and they are the appropriate forum for dealing with allegations of such breaches. In the event that allegations are upheld, applicant companies for section 481 must provide details of all WRC decisions relating to the qualifying company, the producer company or other companies in the film group, and where those decisions are a finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed must be provided. I am a passionate advocate for diversity. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, I would not condone blacklisting or discrimination of any kind. I have introduced policies that highlight the need for inclusion of all. The work of the skills division of Screen Ireland has been particularly important in improving hiring practices in the audiovisual industry. Screen Ireland states that open hiring practices have increased to the extent that crew calls are now becoming commonplace for most productions. Crew calls mean that there is an open application process so that everyone can apply for crew positions in that production. This is for the industry and those working in it including those who may be marginalised, from minorities or from disadvantaged backgrounds. My Department has been informed that 2022 had the highest number of productions providing placements for disadvantaged groups. More broadly, as I referred to earlier, the Safe to Create programme incorporates zero tolerance of seven damaging behaviours including victimisation. Victimisation occurs when there is adverse treatment of a worker in reaction to a complaint made by the employee or worker. It is intended that free online training in tackling bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias will be undertaken by all in the audiovisual industry. Training in these areas should further protect the rights of vulnerable or marginalised workers.

On the specific question, in order to avail of section 481, film producer companies have to sign a declaration that they are abiding by legislation such as the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act, and they are supposed to notify the Minister of cases. Did Metropolitan Films tell the Minister there was a finding against it by the Labour Court over breach of a collective agreement? Does that concern the Minister? Did it inform the Minister that there were ten different cases of unfair dismissal, with seven at the WRC and three at the Labour Court, where the producer company refused to give evidence and said it was not the employer? It could hide behind the designated activity company, DAC, and therefore refused to even engage with the court or give evidence when workers claiming unfair dismissal took those cases. Should the Government not be looking at the detail of this and examining whether there is a major problem? I believe there is a major problem.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	62	Employment practices in industry have been examined by the WRC. The Deputy had a role in the background on that examination. We constantly monitor the operation of the scheme and work with all stakeholders to bring enhancements where we can. The recent extension of section 481 is a positive development for the sector and all working in it. Without section 481, productions as diverse as "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin" would not be feasible in Ireland. The WRC and Labour Court are independent statutory bodies under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Industrial Relations Act 1946, respectively. They are the mechanisms for regulating employment law in the State. They are under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Both organisations have statutory powers under which they conduct their business and I have no role in their operation.

I have to hand an email from someone who was not even in front of our committee. Their name could not be given. It just said that they would love to chat about the film and TV industry again and that blacklisting, bullying and poor practices are alive and well and happening now in some of the 13 productions that were under way in the country at the time. The people who say things like that are afraid to speak out publicly. Those that did have not worked in the industry since. That is what is going on. It is possible because of the DAC structure for which the Government is responsible. The Government gives the production companies money and they give an undertaking to comply with all employment legislation. Such companies go into the WRC and state they are not the employer, even though the company knows who the person is and that he or she was employed on a film production where the company set up the DAC of which it owns 100%. Yet the companies say that they have no employment relationship with that person. And the Government is letting that happen. That is a breach of the fixed-term workers Act. Will the Government show us all the notifications or lack of notifications from the film producer companies about the cases that have been taken for unfair dismissal, which is effectively blacklisting?

As the Deputies are aware, the sports capital and equipment programme, SCEP, is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports and recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. Over 13,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to over €1.15 billion. The programme for Government commits to continuing the SCEP and to prioritising investment in disadvantaged areas. The 2020 round of the SCEP closed for applications in March 2021 and by the deadline 3,106 applications were submitted. Approximately 1,000 of the submitted applications were for equipment-only projects. These applications were assessed first and grants with a total value of €16.6 million were announced in August 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers with a total value of over €143.8 million were announced on 11 February 2022. Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision and 146 appeals were received. Consequent allocations on foot of successful appeals amounting to €6.14 million. It is always important to look at the avenue for appeal whenever this comes up. The total allocation of €166.6 million is the highest ever. Details of all allocations can be found on the Department's website. The Deputy will know of projects in his own constituency. The priority is to advance the successful applications to the formal approval stage. Much engagement is ongoing and work with the Department.  A full review has been undertaken by the Department of the 2020 round. A draft of the review has now been completed. I have looked at is as has the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. We should be in a position to publish this review shortly and recommendations arising from it will be reflected in the next round. Officials are engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the next round and I have had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. Once this process is concluded, I will announce the exact dates from which new applications will be accepted. The timeframe will depend on the volume of applications. It is a really good scheme, which we all know and love. I am hopeful that the discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will conclude shortly so that we can get the next round under way.

It shows that we all acknowledge the value of sports for well-being in our community and what it does for communities. I have had the opportunity to work with a number of the clubs that did receive funding in the last year or two and to assist in the appeals process, which is an important thing to stress. Lacken-Kilbride GAA Club got substantial funding and Greystones Lawn Tennis Club, Sea Scouts and a range of community activities also benefited. Could we also look at a type of sports campus funding where we bring all the sporting clubs together in the community rather than having separate fields designated for rugby, football or GAA? We would get a much better return for the community out of it. One that I am looking at in particular is down in west Wicklow where we are working on a pool for the area. We have a pool in Bray, Greystones, Arklow and Wicklow town but there is nothing once you go to the other side of the mountains. A whole sports campus in west Wicklow is something that we should look at bringing in where it would have running tracks, changing rooms and football pitches for Blessington Football Club etc. That is something that we could also look at in the sports grants.

The sports capital grant programme is well supported and much anticipated in County Clare. Last year Clare got €4.6 million and 69 clubs benefited from it. I am receiving queries from clubs which are anticipating the announcement of a new date for applications. I encourage the Minister of State to move the process along as quickly as he can.

We need a sports facility strategy, which ensures that funding delivers resources to where they are needed when they are needed rather than being awarded following good political lobbying. Very often, you find that the big, almost professional clubs, which are well resourced and have very deep pockets have the expertise or can afford the expertise to ensure that their application gets over the line. It is not a coincidence that the sports capital grants deliver for affluent areas rather than disadvantaged areas. The scheme ensures that there is some accommodation for that but we need to move away from the capital grant scheme and put in a sports facility strategy.

We will not do that. We will stick with it and we will be prioritising disadvantaged areas. That is what we are doing and that is what the sports capital programme has always done. Areas of disadvantage are awarded higher marks under the scheme. There will be a transparent marking scheme and people will know what these projects are judged on. Disadvantage is probably the strongest criterion. Women in sport is really important too and inclusion will also be important. The sports clubs will have to consider all those things.  Clubs that I know are doing their work at the moment to get ready. There is significant support available from the Department. It is probably the most open Department in terms of getting information from it. Local sports partnerships in local areas also give support in places like Clare and Wicklow. The national governing bodies are also there to give support.

I think that sports capital grant schemes is one of the best grant schemes that we have through government. A great many clubs have benefited from it across the country. It is a very fair and equitable scheme. Clubs benefit where we get to engage with them, advise them and we learn the lessons from applications that were not successful.I am working on a particular one in west Wicklow, which is the subject of Question No. 22 on sports capital grants which we will not reach. Crossing the mountains in Wicklow one reaches west Wicklow an area where people always consider they do not get as much as in the east. I would be eager to look a sports facility, swimming pool and running track, as well as sports pitches for Blessington Football Club. People need to go to Sallins, Naas or Tallaght to find a swimming pool. The area merits it and I hope that application can be considered favourably.

It was a record budget the last time and 69 clubs in Clare benefited to the tune of €4.6 million. Spending more on sport gives much more back. It is not just about physical well-being; mental health also benefits from an injection in sports facilities. I ask the Minister of State to give his view on that. How much money has he sought? Will it compare favourably with last year?

In the past it gave a commitment to develop a sports facility strategy. It is not a coincidence that when a particular Minister of State with responsibility for sport is in situ, his or her constituency tends to get greater funding for sports facilities. That does not apply so much currently, but it is something that happened in the past. Having a national sports facility strategy would ensure that would not happen again. It is important to address that.

Regarding Deputy Carey's point, discussions are ongoing. Massive ambition has been shown by voluntary clubs throughout the country. These are not professional clubs, as Sinn Féin has alleged. Voluntary clubs in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of cities and everywhere benefited from sports capital grants, and Clare is no exception. I will be working with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to maximise that budget. Deputy Matthews spoke about swimming pools. There is a national swimming strategy under review and I will be in correspondence with him about that. I share his ambition to bring swimming to every part of the country, including in his constituency. Deputy Durkan might know that my granny got married in the little chapel in Kilcock, which is in the Meath East constituency. The Kildare North constituency is very important to me because many of my constituents take part in sports in that constituency. It is not just our constituencies that will benefit; it is every constituency in the country. We need to help and champion everyone who wants to take part in sports. We need to help these communities in cities, towns and rural areas to benefit from this because we know the importance of sports. This summer will be a wonderful time for sport in the country. Throughout the year there are major sporting events. The themes need to be inclusion and increased participation, and to ensure the facilities Deputy Andrews mentioned are in place. We will also work with local authorities and national governing bodies on that.

This will be a major boost for football in Ireland and particularly women's football. It is an enormous achievement for the women's team under the stewardship of Vera Pauw. What measures are being put in place to address the expected increase in participation in grassroots football ahead of the finals in July 2023?
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	88	I thank the Deputy for this highly relevant question. This is a very exciting time for women's football in Ireland. I recently attended the soccer writers' awards night at which Vera Pauw spoke. The sense of sheer excitement and pride, which came from her and was shared around the room, will be reflected throughout the country as we build up to the World Cup and our women take part in it. We wish them well. It will be very exciting for us in the run-up, but they have considerable hard work to do in preparing for it. I wish them well in that. It is a great achievement and presents a real opportunity to grow the women's game even further at every level and we will do that through every avenue available to Government. There is no doubt but that it will have a positive and significant impact in increasing participation numbers. The FAI launched its strategy for 2022 to 2025 last year. Developing the full potential of football for women and girls is a core objective of that strategy, and one the Government supports. Earlier this month, the FAI announced the appointment of Eileen Gleeson as its head of women's and girls' football to lead the continued development and growth of football for all women and girls in Ireland. This appointment is a very welcome and positive development for women's football. Football clubs and communities throughout the country are doing excellent work in promoting football for women and girls and providing opportunities for them to participate. Addressing women's participation at all levels in sport is an important element of our national sports policy and a key priority for me and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin. Football is contributing significantly to achieving our aims in that regard. The Government and Sport Ireland will continue to support the FAI in developing the game among women and girls. In accordance with the Government's memorandum of understanding with the FAI, funding of €5.8 million is being allocated to the FAI for football development each year between 2020 and 2023. In addition, specific women-in-sport funding is allocated to the FAI through Sport Ireland's women-in-sport funding programme to increase women's participation and to progress the FAI's strategic objectives for women in sport. Funding of €64,000 was provided under this programme for 2021 and 2022. In December 2022, funding was provided to Sport Ireland to support a number of initiatives aimed at improving the profile and visibility of female athletes across all sports in 2023, with specific support for women in football.

We need to ensure that the grassroots level is the best it can be to ensure we capture the almost certain increase in participation around the finals in Australia. We need increased investment in facilities across the country, particularly for grassroots development. Regional development is very important. It is great to see a Kerry football club starting up and developing into the League of Ireland. With all the clubs throughout the country, including in my constituency in Ringsend, there is an issue with all-weather facilities. A previous speaker mentioned multi-use facilities, which is really important. We are not investing enough in those. The collapse of the stand in Limerick's Markets Field at the end of last year highlights the urgent need for investment in League of Ireland and grassroots facilities. We can support and cheer on the Irish team, but we need to do more than that. We need significant investment in grassroots football.

Apart from the great pride and everybody cheering our women on, it will lead to more people getting involved and more pressure on facilities. As part of the sports capital programme, funding will be geared to ensuring we have inclusion and increased participation at all levels, including among women and girls. As I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we also have initiatives at senior board level which are designed to get more women on boards and more focus on that in the governing bodies. That also needs help at all levels throughout the administrative structures of the organisation and, as the Deputy said, through the facilities. I am absolutely committed to doing that. I was never a great soccer player although my late father was. My wife also played soccer. I know personally of the pride among women who played soccer or indeed Gaelic football over the past 20 or 30 years at a time when it was a minority sport.It is with pride that we see the Irish ladies' team now coming through. It is also a source of pride to see the kids who are now coming up through the ranks and playing soccer at a high level. We hope that will continue. The Government and Sport Ireland are committed to doing everything we possibly can to ensure we facilitate that and enable it to happen.

I do not want to labour the point but we need to move away from the sports capital grant scheme. We need to move to national sports facilities. In 2012, the Government developed a draft sports facility strategy which was supported by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. A circular was sent to all local authorities to try to develop the strategy. Has the Government completely ruled out a national sports strategy or is it open to developing one? In order to harness the joy around Irish football, in particular women's football, we need to ring-fence significant funding for the FAI. We need to set up a task force within the FAI and the Government to ensure that funding is directed at the development of women's sport, including women's football, to benefit from the team's World Cup participation.

Tá fáilte rompu isteach sa Dáil inniu. I was talking about my wife playing sport. Coincidentally, she used to play Gaelic in Na Fianna, next door to our visitors. That is a complete coincidence. The Deputy raised important questions. I, the Minister and the Government are very committed to the issue. We will work with the Deputy and the Government bodies. At the meetings I have with every body, including the FAI, the issue of women in sport is top of the agenda. I do not agree with the Deputy's point about moving away from the sports capital programme. I complete reject that. However, I absolutely agree with him about facilities. The most recent sports capital round included the allocation of €25 million to multi-sport facilities. Much of that funding would go to education and training boards, ETBs, local authorities or sports clubs that happen to allow different sports. We do not have the figures broken down, and I am trying to get such a breakdown, but football is a big beneficiary. The size of the pitch in a multi-sport facility is, generally speaking, the size of an all-weather soccer pitch. We will continue to do that. Under the sports capital programme, clubs or organisations that provide for multi-sport facilities or allow access to other sports gain an advantage. We want to help increase participation. I am committed to the issues the Deputy raised in this question. We will continue to work on those issues.

Up to one quarter of our hotel rooms are occupied by beneficiaries of temporary protection. What plans are in place to support the tourism sector in response to our humanitarian empathy towards Ukrainians?
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	95	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 20 together. Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges, both geopolitical and economic, remain. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices, and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry here in Ireland this year. Though the strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year was welcome, there are significant challenges facing the sector. I am, therefore, continuing to direct significant resources to support the sustainable recovery of the sector. In budget 2023, I secured an additional €15 million for the overseas marketing of Ireland. The budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million for the continuation of the investment in skills development and retention, which is critical, as there are significant employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. Additionally, a €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing will continue to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have also secured €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Other allocations include €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development for the continued delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030. Tourism Ireland will roll out an extensive and targeted programme of activity in 2023, with a total marketing budget of €78 million. A wide range of promotional activities will be undertaken, including a new global marketing campaign, publicity and programming, social media and digital marketing, as well as working with the tourism industry at home and the travel trade overseas to facilitate sales. In the area of screen tourism, we can expect many international tourists to head for County Mayo on foot of "The Banshees of Inisherin". Economic, social and environmental sustainability will be at the heart of Tourism Ireland's work over the coming years, driving greater economic prosperity and benefiting communities across the island, while at the same time increasing our consideration of the environmental impacts of tourism. In addition, Fáilte Ireland will announce its plans for 2023 shortly. The Government has recognised the challenge of rapidly rising energy costs for businesses and last year introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS. I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry that the number of tourism beds taken out of the system for humanitarian reasons is likely to have a real impact on the industry's recovery in 2023 and beyond. In addition, hotel accommodation is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families. That is why the Government is actively exploring a wide range of alternative options, including the roll-out of a rapid-build housing programme to provide accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. My Department has communicated concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That Department is working urgently across Government with agencies, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and local authorities to bring new accommodation on board so that the State's humanitarian responsibilities can be met. My Department has initiated the development of a new national sustainable tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years to support sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. The new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable economic development in communities throughout the country while protecting our environment and natural resources, with greater demand spread out across the year. While the sector faces many challenges, I am confident that the supports the Government has put in place will ensure that Ireland's tourism industry is well positioned to maintain its current levels of recovery and to grow sustainably in the coming years.

There are two aspects I would like to concentrate on by way of a supplementary question. The first relates to niche tourism and particularly the use of large country houses. There is considerable scope for niche tourism in that regard. Some of those houses have taken those opportunities and others have not. I also raise the development of conference tourism. There is an enormous international market in that respect. Some countries are availing of those opportunities to a greater extent than this country. It might be possible to incentivise such tourism.

"The Banshees of Inisherin" is a considerable achievement and as a result of the film, the Wild Atlantic Way is now on a global stage, which is significant for the likes of counties Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway and Mayo. We should not look to capitalise on the opportunity through further investment along the Wild Atlantic Way. We have an enormous product on our doorstep.There are now more than 55,000 beds being occupied by Ukrainians in more than 250 bed and breakfasts. We certainly need to ensure we have a plan going forward to ensure that our tourism product is not impacted as a result of a lack of availability of rooms at an affordable price. We need to ensure it does not raise the price so that it is extortionate for tourists coming to this country. I also encourage Tourism Ireland to look to what is happening in Inis Mór and Achill Island and at having an exposition or a marketing campaign on the back of it.

It put up a video on social media maybe three months ago. It shows the actors being interviewed about the beauty of where they worked on location in Achill and Inis Mór. The Deputy can retweet that to his heart's content. It is very aware of the immense value that this will bring to attract international tourists and is capitalising on that. That is another great reason we have tourism, arts and culture in the same portfolio. I have always talked about the links there. In regard to the large country houses, there may be one or two in Kildare north. I can talk with Deputy Durkan afterwards about the potential of that from a tourism point of view. In regard to the conferences, I am aware of that and engage with that specific area in the tourism industry. I expect it to have someone in attendance at the tourism and hospitality forum next week, which is being convened by myself and the Minister, Deputy Coveney. I know Tourism Ireland is aware of the potential there. In regard to the concerns about the humanitarian response, it is, of course, the right thing for us to do. As a nation, we sought refuge for generations and we should never forget that. The Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. The vacant homes initiative led by local authorities aims to provide 1,000 homes while refurbishments led by the Department of House, Local Government and Heritage will provide an estimated 3,000 beds. Under those measures between 6,000 and 7,000 beds or more will come on stream in the coming months to ease the pressure. Of course, I am aware of the concerns in the industry. In particular the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, published reports recently and I have met with its representatives on foot of those reports. I will be engaging with the industry with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the tourism and hospitality forum next week.

This saw significant delivery of cost-rental homes by Approved Housing Bodies, AHBs, in particular through the cost-rental equity loan, the first cost-rental and affordable purchase homes also delivered through the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the first affordable homes for purchase made available via the first home scheme and, indeed, by our local authorities. This momentum will continue in 2023 with a pipeline of housing delivery in place and being developed by local authorities, by AHBs and by the LDA as well as homes being made available through the first home scheme. Local authorities have begun systematically collating information on delivery of affordable homes in their areas, including validated delivery from AHBs and the LDA, in the same manner as is currently done for social housing for submissions to my Department. We expect that in the coming weeks. Separately, the first home scheme has confirmed it has issued more than 800 approvals to date on applications received from first-time buyers. Local authorities have been approved for affordable housing funding of more than €210 million for 42 projects across 15 local authorities which will assist in the delivery of more than 2,800 affordable homes for purchase or rent. The 2022 returns to which the Deputy refers are currently being prepared by the local authorities. Informed by returns of this data which is scheduled literally over the coming weeks, I expect that my Department will be in a position to report the confirmed 2022, not just affordable housing delivery, we will break it down by cost rental, affordable purchase and first home scheme, but also the delivery of 2022 social homes by the end of this quarter. I actually expect it by the end of February or early March.

They are giving people an additional layer of debt but I do not want to have that debate today. What I want to know is what was delivered with the funding provided by the Minister to local authorities and AHBs? We know from the LDA’s website that Project Tosaigh delivered only 48 cost-rental homes last year. As of October only 300 cost-rental homes had been delivered by AHBs but that included the 35 delivered the previous year. On the basis of information I have, I suspect that not a single affordable home to purchase through the affordable housing fund was actually completed or purchased last year. We know, for example, that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the brief to Deputy Paschal Donohoe when he became Minister stated that there would be fewer than 1,000 delivered. Is that the kind of ballpark figure the Minister expects when he gets the final figures from officials in the coming weeks?

As I said, more than 800 approvals have been made already to real households for real homes. That is good. We will break down that data when it is finalised. We will break it down between cost rental, affordable purchase through local authorities and Land Development Agency delivery as well. We are validating that data. We do not have the returns from every local authority area. I have given the Deputy the broad picture. We have a very good pipeline. The targets are without question challenging. They were challenging in 2022. The important thing is that we have proved the concept of cost rental in particular. We have hundreds of tenants in place already. When we have the data returns back in and fully collated and validated, we will certainly be publishing them in the detail requested by Deputy Ó Broin. It is important people see that and see the progress that has been made and where we need to fill further gaps as well. That will include such initiatives as Project Tosaigh. As the Deputy may know, we are looking at Project Tosaigh II returns right now, to which we have a good response.

With respect to the affordable housing fund purchases, in my own constituency homes were effectively completed midway through the year but because of disputes over legal contracts, they have not yet been purchased. We expect them to be purchased by February. That means those homes were not ready for occupation. In the Minister’s constituency, he launched affordable purchase homes in December. However, as at the start of January, those homes were not actually complete. Fingal County Council confirmed to me that they were practically complete but that utilities had not yet been connected and that was in the process of being resolved this month. In fact, the contracts have yet to be signed and will not be completed and ready for people to move in until February. Likewise, the Minister has not proved the concept of cost rental. The LDA homes that were advertised under Project Tosaigh are coming in at rent of about €1,500. There are still no cost-rental units in the urban core where we need them. I suspect even when we see them in the urban core of Dublin that we will be looking at rents of between €1,600 and €1,900. Cost rental has to be affordable and €1,500 for a two-bedroom or three-bedroom unit outside Delgany is not an affordable rent. Therefore, as the Minister knows from his engagement with the AHBs, that scheme is in a bit of a crisis. Until we really grasp the issue of affordable cost rental, that scheme is going to run into huge problems not just in terms of the delivery last year but in the update of delivery this year and the year after.

I met many of those residents. They have long-term, secure tenures with below-market rent. The rent is calculated on the basis of covering the cost of the delivery and management of the development. We have set an income cap of €53,000 net for that scheme. I am looking at changes to the cost-rental scheme and we are working through that. Every single cost-rental development we have advertised has been oversubscribed by ten or 12 times.It is a very popular form of tenure and it is working. We are not just talking about it and we actually have tenants in place in those areas. In regard to affordable purchase, there were issues in regard to conveyancing and legal issues in particular with the first local authority affordable purchase homes being sold but they have all been rectified. That was something we discussed here before. On the specific scheme that the Deputy references in Fingal, my own area, there were some issues with utility connections through the ESB to be very frank. The developer, the local authority and the ESB worked very well to rectify those and residents were issued with an update on that two weeks ago. The homes are complete and the first residents are moving in.

This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes, so it is a very ambitious and badly needed programme. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over €4 billion per year, through an overall combination of €12 billion in direct Exchequer funding, €3.5 billion in funding through the Land Development Agency and €5 billion of funding through the Housing Finance Agency. We all know there were significant challenges to delivery in 2022 due to significant construction inflation, rising energy costs and supply chain difficulties. Nevertheless, local authorities and our partners in the approved housing bodies have worked very hard to maximise delivery throughout 2022. My Department will be preparing delivery statistics based on returns from the local authorities in the coming weeks so I do not yet have final output figures – I outlined the position to Deputy Ó Broin on the affordable side. However, I expect that when figures are collated, we will see higher numbers of social houses delivered this year than in many years. This is for new builds and there is also lease and acquisition, although we are phasing out leasing. The figure will be substantially higher than the figure referred to in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform briefing document, and I know the Taoiseach has also said that. It is also clear that a strong pipeline for social housing has been established. The construction status report for quarter 3 of 2022 showed there were 9,115 social homes under construction at the end of September 2022 and a further 13,709 homes at various stages of design and procurement. In 2022, we also delivered significant additional homes through targeted leasing and the acquisition programmes, such as purchase for tenants in situ, with which all Deputies agree and which we want to ramp up further. These are all available to be allocated to households on the social housing waiting lists. The statistics for quarter 4 will set out details on all delivery streams and will be published in the coming weeks. I will be coming before the Oireachtas joint committee on that.

I agree with the Minister and I have raised many times the need to ramp up the tenant in situ scheme, and I think there is cross-party agreement on that. However, listening to the figures that the Minister is giving and looking at the Housing Commission report today, it is hard to see the value of the targets being set by the Government at this stage, particularly when we are so unclear about whether they are being met. The Minister gave a figure of 9,000 under construction at the end of quarter 3 of 2022 but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is estimating only 6,500 social homes were completed in 2022, some 2,500 fewer than the initial target. Speaking of targets, as recently as ten days ago, the Taoiseach seemed to announce arbitrarily an increase in the Housing for All target, from the average that the Minister has given of 33,000 homes to 40,000. I know our housing spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, at the time said it seemed the Taoiseach was plucking figures from the air in terms of targets. Can the Minister say for sure that these targets are valid, particularly as the Housing Commission has now said Ireland needs between 42,000 and 60,000 new homes per year? How can we rely on targets?

They were set based on very detailed research and input from the sector. It is about building the capacity within the sector to deliver the homes that we need, doing things better and having more people in construction to build the homes we need. We have had about ten to 12 years of significant under-delivery across all tenures but if we look at 2020 and 2021, in those years there were just over 20,000 new builds. Obviously, that was impacted by Covid and two construction shutdowns. I would expect we will substantially exceed our overall Housing for All target of 24,600 for this year and we will have CSO figures very shortly in that regard. We need to ramp that up. These are baseline targets. Last year, 2022, we had a target of 24,600 and I would expect us to exceed that quite substantially. This year the target is 29,000 and I want to exceed that too. I will come back in my supplementary reply with regard to the Housing Commission.

The reality is that no matter what targets are set and what figures the Government gives, the experience of people who approach my office and the offices of other Members every day is that they simply cannot find homes, particularly people seeking help to find a social home. It is heartbreaking to tell them their position on the social housing list and to tell them about the lack of capacity in the system to deliver their housing needs. I want to come back to HAP again because the reality is that many of those on HAP should be provided with social housing instead, and I think there is cross-party agreement on that. When we look at the figures that were paid out on HAP even last year, they are staggering figures that should instead be put into the delivery of social and affordable homes. Many of those on HAP are competing with other renters in the private sector in trying to find somewhere to rent and, in the meantime, HAP is subsidising private landlords. There is a lack of logic to the current system, with huge amounts of money being spent yet a failure to deliver the homes that people need.

In 2021, the last full year for which we have published figures, we had just over 5,000 new-build social homes but, overall, just over 9,000. We need to do more than that. In 2022, we set a target of 10,500 overall and we will be very close to that, and the figures on new builds will greatly exceed the figure the Deputy referenced from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and I can give Deputies an assurance on that. With regard to HAP, it supports about 60,000 tenancies and, of course, the people in those homes. I am no great fan of HAP but it is a necessity right now as we are building more social homes to transition people out. Over the last few years, we have reduced the level of funding available for new tenancies, so we are reducing that dependence. However, we cannot pull the plug on HAP overnight or what would happen to the 60,000 households? What we have to do is ramp up that social housing new-build delivery. In this quarter, we will have the final figures for that delivery. Even in the difficult year of 2022, there will be a substantial increase and I can confidently say we will have delivered more social homes in 2022 than we have done in decades. That is a good basis to work on and to ramp it up further from that.

I am glad the Deputy referenced that it is an enhanced scheme, an improved scheme on what was there before. We all know its purpose, which is to remediate dwellings damaged by the use of defective concrete blocks. We passed the Act to implement and give legislative underpinning to a series of measures to improve and greatly enhance the current grant scheme and that was agreed by Government on 30 November 2021. The 2022 Act will be commenced once the related regulations have been finalised. To get to the nub of the question, draft regulations have been prepared and will be the subject of consultation with key stakeholders before the regulations are finalised and adopted in early 2023. The draft regulations have been with the four local authorities to seek their feedback. It is intended that the consultation with key stakeholders, which will be conducted by the appointed homeowners liaison officer, will commence next week with the homeowners themselves through John O’Connor, and that will go through the draft regulations with the groups. The regulations will provide for detailed matters within the 2022 Act which are to be prescribed, for example, the grant rates, the damage threshold and the form and content of various reports, certificates, forms and declarations: basically, the working of the scheme.The grant rates to be included in the final regulations will be based on the regional construction costs for 2023. That is something we debated before. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland is doing that work and we said we would review it. Thankfully, we are doing this because we have seen quite sizeable construction and materials inflation in that period. That work is being done by the SCSI. Pending the opening of the enhanced scheme - it is important people know this - applications can continue to be made to the relevant local authorities. I am glad to tell Deputies we have seen a significant increase, particularly in Donegal, in applications being submitted and being processed. I am seeking that we get to a position where we will be able to provide a monthly report on the progress with this. People are engaging with this. I would like to inform Deputy Ó Broin that we will have consultation next week with the homeowners and we will receive their feedback. We aim to have the regulations published by the end of February, subject to the feedback that we get from homeowners, because we want their input into this.

My understanding is that of the four local authorities which received the draft regulations at the end of last year, the one in Donegal is refusing to give the Minister’s Department a formal comment because it is not allowed to discuss the regulations with its elected members. I welcome the fact the Minister has asked the SCSI to update the unit-square metre cost but I understand that for Mayo and Donegal, it will not be completed until the end of February, and for County Clare, it will not be completed until April. That means the final regulations are unlikely to be concluded until March for the first two counties, and May for the second two counties. The local authorities will require at least two to three months to get their systems in place, which means people will not be able to either apply to the new scheme or be transferred to the new scheme until June at the earliest for Donegal and Mayo, and August for Clare and Limerick. If any of that is incorrect or different from the Minister’s own expectations, please let me know. As the Minister knows, there is considerable anger in the counties affected by defective blocks because the scheme that we have all worked together on for a long time with regard to building defects has an element of retrospection, which is something that was denied to folks with defective blocks. There are also no caps where full 100% redress is intended to be provided for building defects. That, again, is something that is not in the legislation in regard to defective blocks. Will the Minister revisit those two key issues, namely, retrospection and full 100% redress for the families affected by the defective blocks in all counties?

There is no pause on applications coming through. Anyone who applies to the previous scheme will get the uplift of the new scheme and, thankfully, people are applying and we are seeing an increase in applications. The Housing Agency has boots on the ground in Donegal, with a specific team there. It is also providing advice. I have received feedback from three of the four local authorities. Just in the past week, I wrote again to Donegal County Council and we will be meeting with it. It is important we have its input into this but that is not going to delay people accessing, applying or, most importantly, getting applications approved. On the two specific points raised by the Deputy, the enhanced defective concrete block scheme we have has a cap of €420,000. We are revising the costs within that, independently with the SCSI, which I said I would do. That will cover 99% of homeowners. The average cost in respect of the apartment defects, as the Deputy is aware, is on or around €25,000. It is a different scheme. In the area of retrospection, however, or costs already incurred, I intend to include a provision for that in the regulations on the basis of certified work. The work has to certified.

The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in particular, has been in contact with me, as have other interested Deputies, on that point. I believe there will be a very small number of homeowners in the affected regions who have had work completed. It will have to be certified and invoiced appropriately, etc., for it to access the scheme but I intend that will be part of the regulations we publish. Importantly, when these regulations are published, the joint Oireachtas committee will have full sight of them and we will work through the scheme. Nobody should stop making an application. Homes have been remediated already in Mayo and in Donegal and that continues to be the case.

Part of that is because of the restrictions on IS 465. From what our committee was told, it is unlikely completion of the review or changes to the scheme, in respect of the National Standards Authority of Ireland's work, will be completed this year. That means many people who have already applied to the scheme will not be able to progress until the enhanced scheme is open and transferred to the Housing Agency. Obviously, we do not know what the new square metre or square foot rates are but under the old rates in the legislation, many homeowners have told us, at the committee and in correspondence, that even where they had modest-sized family homes of 80 sq. m or 90 sq. m, they would be short €30,000, €40,000 and €50,000. Obviously, I will wait to see the SCSI's rates to see if that is rectified. Can the Minister confirm that more than 90% of the people who apply under the enhanced defective block scheme will get 100% like-for-like remediation? Can he also confirm what the timeline will be for the retrospection in terms of how far back he will go with the certified works for defective block homeowners?

We will be flexible and we will do that in consultation with representatives. It is only fair and proper that we do that and it will be a very small number of properties. Just to let the Deputy know, we have had 150 applications in Donegal which have been processed and have gone through the stages since December. We have also provided assistance there to ensure people’s applications are actually processed. Homes are now being remediated but we want to see that stepped-up significantly.  The objective of the enhanced defective concrete block scheme passed by the Dáil is to provide 100% redress to people and to cover the costs they have incurred through no fault of their own to get their homes and lives back. I am confident we will be able to do that. We needed to set up the scheme in primary legislation, which we knew. As I said, the regulations are coming down the track shortly. I expect it will be by the end of February. There will not be any delay in accessing it because people who accessed the old scheme and applied for it will get the uplift of the enhanced scheme. There is the administrative work-----

Budget 2022 provided record levels of investment to support housing programmes, levels which we have not seen before, including for the delivery of increased levels of social and affordable homes. Exchequer funding of €4 billion was made available, comprising €2.6 billion in capital and €1.4 billion in current funding. Additional capital funding was available through the Housing Finance Agency and the Land Development Agency. As I have already stated publicly, my Department put arrangements in place to carry over the full 10% capital allocation from 2022 to 2023. This amounted to €340 million and the detail of the allocation of that funding was published in the 2023 Revised Estimates Volume, REV. Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 provides for the carry over of up to 10% of the REV allocation, which is the capital, from one year to the next. The capital carry over is a practice which is used across Departments to ensure the continuity of funding for capital projects. As Deputy O'Callaghan is no doubt aware, the impact of the war in Ukraine has genuinely presented significant challenges as we faced high levels of construction inflation, significant increases in energy costs and issues with the supply chains. These are just facts and, in particular, there was an issue around supply chains for building material. These issues caused delays in some large social housing projects as contractors faced concerns that the costs of delivering the projects exceeded prices agreed under public works contracts. To address some of these challenges, in May 2022 the Government responded with the introduction of the inflation and supply chain delay co-operation framework.That framework allowed for the payment of up to 70% of the increased costs to contractors by local authorities, with detailed guidance provided to support its implementation. Delivery recovered very strongly in the second half of the year, as I said it would and as was anticipated. However, the delays encountered meant some projects did not progress as expected during 2022. This in turn reduced somewhat the levels of capital claims received by the Department from local authorities.

I asked the Minister how much of the unspent capital housing budget was surrendered back to central government at the end of 2022. He did not answer that at all in his reply so let me help him. A total of €337 million that was allocated to local authorities to build homes was reallocated elsewhere, including to pay down local authority debt. A further €340 million was carried forward into 2023 and, according to December's Fiscal Monitor, at the end of 2022, a further €249 million was not spent, of which €231 million was on the capital side. That is a total of €926 million that was not spent but carried over, reallocated or surrendered back to the central Exchequer. How can the Minister stand over such a huge underspend in the middle of a housing disaster?

He mentioned the paying down of local authority debt. Does he know why they are doing that? There are encumbered sites throughout this country that have not been able to be developed for the social housing the Deputy says he wants because the local authorities have been carrying a very significant debt, some of them for up to two decades. We have used that reallocation to local authorities on the basis that they will deliver and start to build on 38 different sites we have identified throughout the country. These are for much-needed, additional social and, in some instances, affordable homes. We have already engaged with local authorities on that. There is a reality behind what the Deputy said about not hiding behind cost inflation or issues we have with the supply chain. Will we just forget the fact there was a reality in April, May and June of last year regarding difficulties getting product and material, which have slowed down some projects that will be delivered in 2023 as opposed to 2022, hence the capital carryover? The Government has to live in the real world too. We cannot just wish these things away and that issues do not happen. We have not had a clear picture this year or last year, but in 2022, we will deliver more new-build social homes than we have done in decades. I expect that at the time we announce those figures, the Deputy will be the first to welcome them.

Under his tenure, we now also have a record level of the housing budget's capital spend not being spent and being reallocated, sent back to the Exchequer or carried over. That is some level of records. On paying down local authority debt, the Minister knows that money was allocated to build real homes that people were meant to move into this year. Instead, some of it was diverted to paying down loans. If that was such a good idea, why did he not decide to do it at the start of the year? He decided to do it towards the end of the year, when he was failing to spend the money he was allocated to build homes. What will he do to ensure this not happen again? Every year he has been Minister, hundreds of millions of euro have been carried over into the following year, which were meant to be spent building homes.

Cá bhfuil na tuarascálacha maidir le 2021 agus 2022? My question relates to the task force that was set up more than three years ago in Galway because of the housing emergency there. Three years later, that task force still rumbles on. I have before me my last communication to the Minister in March 2021, which related to 2020. Where are we now? I will come back to the real world for the Minister in respect of the Simon report.

I have not received the report referred to in my reply to Question No. 89 of 30 November 2022. I understand it is in preparation but the public housing delivery outputs for 2022 are currently being validated for all local authorities, including for both Galway councils. This information will be important for the report's completion. I anticipate this report will cover the activity of the task force over 2021 and 2022. I will make it available to the Deputy when it is received by me. The Galway housing task force continues to provide a valuable focus for social and affordable housing delivery across the two Galway local authorities as well as related challenges such as homelessness. We anticipate we will have the report referred to by Deputy Connolly early in 2023. It will be delivered to the Minister. I understand the Deputy's frustration but the commitment has been given that, once the Minister has received the report, it will be given to her more or less straight away.

I thank him for his straight and direct response. We are talking about a city where a task force was set up in 2019 and where the Simon report - unfortunately, the Minister has had to step out - tells us about the lived experience of real people. Can he imagine that rents have gone up 24% in County Longford, 20% in counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Cavan, and more than 14% in County Galway? That 14% is staggering in itself. We have a city where no houses are available under the housing assistance payment, HAP, or even under the discretionary payments. We have a serious housing crisis, a list that is as long as your arm and all we have is a twisting of language. A task force was set up under the able stewardship of Ms Geraldine Tallon, who has pointed out a number of things, but there are no reports. The task force was under obligation to give an annual report on what it identified as the blocks in Galway.

That has not happened. We are where we are. I will follow up with the task force on the matter of the report being with us. We are now in the first month of 2023. The report will be received by me by the first quarter but I will certainly follow up to make certain it is expedited. We are looking to deliver housing nationwide, but the Deputy's case of Galway city and county is a particular priority for the Government. The starting base is the need to get the report finalised and submitted to us and the Minister. That report will then be made available to the Deputy.

Rents have risen by 16.4% in County Galway. This is the Simon Community's 28th report - it has been published every quarter over seven years - which gives us a snapshot over a three-day period. What does it tell us? No properties are available under HAP, which is the big scheme in town that Deputy Bacik deplored earlier. She forget to say, however, that HAP was the turning point in housing policy, when Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party stated that HAP was the only game in town and removed people from the housing waiting list.I welcome the Minister's comment that he is not happy with HAP, even if he says we cannot get rid of it overnight. We have to recognise that was the crucial turning point in the commodification and privatisation of housing. That is what happened. It was back to a task force. A task force was set up. Surely it has a job to do in a limited time, that is, to focus on the emergency and to come up with a report. Instead, it appears to have become part of the establishment, and I say that reluctantly, when the manager and the management should be doing their job, highlighting if there is not enough money, coming back to the Government and giving us a master plan for Galway to sort out the housing problem.

More particularly, we will follow up to make sure this report is finalised with immediate effect - at the very latest by the end of the first quarter, although I think we can get it quicker - and that we can implement its recommendations. They must be practical in orientation. The Deputy spoke about HAP. One of the developments the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has brought in is that the houses of HAP tenants can now be purchased by the council. That is a positive measure.

On Friday week I will accompany to the court Jackie and her husband - he has worked all his life for a State company and they have two kids - for a case involving an enforcement order, following which they will most likely be evicted from their home having done nothing wrong. Because they are slightly over the income threshold, they are not entitled to HAP or social housing and are expected to live in their car in a couple of weeks' time. Added to that can be Tathony House, with 35 residents facing eviction, and Rathmines Road, with about a dozen facing eviction. All this is happening and the Government continues to allow families and working people - decent people who have done nothing wrong - to be evicted into homelessness. What will the Government do to stop this shameful scandal?

The aim of the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Act 2022 is to afford time for housing supply to increase and to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market. To assist in managing demands on housing services after the winter emergency period and to ensure there is no cliff-edge impact on 1 April, the Act provides for deferred notices of termination to take effect on a phased basis over the period from 1 April to 18 June 2023. The Act has been carefully calibrated to limit its interference with landlords' constitutional property rights. As a further emergency measure, the Minister has written to local authority chief executives informing them of a decision to continue, for the duration of the winter emergency period and up to the end of the transition period in June 2023, with the delegated sanction of purchasing homes where the tenant is at risk of homelessness. Ultimately, increased supply across all tenures is key to eradicating homelessness. Housing supply is increasing under Housing for All. Record State investment of €4.5 billion will be made available in 2023 to support the largest State home building programme ever, with 9,100 direct-build social homes and 5,500 affordable homes. Due to the provisions of the scheme, cost rental does not facilitate the purchase of individual second-hand properties, with capital expenditure focused on acquisition and development of additional new units to help increase overall housing stock. In line with Government commitments, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 will increase Part V provision from 10% for social housing to a mandatory 20% for social, affordable and cost-rental housing requirements. I will come back in with a supplementary response to the specifics of the question.

This is the problem when the senior Minister is not here: we just get script. No disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, but that is the problem. None of what he said stops the cliff edge Jackie, her husband and their two kids face in being evicted next Friday from the home in which they have lived all their lives, and this during what is supposedly a moratorium on such evictions. That is what is happening in reality. What the Minister of State said does not stop the stress the 35 residents and families with kids and so on in Tathony House face as their landlord tries to drum them all out from the places where they have lived. All of them paid their rent and never did anything wrong and they are being chucked out on the street. Then there is Rathmines Road. The Government needs to say clearly that people who pay their rent and have done nothing wrong will not end up in homeless accommodation. That can be done by banning such evictions and by having a clear policy whereby the State will step in and buy properties where landlords are exiting the market, regardless of whether those tenants' incomes are slightly over an income threshold - an arbitrary, cliff-edge income threshold, to use the term the Minister of State has just used.

If he would bring them forward to us, it would be useful. While there are no further proposals in respect of the extension of the current moratorium, the Department is keeping this under constant review and our Department has commenced work on an overall review of the private rented sector, as committed to under a review of Housing for All, which was published last November. As for acquisitions and support to prevent homelessness, the Department is supporting local authorities to acquire homes for social houses for priority purposes, including acquisitions which support a household to exit homelessness or appropriate acquisitions with tenants in situ to prevent homelessness. There is a suite of measures in that regard but, again, I am not familiar with the specific cases the Deputy raises. If he would bring them-----

Jackie and her husband, who, I repeat, works for a State company, with their two kids have written to the Minister, to the Taoiseach and to everybody. They have written to Frank Curran, the head of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. They are over the income threshold, so none of the things the Minister of State said will help them. Jackie and her family cry themselves to sleep every night and they are going to be living in a car because they have nowhere to go, no HAP and no support. Then there are the families in Tathony House and Rathmines Road, all facing the prospect of ending up on the street because there is nowhere to go. There needs to be a clear policy whereby people who have paid their rent and have done nothing wrong will not end up in emergency accommodation or in a car. That has to be the policy. The State must step in even if a person's income is slightly over the threshold. Cost rental is a recognition that people who are not eligible for social housing still cannot afford market prices. Therefore, the State needs to step in in those cases as well and there needs to be a clear imperative that it will do so. Why would the Government let people become homeless? It will have to pay for and deal with the consequences of that. Why would it not do everything to stop that?

Tackling vacancy is a key priority for this Government. Housing for All, the Government's housing strategy, sets out a blueprint to address vacancy and make efficient use of our existing housing stock. Many areas of cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties which, if brought back into use, could add real vibrancy and provide new accommodation in those areas. The Croí Cónaithe towns fund is a key initiative which underpins these policy objectives set out in pathway 4 of Housing for All, and I welcome the opportunity to provide a brief update in respect of the fund. In July 2022, I launched the vacant property refurbishment grant as part of the Croí Cónaithe towns fund. The grant benefits those who wish to turn a formerly vacant house or building into their principal private residence, making it their home. When I launched the grant, it was in respect of vacant properties in towns and villages. The initial response was very positive. To maximise the number of vacant properties which could be brought back into use, I announced the expansion of the grant to include eligible vacant properties in both cities and rural areas from 15 November 2022.A grant of up to a maximum of €30,000 is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as principal private residences, including the conversion of a property that has not previously been used as residential. Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed this amount, a maximum top-up grant of €20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict. This brings the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of €50,000. Feedback on the vacant property refurbishment grant has been positive since its launch, with 760 applications nationwide reported to the end of December. I expect the numbers will increase further following the expansion of the grant. The ready to build scheme was launched on 21 September. It is also funded by the Croí Cónaithe towns fund. Under this scheme, local authorities will make serviced sites in towns and villages available to potential individual purchasers for building their homes. These sites will be available at a discount on their market value. My Department is engaging with each local authority in respect of sites that might be suitable for the scheme. My Department is monitoring how both schemes are operating and engaging with the vacant homes officers who have been appointed in each local authority. Data in respect of these schemes are being collated and verified and will shortly be published on my Department's website on a quarterly basis. They will include county-level breakdowns. In 2022, there was no allocation limit set for individual local authorities in respect of the schemes, as it was anticipated that the actual drawdown would be low at the start while the schemes were getting up and running. In 2023, €24 million is available for the schemes and we will keep the question of allocations under review and monitor drawdowns. My Department will be keeping the schemes more generally under continual review, and it is intended that a comprehensive review and evaluation of the Croí Cónaithe towns fund will be undertaken by mid-2024. Acknowledging the administrative overheads involved in delivering both schemes, my Department is providing project management support funding of between €60,000 and €180,000 to each local authority for their delivery. In 2022, €1.38 million was provided to 21 local authorities that applied for this funding. The most efficient home to deliver is the one that already exists. Under Croí Cónaithe, these schemes can play a vital role in delivering homes and revitalising local communities.

As with any scheme, there will initially be a certain period before the scheme kicks in properly. I hope 2023 will see a marked improvement in the number of applicants. Will the Minister of State clarify something? I believe he said there were 760 applications. How many of those were successful? This is a positive scheme and I encourage more people to take it up, but will the Minister of State clarify whether he is likely to amend it further, for example, the income thresholds or other criteria?

Does the Minister of State agree that having one full-time vacant homes officer in each county is a good thing? For a county the size of Cork, though, does he also agree with its chief executive's recent statement that one full-time officer would be needed per town to make the scheme effective? There is one officer in County Louth, another in County Waterford and one in County Cork, yet County Cork is four, five or six times the size of some other counties. Does the Minister of State agree a county like Cork should have many more vacant homes officers to make this scheme work and have an impact? There are many vacant and derelict homes around the country that need to be used.

I acknowledge the work of the Minister, the previous Minister of State in this role, Deputy Burke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on his appointment and wish him the best of luck for the future. We must resource local authorities in terms of the manpower needed to roll this out, but another crucial component will be awareness. I discussed this matter with my local authority in Kerry prior to Christmas. It was expecting to get financing to try to create awareness of Croí Cónaithe's various strands among prospective property owners. Will the Minister of State update the House on whether there will be money for local authorities with the specific aim of increasing general awareness of Croí Cónaithe among prospective homeowners in particular?

I welcome the Croí Cónaithe scheme and the approach it is taking. There are vacant properties in towns and villages across the country. In Macroom, there are vacant properties in the Dunnes Stores apartments, which have been unoccupied since they were built in 2004. Locals are frustrated that these apartments are not available for people to live in. Every effort should be made to make them available. There is a good level of interest in making applications to the scheme. The Minister of State referred to a figure of 760. I hope there will be many more, and people are inquiring about it at my office. Is the Minister of State setting a target with each local authority for how quickly applications are processed so that people who are interested in taking part will know how soon they can get access to the funding and do the requisite work? Are the local authorities achieving those targets?

In 2018 and 2022, planning exemptions allowed some developers to take on vacant buildings. I am speaking about Carlow. This matter is important in terms of beneficial housing schemes. When making compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, on properties and trying to develop them, local authorities are getting caught up in red tape. A high-profile unit in the historic heart of Carlow town centre has come under the Part 8 process and the exemption does not apply. Refurbishment of the unit under Government policy will effectively be delayed by at least two years. In 2022, Carlow met its targets by delivering eight schemes. In 2023, Carlow has to deliver 28 schemes to meet its targets, each scheme demanding a full Part 8 package - tendering, procurement, supervision etc. This is stretching the technical team's ability to deliver. Can we set the bar for planning for all developments, public and private, at the same level? A few simple amendments to Part 8 would escalate town centre first projects and accelerate delivery. I am aware of the Minister of State's dedication and commitment to town centres and vacant properties.

There has been a significant uptake so far, with 716 applications nationwide. In Cork county, 84 people had applied to the end of December. In Cork city, four had applied. The scheme is immensely successful. We want to get it bedded down and to encourage people to apply for it. Even if there is considerable interest, there will not be an issue with capital. The Minister will be able to go to the Cabinet and get extra capital funding. Deputy Stanton's point about vacant homes officers was a good and valid one. We would ask local authorities to apply directly to the Department for additional vacant homes officers. We would look positively on that. We want this scheme to work. We would welcome any suggestion of a positive nature. Deputy Griffin spoke about resourcing local authorities. In Kerry, there were 60 applications to the end of the year.There is huge take-up. It was very much in the same vein as the vacant homes officers. Ask Kerry County Council, Cork County Council and any other local authorities that wish to apply. If they need additional vacant homes officers, the Department will look on such requests favourably in terms of funding. Deputy Aindrias Moynihan spoke about targets. This scheme has just been rolled out. There has been a huge take-up in a relatively short time. The scheme will bed down. We will be interacting with the local authorities to see how they are doing. In a relatively short time, we will be setting targets in terms of a processing time. The key is that the local authorities in the main appear to have been highly efficient in the way they have processed the applications, in that they have come back in such a short period. Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke about a specific Part 8 scheme. Our schemes are about ensuring we can bring properties back into residential use. I ask the Deputy to forward the details of that scheme to the Department and we will look at it in great detail.

However, the scheme is in its early days. Hopefully, that will improve. Can the Minister of State give us a county-by-county breakdown of the figures he has at a later date? I do not expect the Minister of State to have them to hand. I refer to applications and the number of them that have been successfully approved. To follow-on from Deputy Stanton's question on vacant home officers, if he has the figures can the Minister of State clarify whether they all have been employed at this stage across each local authority or how many vacancies still exist?

I stress the word "full-time", that they do not do any other job but that, and that would be a condition of this. In the past, I was told they had ten other jobs and this was the bottom of the list. We need these officers to go out there and to tap on the shoulders of people who own houses that are empty and properties that are derelict, and invite them to talk and let us get this up and running. Would the Minister of State confirm that if Cork County Council applies to the Department for, say, one officer in each municipal district, of which there are eight, ten or 12, that application would be looked on favourably?

That is something that local authorities should be able to tap into to put the scheme out there. That will help take-up. On a related vein, and something I previously raised on a number of occasions, I ask the Minister and the Ministers of State to again engage with the utility companies, for example, ESB Networks, in relation to reconnection fees. These fees are quite punitive. It is yet another barrier. These will be future customers for these companies anyway and there surely should be a better way for people to reconnect old properties to the grid without being charged so much upfront. Can the Department examine that as one less expense people will have, as well as the fees regarding water connections or reconnections, which are another expense? I could say a great deal about the taxation code, about VAT and about different costs in relation to insulation and other costs as well, but those are ones that could be quick wins.

I acknowledge it is a constructive and positive scheme and is only on the go for a number of months at this point. There is good interest. People have been inquiring about it in my office. There are many inquiries locally on it. On the figure of 84 for Cork county, can the Minister of State give a breakdown of how many are approved at this point? The figures the Minister of State has given are for applications. When people are applying on those, they want to get on with doing the job. Having a clear timeline on how quickly one will have the funds available is important for people who want to plan to do the works and get into the house. Have many of them been drawn down at this point? If the Minister of State has details on that, I would be interested. As this scheme is also available for rural homes, I would be interested in whether the Minister of State can give an indication of how many are in the towns or in the rural areas.

I will provide those details to him. I will be looking for the figures from the Minister of State for Carlow and of course for Kilkenny, in addition to those on rural homes, as previous speakers have requested. We are here today because it is such an important and welcome scheme. We have a housing crisis and all the Deputies are in a position where they are trying to get as many houses or buildings up and running as they can. I am looking for that information.

Certainly, we are only looking at the period to the end of December and it is a short timescale in terms of Cork city. I refer to the vacant homes officers. Deputy Stanton raised it as well. If Cork county, Cork city or any local authority makes a business case - it is about volume and about making a business case to the Department - it would be favourably received. As a Department, we have to look at applications in terms of their credibility but at this stage the Department stands receptive to receive these business cases for additional vacant homes officers, and the case in terms of them being full time. There are people out there who have huge knowledge, for instance, former rates collectors. The Deputy knows the people; they are there. Deputy Griffin sought a public awareness campaign. There is now a vacant homes unit specifically set up in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the first time. They are now embarking on a nationwide public awareness campaign. I would have thought that they will feed into the local authorities on that and that will bring great clarity on it. The Deputy makes a valid point in terms of dealing with the utility companies on reconnections. We will take that up with the vacant homes unit within the Department to interact with the utility companies to come up with a protocol in terms of reconnections. With old buildings, we all know how long it takes. That is a valid point. Deputy Aindrias Moynihan asked about the breakdown. Once again, in terms of Cork county, the rural scheme only got up and running in November. The number there, obviously, would be very tight but it is something that we can look at. We have not precise figures broken down per county or local authority area. Roughly, 20% of applications at this stage are going through the system and have been virtually approved. There shows reasonable efficiency within the local authorities. To give Deputy Murnane O'Connor the figures, Carlow had six applications up to the end of December. Kilkenny, which the Deputy represents as well, had 18. The Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, representing in the same constituency, is obviously keen that this would be pushed. The type of detail the Deputy is looking for will be published quarterly and if there is additional detail that the Deputy would like to see included, let the Deputy make us aware so that we can do so. This scheme is very much up and running. This is a scheme I am very excited about. It is a scheme the public will engage with. We need this. This is all about a town centred approach, bringing homes back into use for families and other people.

The devil is always in the detail and there are a couple of questions my colleagues and I have. My question at the outset is that there are scenarios, and I have come across them myself, where in a multi-unit development one or more owners want to progress works and other owners say they are okay and stand back. How does that get addressed both practically and in terms of within the scheme? I have a second question and I do not know if I will get to it later. How does that work?

I thank all the Deputies for their questions and the number of Deputies asking shows how important this matter is in relation to legacy defects. I know Deputies of all parties and none have been working hard on this. We know there are significant legacy defects in a large number of apartments and duplexes and as a result many owners of apartments and duplexes face really difficult and dire financial situations alongside, and we cannot forget this, the personal stress they undergo on a daily basis that is caused when defects arise in their buildings. The Government and I are absolutely committed to helping those whose lives have been impacted by this issue. The programme for Government sets out a number of commitments in respect of this important policy area of addressing building defects. These include a commitment to examine defects in housing, having regard to the matters at hand. In this regard I did receive Government approval on 18 January last to draft legislation to support the remediation of fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose-built apartment buildings including duplexes constructed between 1991 and 2013. I established a working group within two months of my appointment as Minister. The working group did superb work and that involved all stakeholders and again I want to commend in particular the residents, the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners Network for their incredible work. Others, such as the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and the local authorities really fed into this. For the first time we have a significant survey of the scale of the defects. Some 28,000 homes were surveyed for the work we did. The working group report came to me at the end of July, I brought it to Cabinet in September and then I brought forward recommendations last week. It will be a fully-funded scheme. It has to be on a full building basis. That is one of the challenges. The funding has to go to the owner-management company. With an apartment block, particularly in the area of fire defects, but also water ingress and structural issues, one cannot just do three quarters of the apartments in the block. All of them have to be done. I am optimistic about is that around 12% of apartments and duplexes have already been done. Where residents and owner-management companies found they had very serious issues they went ahead and they remediated and they are carrying the cost of that. On the Government decision I sought on 18 January, I can again confirm to the Dáil that costs already incurred will be covered under the scheme for certified work. That is important that it is certified in the overall context of the scheme. Around 32% of these apartments, between 62,500 and up to 100,000 units, are already in the process of getting work done or about to contract it. I want to say to people to go ahead and do that work and not to delay. There are very serious issues relating to people's safety as well. Those costs will be covered on a full-building basis and fully funded also. We will stand the scheme up and it will take most of this year to get the legislation and regulation together about the workings of this scheme. The Housing Agency will be centrally involved in this also and we will utilise the expertise it brings in the area of mica defective block and also pyrite and infill. We will resource the local authorities. The local authority fire services will carry out the surveys and certify works also. I want to move this on but it is important for residents to know that this Government has their back on this and we want this work to continue. I will work with all members of the Dáil and Seanad to try to expedite the legislation as quickly as possible. This scheme will be with us for a few years and as with mica and defective block we need to get it right. Right now people can proceed, it is fully funded and we are committed to ensuring home owners not only get their homes remediated but have an opportunity to get their lives back on track. I have engaged directly with them also and was at a webinar recently with over 400 members of different management companies right across the country advising of what I will bring forward, which I have done. It is something I have seen in my area of Dublin-Fingal. I have friends, constituents and I know people across the country who have been affected by this. We will move apace on this and we welcome the input of all Deputies who have shown an interest in this already. If I could say in the interests of the House, we received this morning, and it is a pity Deputy O'Callaghan is not here, the CSO figures for the housing completion figures for last year. We are talking about the first year of Housing for All. Last year, 29,851 homes were completed in 2022 which is significantly above the target the Government set of 24,600. We completed 9,184 in quarter four, a 31% increase on 2022. They are the highest figures for a quarter since the CSO began collating them in 2011. The increase in completions is 45% up on 2021. Housing for All is taking hold and in areas of new-build we can see that and we are as committed to tackling and grasping the nettle in relation to defects, both in apartments and duplexes and in relation to defective block in parts of our country also.

On one of the more positive aspects, as he has mentioned, I was concerned as to the retrospective application where some owners may have gone out on a limb and at their own cost, their own time and dime as they say. It may have been a struggle to do so but they took action themselves. It is very fair and right that they are included and that there is a retrospective application. I welcome that. One of my questions, and I have experienced it myself in assisting homeowners, is where there are common areas, a shared terrace or roof or fire walling, boundary walls etc. that are impacted. I am not sure how the scheme applies to where homeowner one says they want to invoke the scheme and engage and homeowner two for whatever reason says they do not want workers coming in and are happy as they are. It seems a bit difficult and I am not sure how that is envisaged in the scheme. Another question is in terms of a point of contact. There is an agency being established and I know the legislation still has to go through the Houses but who do people contact at this stage or in the near future if they have issues and want to begin to engage. They are two practical questions. It is really important, and I know this is in the scheme, but what is the detail to ensure it does not happen again? We have seen bad practices and bad history play out of the last couple of decades and in the lifetime of the scheme and even before and probably after the period 1991 to 2013. What do we do to prevent it happening again? I know there are very welcome things like a register of tradesmen, but what about recourse? The Exchequer is on the hook all the time it seems for the remediation schemes and it is right the State should step in as a guarantor of last resort but what about the people who actually built these buildings, who developed them, worked on them, funded them, financed them and who advised on them? There were architects, consultants, planners etc. What is the recourse to them, to say they did the crime now do the time? How does that work and is it envisaged as part of this funding?

They have been campaigning for this for a long time as the only just and workable solution. They were also struck by the lack of detail and we still have a lack of detail today and they know, unfortunately, that the people affected by mica were promised a 100% redress scheme more than a year ago and they are still waiting for that and in reality the small print of that scheme means that it will be substantially less than 100%. They are determined to stand together with everybody. Everybody affected by defects needs to be given 100% redress and then we need to go after the people responsible.I have a few questions on the details. First, when will the further details be announced? Separate to the legislation, the Minister can outline how it is going to work in much more detail than has been done so far. Second, I take the Minister's point that people should not delay. They should continue. There are serious safety issues and work must be done. Emergency funding was mentioned. Can that be rolled out quicker? It will cost people who need to get work done in an apartment block €20,000 per person. Most people cannot afford this. As it currently stands, that is still not going to happen because most people will not be able to afford it. Therefore, emergency measures must be put in place whereby owners' management companies, OMCs, can access funds. For example, there could be a short-term scheme of the Housing Finance Agency giving low-cost or zero-interest loans to OMCs knowing they will get the money back from the scheme in the future. That would mean works could proceed. I got a text from a person who received a threatening lawyer's letter from an agency saying the person had to pay up. For things such as this, it is still not going to work. How will things other than fire defects be judged? Will defective balconies be included? I refer to houses in estates that were built at the same time as apartments and duplexes and are affected by the same sort of issues. Will, for example, balconies also be included in this scheme?

I very much welcomed the Minister when he said retrospectiveness would be considered in the building defects redress scheme, as did the people in Mayo and Donegal. I want to tease that out further with the Minister. He said earlier that it was provided the work was certified. Will he better explain what we need to do? We need to give homeowners, with whom I spoke this morning, guidance as to how they can prepare in terms of the audit trail that might be needed. We are only talking about a very small number of houses. We have fought for the inclusion of retrospectiveness for years, as has the Minister's colleague in Mayo, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary. We are very much at one with this. We want to get it right and for homeowners to be prepared and have everything ready for when it is available.

As I mentioned earlier, and as I discussed with both the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, a very small number of properties under the defective concrete block scheme may have had work done already. What I said about certification is that a qualified engineer has to certify that the work is of a required standard, that it is invoiced correctly and that a paper trail in relation to that work being done exists. We are finalising the regulations on the defective concrete block scheme. I will engage with residents through the homeowner liaison next week to show them the draft regulations in the Deputy's own county, in Donegal and other affected counties. It is a national scheme. It was recently said on RTÉ that there were counties that were locked out of this scheme. That is absolutely not the case. The legislation we passed in the Dáil provides for other counties to be added by way of regulation. For example, we added County Clare under the old scheme, which an Cathaoirleach Gníomhach, Deputy Carey, is well aware and for which he campaigned. The scheme is open. The local authority will put the submission together and say, for example, that it has 30 homes in Wexford. That submission comes to us and we will assess it and add them to the scheme. We will work through that in the coming weeks. I want the regulations on defective concrete blocks published by the end of February, subject to all the stakeholders agreeing. I will go in reverse order and in response to Deputy Paul Murphy's question, there is a very good document on frequently asked questions, FAQs, which I sent to many of the OMCs, about what happens next. What I will do is establish an implementation group, which worked well on defective concrete blocks, to work through these issues, particularly emergency funding. I am not closed to that at all. In some areas, we allowed that in the defective concrete block scheme such as for immediate safety issues. I do not envisage the use of loans, to be honest. I do not want to complicate it too much. It will take us a year to get this through. I expect legislation will take a year to progress. I will do it as quickly as possible. I will ask for the co-operation of Opposition Deputies. Indeed, Government Deputies have been heavily engaged in this. The scheme is fully funded.  In respect of Deputy Lawless's question, some 12% of apartments and duplexes have been remediated and one third are in the process of this. We may from time to time come across a person who does not want to engage with that. However, all common areas are included in this because one cannot remediate an apartment block without dealing with its common areas and we are going to do that. We have some experience of that in the context of pyrite in infill. There could be an investor living abroad who does not want to engage but we get through it. It relates to a very small percentage of cases. On legal recourse, I am establishing a senior counsel review. Fundamentally, the reason this is happening is because of very poor workmanship and, in some instances, bad materials. Those who were responsible know who they are. They have a moral responsibility to contribute to the scheme. I am looking at legal avenues - it will not be easy; it will be complex - as to how we could seek recompense in that area. There has been a market failure. As a Deputy who represents an area that has been plagued by defects such as these and pyrite before that, I believe the State must step in on behalf of its citizens. All these citizens, be they in Mayo, Donegal, north Dublin or Kildare, are taxpayers. It is a good use of the resources we have. It is important for people to get their lives back on track. On a point already raised, I want people to continue to work they are doing. The implementation group will be established very soon. I will meet homeowner representatives next week to structure that within my Department, work through some of these issues and move it forward as quickly as possible. I will have another webinar shortly, as I did before Christmas which people found useful, to which all OMCs will be invited. This is a priority for us. As to the question of what else is covered, it includes water ingress and structural defects. They are based on the original build. As for maintenance or lack of maintenance over time, a lift that is broken because it was not maintained would not be included. It pertains to apartments and duplexes. We are very clear about the working group report. It does not, at this stage, cover houses within the development. It is apartments and duplexes because that is where the occurrence of this problem is predominant. We have done the most extensive survey ever, which included some 28,000 homes. Not only have the homeowner representatives been incredibly helpful, so too have many other stakeholders, such as Engineers Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland. The Oireachtas joint committee of the previous Dáil did a very good piece of work on this. I am optimistic and hopeful that we will be able to work as a collective to move this forward as quickly as we can.

He addressed most of the points I raised. If he does not have time to respond further, he might take the following point away as a consideration. Management companies will play a central role in this, which is set out in the draft legislation and the scheme. There are still several legacy issues with management companies around the country. Some have been convened and some have been incorporated. Some operate well and some, unfortunately, operate in a dysfunctional manner. I saw the situation of an apartment owner in my constituency who had to evacuate the apartment for a couple of years while remediation was being carried out. They sought to charge the individual management fees for the privilege of renting accommodation elsewhere while his apartment was vacant because they had constructed it incorrectly. Therefore, several issue have arisen. Multi-unit developments legislation was brought in around 2014 and is probably due for update. I am not sure if there are plans for management company legislation in terms of tidying up the whole sphere of how management companies operate, how they are convened and how they are accountable, because they will play a central role in this scheme going forward. Perhaps there is an opportunity to look at that space and tidy things up. There are a lot of legacy issues there.

As it was happening in a widespread way, in terms of recouping the costs, is there not a case for a tax on the profits of the construction industry responsible for this problem? Second, if the Minister has time, will he expand on what it means for the retrospective work to be certified? He is talking about it being certified now, retrospectively, by the fire brigade saying this was necessary. Third, if homes in developments that were done as a whole are not included in these schemes, we will just have to come back to this problem. Why not include the homes in these developments, which include apartments and duplexes, now?

The Government's housing policy is pushing more families into homelessness, pushing up rents and house prices, forcing more and more of our young people to consider emigrating, damaging public confidence and undermining our economy. It is reported in today's edition of The Irish Times that unpublished research by the Housing Commission has found that the number of new build homes that will be needed is between 42,000 and 62,000 per year and yet this Government's failed housing plan only targets 33,000 homes per year - a plan destined to fail and a plan planning to fail. The targets in the Government's housing plan have been widely criticised not just by Sinn Féin but by industry and academic experts and now the plan has been fatally undermined by the very housing commission established by the Government. The implications of this for struggling renters and those struggling to buy a home are very stark. The Government's housing plan is not failing on its own terms, but it is destined to fail. According to this research, even if the Government met its targets by 2030, there would be a shortfall of as many as 245,000 homes. That is alarming for everybody - those struggling for find affordable accommodation and those who will need affordable accommodation.  As far back as 2020, Sinn Féin argued that when pent-up demand for social and affordable housing is taken into account, the real housing demand was above 40,000 new homes per year but since then, we have had three years of Government under-supply despite continued population growth so it is obvious that the Government's housing targets need to be immediately revised significantly upwards. The current targets are not based on evidence or objective assessment of need. Instead they are the result of political manoeuvring - boasting that targets are met when the targets are clearly flawed. This must stop. Why must it stop? It is because it is too serious a matter.  Homelessness is reaching record levels with increases across every category, including children. Renters are facing extortionate rents with no capacity to save and little hope of ever owning their own home. According to the State of the Nation poll carried out by Virgin Media, more than half of renters now worry that they will not be able to pay their rent in the next 12 months. House prices have smashed Celtic tiger peaks with those struggling to get a foot on the property ladder now doubting if they will ever own their home. This is draining the hope and harming the life prospects of many of our people. A survey found that 92% of 18 to 24-year-olds now fear they will never be able to buy their own home. This is what our young people are thinking. No wonder that half of young Irish adults are considering emigration beaten down as they are by high living costs and the Government's housing crisis that is never ending.  The Government must change course and commit to revising these figures immediately. Otherwise it is condemning Irish people to a worsening and permanent housing crisis. Will the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage publish the findings of the Housing Commission's research that pointed out the fatal flaws in the Government's plan? Will the Government immediately revise its inadequate and deeply flawed housing targets? Will it give responsibility for verifying annually, reviewing and publishing data on housing need to a fully independent group that would include the ESRI and the Housing Agency?

Of course, we want to smash those targets. All of us in this House want our younger people to be able to get a home and raise a family. This concern is not an exclusive commodity. It belongs to everyone. We are committed to doing everything we can. We had a target last year of 24,600 houses. An hour ago, the CSO came out with the figures for last year. The figure was not 24,600; it was 29,851. This is way higher and I would like it to go even higher because we have a real problem that we must address but we should be honest and accurate about what is happening. The report from the Housing Commission was commissioned by the Government. We asked for it. We are the people who brought forward that analysis. The commission will presents its work in July as part of getting the analysis right to get the solutions right. We will need to do more and go further and higher because more people are coming into the country than were expected. The commission's analysis relates to 2050 while the Housing for All targets relate to 2030 so the Deputy needs to be careful that he is not comparing apples and oranges. Of course we must go higher than that 33,000 limit. The question is how do we do it and the quality of the housing. This is about housing in the right place. It ain't just a numbers game. We need to make sure we follow through on the national planning framework so we build new communities with high-quality housing. This is important along with the numbers.  One of the key vehicles for delivering it is the Land Development Agency because the State will have to take a bigger role. As I understand it, Sinn Féin opposed the Land Development Agency and would get rid of it. This would be a mistake because the Land Development Agency provides a mechanism whereby we can use public land to develop cost-rental housing that is in the right place and is high-quality and lower-cost with a saving of 30%. Sinn Féin would throw that away straightaway if it was in Government. I fear what this would do to the delivery of housing numbers. Deputy Ó Broin is nodding. He agrees Sinn Féin would get rid of the Land Development Agency. How then could you get access to and use lands in Dublin Port or at Heuston Station?

The Land Development Agency is perfectly suited and is the right agency to deliver that sort of expansion. There will be no shortage of funding and ambition. It takes time and is not easy with the cost of building having gone up. We can bring it down by using the Land Development Agency on public land as well as the private sector. We need so many different parts of the solution and that is what we are committed to in Housing for All. Project Tosaigh, which involves €0.5 billion, will help make that happen. In instances where the market is failing and where those build-to-rent apartments, particularly in the centre of our towns and cities are not going to built, I believe we should step in and take on that development and not be afraid of the State doing more.

A total of 2,500 fewer social houses than what was promised last year were delivered. This is the record of this Government. The Government set up this commission. It should have looked at housing need before it came out with its flawed plan. What Sinn Féin, academics and researchers have been telling it, namely, that the numbers are not adequate, has now been proven. The Housing Commission is saying the Government is way off target when it comes to what is needed. The target needs to be between 42,000 and 62,000 every year.  The problem, which is so serious, is that this Government is planning to fail. The consequences of this will be desperate. Half of young people are planning to emigrate while others are locked into spiralling rents they cannot afford in a cost-of-housing crisis. Thousands upon thousands of people are living in emergency accommodation, which is becoming a permanent feature of this Government. Does the Government now accept that the targets it has set in Housing for All are fatally flawed on the basis of the research by the Housing Commission and that they need to be immediately revised upwards and delivered on?

It is a deal which we believe is wrong on many levels. I have already voiced my grave concerns about it in this House, as have my colleagues, Deputies Kelly and Sherlock. It will fundamentally be an arrangement which will facilitate the handing over of millions of euro of public money into the wallets of private investors and vulture funds. We are gravely concerned about that. As we know, the deal has drawn immense criticism and outrage from across all sectors, urban and rural alike, from environmentalists, farmers and local communities. Many of our constituents in Dublin Bay South voiced serious disquiet to us, as the Minister will know. Even Deputies on Government benches have made clear their opposition to the partnership between Coillte and Gresham House. It begs the question of what is Government policy on forestry in Ireland. If there is concern on Government benches about this deal, as there appears to be, then will it be abandoned? Will there be a change in tack to address the crisis in the forestry sector? There is a bigger issue here too. The reality is that the forestry sector has been in crisis for many years. The crisis does not only affect those working in forestry but clearly has a significant impact on our ability to meet our vital climate targets because we cannot meet those targets unless every sector is working towards them. We cannot meet them without large-scale afforestation. The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss was clear that State-owned woodlands should be recognised and managed as a strategic, long-term national asset for the common good. The State must take control of planting biodiverse forests and put an end to the expanse of clear-fell monoculture across the country. We all know, and I know the Minister knows, that Ireland's ancient native forests have been devastated by hundreds of years of unsustainable mismanagement. We must prevent further destruction by profit-hungry funds but we do not even have a working forestry programme. The Government is meeting just one quarter of its own afforestation targets. The licensing system is in disarray, with delays of two years for the approval of afforestation licences.

It seems that the Government cannot see the wood for the trees, if I may say. Failures in the licensing system have made the large-scale planting of trees and woodlands an impossible endeavour for many farmers and nurseries. The delays are leading to many dropping out of the system. I have been told that approximately one third of those approved for planting are dropping out before any trees can be planted. Instead of proceeding with the Gresham House deal, why is the Government not focusing on reform of the afforestation system and making afforestation a viable option for farmers and landowners in Ireland? Will the Minister share the Government's policy to explain why the Government is not focusing on this? If this is not the Government's preferred model, as it appears the Gresham House deal is not, then has Coillte gone rogue on the Government?

It needs to change. It has done a brilliant job but it was legislated for in the late 1980s when the emphasis and focus was on privatisation and commercial lumber production. That has changed. Coillte's mandate will be changed. It is already changing towards a closer-to-nature model. We recognise that what has been done with forestry, while it delivered acres and lumber, did not deliver better biodiversity or a better nature solution in our country. Coillte too is part of that change. To help it do that, I believe we need to look at the state aid rules which, in 2003, under legal challenge, restricted what Coillte can do. We will go to Brussels, as we are doing for a variety of different issues related to climate change, to get different rules. We will also get Coillte involved in afforestation on public lands and other lands which are not covered under the likes of this deal that was done with the private sector. That private investment in forestry is taking place anyway. The Coillte deal will at least allow it to be open forest. In my mind, this cannot be the main solution because the scale of change that will be highlighted in the land use review that this Government is introducing, which will be the defining indication of what type of forestry is needed where, is not just about the number of acres but how we restore nature and tackle the biodiversity crisis as well as the climate crisis, which clear-fell monoculture systems do not do. We will need some timber for lumber production for use in buildings and so on. We are not saying there should be absolutely none.

We are hearing from those involved in forestry and nurseries, including farmers and environmentalists, that it is simply not operational. The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, told the Seanad earlier this week that the state aid application has not yet been submitted. The Minister said it himself. He plans to go to Brussels but has not gone yet. Once again, the Government is heavy on ambition and setting targets, but light on delivery and actual outcomes. We need to see outcomes here. The Gresham House deal will not deliver the necessary outcome. It is not just us in Opposition making these critiques. In a leaked document which the Irish Examiner reports on today, the European Commission has criticised Ireland's forestry policy in a scathing letter, highlighting particular concerns about planting on peatlands and the impact on birds. The Commission has been critical of this. The state aid application which is the bedrock of the Government's proposed change in forestry policy has not even been submitted yet. It is hard to see how we can expect or anticipate any real delivery of change in forestry.

Some 80% of the people of this State are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. That seems to have been forgotten about by the political establishment. Figures provided to me by the Minister for Finance show that the Government is profiting in terms of VAT from the crisis. Last year, the Government received more in VAT on fuel and energy than ever before when many families are living on overdrafts and many more are in hock to moneylenders. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party are taking more in VAT and fuel taxes than they did in any previous year. The VAT on electricity last year reached record heights of €381 million. People struggling to pay for the heating of their homes pay 40% more on VAT on electricity last year than the previous year. Hard-pressed motorists are paying 30% more on petrol than they did in the previous year. Diesel is 20% more. Cumulatively, they have spent €700 million on VAT on those two fuel sources. VAT on gas and oil and solid fuel is reaching record highs. That is before we even talk about the Government's imposition of carbon taxes. Yes, the Government gave a few bob back but it pilfered that money from people's pockets in the first place. Many people are looking nervously at the planned increase in fuel excise duty that the Government plans for February. The Minister has stood before us many times and said there is nothing more that this Government can do to help people with the crisis in the cost of living but there is. What is said is patently untrue. The Government could do what the Spanish Government did and stop hammering people and reduce the VAT on fuel. Will the Minister categorically say there will be no rise in fuel excise in February? Another issue which is hitting people really hard in their pockets is that of mortgage interest rates. People are struggling to pay them now. Most mortgage holders will be paying far more in the next year. European Central Bank rate rises mean that tracker mortgage holders will have to fork out an additional €3,000 on their mortgages on average. However, the people who are most hammered are the 100,000 mortgage holders who have been sold out to the vulture funds. Families in the grip of those vulture funds will be paying rates of as high as 7% and they will not be able to lock into fixed rates. This is a two-tier mortgage market. It was created by the last Government and it is presided over by this one. Some 100,000 families are now second-class citizens among mortgage holders. They have no protection from profiteering mortgage vulture funds.

They had already risen because he had been turning off the tap deliberately in advance and using energy as a weapon of war. The inflation that resulted and the cost-of-living crisis that came from that was unprecedented, probably since the early 1970s and the oil-price crisis. Any independent economic analysis of any credit or note would assess that this Government's response in the last year protected our people. It did not adopt some of the populist politics that the Tories and others here argued for, which would undermine the economic credibility of the State and its ability to protect the people. What we were able to do this by reducing excise duty, VAT, public transport fares and the cost of childcare, by providing each household with €800 upfront credit payments, by increasing social welfare payments both in once-off and permanent rises in payments, by introducing restrictions and moratoriums on cutting off energy supply and other measures. I could go on. There was a whole range of measures that the ESRI and others have analysed and said that we got it right and that we have protected the most vulnerable in particular in this incredible and unprecedented time. We do not know what will happen in the coming year. Please God, that war will come to an end. We have said clearly that we will continue to protect our people but we should not go down the route of populist solutions where we say we will never raise another tax and we will not reverse any of the VAT cuts. In the end that would lead us to a position where our economy would not be sound and we would not be able to protect and provide for our people into the future. In that populist route lies real danger. There is a responsibility on Government to ensure the basic economic protection of the State's finances so that we can provide the measures when we needs them. We did it during the Covid pandemic and we unwound the measures in a way that worked. That is what we will do again this spring and what we will need to do. We will be attentive if circumstances change. We will keep an eye on international prices. We must keep an eye on what the economy is doing, on employment and on people's welfare. I refer to false simple promises that we would never reverse a single measure and that we would not do what we did during Covid, namely, bring in big supports and appropriately withdraw them, although not off a cliff edge, to which we are all committed and on which we are all agreed. We would not do this on the never-never, where it is put off and at every local election and general election to come, we would say we will not do it now because it will be politically unpopular. That reckless way would really endanger our people and the protection of our people which is what we want to do.

Putin does not set the VAT rates in this State. Putin does not regulate the vulture funds in this State. In those two aspects, he is irrelevant to the conversation. The electricity credit is less than all the increases in all the fuel and energy taxes in the last year. The Government has taken more money out of people's pockets than it has given back with the electricity credit. On mortgages, the vulture funds bought them at bargain basement prices. They should have a lower cost base but they are putting families to the pins of their collars. They are pushing many families into arrears. Maybe that is what they want; maybe they want to crystalise their investments now when prices are so high. The Government said people would be protected. Yesterday I asked the Governor of the Central Bank what levers the Central Bank had to protect families being charged 7% by vulture funds. He said they have none. That is the key issue. What will the Government do to help those families? Will it regulate those vulture funds and maybe even put a super-normal profit tax on those vulture funds in the same way that has been done to energy companies? What will it do about VAT and the protection of mortgage holders?

Those electricity credits have been well timed and well placed. They particularly have helped families in default or at risk of default and not able to pay their bills. Each time they have kicked in, we have seen a dramatic drop in the number of families at most stress. Therefore, it has been exactly the right measure. By contrast, at the time there was talk about all sorts of weird caps which were completely uncertain and would not have delivered functional support. The energy credit has not been the only one. It has come with all the other measures - about 12 by my count. We need to wean off those and do it in a balanced way, subject to what happens in the war.

The Government has also completely failed to provide on any clarity as to whether the reduced 9% VAT rate for electricity, gas, petrol and diesel will continue beyond 1 March. People need certainty. The lack of clarity from the Government in this area is causing significant stress and anxiety for tens of thousands of people. Furthermore, the hospitality sector, which employs 260,000 people and whose season kicks off on 1 March, with bookings going on at the moment, is being left in limbo once again as the Government has made no decision on whether the VAT rate for the sector will continue on the temporary lower rate beyond 1 March. They need certainty. They need to fill rooms, take bookings and employ people. Leaving such families, motorists, rural residents and the entire hospitality sector in a state of limbo in the middle of a catastrophic cost-of-living crisis is outrageous and underlines the wishy-washy nature of the Government. Ministers are in here defending the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and dealing with everything bar what they should be dealing with. They are letting the big guys like Gresham House take over our country. Look after the daoine óga and daoine beaga, please. The lack of clarity in this policy is incredible. It is clear the Government lacks any leadership here, or is it that the three parts are fighting with each other? I heard the Minister say on radio that he thought that excise duty on fuel would need to increase because the cost of fuel had come down. Does he really want to cripple motorists, hauliers and everybody else? Inflation and the cost-of-living pressures affecting families are extremely harsh at the moment. Families and small businesses deserve to know what is happening. They will deal with it as best they can, but they deserve certainty. The Government's failure to provide clarity here is appalling. I know Government backbenchers are in agreement with what we are saying here, but the tail is wagging the dog because the Minister stated he wanted excise duty to increase again along with carbon tax and everything else. Earlier he said we should come down from the mountains and plant trees on good land. I say he should go back into the hills and stay there with the wolves and everybody else if he will not look after the people he was elected to look after. He can plant whatever trees he wants to plant in the wetlands and the wolves will keep him warm at night. However, they will not heat homes, provide food on the table or support the 260,000 jobs in the hospitality sector. Is the Government trying to wipe out that industry altogether? We need decisive action. The Minister told Deputy Tóibín that there would not be a cliff edge and the Government would deal with it. When? It is only four and a half weeks until 1 March and what will we do then? Will we wait for another crisis?

That scale of price increase, which no one could predict would continue or otherwise, would be devastating for Irish business. Even though prices have come down dramatically since that spike, it has been very challenging for many businesses. That is why we introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, one of the other measures that was introduced as part of the range of different solutions to the problem - I did not mention it to Deputy Tóibín. It has been surprising, we need to look at the real reasons, that the uptake has been much lower than expected. We will look at that as part of the review of the range of measures. No one knows for certain what is happening with energy prices; it depends on the war. Five or six weeks ago I believe I said publicly that I expected gas prices to remain at their very high level for the next two years. That was the best advice from the International Energy Agency and the European Commission and any analysis available to me. It has changed in the past five or six weeks for a variety of reasons. Europe has not used as much gas. The stores in Europe are nearly 80% full, whereas this time last year they would have been down at about 30%. We are going into this refilling season in spring and summer. It has also been a slightly warmer winter than average. For that and other reasons, the price of gas has come down very significantly from what it was five or six weeks ago. That will not kick into home bills for some time. It will depend because each supply company has different circumstances in terms of how far forward they are hedged. Some might even be hedged a year in advance. They might have bought gas at very expensive prices last summer and autumn and consequently would have very high price points into this year and up to the end of the year. Others may not have hedged their position and may be able to bring their prices down quickly. There are about 13 different supply companies, all of which have different circumstances. However, we want to bring that down. The Deputy will recall the highest price of petrol and diesel was about €2.15 a litre.

The price of oil has been relatively steady at about $80 a barrel on the international markets. In those circumstances we need to consider restoring our tax base. The benefit of excise and VAT is that they help to provide a stable income which allows us to pay for the public service pay increases we need to deliver. They allow us to provide for social welfare increases and go further in October's budget. I could outline a long list of what we need spend money on. There is a responsibility to retain the income stream to pay for those vital services for our people.

While the Minister will not acknowledge it, it is not complicated to calculate the amount of tax the Government takes for each litre of petrol and diesel. It is as simple as that. Will the Minister to confirm to the Dáil today whether the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector, the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which he mentioned, and the excise cut for petrol and diesel will be extended beyond the end of February? That is a simple question. People need certainty. The 260,000 people employed in the hospitality sector and their employers need certainty. The Minister referred to a slow uptake of the TBESS; it is confined to electricity. I have been contacted by people using oil or gas other than town gas and could not get the TBESS. The Government is making it tricky. The Minister is making it sound as if people did not need or want it. These are the games he is playing with people's lives. The public deserves a government that will provide certainty. It appears we will not get certainty and rather it will be day after day and issue after issue. People need clarity and certainty that they will be able to heat their homes and go to work. Industry, farms and everybody else who depends on these measures need to know they will continue and they will have certainty.

The Governor of the Central Bank came before the Committee on Finance yesterday and made clear to me and others that he expects rates to increase by another 1% by March. The process will begin next week. That rate hike will immediately affect 300,000 people who are on tracker mortgages. It will mean having to pay thousands of euro more in interest this year. It also affects more than 100,000 families who have had their mortgages sold to vulture funds. There was a commitment from the Government that they would not be any worse off but they are far worse off. Many of these individuals are already paying a 7% interest rate in the light of recent hikes. By March, they will be paying 8%. The Minister must understand the issue. We have seen the detail. For some of the affected families, it will mean an increase of €5,000 in interest payments compared with the amount they were paying in June last year. That will be a breaking point for those families. What can the Government do? Is it not now time for the Government to reintroduce tailored, targeted and time-bound mortgage interest relief to relieve some of the pressures on these families?

There are reliefs available for the rental sector, which the Deputy would acknowledge is an area in need of real support. Returning to a point I made earlier to Deputy Tóibín, the Central Bank has the key regulatory role. It does not set the interest rates on commercial operators, but when it comes to the commercial decisions, it does have a role about how to protect the most vulnerable customers and how to deal with those facing particular difficulty. We have learned over the years that the relationship between the mortgage holder and the relevant company is critical. In that respect, the Central Bank has a key role to play. Mortgage interest relief is a matter for the budget. There were calls for a budget every month during the crisis last year. I do not think that was the right approach. The right approach for us is to engage in the budgetary process, which, as the Deputy knows, runs from April to October. It is not as if the budget is done in one day. There is an initial statement for the European Commission and the summer economic statement. Decisions about mortgage and tax supports-----

Yet, such workers are paid much less than equivalent staff employed directly by the State, despite many of them propping up many State services. In October last year, we in the Labour Party brought forward a motion which would have delivered pay parity for these vulnerable workers in the community and voluntary sector. We have seen no action from the Government since then, despite the fact the Government waved that motion through. The national executive of the Fórsa trade union is now backing a proposal for strike action in a number of community and voluntary sector agencies. If it goes ahead, that strike action will affect many staff and, crucially, the many people for whom those staff are caring and providing invaluable supports. The last thing any of these workers want is to take to the picket line. Will the Government face up to its responsibility and give workers in the community and voluntary sector the pay rise they deserve?

There is a lot of understanding and sympathy within the Government for the case the Deputy is making because workers in section 39 organisations are doing very important caring and other valuable work for the State. They are not directly employed by the State, but that should not absolve us or the State from looking to address disparities where they exist. It is a complicated issue. Trade unions and others are involved in the resolution. I understand the Department of Health has the key role in terms of working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to resolve what in my mind is an anomaly that needs to be resolved, in that certain categories of workers are not being treated the same as those doing similar work. The issue will not be easily or immediately resolved but I would like to see the issue resolved.

I have received hundreds of emails from constituents on the issue. A protest about the issue is happening outside the gates of Leinster House now. The Minister and his Government have been caught out by the public in allowing a deal to go ahead that they should never have entertained. I am also sure everyone concerned about the Coillte deal will be equally as exercised when they read in today's Irish Examiner a piece by Paul Hosford about the EU's scathing criticism of the national forestry strategy that was designed by the Minister's party colleague, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett. The letter from the EU criticises the inappropriate afforestation on sensitive habitats, the planting on peatlands, the impact on bird species, such as the curlew, which will be extinct within ten years, and the planting and river catchments critical to pearl mussels. These forestry and biodiversity failures have occurred on the Minister's watch. How can he and the Green Party, which has never been as well represented in government, stand over this?

The workers have been driven to strike because of the refusal of their employer to recognise their union of choice, namely, Mandate. Because of the so-called voluntarist model of industrial relations here, there is no legal mechanism to force the employer to engage with the union except by the workers exercising their right to strike. It is an important strike for that reason. If the strike is successful, it will make it easier for every Corrib Oil and H2 Group outlet to have a union contract, leading to better terms and conditions, paid-for training, realistic pay scales and a better environment for everyone. I encourage the workers at the other 20 Corrib Oil outlets and the other 14 H2 Group outlets to join the union. Does the Minister agree that the employer should recognise the union?

One constituent is owed more than €400,000 since last October for accommodation he has provided. Unless he is paid, he will have to withdraw that accommodation. Nobody wants that. What is the delay? The second issue is the need for good, timely communication with local communities about the location of refugee accommodation. Lack of clear information allows rumours to spread. The damage is done and is impossible to repair. One constituent gave a house to a Ukrainian family before there was any money involved. That family subsequently returned to Ukraine. Since the end of last September, that family has been trying to get another Ukrainian family into that house but the family is being bounced from one agency to another, be it the local authority, Red Cross, or the International Organisation for Migration, IOM. Generous, decent people are beginning to lose patience. I want to ask for a more timely response.

Of those, 46,000 are in hotels and guesthouses. That is more than 700 individual contracts. I recognise that in the latter half of last year a backlog grew in regard to prompt payment. We put in additional resources to address that. We shrunk the backlog. We did not entirely clear it. We will work with the Deputy in regard to the particular provider of whom she spoke. I take on board the point on communication. It is important. When we are opening new accommodation we try to let Deputies and local authority members know. We are looking to build a unit in my Department that will be designed around that in order that we can do that on a more proactive basis. Obviously, where there are bad faith actors, and there are some bad faith actors in this, sometimes we are responding to rumours that have absolutely no truth whatsoever. In regard to the house, is that a shared house?

I asked the question of the Minister before Christmas when it was said that the policy view of his Department would be established by the year's end. I understand this report was initially meant to be reviewed in quarter 1 of 2022. It was delayed due to Covid-19 and that is understandable, but where are we in regard to private wire and direct line renewables? Given the energy restrictions we face into the future, it is imperative we establish that policy position.

We are going to introduce the ability for private lines so that industry will be able to generate its own power and have battery storage and other systems that will allow it to be part of not just meeting our immediate energy security needs, which are very real, but also the need for decarbonisation. I will have to come back to the Deputy on the exact date on which the rules will be changed. However, we are committed to moving in that direction. One thing that might give some encouragement in the interim is that last year was a record year for the deployment of renewable power in our country, in both solar and wind energy. I was also informed yesterday when I was working on this that, in regard to battery storage, which we have only started but which has taken off close to the power stations at present and which also has huge potential close to industry as part of that balance in capability, we have the highest per capita volume of battery storage of any country. In both renewables and on battery storage, we are progressing. Private wires and the role of industry will be expanded.

I said to it, as I will say to the Deputy, that we have a huge volume of projects. There are projects worth more than €70 billion, and that was before the inflationary period, with a €34 billion national development plan, NDP, pool and a pool where we have committed 10% funding to active travel and 20% funding to public transport. In those circumstances, to my mind the priority has to be the building of a whole range of new bypasses such as Castlemartyr in a similar road area. I could go on throughout the country, such as Listowel, Abbeyfeale, Virginia, Carrick-on-Shannon - the list is as long as your arm. I believe those projects providing bypasses to allow our towns to thrive should get priority over mainline capacity enhancement, which is the case with the road in question. Given the very limited budget we have as well as projects committed to, such as Ringaskiddy, the Dunkettle roundabout, with a limited purse I believe bypasses are the area on which we should focus the money.

The large energy user, LEU, rebalancing subvention took charges away from big businesses and added them to the bills of domestic users in a scandalous scheme that sums up the Minister's approach to these issues, which is to protect large corporations and penalise ordinary workers and families. Freedom of information documents secured by Senator Lynn Boylan show that even the amount approved was actually surpassed and more was actually passed on to LEU customers. Will the Minister now instruct the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, immediately to evaluate how much additional costs were domestic customers burdened with under this scheme? More importantly, will he make sure it is repaid to hard-pressed families?

In 2010, if I recall rightly, our economy was at real risk. The price of electricity for industrial providers was historically much higher than other European competing countries. There was a real risk of major job losses at a time when our economy was in real difficulty and in danger. It is this Government, in different circumstances, which has changed that and reversed that decision.

I am not sure whether he has told the Office of the Planning Regulator about that or amended the national planning framework or told a single local authority in the State.In Meath, we have a track record of delivering houses but there are nowhere near enough. The Meath County Council housing delivery action plan targets are shy by 2,000 out to 2027 and there will be more people going onto the housing list than houses being built. To buy a house in the private market, people are looking at in excess of €485,000 for a three-bedroom property. We are ahead of the game in regard to our county development plan but as soon as it was adopted, it was out of date because it was based on the 2016 census figures and population projections that were grossly underestimated, although they were the basis for the national planning framework, NPF. For example, the town of Dunshaughlin could grow by 6,000 people up to 2027 and there are 8,500 people there already. Will the Minister immediately review the housing targets for County Meath and ensure they are consistent with national, regional and local plans?

I believe the national planning framework is correct in that we need more balanced regional development, more compact development and low carbon development. That means we need to see Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick in particular thrive as counterbalances to the rapid growth of the greater Dublin area. Half of the new housing is going into the greater Dublin area but it will not work for Dubliners or for people in Meath, Wicklow or Louth if everything happens in the east. We need that better balanced regional development. That is not to say we do not develop Meath but it means we do not abandon the national planning framework and the key policy decisions behind it. Yes, we need more housing but we have to make sure it is balanced in terms of being located right across the country and, in particular, those other cities need to grow.

She is campaigning for the Government to intervene in this case. It is now 15 years since this young girl disappeared in Spain. She left the house of a friend to go to her own home and it is said that she never arrived there. It was six months previously that the famous case of Madeleine McCann was in the world headlines. There is certainly a sense that the Spanish authorities did not want to bring bad publicity to a very touristy part of the world and to the commercial interests there, and the case was not dealt with as appropriately as it should have been at the time. Since then, new information has come to light and, in recent days, there has been a lot of media coverage in Spain and reports that somebody has come forward to say that, unfortunately, they know where Amy's body may be buried, and they are speaking around that. The pressure needs to be put on the Spanish authorities to deal with this issue. I call on the Government to really put on the pressure to ensure the Spanish authorities act to find Amy's body and bring her home to her family.

I know of a care home that is waiting on this money. I understand there are a number of issues with the HSE that it has to address with the Department. The CHO is telling me that it has not been allocated the money, the service is telling me it has not received any word and the Department is telling me at all times that the money is coming, but it is not.

A critical element of that is new mobility car sharing centres. The reason Deputy McAuliffe is interested is because we have already introduced one in Finglas village, and it provides a model that we need to roll out across our cities in particular and across the country. It is the council providing the land and it is working with the ESB on the grid connection. It is both a charging and a car sharing station for a variety of different car sharing companies, and it also has e-bike charging and e-bike sharing. To my mind, it has huge potential because the benefit is that, as the Deputy said, most cars are parked 95% of the time, so there is a huge economic saving, huge energy efficiency and huge import reduction in terms of the balance of payments, and it provides a very high-quality service. The Government will provide funding for the roll-out of those mobility hubs across our cities as the big boost to car sharing.

I emphasise again the importance of the forestry sector to the Irish economy and the important role of forestry in the delivery of our targets under the climate action plan. I am heartened by the cross-party support for forestry and for improving our afforestation rates in the country. Almost every Deputy in the House has spoken about our need to increase afforestation rates for the benefit of farmers, rural communities and our climate. For various reasons, forestry planting has not been or is not where we want it to be. Afforestation rates have not reached their heyday of the late 1990s and early 2000s for a raft of reasons. We have very ambitious climate targets, with forestry planting being at the very centre of these ambitions. As we face into a decade where we will need to reach up to 8,000 ha of forestry planting each year, our new €1.3 billion forestry programme will be a real game changer as we face into this challenge. We have 11.6% of the country under forestry at the moment with a target of reaching 18% by 2050. The challenge is great but our ambition is higher. This is an ambition with farmers at the very centre of it. This is why the programme for Government has committed €1.3 billion to this new forestry programme with substantially higher payments for farmers.  Putting it plainly, farmers will receive premiums for 20 years in the new forestry programme, which are up 66% on those of the previous scheme. This is the biggest and largest forestry programme ever introduced by any Government here and has been designed to have an emphasis on close-to-nature forestry and to ensure that farmers will be its primary beneficiaries. Comprehensive public consultation has taken place over the past year on the development of a national forestry strategy which has resulted in the publication of a shared national vision for the role of trees and forests in Ireland to 2050, together with the new draft strategy which sets out a clear set of objectives for the role of trees and forests in Ireland between now and 2030. The new Forestry Programme 2023-2027 will be the primary means by which the new strategy will be implemented over the next five years.  As I said, this comprehensive package of measures included a programme which will see an increase in forestry premiums between 46% and 66%, with farmers receiving 20 years of premiums compared to 15 years of premiums payments for non-farmers. In addition to receiving 33% more premium payments, farmers who plant new forests will receive the single farm payment on land converted to forestry. Other private landowners will not receive that payment. The new forestry programme will also include a small-scale native woodland scheme whereby farmers will be paid to plant mixed native broadleaf forests of up to 1 ha in size on farms and along water courses, without the need for a forestry licence. This is another clear incentive to our farmers to consider planting their land. The Forestry Programme 2023-2027 is subject to state aid approval from the EU Commission. The previous state aid guidelines in the forestry sector expired on 31 December 2022 and have now been replaced with a revised version as of January 2023. The introduction of these revised guidelines meant that a formal application for state aid could not have been submitted to the European Commission until the revised guidelines were in place, that is, before this month. We are continuing to engage with the European Commission to get this state aid approval process completed as fast as possible and we are leaving no stone unturned in that regard. We do not have a day to waste and we are working proactively to get the work completed in order to get the new programme officially open.  In the meantime, farmers can still engage with their planners to have much of the preparatory work done so that they can then officially submit their application once approval is received. I need to be clear that the precise timing of state aid approval will be a matter for the European Commission. We are, however, working daily with the Commission to get this process completed as quickly as possible. On licensing, we have climbed a mountain to improve a situation that was truly dire. When the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I came to office, the forestry sector was on life support. Confidence had been eroded, licences were backed up and afforestation rates had collapsed. A broken appeal system had ground licensing to a halt with 6,000 licences awaiting over 120 days for approval. That number has reduced by nearly 5,000 now.  The backlog came as result of a 2017 court ruling which required significantly more scrutiny on each application, which delayed every single application. The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I, working closely with our Department officials, set about fixing that problem but with it being so deep-rooted, it took time. Working with our officials, we identified the problem and we have fixed it through investment, hard work and determination.  To emphasise how efficient the licensing system has now become, in 2022 the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine issued 4,713 licences, which was 1,154 more licences issued than applications received. Licences on hand with us for more than 120 days reduced from 3,700 applications in January of the year past, to 1,983 at the end of the year. The 6,000 to 7,000 licences we had on hand in total in August 2021 is now at just over 3,000 and continues to reduce every single week, even when new licence applications are factored in. Licences for timber felling and forest roads were both at record levels for a single year in the year just past.  There are now over 1,000 approved afforestation contracts with 7,343 ha approved as ready for planting. In addition, there was over 9.5 million cu. m of wood licensed, well beyond the National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, estimated demand.We have seen real progress but we have more to do. We will continue to push and drive on to become even more efficient. While the new forestry strategy and programme are not finalised yet, the Department has introduced an interim afforestation and roads scheme in order that those with valid approvals under the old forestry programme can plant and build roads. Under the previous programme, licences were issued for more than 7,000 ha of afforestation that have not yet proceeded to planting stage. Under the interim arrangements that have been put in place pending approval of the new programme, those with existing licences can now proceed for planting at the new rates proposed to be paid under the new programme and have the full benefit of those new rates. We have received significant numbers of applications to proceed with planting in the coming weeks and months under these arrangements. We are committed to keeping this critically important industry moving through this relatively short period of uncertainty. Felling and non-grant aided roads licences will continue to issue and the Department's significantly enhanced licensing system will continue to progress existing afforestation applications pending state aid approval. Under the new programme, farmers, as the biggest landowners in the country, will have the opportunity to play the most significant role in the creation of new forests. We hope that they will take advantage of the generous incentives on offer to help drive increasing afforestation. The afforestation targets set out in the forestry programme and the climate action plan are ambitious and will require the input of all stakeholders. The Government asked Coillte to get back into afforestation in order to help meet the country's ambitious forestry targets. The independent semi-State company, through its strategic vision, which was launched in early 2022, set a target of 100,000 ha of afforestation by 2050. However, the company is precluded from directly receiving premiums following a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, and it simply cannot draw down premiums itself. Coillte has, therefore, been exploring all options to support the creation of new forests in Ireland. This includes, through the harnessing of funding and assets from private and public sources, afforestation grants and premiums to provide long-term social returns for all stakeholders. I am acutely aware of the concerns that have been expressed regarding Coillte's involvement with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and Gresham House. Coillte has partnered with ISIF to establish the Irish Strategic Forestry Fund as one of a number of models it intends to deploy in order to enable afforestation on a meaningful scale. As the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last night, and as we say again, the structure of the deal between Coillte, ISIF and Gresham House is not our preferred option. Our preferred option is for farmers to plant forest on their own land. That is what we have designed the new forestry programme to achieve. However, this fund is an option Coillte has put in place to help us reach our highly ambitious forestry targets. The total area of new forest planted through the fund will deliver approximately 3.5% of the 100,000 ha of new forest Coillte has committed to enabling between now and 2050. Of the State's overall national target of 450,000 ha of new forest by 2050, the fund will plant less than 1% of that total. Coillte will not sell any existing, publicly owned forest to the fund, nor will it seek to purchase any other public land on behalf of the fund. Any land purchased by the fund will already be in private ownership and, obviously, no private landowner will be forced to sell land to the fund. Coillte and ISIF have entered into binding, contractual relationships in respect of this initiative, which has commenced its work, the afforestation element of which is expected to last for five years. Building afforestation momentum in a sector that has been stagnant is necessary but there are various options to reach our ambitions. This is why the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, and I have asked Coillte to closely examine how it can work more closely with the State, as well as farmers and local communities. Again, this type of strategy is not our preferred option for strategic partnerships in the sector. Our preferred option is for farmers to plant trees on their own land, which is what we are incentivising through the new €1.3 billion forestry programme. We want all strategies to be based around working in partnership with farmers to support their ambitions for forestry but we must also be realistic. For various reasons, forestry plantations are not where we want them to be. Afforestation rates have not reached their heyday of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for many reasons. We have highly ambitious climate targets with forestry planting at the very centre of these ambitions. Our main focus now is on securing EU state aid approval in order to introduce the new programme as quickly as possible. This is a €1.3 billion forestry programme that is focused on the future and not on the past, and on driving economic activity in rural communities throughout the country. This programme puts our farm families at the centre of its record premiums and a 20-year tax-free income. We have much more work to do to change the perception around forestry. Increasing our afforestation rates will be good for the environment, for our climate targets and, critically, for family farm incomes. We are entering and facing into an exciting future for forestry. We all look forward to working together to seeing Ireland become a leader in the forestry sector.

I also welcome the Minister and the Minister of State. I have lost count of the number of discussions and debates in which I have participated in this House, and at committees and elsewhere, in respect of Ireland's forestry policy and its underlying failures. I have often said that a good forestry strategy is one that will deliver for the environment, our local communities and the economy. Unfortunately, we have had a worsening situation over the past decade or so, whereby none of those objectives have been met. In fact, the situation has got worse over the past couple of years. If I welcome anything over the past number of weeks arising from the Gresham House deal that Coillte has engaged in, it is that it has finally put a spotlight on those failures. This is now a matter of public discourse. In my time in politics, I have rarely seen an issue that has united so many facets of Irish life, that has been the talk of so many different arenas, and that has angered and frustrated so many different people. The deal that Coillte engaged in with Gresham House has been roundly and rightly condemned by environmentalists, farmers, local communities and virtually anybody who has uttered an opinion in this House and outside it. It crystallises the underlying inability of the Minister, the Ministers of State and their Department to get this issue right. The Gresham House deal, despite what we were asked to believe in the opening days of this debacle, was not something that came as a shot out of the blue for the Government. This deal was essentially signed off on by the Government. It would not have been possible were it not for a letter of expectation issued by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, to Coillte in June of last year. I believe that happened as a result of negotiations and discussions with Coillte. The Minister's defence of that was we should have realised that this was what Coillte were planning to do because we received briefings from it.I have met with Coillte a number of times, seen its broad strategy, discussed with it some of the detail and asked it how it wants to achieve this. Coillte has never suggested to me, in private conversations or in public briefings, that the route it saw was through an engagement with the type of investment fund Gresham House represents. The letter of expectation directed Coillte to develop initiatives that included participation in a subsidiary or partnership enterprise. It is clear that the letter directed Coillte towards this fund. There has been an attempt by the Ministers over recent days to minimise this. One of the figures they keep citing is that the deal represents only 1% of the overall ambition, but we know that what it will represent is a purchase of 12,000 ha, 8,500 ha of which is already afforested. The Ministers still have not explained what possible benefit to the Irish people there is in having land that is already afforested and in local ownership transferred to the ownership of a huge foreign investment fund. The 3,500 ha over five years represents 700 ha per year. If we were to set that against what was actually planted last year, far from 1% or 3.5%, it would represent more than a third of all trees planted in a given year. The Minister, I had thought and hoped, would have taken the opportunity today to indicate that he plans to issue a new shareholder letter of expectation to Coillte to instruct it not to proceed with any of these types of deals in the future. From our discussions last night, we have learned that there are ways in which the Minister can ensure that the Gresham House deal does not proceed. The first thing he could do is tell Coillte not to put €10 million of public funding into the project but instead use that money to purchase publicly owned land. The second thing the Minister could do is issue a public pronouncement encouraging investors not to put their money into the Gresham House deal because if Gresham House cannot pull together the €200 million, this deal will fall apart. The really disgusting thing that has happened is that for all the pronouncements we have all heard on our local radio stations and all the rest of it, we had an opportunity to send a very clear message through the Private Members' motion that was before us last night. Unbelievably and bizarrely, but probably not surprisingly, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputies abstained. For all the bluff and the bluster, when it came to it they would not support a motion that very clearly called on Coillte to stop the deal with Gresham House. Now all the failures of forestry policy that have been ongoing for so long have been exposed. In 2004, as has rightly been said, a state aid ruling essentially meant that Coillte could not draw down the premiums and grants in respect of forestry and removed Coillte from the market. Very quickly after that, however, the market recovered to such a point that in 2010, six years later, we were hitting more than 8,000 ha per year in afforestation. There will rightly be debates about the types and locations of that afforestation, the impact it had on our biodiversity crisis, which many would argue was worsened as a result of that policy, and the fact that to some degree we managed to create a forestry policy whereby, by planting trees on bogland, we became one of the only countries in the world that made forestry actually damaging and carbon-emitting as opposed to something beneficial to the environment. However, we planted over 8,000 ha per year. That means there is a model in place by which this could be delivered, and the model was working in partnership with farmers, in particular. It was subsequent to that that the market moved and, through Government policy, investment funds were encouraged to come in and purchase large swathes of land in order to be able to draw down the premiums for which they were not excluded. We see the devastating impact that that has had in places like Leitrim, west Cavan and west Kerry. From 2010 the number of hectares each year being afforested steadily declined. Aside from the fact that we now had these new investment-type models coming in on a private basis, the numbers went down, up to and including in 2017, when the court ruling to which the Minister refers had a huge impact on the licensing process. What did the Government do after that? In 2019 it commissioned the Mackinnon report. It was delivered in December 2019, and in January of the following year, 2020, the Department issued the draft implementation plan of the report. In November 2020, almost a full year later, it appointed Jo O'Hara to advise on the implementation and she delivered the implementation of the Mackinnon report in February 2021, whereby Project Woodland was established. Project Woodland went on to commission a series of specific reviews. I have lost count of the number of reviews and reports the Department has carried out. Not to be outdone, we on the Oireachtas agriculture committee got involved in the process and commissioned a report. I would safely say that if we were to stack all the reports relating to forestry that have been received since August 2019 on the floor of the Dáil, they would hit its high ceiling. The problem, then, is not the lack of resources, a lack of reports or a lack of ideas; it is the lack of political will to actually implement them. We have known since, aside from the licensing issues, why farmers disengage because they have been quite upfront in telling us. The licensing debacles were an issue. Farmers who a generation ago planted trees and forests and then came to the point where they were actually felling them ended up finding themselves with four- or five-year delays before the felling licences were provided. We know that the issue of ash dieback has never been dealt with effectively. Farmers, through no fault of their own, albeit arguably through the fault of the Department for having allowed ash dieback to enter the country in the first place, saw their entire investments completely destroyed. The Government in large part told them it was their own loss. Then, when they did intervene, they did so in a way that was not anywhere close to what needed to be done. Here we are, then, in January 2022, and here is what some people might not realise. People who own land, whether public, private or community-owned, and who decide they want to play their part and want to plant trees today cannot apply to do that. They cannot submit a licence. The Minister says "We do not have a day to waste" in getting this programme through. He forgot to say that the application has not been submitted, so we have not a day to waste in getting this application through but the application itself has not been submitted, and we hear reports that the European Commission has some very serious concerns about that programme. What, then, needs to happen? We need to start engaging with the sector. The first thing we need to do in order to build goodwill is to do precisely what we have asked in respect of Coillte. A new letter of expectation needs to issue to Coillte telling it that no more of these deals will be tolerated by the Government. Second, we need to try to scupper the current Gresham House deal. That is certainly within the mechanisms. The third thing we need to do is get clarification on the state aid rules. As I said last night, my understanding is that it might be possible for Coillte and other public bodies to avail of premiums and grants. If that is the case, it would be not only unacceptable but a national scandal if, instead of doing that, Coillte were to put its funds into a private investment fund in order to purchase land. There is an organisation called Social, Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA, that represents upwards of 85% of the forestry sector. Despite being asked several times, the Minister has not committed to meeting the association. I would have thought that that would be a good first step. In respect of the licensing programmes, and despite what has already been said, there is a target of 100 licences per week. Essentially, that is the target the Government has set to achieve. It achieved it in 18 weeks last week; it was 19 the year before. While the overall number of licences issued increased, there are still delays. I am running out of time but I will finish on two remarks the Ministers have made in recent days. They go to the heart of the dichotomy we have and the divergence of views.The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, said: "This is a hugely exciting time for Irish forestry, and we have designed a Forestry Programme that will deliver for climate, for biodiversity and for our farmers." The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, decided to outdo her and said we were at the dawn of a brilliant, bright and exciting future for forestry. One forester who rang me last night described the current situation as the darkest hour in Irish forestry in that person's 25 years in the sector. That is the dichotomy.

I also spoke during Sinn Féin's Private Members' motion, which made three concrete proposals. Deputy Carthy has touched on a number of them, those being, licensing and how the State can get itself off the hook in the Coillte deal. In my comments, I will focus on the forestry strategy. Sinn Féin's Private Members' business called for the publication of a forestry strategy as a matter of urgency and for it to prioritise afforestation undertaken by local communities, farmers, landowners and public bodies over investment management ventures, which is the model of delivery that should be at the strategy's heart. In his concluding remarks, the Minister referred to the Government's approach and said:The second part is that we publish our new forest strategy as soon as possible, and an ambitious one. This is what we will be doing. We are working on finalising that at the moment and it will be a really good forestry strategy to go with the unprecedented high premium rate that we already announced just before Christmas.There was no mention of the delivery mechanism or the prioritisation of local communities, farmers, landowners and public bodies over investment management ventures. That should come as no surprise. There is agreement that we need an ambitious plan for forestry, but the Government seems to be ignoring it, which is the disappointing element. There is an agreed vision of what the future of forestry should look like. Indeed, the Department conducted an extensive public consultation using surveys, various deliberative models and stakeholder engagement, and prepared a summary report of the result. What does the citizenry say when we speak to it about the future of forestry? There is a wisdom in crowds, as there always is. Regarding Ireland's ambition for forest creation, and according to the report, citizens recognise:1. The current level of forest cover in Ireland is too low and there is an urgent need for a greater level of ambition.2. Ireland needs a major expansion of new forests, to where there is a greater balance with traditional agriculture in the landscape.3. Land availability is a critical element to any future increase in forest cover.4. A significant shift in land use change is needed and will require much better integration of trees and forests with traditional farming and agricultural practices.5. There needs to be a regulatory system in place that can deal efficiently and effectively with the requirements of forest establishment and management.
The right reasons - Forests for Climate
1. Climate change is a key driver for increasing forest cover.2. Combating climate change should be a priority objective when planning new and managing existing forests.3. Forest carbon accounting will be a key tool to understanding the climate change impact of the forest sector and to informing decisions on future land use planning,4. Increasing the use of wood and wood products, both as a long-term store of carbon and as a substitute to using more carbon intensive products are key ways that forests can contribute to meeting our climate targets.5. There is a preference [among the citizenry] for managing forests in a way that addresses climate change.People want forests in urban and rural areas. According to the report:1. There is generally a very positive attitude toward forests in Ireland and they are an important natural resource for urban and rural communities, using them regularly for recreation and health and wellbeing [sic].2. Continued access to public forests is vital to maintain the benefits of forests to people. There is a general divergence in preference for access to publicly or privately owned forests ...5. Continued and improved engagement and communication with forest owners and farmers is essential to maintaining good working relationships and building confidence and trust.I have more to go through, but it already seems that if the Department, Minister and Minister of State actually listened to the public consultation that they conducted, they would not have landed themselves where they are. The consultation continues:The right reasons - Forests for Wood ...2. There is a preference to see more wood products used in the construction of Irish houses an in energy generation ...5. There is a need for wider education and awareness raising on the benefits of wood and timber products.Using forests for nature shows a major gap in the Government's approach. The consultation reads:1. Supporting and protecting nature and biodiversity are key drivers for increasing forest cover and planning and managing existing forests.2. There is a preference for expanding, enhancing and restoring native woodland habitats.3. Establishing non-native conifer forests on sensitive peatland habitats is a key concern. The existing biodiversity and climate mitigation value of candidate afforestation sites should be an important consideration in this regard.4. A diversity of approaches to forest establishment and management should be used in support of nature ...
The right trees
1. There is a preference among the public for more diverse mixed forests and native forests.2. The urgent need to create more forests should not be used as a reason to continue planting less diverse forests ...
The right places
1. People would like to see more forests established on a mix of private and public lands and in urban and near-urban areas ...
The right management ...
2. There is an interest at community level to facilitate greater community involvement in forest establishment and management ...4. Using a suite of options in encouraging more farmers to plant trees will be important.Nowhere in the above did the citizenry say that we should develop a complex market mechanism and use investment funds to buy up tranches of private land to deliver corporate profit. Rather, the people have said that they want a model of forestry that delivers for local communities, the environment, farmers and the economy. Indeed, this is the same sentiment that came from the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss last week. The Government has landed somewhere entirely different, though. There has been extensive discussion of the Coillte deal, which is a bad deal for Ireland. Today in the Irish Examiner, Mr. Paul Hosford reported the deep concerns of the European Commission, specifically its Directorate General, regarding the elements of the Government's plan relating to biodiversity and nature, for example, planting on peatlands and the impact on birds. The Irish Examiner reads:[The commission] has previously drawn attention to risks of inappropriate afforestation of sensitive habitats such as peatlands and negative effects on areas of high ecological value ...I will draw a connection. When the Government consulted the people of Ireland, they said exactly the same thing as the European Commission did.The Irish Examiner also reads:The [strategic environmental assessment] report also does not ... adequately address concerns about the piecemeal encroachment of forestry plantations and roads into open landscapes under high natural value farming and relied upon by open habitat birds, notably the hen harrier and the breeding curlew. Breeding curlew numbers have collapsed from an estimated 3,300-5,500 pairs in the late 1980s to no more than 150 pairs at present.There is an agreed vision - my party certainly reflects it - in the report of the public consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. The Government is failing miserably to deliver on it.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	405	At today's Business Committee, it was agreed that the Labour Party would give time to the Independent Deputy MacSharry, who has just arrived. I believe I have seven minutes.The Minister and Minister of State are present. We have seen, with the demonstration today and with the reaction from the public up and down this country to the proposed Gresham House deal, how strongly people feel about their woodlands, their ancient woodlands, which have been under pressure and under stress after centuries of mismanagement, and the woodlands that are yet to be. The previous Deputy spoke about the importance of woodlands all over the country. I look at the Swords Woodland Association, which is a proactive group in my home town of Swords and which over the past five years has been in schools educating young people about the importance of woodlands and trees. They have had multiple plantings of trees all around the town. They have initiatives on the importance of hedgerows in biodiversity. It is a positive proactive association of which I am proud to be an ambassador, although the real work is driven by a fantastic group, including Councillor Joe Newman and Mr. Edward Stevenson, who are bringing the importance of woodlands to communities in urban settings. People understand and connect with the importance of publicly-owned woodland space for our climate change objectives, for our biodiversity and for peaceful places to be and when this proposed Gresham House deal came to public consciousness, we were not surprised at the reaction that we have seen. The Minister said Coillte wrote to him on 16 December to inform him that the deal with Gresham House had been signed off and that due to the Christmas break, he was unable to turn his attention to it until January. We also know the Minister has been aware that Coillte was looking to engage private investment since the end of 2021. To be fair to the Minister, he has not shied away from this. The nature of this deal did not sneak up on the Minister or, indeed, on the Government on 16 December. There was no sleepwalking into this. This was something that was coming down the tracks for more than a year. We have heard from the managing director of Coillte that the Minister had been kept in the loop on this deal in the months leading up to it being signed off. The Minister knew this was in the pipeline and dropped the ball on doing anything to stop it. The Minister admitted that this is not the preferred way to go but that begs the question as to what is Fianna Fáil's preferred route on this. The Government has had two years to look at better alternatives, which to most of us in the House are obvious. However, as a result of inaction, we are left with an outrageous deal that, by the Minister's own calculations, is less than preferable. Perhaps it is the Fine Gael influence that has rubbed off on the Minister. This deal has their fingerprints all over it and I am sure they are delighted to finally be getting their wish of privatising forestry after they were blocked from doing so by the former Minister, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, and the Labour Party on their last attempt almost a decade ago. We have the scars on our back and know exactly how Fine Gael feels about forestry in this country and where it wants to go. It was hoped that the Green Party and Fianna Fáil would be able to stop such a way forward but this deal has all the hallmarks of what Fine Gael has wanted to do since its NewERA document many years ago. The EU state aid regulations have prevented Coillte from receiving State grants and premia. In what world is the solution to this to simply hand the money over to a small number of investors syphoning funds from the public purse into the pockets of investment fund managers based outside the State? In the two years they have been aware that this was the course Coillte was looking to take, has the Minister not been petitioning the EU to change its rules around State grants? In response to a question on Leaders' Question from my party leader, Deputy Bacik, today, the Green Party leader and Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that they will go to Europe for the change, but why is it taking so long? Why have they not gone to Europe already? Why is it in the future? If it is in the future, when exactly will the Minister go to make these changes? The case to make is clear. There is a direct correlation between when those rules were introduced in 2003 and a decline of our forest sector. The Government knows that these rules have hampered Coillte's ability to carry out its mandate and we have heard from the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, among others, that the State should go to the EU to seek a change in these rules. We heard from the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, earlier this week that the Government has still not approached Brussels. This backs up what the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said in response to a question on Leaders' Questions today. When the Minister of State learned of Coillte's plans two years ago, her first port of call should have been to look for a change in these rules. This still has not occurred. We accept that a new approach to forestry needs to be taken if we are to meet our targets but privatisation through the back door is not the solution. Coillte has claimed that it cannot meet the scale of investment required but the fact remains that it is an extremely profitable enterprise and has the capacity to borrow. It has more than €1 billion in net assets. Its 2019 balance sheet showed €58 million in profits and its 2021 balance sheet showed €119 million in profits. These two profit figures alone would show that to meet the amounting of funding of €200 million that this deal is looking at raising, Coillte would have the ability to service and repay a loan of that amount if the rules allowed, and it would prevent taxpayers' money being syphoned off into a foreign financial house through State grants and premia. A syphoning off of State funds is exactly what we are seeing here. Coillte is getting into bed with private investment funds, the sole purpose of which are to generate profits for their investors. What this means in practice is that grants that could have been used by local farmers to develop their own forests on their own land are going to foreign investment fund managers and profits from the afforestation industry that could have been kept in local communities are being exported. The commercial motivation of Gresham House will mean this deal results in as little regard for biodiversity and climate concerns as they can get away with. All the great work that organisations are doing locally, such as the Swords Woodland Association, can only do so much. We need Coillte to be resourced. We need the rules to be in place to ensure it can meet and, indeed, "smash" - the word the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, used today - through the targets. Unfortunately, this Government is not going in this direction and we have great fears about the future of afforestation industry.

It was very long and not being a member of the committee, it went on so late I could not wait long enough to contribute. The Minister, Deputy McConologue, said it is not the Government's preferred option. I appreciate that. The Minister also said that "binding, contractual" arrangements have been entered into. The first issue I have with it is the autopilot approach that consecutive Governments and various Ministers take to the semi-State sector. It is a kind of autopilot that they are over there, the Government will get the dividend and it will give them the nod on what they are looking for, in terms of raising money or whatever. That is poor practice. We need to take a more hands-on approach to broad policy agendas being followed within the semi-State sector, and particularly Coillte. This proves it. By the Minister's own admission, it is not his preferred route to go. The Minister tells us that he is incapable now of preventing it because there are contractual arrangements. Yesterday evening, I sat beside Deputy Michael Collins and I provided him with a copy of the relevant piece of the 1988 Act. He said the Minister had the power to prevent it. The Minister frowned at that. The Minister has the power, by the way. For his information, under section 38(2) of the Forestry Act 1988, under general ministerial powers, the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and other Ministers, can specifically direct. When it comes to raising capital, I would suggest most certainly the Minister can. In effect, what we will have here is potentially a brass plate on Merrion Square with" Gresham House" on it. Its investors, wherever they will be in the world, will be the owners of land here. That is where the premia will go. That is where the beneficiaries will be. What is more, funds such as Gresham House will likely flip that investment multiple times between now and the maturity of the timber, etc. Unlike the lies, quite frankly, and the misleading nature of some Coillte comments that this will do great things for local investment, there will be no premia being spent in Connacht Gold or in the local Centra, as there is at present. We are powerless to prevent any foreign person buying land in Ireland or doing what he or she wants in Ireland. The market dictates but I would suggest that when it is the State-sponsored foreign plantation of our nation, the public are entitled to take a view that we do not want to incentivise this. If there was market failure and if there was not a robust competitive market for the purchase of land and planting, and the Minister acknowledges the serious difficulties over recent years that we are making progress on in terms of backlog on felling and planting licences, there is no issue with money. On 5 January, for example, we, through the NTMA, raised €3.5 billion in the markets for green bonds.Coillte could have a forestry bond that could raise money directly. The NTMA could have set up a separate special purpose vehicle to invest if Coillte needed money. The Ireland Strategic Infrastructure Fund, ISIF, could have put the money in. If, as the Minister has stated, it cannot be prevented now, can he give this House an absolute assurance it will be prevented in the future and that he will encourage not only his Department but all his colleagues in the Government to take a more hands-on approach to our semi-State sector.

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on Ireland's new forestry strategy. I commend my colleague the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on her Trojan work in securing an unprecedented €1.3 billion to execute this key pillar of Ireland's climate action plan over the next five years and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, on his leadership in this role. As the Taoiseach told the IFA last week, the forestry strategy was designed to benefit rural Ireland by giving farmers the biggest opportunity to meet our forestry targets and ensuring the overwhelming majority of the economic stimulus it provides will be felt in rural Ireland. As a rural Deputy representing a constituency with a proud agricultural tradition, it is especially important to me that farmers are at the heart of Ireland's response to the climate and biodiversity challenge. They own and manage two thirds of our land, so it is our responsibility as politicians to ensure they are empowered and equipped to lead. There are also benefits in the forestry strategy for nature, and I welcome the provisions to expand substantially the native woodland cover, ensure more diverse mixes of species, address legacy impacts, restore afforested peatlands and support closer to nature forest management. We have work to do across government to ensure robust ecological assessment procedures to safeguard habitats and species of ecological importance such as the freshwater pearl mussel, marsh fritillary butterfly, red listed bird species, species-rich semi-natural grasslands and other high nature-value farmland areas, especially with respect to the native tree area scheme. This is at the forefront of the Minister of State, Senator Hackett's, mind. When we think of forests, what do we think of? Is it stands of healthy conifers that will be felled for valuable sawlog to support the rural economy and national housing targets, beautiful non-native beech and bluebell woodlands that were established centuries ago on old estates that we now enjoy for walks with our families, or the soggy biodiversity-rich temperate rainforests dripping in mosses and liverworts that might naturally occur on large swathes of our island? I argue we should think of all three. We should not forget about the other forests either, the islands of low yield class timber on peat soils on the western seaboard, many of which are uneconomic to extract, the ancient and long-established woodlands that are dying in slow motion, choked by invasive rhododendron and laurel that crowd out the next generations of trees, the dense monocultures of conifers that exclude both light and communities, and the bare hillsides that might regenerate on their own through a succession of grasses, bushes and shrubs to natural woodland were they not relentlessly grazed. Social and economic policies of the past, which were undertaken for good and valid reasons at the time, left us a difficult legacy when it comes to forestry. The decision to ensure the nation's strategic timber resource never competed with agriculture and confined forests to the productively poorer lands was made in the shadows of the Great Hunger. The planting efforts on vast peatlands and of the west in the 1970s and 1980s provided desperately needed rural employment for so many people and was the only alternative to emigration. The intensification of agriculture that overwhelmed the wooded corners of fields and tall thick hedgerows transformed the fortunes of many farmers, and the planting and felling protocols of more recent decades pursued maximum economic productivity in the regions left behind, often to the detriment of environmental or social productivity. The forestry of the future must take account of this history and we, as elected representatives, must ensure the whole story is told if we are to make better decisions today. In my role as Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, I am keenly aware that the Ireland of today has a very different set of values to the Ireland that wrote the first 100 years of our forestry story. These new values are very much to the fore in my Department which undertakes extensive work to conserve and restore existing native woodlands, create new ones and restructure and rehabilitate the forests where a different habitat is better for nature. In our national parks and nature reserves from Glengarriff to Glenveagh, we are restoring ancient oak yew and alluvial woodlands, planting new native woodlands, collecting seeds and establishing conservation populations of genetically unique tree species, removing invasive species such as rhododendron, cherry laurel, beech and sycamore restoring and rehabilitating afforested peatlands, erecting deer fencing and managing populations on an ongoing basis. This work has been significantly ramped up thanks to the increased funding provision for the National Parks and Wildlife Service under this Government. We are also taking a longer term more strategic view of the management of these special places. In Glenveagh National Park in County Donegal, we are implementing a new woodland management strategy with a 100-year time horizon to 2120. In Killarney National Park in County Kerry, we recently published a 30-year review of the vegetation change in permanent native woodlands, the findings of which will inform future management, including the new rhododendron management plan which is currently being finalised. In Wicklow Mountains National Park, a new deer management plan is expected to be completed later this year. At Wild Nephin National Park, we are at the beginning of a major ecological restoration project to bring a former conifer plantation back to healthy peatland, native woodland and riparian habitat where natural processes are the drivers of change. At the national level we are almost finished a scoping study to map, monitor and protect Ireland's ancient long-established native woodlands, which is a vital step towards a full national inventory of these amazing habitats. We also continue to manage deer hunting licences, with more than 6,000 issued by my Department last year. Deer grazing remains an overwhelming pressure on the establishment and regeneration of native woodlands across many parts of the country despite the culling of more than 50,000 animals last year. I firmly believe a long-term, strategic and sustained approach to deer management that is led by data is needed. We need a deer census, a deer forum to explore management possibilities, including contracted service providers, and to promote venison as a source of wild organic lean protein and mainstream it in our diets. We also need to think more broadly about grazing in general, especially grazing by sheep. Conservation grazing has a role to play in the management of our uplands, but what we have now is not working for nature, water, climate or people and we need to rethink it. Invasive plants such as rhododendron and cherry laurel present significant challenges and a major programme based on sound science and best practice and managed strategically on a site-specific basis needs to be undertaken. Communities can play a vital role in this work, and we have seen fantastic examples of people coming together to support nature. An inspiring one is a group of farmers who, through their participation in the rural social scheme, are removing rhododendron from Bundorragha Catchment in County Mayo, and I would like to see much more of this take place. It is clear we need to think big and take bigger action. The next five years will be crucial. The European Commission's proposal for a new nature restoration law is focusing minds on the challenge ahead and its implications for all habitats and sectors, including woodland and forestry, and it is starting to become clear. Early analysis suggests we will need to establish approximately 1,300 ha of sessile oak woods and approximately 500 ha of alluvial forest every year to achieve the 2030 targets. This goes well beyond the scope of the new forestry strategy, and while the role of Coillte has been much discussed in this House in recent weeks, a key question remains to be asked. Is there potential for Coillte to ring-fence a portion of the profits it returns to the State for the creation of permanent native woodland in support of the nature restoration law? I would like to see this explored. Speaking in the Chamber earlier today, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, signalled his intention to look at the mandate of Coillte. Last month I wrote an op-ed piece setting out my hope that we will be able within my lifetime to remove fences that corral nature into so-called safe places. If we are to achieve or even move towards it, we need a clear sense of who and what our forests are for, where they should and should not be; and a sustained, targeted focus on how they are managed for the next 100 years.

Some of the facts and figures that have gone out on the investment opportunity with the Gresham House fund have been misleading. It is important to put it in context. The Government policy is to establish approximately 450,000 ha of land into forests by 2050. Coillte will manage approximately 100,000 ha of that. The investment we are talking about equates to approximately 3,500 ha of land and not the 50,000 ha that is being widely reported. That is a gross misrepresentation of the facts. The use of the term "vulture fund" is also misleading as there are no distress sales. Anyone can buy or sell land, anyone can plant trees and anyone can invest in this opportunity. We need to get those facts out. However, the set-up of Coillte is something we wish to address and this gives us the opportunity. Perhaps it has highlighted the need to address the mandate of Coillte and establish a new mandate for the company which will deliver multiple benefits, including environmental and community objectives as well as the production of high-quality timber, and retain the commercial forests of Coillte in public ownership.Coillte has a vision over the next 30 years to achieve a 50:50 split in developing forests for nature and for wood, which is a huge improvement on the current 80:20 split there is now. It should happen faster. One of the difficulties with Coillte is that, while it is a commercial entity, it does not retain the profits from its commercial ventures. I understand the profits go back to the State, making it a commercial State agency. It is prohibited from apply for Government grants because it would run foul of state aid rules. On the remit of Coillte and how we can improve things, we are all in agreement that we have to plant more forests. Nobody would disagree with that nor would they disagree with the fact that the supports and incentives for farmers to do it go further and are a better grant than for somebody who invests but is not a farmer. We should be trying to encourage and work with the farming communities and landowners to plant more forestry. That said, if Coillte were allowed to maintain its return and reinvest its profits back into forestry in Ireland, we would likely need fewer outside investors. It is important to remember we will always need outside and private investment in much of what we do in this country. In housing, for example, there is an annual investment from the public purse of more than €4 billion, but the total per year is probably around €12 billion. That type of private investment is always needed. This fund is seeking an investment of €200 million from a diversity of investors that could come from all over the world. It is not a quick buck or a quick return. I have heard people say this will inflate land prices and that investors will come in and make a quick killing. We are talking about investment in something that is not going to be harvested for 30 or 40 years. There will be grants over the duration the timber grows, but it will go back into managing it. The return on this is the timber produced at the end. I would like to see that timber being produced by Coillte commercially, but on public lands and that return going to the State. We need a lot more timber in this country. We are talking about the construction of approximately 40,000 houses per year. The figure changes from time to time but we are looking at a figure of between 35,000 and 40,000 houses. If we build all those houses with concrete, and we covered this in the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage recently, we will overshoot our carbon targets. Therefore, we must have much more timber frame construction and move to modern methods of construction. We have the raw material growing here. We know that soft wood, such as spruce, can be used to manufacture cross-laminated timber with which we can build much higher than the two- or three-storey buildings within the current regulations. All around the world, buildings are 12 to 14 storeys. That is what we need to be aiming for. That is what we need to be using the timber for. We must plant a lot more forests to do that. We have failed, but this investment opportunity represents less than 1% of where we have to go with Government policy by 2050 to achieve the target of 450,000 ha of new forests. I would prefer if it were Irish investors and landowners, keeping it in the country but we have to rely on investment from time to time. It has been grossly misreported and I am glad to be able to put some facts on record.

It says all the things that people in our communities want to hear. We have the Tánaiste talking about rewilding land. We have the Taoiseach talking about turning the tide on climate change and biodiversity loss and leaving the planet to the next generation in a better condition than we inherited it. We hear the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan's evocative descriptions of forestry and what Ireland could and should be. However, while all the talk is there, the reality is their actions say very different things. We have seen in recent weeks, with the Coillte deal coming into the public arena, is the complete hypocrisy of the Government being exposed when it comes to forestry, biodiversity, rural communities and just transition. It is not just the Coillte deal. There is also the matter of the EU letter that is currently online and that scathing criticism of this Government and its approach to forestry and biodiversity. People are awake to this now. The reason we are all inundated with emails and the reasons for the protests at the gates of Leinster House is because people can see what the Government is trying to do. They see the reality and discrepancy between Government talk, press releases, spin and its actions. I ask the Minister to listen to those voices. It is not often in this Chamber that we hear politicians from across the entire spectrum, environmental groups and farming organisations all saying the same thing. That does not happen often. That in itself should be ringing enough alarm bells with the Minister and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, to say we need to stop this deal. The community is saying this is not right. The biodiversity assembly is saying the same thing. It is not just one voice, one sector, or one interest group. Everybody is singing from the same hymn sheet, except for the international investors who will make a profit from this deal. It is a bad deal for the public purse, for biodiversity and for rural communities, and it is the absolute opposite of a just transition. A just transition is one in which the Government is supporting rural communities to make the changes we require of them to meet out climate targets and improve our biodiversity. That is the responsibility of the Government. Again, this is another area in which the Government repeatedly talks up its actions. However, this is not a just transition. This Coillte deal is pitting international investors with very deep pockets and who are being subsidised by the State against rural communities, and that is not how we want to meet our climate targets. Our climate targets are very important but how we get there and reach those targets is also incredibly important. If we leave large swathes of our communities and residents behind, it will lead to a very destabilised, unfair and inequitable society. It is interesting that the Minister has said this deal between Coillte and Gresham House is not the Government's preferred option. We have heard from other members of the Green Party who would also prefer if it were the State investing in this forestry so that we do not have to go out to the private sector. Over recent weeks, it seemed very handy that Coillte was there and for the Government to say "It's not us", that this was Coillte, that it had nothing to do with the Government, that it did not know about it and was not sure what was happening, and that this is Coillte's baby, as it were. The reality is, however, Coillte was set up by the Government with a specific mandate and it is performing to that mandate. It is the Government's responsibility to work out whether that mandate is in the public interest and whether it represents what we need now in light of our climate and biodiversity crises. It is clear it is not. We have heard from Green Party members who have said that perhaps we should be looking at Coillte's mandate. In the context of this deal, however, has that horse bolted? Is the Government too late in reforming Coillte to prevent this model, where profits will go out of the country and the heavy lifting is being done by a State entity? Coillte will find the land, plant it and manage it, and international investors will be subsidised to receive those profits in 20, 30 or 40 years' time. The question is why the Government is not making that investment. If it is financially viable and financially attractive enough for an international investor to do this, surely it is also financially attractive for the State to do it.We have heard repeatedly about how there is a €5 billion surplus this year, so why is the Government not using some of that money so that we do not have to go to international investors but can keep control of our natural resources? Surely at this stage we have learned that Irish natural resources should be remain within the management of the Irish State. What the Government is doing is cementing a model that will be there forever and a day. It will affect generations to come and that is not in the best interests of the State. I will address the letter the EU allegedly sent to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the forestry strategy. The letter is damning and completely undermines much of the commentary from the Government benches today about the benefits of this forestry strategy and what it will do for our environment and all the improvements we are seeing. What this letters says is that the EU has serious concerns about the forestry programme, the risks of inappropriate afforestation of sensitive habitats such as peatlands, and the risks and impact on areas of high ecological value, including landscapes that are important for the hen harrier and the curlew, that have been repeatedly raised with this Government. It is estimated that the curlew will be extinct within ten years. We are down to 105 breeding pairs. That is on the Government's watch. It has been repeatedly warned. My children, your children and our grandchildren will only be able to see curlews native to Ireland in books, and that is on the Government's watch. The EU has also raised concerns about damage to catchments that are critical to the freshwater pearl mussel, the fact that peatlands are deemed suitable for planting if they are less than 50 cm in depth and the effects of afforestation on rare grassland habitats. This is a scathing letter but it is a very clear assessment not only of our past forestry policies but the policies being proposed by the Government. There are questions about whether the state aid mentioned earlier will be available to us if we are not addressing the EU's environmental considerations and concerns. The EU also talks about public participation, the level of fees, changes to that and how that affects people's rights under the Aarhus Convention. This is a scathing assessment of the Government. While we get a lot of spin and PR about €3 million funding for this and €10 million for that, the Government is failing to introduce the systems changes that are required. We cannot address our climate and biodiversity crises with a shallow approach. We need to make significant changes to how Government thinks about these things. The unfortunate reality is that the compass of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and now the Greens continually tracks towards corporate profits when it comes to climate action, the environment and forestry. We seem to have a green-tinted Government but not one that actually makes the changes we need to see. This will be a lost opportunity because I do not think I have ever seen such support for environmental measures in my lifetime as this Government has - not just from the community but across political parties. The Government is wasting that opportunity and instead of building up a healthy environment for our communities, it is undermining future generations in respect of our climate and biodiversity crisis.

I cannot speak about our forestry strategy without addressing the issue of Coillte and what my comrade Deputy Carthy raised here on Tuesday. It is not often that I am speechless but I was glad I had a couple of days before I got to speak on this issue. The proposal by Coillte to sell 12,000 hectares of land to Gresham House, which is a foreign private investment firm, is inexplicable, cheap and trashy. I believe the revulsion at this plan is widely felt across the House and that the outright rejection of this casino is gutteral for all of us who believe in the integrity of the land and the dignity of all who are proud to call Ireland our home. This Government is already selling our housing to vultures and cuckoos and selling the care of our elderly to global corporate markets and here it goes again selling our forests to a foreign investor. Deputy Carthy read the response to a parliamentary question that stated the Government had issued a letter of shareholder execution to Coillte to include partnership or participatory enterprises on 2 June 2022, which was eight months ago, so the Government knew all along. It knew and it did nothing. It knew then and it knows now that this land and good forestry are essential to the future of our farmers, communities, climate plan, biodiversity and how we live on this island with the changes and demands the climate crisis is bringing. Instead of the message stad anseo, with the granting of the shareholder letter, the message was away libh. There is a shocking cheapness, ignorance and crassness to this deal that has no place in the heart of an Irish Government that fancies itself as mature and all grown up. Are you having a laugh? It has the mortifying feel of the gombeen man selling what is priceless for a few coloured beans. It is so brazen and cheap. It displays the old-fashioned, dangerous and damaging thinking that sees humans as separate from the land and nature as opposed to being part of it and regards the land and nature as being there for us to exploit and, in the case of Coillte and the Government, to exploit for private profit by a foreign investor. In north Kildare, people were angry and sickened by this even before Deputy Carthy got to his feet with the revelation he put on the record of the Dáil on Tuesday night. I was already inundated with emails from constituents in north Kildare who were disgusted by this, many of whom told me they had voted for the Green Party. Pimping out our land and prostituting it to a foreign investor for its private profit was not only horrifying and nonsensical, it was also downright disrespectful and unpatriotic. These people know this is land we need for our small farmers, family farms and local communities because they know that good forestry, not the cheap, splintered industrial monoculture wasteland of Sitka spruce, is what we need. We need indigenous forests for our people, climate and biodiversity. They know that good forestry brings the community into its shelter and does not leave them living in its shadow. We already bear the historical, societal and inherited psychological scars of the stripping of our ancient woodland by a foreign power. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications would do well to grasp that this was the reason we had no wolves in the first place. Mac tíre - the son of the land - was lost to exploitation of our oak forests so the British empire could build its navy to exploit other lands and communities at the far end of the earth. I heard the Minister's colleague on the radio last night saying this was no the repetition of the situation that inspired the song "Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár", but tell that to the hundreds of people who sent emails to us. This has really touched a nerve with the people and the Government needs to listen to them. I am getting emails from people in urban and rural areas who are united on this. For centuries, the stripping of our land will be done by a financial power. Coillte is gifting this land to Gresham as per the letter. Well-being in forestry is essential and there will be no well-being if this cheapening of our land and people for the incentivisation of vast private profit pushes the price of land out of the reach of local farmers. It would be perverse if it did, and it will. It would not reflect the values people have and their concerns about how we live together with equality and the just transition for the future.I call on the Minister to get on with publishing the new forestry strategy. I do not know if he attended the Save our Forests - Save our Land protest earlier. It wants investors out, nature in, and to have hedgerows, not hedge funds. The Government has to clear the remaining forestry licensing backlogs and continue to process new licence applications within a reasonable timeframe. The implementation of the Mackinnon report and subsequent reports must be central to future action.

We know that forestry can be a viable and important commercial sector but we also now know that our forests are a vital source of climate mitigation for this country. Any State or semi-State body that fails to operate on that basis is failing the people by placing profit ahead of survival and corporate interests ahead of nation-building. In 2021, influenced strongly by a global supply and demand imbalance that created a series of supply challenges in key markets, Coillte published record profits. Unfortunately, I sit on the Committee of Public Accounts but cannot look at those profits because the Committee of Public Accounts does not get to talk to Coillte. We do not really have any serious budgetary oversight of the operations of Coillte. There is little Dáil oversight of the decisions made by Coillte. Pre-tax earnings increased significantly on the previous year to €159 million and it recorded operating cash of €73 million. Its revenue earned in 2021 was €422 million, up from €285 million in 2020. These are huge numbers. However, Coillte as a body for forestry in this country is a failure. It is no longer fit for purpose and should be wound down or fundamentally reformed. The problem we have is this. The deal with Gresham House in fact fulfils the terms of reference in the legislation for Coillte. It is a deal based on profit above all other concerns. The legislation for Coillte sets out the following parameters for its operation: to carry on the business of forestry and related activities on a commercial basis and in accordance with efficient silvicultural practices; to establish and carry on woodland industries; to participate with others in forestry and related activities consistent with its objects, designed to enhance the effective and profitable operation of the company; and to utilise and manage the resources available to it in a manner consistent with the above objectives. The language includes "a commercial basis", "woodland industries", and "profitable operation". In considering the deal made between Coillte and Gresham House announced this month I have had cause to review the approaches of other countries in the development of their own forestry sectors. That was an eye-opening experience. There are very few comparable examples of bodies such as Coillte in other countries, whether within or outside the EU. I found it difficult to locate any country that constrained its forestry work to purely commercial matters in legislation. In fact, I was not able to find any where there was no accompanying body that simply looked at public good. It was difficult to find any example of a deal similar to this with so little oversight from the political body in question and so little buy-in from the public. However, there were quite a few comparative similarities between the jurisdictions I looked at. Most EU countries and regions where forestry is successful and growing, both as a commercial sector and as part of their climate strategies, have many things in common. That includes both states within the EU and places such as Canada. They have broadly aligned approaches. It is worth outlining what those approaches tend to be. They tend to identify that a nation’s forests, whether those that exist now or those that are planned for, are a key natural resource. They tend to identify that natural resources are a public good and the public, where possible, should retain ownership of them. They identify that the forestry sector is inextricable from our climate commitments and therefore environment and biodiversity considerations must be part of all decision-making, whether about finance, biodiversity or land management. They identify that almost all the forestry bodies, at least which I looked at, took a regional approach. For example, Canada took a federalised approach and then broke that down within its federal limits. One can look at smaller countries such as Slovenia and other places in the EU that have strong local government that has a significant impact on decision-making on forestry. It is not a centralised system or a body that lives in the capital city and decides on matters. It is developed with local people, local communities and local authorities, and is overseen by them. I do not think anyone in this debate is proposing that commercial forestry, where it is developed and led by sustainable practices such as continuous cover and native planting, should be excluded from our State objectives. To the contrary, as somebody coming from the construction sector, the supply of a renewable building material could only be in Ireland's interests as we currently underutilise timber in the Irish construction sector. However, Coillte's narrow focus on commercial benefit and indeed the legislative underpinning for Coillte does not meet with the climate or commercial demands of the 21st century. As I said, Coillte is doing what it says on the tin. It is operating for profit. It is imperative that Coillte is removed or reformed to align with the principles of climate neutrality and, while we recognise the importance of natural capital, that we do not seek to reduce investment in our nation's forests as an exercise in accounting. Forestry can and will provide significant income to the State through timber production but it is also a pillar element in the fight to improve biodiversity, a means of capturing carbon, a space for health and well-being and a vital habitat for our wildlife. Forests are vital for the future of our planet. They improve the health and well-being of everyone. With careful planning and expert management, our forests can and will continue to thrive and be a significant amount of our landmass. It is imperative that we listen to the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss and implement its recommendation that we consider the position of Coillte. I ask the Minister to consider unpicking the Gresham House deal by dissolving Coillte as a matter of urgency. If it is less than 1% of our land, then we do not need this deal and it is not significant.

There are those outside this House who would advise that this was a done deal which cannot be reversed, that Europe has responded favourably to it and so on. It is amazing that a country outside the European Union, where this particular financial house resides, has the ability to overstep the border and make a sizeable investment that presents a danger of crippling one industry and pretending to support another. I brought this to the attention of the Minister who will know that I raised this issue on several occasions over the past years. I did the calculations like everybody else did and I could not see where the reduction in carbon was going to come from unless something was hidden in the agenda that we were not told about at all. I want to talk about carbon sequestration for a moment. I was a member of a committee of this House many years ago when a great deal of work was done in this area. The present Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was involved in it himself and made a useful contribution. Many things that were done there still stand and still need to be brought further. However, in this particular situation, somebody saw an opportunity, allegedly but not necessarily to serve the needs of the environment on one hand, and to cripple the dairy and beef industry on the other hand, thus bringing about carbon reductions. It was the obvious thing that was waiting to happen unless there was an alternative plan. I want to mention that there is a variety of trees that are beneficial to carbon sequestration and some trees which are not. I feel sorry for the poor Sitka spruce, which seems to be blamed for almost everything and anything, including the bad weather and climate change. That is not true and it has its role to play but good forestry and tree management needs to be controlled in such a way that shelter is provided during the bleaker months of winter by Sitka spruce or other varieties of conifer. Members should remember that the Caledonian pine, which is not regarded as a native pine in this country any more, was found in the Céide Fields from 5,000 years ago.I know we have a habit in this country of not declaring something to be of national interest or native to the area unless a certain amount of time has passed, but this is 5,000 years. I expect that the Caledonian Pine, Red Deal or any of those varieties are well and truly established as part of the national woodpile, for want of a better description, at this time. I would warn about this. I remember this House well when a deal was put forward in relation to the sugar beet industry. It was a vital industry. Members from various parts of this country will remember it. It was an indigenous industry and a rotational crop which had several benefits. I could not believe what happened at the time. Allegedly the farmers were going to get €177 million. Like hell they were. There was never any intention to give it to them. The speed with which the sugar factories were dismembered and transported for scrap was amazing. It is amazing what can be done when the will is there to do it. That was wrong and it has been proven to be wrong. This proposal has a similar smack about it. Its intentions can be justified on paper but in reality the damage that is likely to be done as a result of this proposal is huge. I am not an enemy of financial houses or anything but I agree with what others have said that we must control the use they are put to. The Governor of the Central Bank was before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach yesterday. He was frank about the degree to which he could intervene, if at all. To those who say it is a done deal and cannot be reversed I say that is not true. It is not so. A sovereign state has the right at any time to change its mind for whatever reason and in the face of evidence emerging. I say to the Minister of State that this is not a criticism. I do not speak of this lightly. I do not accept the arguments put forward in its favour. It is the thin end of the wedge. It is something that will grow and grow. It will get bigger and bigger and eventually we will be owned by somebody who is not only outside the country but outside the European Union. That is an extraordinary situation altogether. I have never seen anything like it. Indigenous industry is about to be affected. I am talking about the cereal, beef and dairy industries, all of which made a major contribution to the recovery of this country after the financial crash. Without them, it would have been much longer and more severe. If we go down that road again, we do so knowing full well where we are going and we ignore the benefits of retaining our national interest in a way that reflects well on the thinking of the people. We should not have to go down the road of being advised by so-called experts who always know more than us, of course. We are only humble citizens representing humble citizens. But they do not. They are people who have a right to hold their view in a way that is resolute and will stand the test of time.

It is of vital importance not just to rural TDs but also to urban TDs. It a vital part of our commitment to tackling climate change, to reversing the damage done to our ecosystem over decades and also vital for supporting local communities across rural Ireland and strengthening the local economy. When it comes to forestry in Ireland, the reality is clear; we have been massively failing year after year. The climate action plan suggests that upward of 8,000 ha. of land needs to be planted annually. The Government has set that as the annual afforestation target between 2019 and 2030 yet it is struggling to hit even a quarter of that target. With only 11% of forest areas across the State, we are massively below EU member states where the average is around 40%. We must begin a national conversation on what afforestation should consist of, how it will look and how it will impact and benefit the countryside. We need a clear plan to address the minuscule amount of native woodland across the State. Dubliner Eoghan Daltun has been a strong voice on harnessing the vast potential to be harnessed across Ireland's west coast. In 2009, he bought a 27 acre partly-wooded farm on the Beara Peninsula, a beautiful part of the world. He described it as dying ecologically. Now, over a decade later, it is thriving. The ecological strength of his farm on the Beara Peninsula is in contrast to the nearby Killarney National Park. If you wander across the UNESCO biosphere of Killarney National Park you will find a barren landscape, stripped bare by Sika deer, goats, sheep and, of course, the invasive Rhododendron which provide little or no opportunity for the restoration of that ecosystem. We need to see an effective strategy to remove invasive species from the biosphere. What will be central to the success of the national forestry strategy will be community involvement and community buy-in. We need local communities to be the driving force in afforestation and not international investor funds, the sole modus operandi of which is profit and profit alone. We need to provide effective subsidies to farms which want to revive and plant native woodlands and effective subsidies to help farmers and local communities to tackle invasive species and the harm they do. The proposed deal between Coillte and Gresham House has brought about widespread opposition. It has brought together sections of society from right across the State, urban and rural, which are opposed to this proposed deal. There is opposition to this deal from every section of Irish society: environmentalists, farmers, the forestry sector, rural and urban communities. The Government needs to engage and listen to these voices and expert knowledge and we need to make sure that the Gresham House deal can be undone. I strongly urge the Government to reverse the decision and to scrap the deal with Gresham House. I urge it to look after and support farmers and communities right across rural Ireland.

Like many who were on the protest today and many of the thousands who have signed the "Save our Forest - Save our Lands" petition, I was absolutely horrified by the proposed deal between Coillte, a public forest company that is owned by the people, and a vulture fund. And Gresham House is, in my opinion, a vulture fund.

I will set the context for this. Our forests were destroyed by colonial and imperial plunder. It was brought down to about 1% in a country that used to have 80% forest of native woodland. One of the objectives and missions of the revolutionaries who fought for the independence of this State, right back to Parnell and the revolutionaries who fought in 1916, was to recover and regenerate our native forests and woodlands. Therefore, it is absolutely appalling that anybody in Coillte, in government or in its Departments could think it is a good idea to have wealth-asset management companies come in here and buy up potentially 100,000 ha. which is what Coillte says that it is going to contribute. Yes, the first deal is 12,000 ha. but was the whistle not blown about this? We shall see what is going to happen. So it is potentially 100,000 ha., 0.25 million acres, and God knows where it could go from there, which will be bought up by profit-hungry investment funds. Are these people vulture funds?Helpfully Coillte sent us a document containing frequently asked questions on the Gresham House deal. It states:Where do the fund’s profits go?The fund is designed to generate profits from the business of forestry and timber production. These profits will be retained within the fund and from time to time be distributed to the investors in a similar way as a company distributes dividends to its shareholders.That is a corporate takeover for profit. It is very simple. Let us get a bit more specific. Olly Hughes is the forestry managing director of Gresham House. In an article he wrote recently, he explained Gresham House's interest in buying up forests. He did not mention the word "biodiversity". He did not mention the idea of supporting farmers. He did not mention protecting wildlife, public amenities or any of the things that ordinary people and Coillte should regard as the real value of our forests and our natural heritage. Instead, he mentioned carbon trading credits, which are set to multiply in value in coming years. The casino that we saw wreck this economy with vulture funds, asset funds and so on in terms of housing will now switch to the trading and speculation in carbon credits by profit-hungry international investors. That is what they are up to. Who will own these carbon credits? Perhaps the Minister of State might inform us. Whom will they benefit? This is speculation on environmental destruction because carbon credits are bought by countries that do not take real action to mitigate climate change but buy themselves out of their requirement to deal with the destruction of our environment by buying up credits. Gresham House, facilitated by public money and public premiums by the State company, will facilitate speculation on carbon credits. That is what is going on. Of course, that means it wants the fastest-growing cheapest type of forestry that gains value for its investment and gains profit for it, regardless of the consequences for environment, communities, small farmers, biodiversity or climate change mitigation. It does not have the remotest interest in those things. It will exacerbate an already failed forestry model that has been dominated by the Sitka spruce industrial monocultural model which is a blight on our landscape and has done such damage to many communities and so on. By the way, it is an accident waiting to happen. As with ash dieback what happens if anything goes wrong with these massive industrial single-species plantations? All of it can be wiped out as happened with ash. Has the Minister of State heard of the bark beetle, for example, which is running riot through spruce plantations throughout Europe? It could potentially wipe out the entire forest estate. The pine weevil is already doing damage to Sitka spruce plantations to which they are extremely vulnerable. This kind of forestry model is an accident waiting to happen. It is bad for soil, water, wildlife, farmers, biodiversity and climate change mitigation. A report for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine a few years ago suggested that our forestry model might even be a net carbon emitter. This will exacerbate this to the benefit of vulture funds. This fact has been confirmed by, of all people, the European Commission - not my favourite people. Andrew St. Ledger and I, who were involved in organising today's protest and the Save Our Forests – Save Our Lands campaign, received a leaked document, which presumably the Government has had in its possession for some time. It contains a damning critique by the European Commission of our forestry model and of the failure of the Government to carry out a proper strategic environmental assessment on its forest programme. Is that the real reason we have not got state aid approval? We provided this damning indictment to the Irish Examiner yesterday and has been published in that newspaper if the Minister of State has not read it. It slates the environmental impact assessment provided for the Government of the €1.3 billion forestry programme. It highlights failure to comply with the Aarhus Convention, failure to fully deal with the negative impacts of what it calls the dominant Sitka spruce model, failure to address the problems of planting in the wrong places on peatlands and sensitive environments, and doing planting that is damaging wildlife, aquatic life and so on. Is that the real reason? Why was that not in the public domain? When was all this signed off without the Government supposedly being aware of it? The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund is a State agency. Are we really suggesting that the Ministers and the rest of it were not aware of this going on? I am not sure if this stuff has come into the public domain. Records reveal that a company called Gresham House Forestry General Partners (Ireland) Limited was established in April 2022 with Pat Cox, an ex-Fine Gael Deputy and MEP, as a non-executive director. The company also joined the Irish Association of Investment Managers, which is led by the former Fine Gael Minister of State, Michael D'Arcy, who was a Minister of State in the Department of Finance which, I remind the House, is the main shareholder in Coillte. When we are talking about the failed model pursued by Coillte, who set up Coillte? It was Bertie Ahern and Ray Burke. Why does it have a mandate that is all about profit and not about biodiversity, protecting and enhancing the forest estate in the interest of the people, the public, the common good and so on? As we know, Bertie Ahern subsequently headed up the International Forestry Fund of IFS Asset Managers, based in Dún Laoghaire. We had to go marching in 2013. It was not Pat Rabbitte who stopped the plan then of the troika and the Government, signed in a memorandum of understanding, to sell of the entire harvesting rights of Coillte. One of the groups looking possibly purchasing those harvesting rights was a fund headed up at the time by Bertie Ahern. Thousands of people marched in the save our forests demonstration and the Government was forced into a humiliating, but good retreat. The numbers will swell unless the Government gets out of this deal and end such deals. Has a strategic environmental assessment even been done of this deal to see the damage it could do to the environment? The Government needs to get out of this deal and reform Coillte.

It is a very important one for many reasons. Forestry offers tremendous opportunities and if we heed the necessity to deliver on the commitments of afforestation, we can contribute to tackling some of the biggest challenges we face as a country. We do not need to think back too far, to the Covid-19 pandemic, to recognise the importance of our forests and public spaces as places to go for respite from the stress we all endured. I am sure we all appreciate that through national afforestation plans, through Coillte and farmers throughout the country, those spaces will be increased dramatically in coming decades.  I understand the Government intends to increase the numbers of trees planted in Ireland. This will not only help us meet the challenges we face, and I will discuss those issues shortly, but it will also allow us to provide significant amounts of recreational forests and woodlands, which can be enjoyed by all our people, young and old. This is a key part of rebuilding the bond between our people and our natural environment, something I believe most Irish people already hold dear to them, and something they want to see more of.Our global environment is under attack. We have seen warning after warning from our scientists. We have seen the worsening of natural disasters occurring across the world and an ever-increasing number of displaced people as a direct result of climate change. We are setting ambitious goals to ensure we meet our own national commitments with regard to climate action, which has resulted in one of the most ambitious sets of climate targets this country has ever had. It will not be easy to achieve those targets but we are making good progress. The next three or four years will be the barometer as to how effective the climate action plans will be in delivering a reduction in our national carbon emissions. Forestry will play a pivotal role in helping us to meet certain aspects of our climate action goals. We know that forests can operate as a carbon sink and, indeed, our forests can be a significant component, boosting not just biodiversity in our country but, as I mentioned, also boosting recreational space. No town or village across the country is unaffected by climate change. No town or village has not felt the effects of the housing crisis. This is where commercial forestry can provide a significant synergy that will allow us to respond in part to one of the biggest challenges we face as a nation with one endeavour. We must increase the use of timber within the construction sector. We have significant goals for housing in the Housing for All plan, which proposes to deliver 300,000 homes by the end of the decade. We will require the use of multiple resources to achieve that target. I believe timber can play a much larger role. Only approximately 20% of our homes are built using timber frame, which compares poorly to some of our neighbours, for example, Scotland, where 80% of the housing stock is constructed with timber. We also know that the use of concrete and cement is a major source of carbon emissions. By reducing the use of those materials and increasing the use of timber, we will not only be able to build a significant number of homes but will also be limiting the production of concrete as part of the process. I recognise that the use of timber in construction should not be the only reason to plant new trees and develop forests. As I said, we need our forests for a number of consequential reasons, including biodiversity and recreation, as well as housing. Finding the right balance in these areas will be key to the overall successful management and development of forestry in Ireland. The target for the 2023 climate action plan has been set to raise the percentage of Irish land being occupied by forest from its current level of 11% to 18% of all land in the country. I note that half of these new forests will be reserved for native woodland and half for timber production. Even within the 50% for timber production, I understand it will not be monocultural. In other words, we will not have the sort of monocultural forests that have been planted in recent decades. That will mean a significant improvement in the biodiversity of the new lands that are going to be planted. It would be remiss of me not to address the recent news involving Coillte, on which subject I have received much correspondence. The situation is being manipulated by some individuals to suit their own particular agendas. The deal that has been announced refers to roughly 3,500 ha of new forests over the next five years. In total, it will involve approximately 12,000 ha where existing forests are included. These existing forests are privately-owned, not public, land. No public land will be involved in this particular partnership. For context, I will also add that Coillte is currently responsible for 444,000 ha of forestry across the State. I will also address the matters surrounding licensing in the forestry sector. Not a single Deputy in the House would contend that system was going well. The Opposition and many on this side of the House regularly assert that the licensing backlog was until recently at a crisis point, and the figures would back up that point. The backlog in licensing has been dramatically reduced and I commend the Minister and the Ministers of State on their work in the Department to make that happen. I also look forward to the forthcoming publication of the national forestry strategy. I understand the Minister and his Department are currently reviewing submissions under the public consultation that will be concluded shortly. I very much look forward to reading that. The strategy will make a valuable improvement to the forestry sector. I am also particularly encouraged by the increase of up to 60% in premiums and the extension of the premium period from 15 to 20 years. Those are steps that are entirely necessary to attract more people to the sector. In the context of the state aid process, I wish to underline that many of our forestry goals can take time. I urge the Minister to keep the House informed of developments in this process as we move closer to a result within this particular application. We are all hopeful that this aspect of the matter will be resolved sooner rather than later.

I acknowledge the massive €1.3 billion investment in forestry, particularly for rural communities, secured by my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett. The forestry programme will help us to achieve many of Ireland's national environmental priorities. Forestry has a crucial role to play in meeting Ireland's climate targets, as well as addressing the decline in biodiversity. The recent national debate around Coillte has raised important concerns and questions about how we implement this new forestry programme. Coillte was established in 1988 as a semi-State commercial business. The organisation employs approximately 900 people and manages about half of the forested land in Ireland. While commercial forestry and the production of lumber for construction will be critical into the future to assist us to meet our climate obligations, national priorities around forestry have changed and Coillte's objectives must also change. As noted by other speakers, Ireland must increase forest cover by approximately 400,000 ha by 2050, as set out in the forestry programme. It is critical that at least half of this afforestation is in the form of native woodland. There is public benefit to this, which must be recognised by Coillte. The Coillte-Gresham House deal about which we have spoken at length today involves the planting of 3,500 ha for new forestry out of an overall objective of 400,000 ha. I understand the background to this deal cited by Coillte around EU state aid rules but I have concerns about the concentration of land ownership and the impact this would have on rural communities. If the deal cannot be reversed, it is clear from listening to colleagues, constituents and stakeholders that we do not want to see this format expanded. I welcome the commitment from the Minister that Coillte will re-engage with farming communities. Farmers should be at the heart of our forestry programme. It is essential, as Deputy Farrell referenced, that there is buy-in from farmers to attract people to afforestation. Increased subsidies are justified, particularly where there is public access to land and biodiversity is improved. I welcome today's debate. The national conversation that is taking place around forestry and the role of landowners and their inclusion is important. Now that the debate is happening, there is greater awareness around the role of Coillte and its intentions in respect of the forestry programme. The programme is essential. There have been calls in this House for a programme for a number of years. The Government has brought forward this plan. It is relatively new. I know the Minister and the Ministers of State are engaging and listening to various groups and stakeholders, which is important. I await the Minister's response.

I assume the Minister, the Ministers of State and everyone else across the House has received a large amount of correspondence from people who have been put out by what they have seen. We can probably all make easy politics of a situation where natural resources are being sold to a British investment fund. That sells well. The problem is that it is partly true. How did we end up in this particular set of circumstances? I am not entirely sure how the conversation went or how Coillte suddenly decided this was a good idea. I accept the difficulties that exist in respect of state aid rules but I do not understand why there was no conversation at Government level. I do not understand how the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, can say he did not know about this deal until it was done in December.I am not sure whether the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, knew about it before that point. What I do not understand is how there was not a conversation to state that this is not what we seek to do. We can get into arguments in regard to 12,000 ha and 1% and all the rest of it but really this comes down to what the Minister already said is not his preference. Therefore, it is an acceptance that this is a bad deal. This is a bad deal in regard to afforestation and the Irish people. Therefore why are we doing it? On some level this has happened. The second question is, what are we doing to extricate ourselves from what is a really bad situation? What legal advice has been sought in regard to how we backtrack from this? It is all well and good saying deals were done and mistakes were made and we move on. The fact is this is a major disaster. In fairness, we have to congratulate all those people who have become worked up in regard to this. While we might be talking about 1% and 12,000 ha, most of it land that was already forest, the fact is that we could have been talking about a huge number of the future plans in regard to afforestation. The only reason this happened is obviously that due diligence was not done in regard to the European Commission from a point of view of providing another modality or means for Coillte to do this. Clearly a huge amount of work needs to be done to buy back trust with farmers. We can talk about ash dieback or the issue with licensing and backlogs and so on but the fact is what we are all hearing is that the Government lacks credibility because it is dealing with farmers and others who have been burnt too many times before. We need to be able to engage them and bring them back into play. We certainly do not need this deal that nobody seems to think is a good idea. The Minister of State does not seem to think it is a good idea. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, does not think it is a good idea. We have heard multiple Government Deputies also saying that. The Tánaiste said this needed to be reviewed. Has anything been done in regard to reviewing this? We absolutely need to backtrack out of this deal and introduce a real means of doing business. What conversations have taken place with the European Commission and who has had them from a point of view of getting around state aid rules? We know state aid rules have changed. We know that when the Germans and the French talk to the European Commission in regard to the need for them to deal with variances, anomalies and stuff they determine is absolutely required by France or Germany, they are able to deliver changes in regard to state aid rules. I believe therefore that there is a fair argument here in regard to this. I also accept that on the particular issue I had with the European Union and the European Commission was their at times absolute opposition to public and state services. Now I think the European Union and the European Commission have learned a lesson through Covid-19 when they saw the absolute necessity that sometimes the State has to step up to the mark. Therefore you have to facilitate the State and semi-State bodies such as Coillte. We cannot have a case where the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is going to put in €25 million and Coillte is going to put in €10 million. Let us be clear. Gresham House is only here to do business for Gresham House. What would the point of it be if for any other reason? It is hardly going to be altruistic. We have all accepted it is a bad deal so the deal needs to be stopped. We need a move back from it but I want to know what conversations have been had from a legal point of view. We need to find a means to do this properly and do the business that needs to be done from a climate change point of view. I hope the Minister of State will have answers to all those questions.

When stories circulated that land was to be bought by a British investment company and fund they were convinced it was a practical joke. Unfortunately, it was neither a rumour nor a joke. In fact it would appear that a deal was done before the majority of those impacted had an opportunity to ask questions or raise objections. The low-key manner in which all of this took place gives serious cause for concern. Aside from being a shock to the farming community it has caused ripples of lost confidence in the belief that Government is putting Irish farmers’ best interests front and centre. These ripples are not unfounded. The irony of this plan by Coillte to enable Ireland to meet its climate target is not lost on the farming community. When one looks a little deeper questions arise as to why we are now worried about meeting our targets and how did this situation arise. The finger can in fact be waved in the direction of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Coillte last year was issued with 110% of the felling licence allocation with only 68% of the private sector afforestation target reached. This failure to grant adequate licences to farmers has been ongoing since 2016. A worrying 416 private afforestation applications remain unprocessed despite desperation and pleas to the Department from applicants. This has massively impacted on farmers’ ability to remain in forestry. The Department has failed to ban imports which has allowed ash dieback to take hold in this country. Farmers have found themselves with dead plantations as a result, effectively pushing them out of forestation. The administration of the ash dieback reconstitution scheme is ponderous and slow. This scheme is of critical importance to many forestry holders throughout County Tipperary and throughout the country. It is totally unsatisfactory that of the applicants who applied in 2022, 587 have yet to be processed and approved. The decisions by the Department on land designation which have been deemed to have been without any scientific justification have resulted in farmers being told that their land is unsuitable for forestry. How many land owners contribute to meeting climate targets? How can they contribute if their efforts are blocked? In order to deliver on our climate obligations Coillte had to do something. It brought the Gresham House asset managers on board. As a result the Irish Strategic Forestry fund came into being with the aim of seeking investors. We are told that Coillte will be the land purchasing, planting and forestry management body. However, the new fund will own the land and be entitled to any grants and premiums. Where does the blame rest? Had the Department issued licences and addressed the problems with imports, would Coillte have needed the support of an investment fund? This is the key reason farmers and their prominent and influential representatives bodies do not agree with this approach. They are also concerned that land prices will soar. In fact prices are already on the rise. The shared aim of farmers with the support of Government should be to address climate change. Government has completely let farmers down in this regard. It has also forced Coillte, an independent body, to take action. The investment company is not trying to make a job of meeting climate targets easier for Ireland. Its objective is to capitalise on the fact that we have failed to do this for ourselves. Its end-game is not climate action but its bank balance. It has no allegiance to Irish issues.  The arrangement put forward is a sell-out of a national resource. It is not acceptable. It does not have the support of industry partners nor of the majority in this House. It does not have the support of the public and overall it is a bum deal for the Irish people. It has not been thought through and will have lasting consequences. It must be reviewed.

The reason Ireland are failing to reach afforestation targets is not because Coillte are not participating but because the forest service in the department of Agriculture have literally made it impossible.Historical issues leading to the decline.- Arbitrary departmental policy decisions on land designations without any justification or scientific rationale reduced the supply of suitable forestry land to the private sector since 2010.- Failing to ban plant imports and allowing Ash Dieback into Ireland was a clear dereliction of duty. The reluctance to provide adequate supports for farmers with dead plantations since has resulted in a decline in farmer participation in forestry.- Above all, the shambolic forestry licensing system designed by the department has resulted in a complete collapse of the sector since 2016. This licensing scandal is now in its 6th year, why has this not been addressed.- The final nail in the coffin is that currently and for the first time in living memory we don't even have any forestry program in place.Furthermore, the minister has no idea when or even if the proposed programme will be ratified by the European Commission. For us, this means that in the depth of the worst crisis in the history of our industry that all schemes are now closed and our work terminated. In a climate emergency the ministers department have somehow created a situation where afforestation applications are not even being accepted. Surely Ireland is the only country on the planet where this is the case. No applicants permitted to plant trees, we are not open for business!In numbersThe licensing output and stats on the ministers department for 2022 also needs to be questioned. On target licence delivery, the Department’s own figures for Coillte felling are that the target was 1,530, licences issued were 1,687 and the target achieved was 110%. However, for private felling, the target was 1,830, licences issued were 1,606 and only 88% of the target was achieved. That is a pattern that the email sets out in a diagram. The email continues:Coillte were issued 110% of their felling licence allocation for 2022.- Only 68% of the private sector afforestation target reached.- Four hundred and sixteen (416) private afforestation applications remain unprocessed. I will run out of time before I finish the email but I want to highlight that there is palpable anger across the sector. The final lines of the email state:[The Minister] Eamon Ryan spoke last week about having rules changed in the EU so Coillte could claim grants and premiums. Would it not make more sense to fix the forestry licencing system here and allow Farmers to plant their own land - or does that not fit their agenda?
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	423	I am happy to take part in this important debate about the future of forestry in Ireland and to examine the rationale of the Government's current policy. Ecology and biology have long been used in the lexicon of forestry language and we can now add a new word, “codology”, because that is the best description of the recent activity announced by Coillte, a State-supported company which, despite its annual profits, could not muster financial expertise other than to go to Bond Street and Threadneedle Street to find UK partners to figure out how to add capacity to its operations. The domestic forestry sector has been in crisis for a number of years and that is down to just one reason, which is the inefficiency of the forestry office to process applications. Where farmers have had land suitable for forestry, the delays have meant they have diverted into other streams. This point is best highlighted by looking at the historical activity of the domestic forestry sector. In 2000, private domestic growing delivered over 14,000 ha, in 2010, it delivered over 8,000 ha and in the middle of Covid, in 2020, it still delivered 4,000 ha, which is half of our annual 8,000 ha target. However, the message coming from Government is that the domestic activity cannot deliver the afforestation targets we need to meet the climate goals. Helping this narrative is the deliberate prioritisation by the forestry office in terms of putting State-supported activity ahead of the private growers in Ireland. In 2022, Coillte achieved 110% of its felling target, which I am sure it was delighted about, whereas, on the other hand, private felling achieved only 80% of its felling licences and just 68% of its afforestation licences. The continuing failure to provide an efficient licensing regime to the sector is at the heart of the rationale for Coillte to go looking for foreign moneys and for partners capable of achieving subsidy and premium approvals. The Gresham House deal initially was to develop 12,000 ha of Irish forestry over the life of the programme, and this would deliver hundreds of millions in State subsidies to that concern. These moneys will not be transferred to Irish families; rather, they will go to international investors. In addition, given the pushback in recent days from Deputies in this House, Coillte is now saying it will focus on acquiring over 9,500 ha of existing forestry, along with a target of 3,500 ha of afforestation. In other words, two thirds of the fund will now go to acquire lands already forested, delivering nothing in increased climate change target benefits to Ireland. What of Coillte’s responsibility to deliver biodiversity in its afforestation activities? Will it be forced, like the private sector, to provide 20% broadleaf on schemes and 15% open area, or will it, as it does in Leitrim, plant 100% Sitka spruce and then come down to Wicklow and plant 20% broadleaf as part of those schemes? The failure to address the dieback issue is at the heart of the difficulties for farmers getting into the new forestry programme. The Minister has to try to sort out a new scheme. I know that is stopped because it is waiting for approval, but surely the Department can find a way. I am well aware of our need to protect biodiversity and to achieve our climate targets in the forestry sector but I, like others in this House, am fundamentally opposed to the creation of State monopolies, which, the way the present policy is going, is what will propel Coillte. I am also fundamentally opposed to the idea of using Irish taxpayers’ money to incentivise foreign investment interests to enter the Irish forestry market and displace rural and regional farm ownership and farm families. Forestry growers want and need a functioning licensing department that deals with their applications quickly and allows them to enter the forestry programme. The Government’s focus must return to incentivising the perpetuation of our rural and regional economies and it should stop aping other systems, using foreign capital as an excuse to reduce Irish farm capital and to brainwash further and pressure our rural communities to migrate to other settlements. Our Irish lands must be kept in Irish ownership as that is the only guarantee that they will be available to future generations.

Our land use in forestry, instead of being a source of sequestration, is actually emitting 7 million tonnes, which is more than 10% of all of our emissions, and that is going to rise in the coming years to 11 million tonnes. It is very much part of our climate crisis and the challenge that we have in the forestry area. Forestry needs investment because it has to stand the planting cost and people also have to stand without income for 30 years. The State cannot do this alone. We need to mobilise private investment to achieve that as it will not all come from farmers being able to fund it. The reality is that we are 90% off the current target. The investment that is proposed by Coillte here is less than 1% of the new planting that we envisage doing over the next 25 years. That is the reality. I have come in here time and again and listened to Opposition spokespeople lambasting the Government for not having a more effective planting strategy and wanting more, but when Coillte, a body which has national standards applied universally, decides to try to be innovative in this space, the Opposition and many other people jump down its throat. The reality of this investment is that it is being supported by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, a fund that we have set up with independent management to identify areas of investment where we need strategically, as a country, to leverage extra money into this, part of it State investment from ISIF, but part of it privately raised. The investor or the fund manager here is going to target Irish pension funds as one of the core investors in this. If we want to tackle the climate crisis and go from our lamentable performance in terms of both emissions reduction and planting, we need to be innovative. Coillte, far from being a monopoly, owns only half of all, but it is also completely debarred from any State subsidy, so, unlike private investors, it cannot attract moneys to support its activity.The supposition that because there is a fund raising money, that this is undermining the future of farming is totally misplaced. As I have said, this is only 1% of our overall ambition and the reality is that we are not anything like achieving what we need to do. I am fully behind the Government’s approach of supporting farmers. Indeed, this approach ensures that the farmers, and those who are investing, invest in a mixed forest plantation, not conifers alone, and that it promotes with higher subsidies those who are more supportive of biodiversity. Indeed, the forestry strategy outlines a multiple of goals, seven different ones in fact, including climate biodiversity, but also forestry and getting wood products and displacing in our construction industry the excessive use of concrete. Scotland uses three times more wood than we do and we want to see that changed. Forestry is a business and it needs to provide an adequate return both to family farms which invest in it and to anyone else who invests in it. That is the reality. If we want to support a more mixed approach, which we do, it is public policy which must drive that. That is what the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, has been doing in designing her strategy. It is designed to promote multiple approaches. The other reason why Coillte’s activity is to be welcomed is that a reliable State investor like Coillte can ensure that the carbon sequestration standards are achieved by these forestry undertakings. This will be forestry managed to the highest possible standards and able to guarantee the type of carbon sequestration which will become a source of income to family farmers, and the sooner it becomes so, the better. Finally, the farmers that I hear from are reluctant to invest in forestry because it means an immediate devaluation of their land and an obligation to replant at the end. They feel that they are locked into forestry for a lifetime. The arrival of new investors in the scheme will make the sector more liquid and people will be able to move in and out of it. That will create an environment where it is more attractive to farmers to make that investment on part of their farms. I welcome, in particular, the approach of allowing small 1 ha investments in the strategy. Because this company which will be managing the fund is based in Britain, I believe that we have had something of a jingoistic reaction to what is happening here. This is a State enterprise which manages forestry to a high standard and which is completely compliant with all of the new approaches the Minister of State has articulated and is finding innovative ways to deliver in an area where we are totally off the targets we have set for ourselves. We need to look at this in a more balanced way than we have seen here in the House heretofore.

When one hears terms like this is a sell-out and a land-grab, perhaps some of that commentary is overplayed. He is also correct in his assertion that, at the moment, land use in general is an emitter as opposed to a sequester of carbon. For years we have been getting it wrong. I know the Minister of State’s passion for and interest in this whole area and that really comes through but in respect of Coillte and how it has conducted its operations over the past number of years I have very significant concerns. That is because I have seen it on the ground in my own constituency in west Cork. I am one of the very first persons to praise Coillte when it does things right and when it creates amenity parks and walkways through a piece of woodland so that the community can enjoy it. It has done that in my constituency around Castlefreke, where it has created amazing walks and amenities. It has done it in Avondale in Wicklow and in Curraghchase, which is a fantastic forest park in Limerick. When it gets it right, it gets it right, but from a commercial point of view it seems to be hell-bent for the past number of years in selling off bits of land to private entities where the sale will benefit one rather than the community and the many. We have seen that replicated right throughout Ireland and I can give two real examples. In my constituency in west Cork in Castlefreke, in Rathbarry, which I mentioned earlier, Coillte owns a fantastic amenity. There is woodland there and commercial forestry which was previously owned by Coillte which is mixed with old deciduous forestry and native woodland. There was a proposal in 2018 to sell off a large swathe of this amenity. It is only by pure luck that the community picked up on it, we became active and prevented the sale. In 2018, it harked back to the political meetings of old when we would gather at the crossroads. I remember that we met at the crossroads at Rathbarry and we were joined by hundreds of community individuals who wanted to keep this amenity for the community. We did, we fought and we met at Rathbarry. Later there were thousands who met together at a meeting in Rosscarbery where we mobilised and prevented the sale. No community should have to go through that battle to prevent the sale of an amenity owned by Coillte, which is funded by the State. We thought that battle was over, the amenity is there and it is still very much a community amenity but then we moved to Ballymartle, which is an area which has been discussed in this Chamber quite often. The community in Ballymartle are facing the exact same battle where, again, Coillte seem hell-bent on selling off an amenity enjoyed by the community to benefit a single individual or a private company. Again, it is the benefit of the few against the very significant benefits that woodland amenities have for the many. Again, so far we have prevented it and it has been stalled, but the community are having to fight tooth and nail to keep this extraordinary pristine piece of woodland for the community and for the public. There seems to be this strategy, which has existed within Coillte for quite a while, to look at the commercial benefits of a few versus the community and the biodiversity benefits from hanging on to these extraordinary pieces of woodland. Now, the way I look at this is almost a similar approach but on a much larger scale. This is a real shame, as far as I am concerned, and a lost opportunity. As party spokesman on biodiversity and climate action, I know how difficult sometimes it can be to marry agriculture and biodiversity and, equally, to marry agriculture and climate action. There are opportunities and we are seeing a sea change from within the agricultural community. It wants to do more, is buying into these agri-environment schemes, buying into the idea of mixed species swards, and is really going for solar in a big way from an energy point of view. Sustainable forestry was going to be a key method, and still will be, of the farming sector getting involved in improving and reducing emissions, sequestering carbon but also in pursuing biodiversity through sustainable, continuous and mixed woodland forestry. If we go down the route of international investors in a larger scale - I appreciate the fact that it is only 1% of the overall targets but still it is there now in principle - I have very significant concerns because there are small forestry owners out there who are represented by forestry co-ops who have gone through a very stressful number of years in trying to get felling licences, planting licenses and in trying to get involved in forestry. I have been there, met them and I have walked woodlands with them where I have seen the obstacles they have come up against, including the red tape and bureaucracy they have faced. The Minister of State and her Department have done a great deal to remove much of that bureaucracy but I genuinely feel that this is the wrong approach. I cannot stand over or defend it and we are going to see on a much greater scale nationally those community meetings we had in Rathbarry and Ballymartle, which were attended by hundreds of people, unless we get this right.

I will cut straight to the chase. Investment funds or vulture funds, whatever they are called, are again making profit from taxpayers' money. It is as simple as that. Here we go again. Our natural resources for use by the Irish people are being given away or are being chipped away by privatisation for profit. This will affect a number of rural community groups and farmers. The Minister of State referenced depopulation of communities. This will add to it. We need investment in our own stock. I have dealt with Coillte. There is absolutely no oversight of it. It is a quango created by the quango specialists; we know who they are. Coillte is not working. We closed the sugar beet industry a number of years ago because we were told we did not need it. We were then told we did not need fertiliser and we shut down the fertiliser industry. We gave away most of our fishing rights. We have given away oil and are now going to give away another natural resource. It is absolutely bonkers. What is more worrying, however, is the Minister was asked during the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine whether international investment funds involved in the new forestry initiative will also be able to draw direct payments under the Common Agricultural Policy if they hold a herd number. The assistant secretary general of the Department replied that the herd number defines you as a farmer, and that there are farmers that incorporate as companies, so farmers can draw a single payment as long as they were claiming a single payment since 2008. Asked whether the looming forestry investment companies, both foreign and domestic, will be able to draw from the Department's grants and premiums annually, plus the newly established grants under the forestry programme for 2023 to 2027, the Minister said yes, for 15 years. It is absolutely bonkers. I could find other words for it. We never learn from our mistakes. Our natural resources are the biggest gift this country has. I heard some previous speakers state that Europe is putting us under pressure. I can remember 30 years ago, when we were going on about climate action and spreading manure. What did we do about it? Nothing. It only suits the Government when Europe says X or Y so it can pick and choose. The Government will meet major resistance to this. I urge the Minister of State to go back to reconfigure or get rid of Coillte. The Government should not sell, or even rent, our natural resources for profit because it is killing our people by starving them of all the resources and what we can do with them. I am just so angry, as are the people outside Leinster House. I ask the Government seriously to reconsider this.

Where I live in County Leitrim has one of the highest rates of afforestation in the country. Sitka spruce trees are everywhere. When I look outside, where the sky meets the land, it is Sitka spruce forestry on all sides. Forestry is painted as this great thing that will do an awful lot of good for people, but for the communities I live in and represent, it has been a very negative thing because it has starved those communities of people. I will tell the Minister of State why. When farmland is planted, farmers never need to buy a gate or fertiliser again, or cut hedges, or get the vet in when an animal is sick. They never need anything again. Machinery does not need repairing again. All those auxiliary parts of the local economy that require people to do the work to keep farming going are gone. The only thing that happens is that, after about 12 years, some big company comes in with major machinery for about three weeks, thins the forest and activity is then finished for another seven or eight years. In another seven or eight years, there is a big burst of activity for another three weeks but then nothing until the land is clear-felled and then replanted. That is what we see happening in all our areas. In most of the parishes around where I live, the population is less than 30 people per square kilometre, which means that community is in terminal decline. That is what we see happening across much of County Leitrim. When we see very low levels of population, there are very high levels of afforestation. That is the problem we have. In theory, none of us has a problem with trees being grown. They are absolutely brilliant. They do so much for our biodiversity and have such potential, but they kill communities. That is the problem. We need to find a way of dealing with that. I will make a final point. There has been much talk of the corporate sector coming to Coillte to access State money to line the pockets of foreign multinational corporations. That is what we see happening. This is not new. This is already happening. Half the forests that have already been planted have been planted by pension and foreign funds that are coming in, buying up land and planting it under the noses of farmers. Farmers cannot compete with them. This is not a new venture. It is more of the same bad policies of this Government.

It is yet again another attack on our sovereignty as a republic. A halt should be called to this deal without delay. I ask the Minister of State to do the right thing. People have expressed serious concern right across the party spectrum. The Minister of State's job should be to listen and engage. The Minister said this is not the preferred deal. If it is not the preferred deal, why in the name of God would the Government sell us out? Why would it cause a land grab? Why would it turn its back on farming families and communities the length and breadth of this State who are vehemently opposed to such a deal? It is an absolute sell-out and needs to be stopped. I will give a flavour of some of the forestry and farming organisations that are opposed to the Coillte deal. They include the Irish Farmers' Association, Macra na Feirme, Western Forestry Co-op, Irish Forest Owners, the Social, Economic Environmental Forestry Association, SEEFA, the Forest Owners Co-operative Society, the Association of Irish Forestry Consultants, the Agricultural Consultants Association, and Limerick and Tipperary Woodland Owners. That is just a flavour of some of the organisations against this deal. I ask the Minister of State to please listen to them. Does any of this opposition, given its scale and breadth right across farming and forestry, give the Minister or this Government any pause? Does it raise any doubts at all? Does it not signal that the approach being taken by Coillte is not just inappropriate but almost amounts to a breach of the social contract and is most certainly a betrayal of the people? Last Thursday, all the organisations I mentioned issued a statement. It states quite clearly that, "The recent announcement by Coillte that it has joined forces with a major foreign investment house to establish a fund to acquire 12,000ha [of] forests and bare land is strongly opposed by the majority of the main organisations in the agriculture and forest sector." They go on to say it is their view that, "This is the first step in Coillte’s strategic vision to act as an agent on behalf of foreign and national investment funds to transition 100,000 ha of Irish farmland out of local farm ownership for afforestation by funds [and funds for profit]." Of course, the taxpayer is used in all that to the tune of €2.1 billion. The statement continues, "The most saddening part is that this venture is being enabled by the Irish taxpayer to the tune of €2.1 billion of Irish taxpayers’ money". Most of them are opposed to this deal.

I expect her to come back with a good answer as to why she is treating people this way, along with the Minister, who is an absolute disgrace and could not answer any of the questions I asked him during last night's meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The statement goes on to say that Irish taxpayers' money will be:paid in forestry grants and premiums to investment funds to purchase 100,000ha of our sovereign Irish farmland to establish forests. The Irish taxpayer will be paying for the sale of rural Ireland to investment funds. [Is that not betrayal?] This will not add to the local community or the local economy, and furthermore this will have a negative social impact through rural depopulation by encouraging investment funds to compete for land thus disadvantaging existing local, new entrant and young farmers. While any income (forestry premiums, carbon value, profit) will not be spent in the local community or local economy as it would be if farm families or local people afforested these lands [and if they were assisted in that]. We believe this is Government policy to meet afforestation targets at any cost. It is likely to be counterproductive. We do not support it. And it is a bad deal for Ireland.That comes directly from the organisations of whom the Government needs to take heed at this stage. Macra na Feirme has expressed serious concerns about young farmers being outbid and about their not having access to land, even though generational renewal is a real issue that comes up in the EU. Those concerns are all being ignored. It is high time the Minister of State listened to people and called off this deal now.

Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár. My goodness, we are back again. Mention was made today of our visionaries and leaders who fought to free this country. We will commemorate one of them, Liam Lynch, on 10 April of this year. He lost his life, unfortunately, in the Civil War. He was leader of the IRA forces at the time. What ideals they had. A film called "The Dying Days" is being made at the moment and the crew is walking through forestry and trees, or what is left of it by the British. The IRA forces ran the British out of here through guerilla warfare. They could not deal with them. Are we now going to bring the British back in under the names of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party? They are green all right, but they think the people are very green. The people are not green and they are wide awake to the Green Party. It has caused the devastation in Coillte. The delay in licences was there when the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, arrived in the Department. The ordinary farmers cannot get licences. They are being penalised and blackguarded every which way they turn. After applying for three or four different licences, if they wanted to cut a cipín, the Government would not let them. It blamed the staff and everybody else. This is its fundamental policy. The Government did not want this. Those policies are disastrous for this country. I thank the forestry officials, the Coillte officials, who have worked with me and my daughter, Councillor Máirín McGrath, Knockmealdown Active and the Glen of Aherlow Fáilte Society on beautiful forest walks and amenities. I salute those volunteering groups that have created wonderful amenities for people to visit. Are we going to be certain now that the gates will not be locked, with padlocks across those walks? We are not because we will not have control of this. It is as simple as that. The Constitution is there on the desk and the Proclamation is read out at so many commemorations. What of unfettered access to our land and property from sea to sea? Where are we now? We are being sold out to vulture funds. It is easy for Deputy Bruton to say we are getting excited or are overreacting. The next time he is down in Clonmel with his bean chéile, I would ask him to go out to Kilcash and to the Knockmealdown Mountains and see what is happening out there and see the beauty and the enhancement of what is there. We have been sold out. The Minister of State did not do that but her predecessors did. Fianna Fáil sold the sugar industry, a wonderful industry. The current Government has sold out the fishing industry. The Green Party is certainly part of that Government. Now it wants to kill off the beef, dairy and cereal crop industries and allow land to be sold off to vulture funds. We have seen the horrible vulture funds. We heard former Minister Michael Noonan describe them as a necessary evil. Vultures are horrible creatures by nature. We know what vultures, great crows etc. do to young lambs. The very thought of that is anathema to me and the people who elect me. I intend convening a meeting this Sunday at the Knockmealdown Mountains, at the monument to the site where Liam Lynch was fatally wounded. He died in Clonmel hospital afterwards. I invite all and sundry who want to come to enjoy the mountain air and the freedom they have at the moment because of Coillte. I also thank Coillte for providing a loop walk car park this year, and I thank Tipperary County Council and Councillor McGrath for getting the funding to develop that. We want to keep that for future generations. Today was grandparents' day in my local school, which I missed to be here to try to protect our forests and to get the Government to reverse its decision on Gresham House for those grandchildren and our future generations not to have a country craven to big business, craven to vulture funds and craven to the banks. We saw the bailout. We saw how Deputy Donohoe, in his last act as Minister for Finance, gave back the bonuses to the banks. I say "Halt, "Stall the horses" and "Reverse this deal". If we cannot reverse the deal, Coillte should be disbanded, which we have the power in this Oireachtas to do, and a new organisation set up to serve our country and our people. We will not have a bit of carbon sequestration or anything else in this deal. It is rotten from every point of view, and I cannot believe the Green Party is part of it when it talks so much about carbon tax and so on. Again, I salute the men - it was mainly men - who worked in the forest service and their families. They were dedicated and drained the land by hand, planted those trees, made the ridges and harvested them back in the 1940s and 1950s. They made lovely entrances and painted gates with ornate timber and signage. They had respect and love for their work. That is all being wiped away - our heritage, our culture - by a Government that is craven to vulture funds and big business. Members of the Government go over to World Economic Forum, WEF, conferences all the time and speak to people who want to sell out our Constitution. Those Members then have the cheek to go to Arbour Hill and similar places and read out and salute the Proclamation. They should be totally ashamed of themselves and ashamed of every breath in their bodies. They do not represent the people who gave us the freedom of this country. They should not be able to speak their names. They are not fit to do so. It is disgraceful. This must be stopped. If it means disbanding Coillte, we will stop it.

I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, whom I know personally, who is one of the most dedicated public officials we have in this country and who is passionate about resolving the challenges we have in this country in climate and forestry. I pay tribute to her and the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, who are both incredibly serious about their roles. They are performing those roles diligently. I congratulate the Ministers on securing €1.3 billion in investment for forestry. What they are aiming to do is change for the better how we use land in this country such that we will secure our environment for future generations. I congratulate them on resolving the licensing issue that has plagued the system for the past number of years. That was no easy feat. Despite all the noise, cynicism and nonsense we hear in this Chamber, I firmly believe this Government is improving the forestry model. The forestry strategy sets out how forestry for the coming decades will go. It will be better. It will be better for commercial forestry, better for biodiversity, better for construction and better for our environment. I am somewhat bemused by the characterisation of private capital as some kind of mendacious, foreign, malicious way of achieving our aims. For decades the environmental movement dreamed of leveraging private capital such that we could achieve our aims. Of course, these investment funds are not vulture funds by any definition; they are investment funds. They are Irish investors, not British investors. Of course, the Members opposite do not care about biodiversity, or not necessarily, no more than if they were to invest in a rail project they would care about trains. We are using private capital to get what we want. The State is putting guidelines on this money such that we have overall a net positive benefit. We have huge challenges in this country in how we use land. There are and will be trade-offs. The reform agenda is so great we will have many debates like this for many years ahead. The trade-offs are between agriculture, forestry, construction, the rewetting of land where necessary, and restoration of biodiversity as much as possible. However, none of these decisions are easy, and when one makes decisions one creates the space for people to disagree, to shout and to weaponise politics, and that is what is happening here. In construction we do not use timber nearly as much as we could. In Scotland, our near neighbour, 75% or perhaps closer to 80% of home constructions are timber framed. It is closer to 20% in this country. We need to change how we do construction in Ireland. Concrete construction has a huge climate impact on this country, and we simply will not meet our climate targets unless we move from concrete to timber.The double whammy here is that we will displace the emissions from cement generation and sequester emissions by using timber. That is a positive step. It might mean a great deal of commercial forestry and trade-offs, but it is the right thing to do from a climate point of view. I am looking forward to the publication in a few weeks' time of the land use review. It is a major piece of Government work that has taken two years. I believe phase 1 will be published in the next two weeks and will be of interest to every Deputy. Phase 2 will be published in the autumn. Phase 1 is the information gathering exercise and will show us how we use our land, where the economic benefit and emissions are etc. Phase 2 comprises the relevant decision-making. I wish to mention a local woodland, namely, Cratloe Woods, County Clare. Deputy McNamara, who has just left the Chamber, would know it well. The old oaks of Cratloe Woods were used in the construction of the royal palace in Amsterdam. It is just 20 minutes outside Limerick city and is a wonderful amenity. It is where I first learned about biodiversity. I used to race the Clare and Limerick hurling teams around the hills of Cratloe. I wanted to make special mention of Cratloe because the potential to develop it further as an amenity is immense. The woods there are underutilised. I would encourage the Minister of State in this regard and will speak with her on the matter in the weeks and months ahead.

Experts tell us that, if we plant 18,000 ha per year between now and 2050, we will be carbon neutral without taking any other action. That is not an improbability. Back in 1994, we were planting 24,000 ha per year. Of that, 18,000 ha were in the private sector. Farmers and other members of the public were more than happy and enthusiastic to plant trees, and they did so for all the right reasons. Subsequently, we descended into a licensing quagmire. I appreciate that the Minister of State has taken major strides in resolving the licensing issue but the fact remains that confidence in the sector has been shattered. The new €1.3 billion forestry fund is welcome but that news was tinged with disappointment as the state aid rules have not been signed off on and it could take at least another eight months before we get the go-ahead from Europe. In some respects, this restricts new planting, but the real hammer blow was the news that Coillte was teaming up with Gresham House. This issue is a lightning rod for disappointment across rural Ireland. We are told that it is a done deal, but I do not accept that. It is unacceptable that another semi-State company can recklessly and intentionally embark upon a programme of radicalised commercialism to the detriment of national interests. Coillte already enjoys a dominant position in the Irish market and is responsible for as much as 70% of the logs produced here. It decides who can buy them and at what price. The Government and the Department earnestly reached out to Coillte and sought to encourage it to consider further forestry at scale across the country. However, Coillte took this as licence to ramp up its commercialisation plans with a covert plan to bring it to what is almost a position of monopoly in this country. This unholy alliance has the potential to give Coillte absolute control of the bulk of production of a rare natural resource. Coillte needed a corporate ally to reach this position. It looked across the sea to Scotland and saw Gresham House, which now has as much as 25% of Scotland’s forestry market. Coillte, in its wisdom, decided that Gresham House was a perfect partner for it in getting to where it wanted to be. Gresham House does not plant virgin forestry. It only sources semi-mature forestry with the express aim of maximising profit to the detriment of all else. As a consequence, forestry prices in Scotland have careered northwards. An Irish producer active in the Scottish market recently sought to buy a large tract of forestry and was willing to go as high as €150 per cubic metre, double what the producer had paid previously for forestry land in Scotland, in the hope of outbidding Gresham House. However, one cannot outbid Gresham House. The investment house ultimately paid three times over the odds for the land. Its pockets are deep and it does not bother with idealism. Its motive is pure and simple – unadulterated profit. Coillte is setting itself up for a near-dominant share of timber production in this country, which will have a significant knock-on effect on construction, house building specifically and house prices for many people seeking to get on the property ladder. Coillte knows that timber demand will treble over the next three years and that there is an infinite amount of money to be made from timber in the coming years. This deal is dependent on €25 million from the ISIF. I do not accept the argument that the ISIF cannot be told to pull this funding. It is not an acceptable investment for the ISIF, it is not ethical and it will have detrimental consequences for rural Ireland at every level. The Government has it within its power to tell the ISIF to pull the funding. If it does so, the deal will fall apart. Coillte went into this deal with its eyes wide open. It believed it could ride out the subsequent public outcry and backlash. Our most senior politicians, including party leaders, are giving Coillte some cover by saying that this is a done deal, but people can welch on any deal. That has been done countless times down the years. Admittedly, to do so would come at some price, but Coillte went into the deal having researched it and found out the details for itself. It now needs to take stock of the room. It needs to listen to the people and realise that it has lost the room and the Irish people and that the Irish people have seen through the deal. This deal is wrong. It might have made eminent sense in a corporate boardroom in London or Edinburgh, but it should not have made sense for the directors of a semi-State company tasked with managing one of our finest natural resources. Coillte needs Ministers to back away from this deal. It needs to swallow its pride, and whatever losses come with that, and accept that this was a major miscalculation on its part.

Both are important matters to consider. A number of questions arise. Why did Coillte select Gresham House? What procurement process was put in place? Gresham House came up with a great blurb but it is not unique in that. Many investment funds around the world are into greenwashing these days. Were all the other greenwashing investment funds allowed to bid? If not, why? Why did Gresham House choose Coillte? In the short time available to me, I wish to posit some answers. The Minister of State might disagree with them. If she does, I would like to know why. Before I continue, though, I wish to thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for something I found on the People Before Profit website this morning. I read The Irish Times, RTÉ and the People Before Profit website. I am joking, but there was an interesting letter that-----

The Commission’s letter talked about:inappropriate afforestation of sensitive habitats such as peatlands and negative effects on areas of high ecological value including areas under high natural value farming, notably with regard to open landscapes important for Hen Harrier ... and ground-nesting birds such as the breeding Curlew ... It has also expressed concerns about proposed planting in river catchments that are critical for the Freshwater Pearl Mussel.It is not the Minister of State's fault that all of those areas have been degraded over the years. It is not her fault that tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár and that Ireland’s wood cover was cut down centuries ago, but it is her fault if she does nothing about it. As a Minister of State with stated environmental credentials, if she goes into a Department and does absolutely nothing about it, then it is her fault.Turning back to Coillte, the reason one would select Coillte is because State agencies look the other way when it is Coillte. The National Parks and Wildlife Service carries out a valuable function in Clare, as it does right across the country. When the transgressor is Coillte and when the transgression is on Coillte lands, however, the National Parks and Wildlife Service looks the other way because it will be bogged down in paperwork for months with Coillte, whereas if it tackles a small farmer or even a big farmer, it will ultimately be successful and it will see a return. It is easier to go after the small man than Coillte. Forestry practice in general is undoubtedly responsible for a degradation in water standards across Ireland, in particular, in Clare. In east Clare, the Slieve Aughty mountains that I have mentioned to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on many occasions, is heavily afforested, much, but not all, of it by Coillte. The local authority waters and communities office, LAWCO, has carried out surveys into water quality. There is a marked degradation in the Bleach river, in the Lough Graney catchment all the way down into Scariff and the Lough Derg special protection area, SPA. There is also a degradation on the other side, in the Slievebernagh mountains, as well as in the Owenogarney river and the Anamullaghaun river. The Anamullaghaun river, I must declare, flows through a beautiful farm that I am fortunate enough to own. Freshwater pearl mussels, recorded there right up to the 1970s, are gone. Coillte recently commissioned an environmental study because of a project that it is planning to carry out there. It did not look at eels because eels are, of course, protected under European law. They did not look at it specifically because eels were found there as recently as a couple of years ago by Inland Fisheries Ireland. They look away. Lastly, even down to the creation of special areas of conservation, SACs, for example, the Slieve Bernagh bog SAC, I invite the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, to look at the map and see how carefully it is contoured to avoid the inclusion of Coillte land as part of that. If the Green Party wants an overall majority in the next Dáil, it should get whoever drew up that map to do the maps of the next constituencies because it is a work of art. Coillte is not treated equally to others in any way, shape or form. Of course, an investment would want to partner with it.

We all know the dangers of climate change that we are facing. We all know that forestry is one of the best ways this country can help fight climate change. This deal shows the lack of seriousness of the Government towards climate change. This deal shows the Government's lack of an effective plan to deal with it. Only 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions. This crisis was created by large corporations. Large corporations continue to make this crisis worse. They are not stopping any time soon. The Government wants to put the solutions to this back into the hands of businesses so that they can make money out of a crisis they have created. Forestry is vital to combating climate change. It takes CO2 out of the air. It traps greenhouse gases in the soil. It helps reduce in our air and water. It develops ecosystems that speed up all these process. We need natural woodlands, not only to hit emissions targets but to make sure we have solutions to climate change. These forests need to be native and sustainable. They need to promote wildlife and help stop biodiversity loss. They need to benefit communities and farmers and improve people's lives, and they need to be owned and controlled by the public. The deal does none of those things. What this deal does is use public money to hand over lands and profits to a private company. It takes land out of the hands of rural communities. It reduces farmers' ability to plant trees by raising the cost of land on which to plant them. It encourages and worsens the problems of Sitka spruce and monocultural plantations in Ireland. It is handing €2.1 billion of taxpayers' money into corporate hands - more, by the way, than it would cost the State itself to buy the land and plant trees. The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss has said that this could lead to the sell-off of public lands and agreed that State-owned woodlands should be recognised and managed as a strategic long-term national asset for the benefit of the common good. This should also be reflected by keeping land and money in rural communities for their common good. This deal is a clear step away from either of these. We have seen from the Government shareholder's letter of expectation to Coillte that it has no problem with this at all, even though the Minister is now saying it is not the Government's preferred option. We can fight climate change. We have the time and we have the resources. Rather than using that fight to grow our country and society, to put this country's lands and resources in the hands of its people, and to grow and benefit local communities and people's lives, this Government has, once again, gone back to its old playbook to make the cost public and privatise the profits. These companies caused climate change but rather than hold them to account, this Government will not let them walk away scot-free, but with their pockets filled as well. There has been a lot of hay made about how no land will be privatised in this deal, but the money will, the grants will and ordinary people will not see any of it. This has been the line of Government parties for decades that if one cannot privatise assets, they will privatise the profits. It is the reverse of what we did with the banks where we nationalised the debt and taxpayers had to pay. This is not good enough any more. Today, we see, as has been said, that the European Commission has criticised Ireland's forestry policy in a scathing letter. In a leaked document, the Commission's Directorate-General for Environment stated a strategic environmental assessment report submitted as part of the draft national forestry plan does not sufficiently address concerns. In October, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine published a screening note for the forestry strategy from 2023 to 2030, which says that the plan will be 100% Exchequer funded, with state aid approval expected from the European Commission. We now know that letter has not even been submitted. This Gresham deal with exacerbate this and the aforementioned letter confirms that the deal should be shelved. We need to tear up the entire strategy. This is the price we pay for Coillte having a misguided mandate. We do not only need a just transition; we need a just transformation. We need climate justice. We need to make sure that those who have contributed the most to climate change contribute the most to fixing it. This does not happen by handing over billions of euro to big corporations. It happens through taking back power from these corporations and putting the power and benefits back in ordinary people's hands. This deal and its policy only make the rich richer while everyone else struggles. I oppose the deal. The solution to climate change cannot be in the hands of big corporations. The money to fix it cannot be either. It needs to be in the hands of the people in our communities.

We had Private Members' business on Tuesday and we spent over three hours in committee last night talking about some of the issues that have arisen. I am aware it also has come up in Leaders' Questions. I am happy to have a chance to speak about the future direction of Irish forestry policy and, in particular, to urge farmers across the country to look at the new €1.3 billion forestry programme. We have a massive challenge ahead to meet our climate action targets and forestry has a significant role to play in that. That is why we have designed this programme in order that the vast majority of that €1.3 billion will go to farmers to plant on their land and to draw down premia for the next 20 years. I believe it is right that Coillte, as the State foresters, should play a role in our afforestation targets. There has been a lot of talk about Coillte and Gresham House and that Coillte has partnered with private investment, as it is fully entitled to do. As part of that, and Deputy McNamara raised the issue, I understand from Coillte that Gresham was appointed after an independent procurement process; something that a Minister should not interfere with. As we have said, this partnership is only one of the options Coillte has come up with to enable afforestation. Our preferred model of delivering on our forestry targets is for farmers to plant on their own land. I would like to call out the fearmongering and inaccurate nonsense from Deputy Nolan that we are selling 100,000 acres to private interests. We are not. Nor are we putting €2.1 billion of taxpayers' money into the fund. The Deputy certainly needs to check her facts. Government policy is to increase our forest estate from 11.6% to 18% by 2050. This will require 450,000 ha of new forests by 2050 and the vast majority of this will come from our farmers.

This new forestry programme will absolutely deliver on the right tree in the right place for the right reasons under the right management. Under the new programme, the incentives for native broadleaf forests, agroforestry and continuous cover forestry will be significantly increased, and there will also be support for a new forest type, emergent woodland. This is supporting for the first time naturally regenerated woodlands. A further example of our farmer and biodiversity-friendly approach is that organic farmers will be able to receive organic farming payments and agroforestry premiums on the same area of land. Roughly two thirds of our landmass is farmland. Therefore, the reality is that if we are to meet our 2050 forestry targets, we will need to count on a massive effort from our farmers. Our farmers will be the primary drivers of our afforestation efforts and they will be the primary beneficiaries of the €1.3 billion programme. Nothing Coillte has signed up to do changes any of this. The opportunity for farmers remains as it was before the deal. They will benefit most from the new forestry programme. I want to be absolutely clear that any new forests that are focused on timber production will not be monoculture forests. In fact, under the new programme they cannot be monoculture. The days of State-funded monoculture forests with inappropriate setback distances on the wrong soil types are over. This has been something I have been against long before I took office and something I have acted upon in government. Any forests planted under the new forestry programme for timber production will have a minimum 20% broadleaf content and a minimum 15% area for biodiversity enhancement. But it is not reasonable to ban conifer timber production, as some have suggested we should do. We would be left with the prospect of the unsustainable importation of large volumes of wood and the decimation of our own timber production, which will become increasingly important for sustainable construction in the years ahead and for sustaining rural economies. Coillte has committed to an even balance of trees between conifers and broadleafs and the Government is committed to an even balance. The Tánaiste has said it, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said it and I am saying it clearly here today.  The financial incentives are clear for everyone to see. All the feedback we are getting from the proposed rates under the new forestry programme is that the demand for native broadleaf trees is far outstripping the demand for conifers. To deliver on this future - and in response to Deputy Carthy, it is an exciting time for forestry - we will need to engage with the people of the future, the jobs of the future and the skills needs of the future as we invest in forestry education and training to manage our vastly expanded and diverse woodlands. It is clear the Government is serious about making progress in forestry. We have spoken a lot this week about Coillte's further direction. I think it is important to mention a key constraint on Coillte's ability to engage in afforestation without private involvement, which is EU state aid rules. A 2003 EU state aid decision ruled that Coillte as a public authority could not receive state aid in the form of annual forestry premium payments. As mentioned by many in government this week, we also are committed to exploring how we might be able to fund Coillte's afforestation efforts directly, either through capital funding or through grant and premium payment under the new forestry programme without breaching new state aid guidelines adopted on 1 January 2023. Aside from state aid constraints Coillte under its current mandate simply does not have the capital it needs to deliver the scale of this ambition. A huge amount of its profit is re-invested into maintaining and improving its existing forest estate, for example. Coillte's dividend currently goes back to the Exchequer. To take the average dividend over the past five years, to the end of 2021, that is around €30 million per year. Even if the full amount of this average dividend was utilised for afforestation, it would take Coillte in the region of 200 years to do that 100,000 ha of afforestation it has committed to doing. Yes, we do need to look at whether the Government can fund Coillte directly.  To be clear again, however, this fund is not the Government's preferred model to reach its afforestation targets. The preferred model of afforestation is for farmers to plant trees on their land, which is why we have designed the new forestry programme in a way that will pay farmers 33% more in annual premium payments than any other landowner, on top of the single farm payment, which non-farmers do not receive. There is enormous potential for Coillte to establish new native woodlands for biodiversity on lands already in public ownership and suitable for forestry. Coillte is already working closely with local authorities and State bodies to identify such lands. Coillte and Bord na Móna are planting native woodlands on former industrial cutaway peatlands is a great example of this approach. Coillte is also planting new native woodlands through the not-for-profit Nature Trust, and I know the Tánaiste has said we should examine the possibility of the State purchasing land for Coillte to plant further native woodlands and this is something I am happy to explore with the Tánaiste and my Cabinet colleagues. This debate over the last couple of weeks has however raised the larger question of what we as a State want from Coillte and where its focus should lie. As a Green Party Minister of State, it has always been my belief that Coillte should have less of a focus on delivering a dividend for the State coffers and more of a focus on nature, regeneration and afforestation. Perhaps now is the time to look at Coillte's mandate again. My own party was certainly clear in its general election manifesto in 2020 that we should look at a broader mandate for Coillte, which would deliver multiple benefits including environmental and community objectives as well as the production of high-quality timber. This remains our position. I will continue to pursue this with my Government colleagues. I have always wanted a broader mandate for Coillte and if this debate can bring that forward, it will be a very positive result.

The Mental Health Commission's interim report is an important contribution to our objective of providing timely high-quality child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS. The focus on service quality and patient safety is vital in developing and improving services. Following the Maskey report early last year, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, contacted the Mental Health Commission to ask it if it would consider conducting a review such as this into CAMHS services. The Mental Health Commission is independent and ultimately chooses what it wants and both the Minister of State and I were glad that they decided to focus on CAMHS this year. The findings in this interim report are significant. The report makes for very sober reading and is being treated as a priority by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and me, by the Government, by the Department of Health and by the HSE.The findings in the interim report are significant. It makes for very sober reading and is being treated as a priority by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I, as well as the Government, the Department of Health and the HSE. The findings identify issues that are simply not acceptable to me, nor are they acceptable to our healthcare professionals providing these services. Many of the issues raised are being responded to by the HSE, and the Minister of State and I are engaging with the HSE and the Department of Health on what additional actions are warranted on the back of these findings. We are also hearing from front-line clinicians, from excellent groups such as Mental Health Reform, which are here with us this evening, and from professional bodies. The report is one of several important pieces of work under way. These include an improvement plan, addressing issues identified in the Maskey report, many of which have been highlighted in the interim report. There is an audit ongoing on adherence to the agreed 2019 national guidelines. There is an audit on prescribing practices. There is a listening exercise, which is very important, that is focused on engaging directly with service users and their families. A look-back review into cases in north Kerry is being commenced and, critically, the HSE is commencing a review of all open child and adolescent cases that have not been monitored for six months or more. One of the issues highlighted in the interim report is the need for such a review. In fact, it was one of the main asks of the Mental Health Commission, and the HSE has immediately agreed to do that and is undertaking it. The HSE estimates there to be approximately 4,000 such cases. The interim report references 168 cases. The HSE has engaged with 140 of those already and is looking at the remaining 28 cases. I also look forward to the final report, which will come out later this year. Coupled with new national leadership positions in CAMHS, and guided by the national strategy for mental health, Sharing the Vision, these different areas of review are informing what additional actions are required to achieve what we all want which is consistently high-quality and accessible mental health services for young people. As the programme for Government outlines, we are committed to a high-quality, safe and compassionate mental health service for children, women and men. In addition to ongoing and increased funding for mental health services, a focus on service improvement and reform is essential. It is important to say that in spite of the challenges we are discussing this evening, good progress is being made on many fronts, and the Minister of State, deserves great credit for her ongoing work and championing of changes and improvements that patients need to see. I fully empathise with young people and their families who may be worried about receiving the care they deserve. This came to the fore with the publication of the Maskey report and was highlighted again this week. I thank Dr. Susan Finnerty and her team for their valuable contribution so far in both the interim report and final report that will come. I also recognise the important and good work done by CAMHS teams across the country. I thank them for their ongoing commitment to young people and their families. It is important to emphasise that many young people experience a positive outcome with the support of CAMHS. It is important for us to reflect that the interim report quite rightly calls out the things that need to change, but it also makes important points about what is working. It states that 225,000 appointments took place last year under these services. Some 21,000 young people are being supported by CAMHS. Critically, the interim report states that many young people, and their families, have received "excellent care and treatment" and we must keep that in mind. To the credit of the 73 CAMHS teams nationally, they have turned additional funding and supports from the Government into a 21% increase in the number of new patients being seen. Let us think about that for a second. In spite of all the challenges and difficulties that Covid caused for patients, their families and service providers, our CAMHS teams increased the number of new people being seen by 21% and that must be acknowledged. The problem is that demand for services rose by 33% during the same period. There is no health service in Ireland, and I dare say very few anywhere, that could absorb a 33% increase in demand in a short period and not come under significant pressure. It would not be any different with our CAMHS services. While the work and reviews are ongoing, we must ensure that people are receiving appropriate care today. Acknowledging the serious concerns raised in the report, I remind all those using CAMHS, and their families, that HSE Live is available to support children, young people and families with concerns arising from the interim report. The telephone number is 1800 700 700 and lines are open Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday to Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. What of the overall direction for mental health and youth mental health services? The HSE is essential in implementing the recommendations of Sharing the Vision and it sits on the national implementation monitoring committee for the implementation of the 100 policy recommendations. Progress is being made on the implementation plan. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance mental health services and supports up to 2030, from mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service. With improved links to youth mental health services in the widest sense, CAMHS is crucial to Sharing the Vision. As of the third quarter of 2022, some 88 of the 100 actions are in implementation stage, with 57 marked on track. I have no doubt we would all love to have the 100 actions marked as on track, but we must bear in mind that our health services providers, the people tasked with doing this, have been dealing with the most difficult health care crisis in 100 years at the same time. We must bear that in mind when we look at the level of implementation. I acknowledge the broad support, co-operation and balanced understanding always shown in this House in respect of these policies and the support for Sharing the Vision. Funding is essential. Budget 2022 provided €1.149 billion for mental health, including specific funding to enhance CAMHS. It allowed for the provision of two new CAMHS telehubs and a dedicated €6 million to expand capacity within the community mental health teams. Further investment was made last year in the national clinical mental health programmes and new models of care, many of which benefit young people directly. One example is the national clinical programme on eating disorders. An additional €1.15 million was secured enabling the development of three new specialist eating disorder teams, bringing the total number of teams funded to nine. There are four fully-operational teams now and the other five are nearing full recruitment, expecting to be fully operational early this year. It is a very important and welcome development that has come about because of the political prioritisation from the Minister of State. The CAMHS eating disorder teams are operational in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, 4 and 7 with recruitment well under way in CHOs 2 and 9. Another programme was the CAMHS intellectual disability model of service, which the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, launched last September. It was developed to enhance services for those with intellectual disability, advancing the development of specialist mental health services and standardising the care. Currently, there are 38 mental health intellectual disability staff working across five CHOs. That work is ongoing and is very important. I know from talking to service users and parents, that pathway is not fully there many people. If there is a combination of mental health and intellectual disability issues, the model of care is meant to be very clear and laid out. However, it is not being properly or fully implemented in all areas, and it is something we are looking at. Funding in 2022 also included €10 million for mental health services relating to Covid. Our service providers kept 90% of the services going during the Covid pandemic, which was good to see.This year, the Minister of State secured an extra €57 million in core funding for mental health bringing the total budget to €1.2 billion. That is an increase of almost €200 million. We need to promote quality and safety in light of increasing demand and case complexity. It includes more integrated care between CAMHS and primary care and disability services, which is so important. Yes, we need to focus on CAMHS. There are many excellent things happening in it but there are also many serious issues that have been identified in this and other reports. However, we really need to be talking about youth mental health, of which CAMHS is one part. We have primary care psychology and amazing community-based teams like Jigsaw and others and we need to maximise prevention, early intervention, low-complexity treatment where that is appropriate and make sure CAMHS is available for all those who need it. We are not there yet and because of that, there are referrals to CAMHS that would be better suited to fully functioning primary care psychology services and other community-based services as well.  However, an extra 500 people are working in mental health services since the Government took office. There is a workforce of 10,500 healthcare professionals and 97% of those roles are filled. The Minister of State is working with the HSE on the remaining 320. We have 73 CAMHS teams with clinical governance from 80 psychiatrists. Very substantial resources are in place. The report is entirely on the money with regard to ICT systems. It is not good enough that community services across the country, not just mental health services, are still using paper files instead of IT systems. It is something we are prioritising and we need to roll that out quickly. Two new roles are coming in to which the Minister of State will speak. One is a clinical leadership role while the other is an administrator of leadership role to make sure the changes that need to happen are championed and co-ordinated with broader healthcare supports in hospitals and the community.  I will finish where I started, which is by acknowledging the work of the Mental Health Commission and the very serious nature of the issues it has raised. They are issues the Minister of State sought to have raised. It is one important piece of work in several reviews that are ongoing to make we have the best possible services.  We get into very robust debates in this House, as we should. I was in the Seanad earlier. Some of the language used would lead one to believe there is not a nurse, doctor or health and social care professional in the country providing a decent service to any patient. Some of the language was around total systems failure, which we know is not true and it is not true of CAMHS either. A lot of people will be watching this debate. A total of 21,000 young people use CAMHS. Can we bear that in mind and bear in mind that the interim report explicitly states that many people are receiving excellent care and treatment as we discuss this over the next few hours?

I am very pleased to attend today with the Minister and I will also be in the Seanad next week. The Government is fully committed to the delivery of high-quality, person-centred and recovery-oriented mental health services. The Mental Health Commission’s interim report on the independent review of the provision of CAMHS in the State by the Inspector of Mental Health Services looks at service delivery and administrative practices in five CHOs. The interim report, which focuses on five out of nine CHOs, is a timely contribution to the common objective of improving CAMHS overall, especially when it comes to quality and safety. Following on from several meetings to discuss the Maskey report earlier in the year, I asked the Mental Health Commission to expand the remit of its annual thematic report to take cognisance of the Maskey report, which had been recently published. I was pleased to provide the necessary resources to the Mental Health Commission to enable this comprehensive review to take place running in parallel with the HSE national CAMHS audits. I look forward to the publication of the full report later this year and the relevant data supporting findings and I thank Dr. Susan Finnerty and her team for their work to date. The Mental Health Commission plays a vital independent role in supporting and assisting in the development and improvement of mental health services. In highlighting areas where practices can and should be addressed, the interim report of the commission provides an opportunity to ensure that HSE services continue to be improved. At the outset, it is important to highlight that many of the findings in the interim report relate to specific operational issues within CAMHS teams that have been recognised and resolved by the HSE. However, young people and their families have the right to expect a service from CAMHS that is person-centred and meets their needs in a timely manner. Any single instance that falls short of the high standards that patients and their families should rightly expect is an area of concern. Like the Minister, I am acutely conscious of the 21,000 children and young people who receive supports from CAMHS. I am very conscious of the 770 people working in CAMHS who provide a very good service in the main. I was also very conscious when I spoke on radio this week on several occasions that the radio might be on in the waiting room and children and their parents might be listening to this debate. My job as Minister of State is to make sure we can put the correct procedures in place to make sure we can build confidence in CAMHS. I am reassured from the ongoing and extensive engagement between my Department, the HSE and the commission regarding the findings of the interim report that care in individual cases has not been seriously compromised. Any areas of concern identified by the commission in carrying out its report were escalated immediately to the HSE for immediate action and resolution.  I understand the anxiety that patients and their families may have as a result of this interim report. Issues around open cases, medication reviews and governance of services are not to be taken lightly and I certainly do not take them lightly. It is of huge importance to me that parents are reassured that the services their children receive are safe and appropriate. Last year, many young people and their families received excellent care and treatment within CAMHS teams, which have nearly 21,000 cases nationally and see 225,000 appointments annually. I again encourage anyone engaged with CAMHS to stay connected to his or her team. I have visited many CAMHS teams the length and breadth of the country in the past six months and was really struck by a young girl I met in Dundalk who came along with her mother. She had been in the care of CAMHS for four years, was almost 18 and was just exiting. She told me she had 96 appointments over four years. She had been seen every fortnight for four years. I was struck by her and how grateful she and her family were to the team for the help and support it gave her. There are many more. Notwithstanding that, we know there are many issues relating to not everyone receiving the service they should get. As recommended by the commission, the HSE has confirmed to me that it is undertaking a review of open patient cases. This will initially consist of a review of all open cases where the patient has been prescribed medication by his or her CAMHS consultant or doctor and who has not been seen in the last six months by his or her CAMHS teams. This is the right thing to do. It is essential that these open cases are reviewed as a priority. I met with the HSE today and met with it yesterday with the Minister. We have had several meetings. This work will start immediately.  This review of open cases will provide crucial further assurances that these children and young people are receiving appropriate care that is reflective of their current and future health needs. Importantly, the review will include a focus on physical health monitoring for those who are on medication. As per the recommendation of the commission, these reviews will be based on NICE guidelines or similar relevant and clinically appropriate guidelines.  While this is an interim report with further work to be undertaken by the commission across the other four CHOs, the HSE has been proactive in ensuring that lessons learnt thus far have been disseminated throughout all CAMHS. On receipt of the draft report from the commission, the HSE national mental health office undertook engagement calls and meetings with all CHO management teams to share the observations and findings of the interim report.All documentation in response to this report has also been shared with all CHOs, along with regular update meetings with heads of service and chief officers. In addition, lessons and recommendations from the Maskey report have also been shared with CHOs. At all times, the HSE has sought to ensure that it is proactively improving services based on the recommendations of reports and audits. In the context of issues highlighted in the commission’s interim report, the new mental health Bill is at an advanced stage and will further underpin the rights of children accessing mental health services. It includes a number of reforms specific to children and young people such as the introduction of guiding principles; an overhauled approach to consent to admission and treatment for children and young people, including allowing young people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to mental health treatment on the same basis as physical health; and additional statutory safeguards such as the provision of information and care plans to all children and young people receiving inpatient treatment. A new Part has been introduced to the Bill setting out the process of admission and consent to treatment for children, introducing capacity and consent for young people, and mirroring safeguards for adults under the Act for children, such as the right to information. The Bill will provide for the presumption of capacity for all young people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to mental health treatment. This will bring important parity between mental health and physical health on consent, as the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act provides for people aged 16 and 17 years to consent to medical treatment. The Government acknowledges that mental health services must constantly evolve and develop to ensure they are in line with international best practice and regulatory requirements. I note the recommendation from the commission regarding the need to regulate CAMHS. Regulations and standards play an important role in ensuring that healthcare services are safe, of high quality, and negate risk. Inpatient CAMHS are currently subject to the Mental Health Commission’s regulation, registration and inspection process, with annual inspections of each approved centre under the Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006. As was set out in the published general scheme of the mental health Bill, the regulatory remit of the Mental Health Commission will expand to include all community residential services and all community services. Regulations will be drafted to set out the parameters of the commission’s regulation of these services following the enactment of the new mental health Bill.  Regulations must be drafted under relevant primary legislation, which in this case in the Mental Health Act. The new mental health Bill includes an overhauled approach to Part 5 of the Act which relates to regulation. As set out in the published general scheme, it will extend the commission's powers of regulation, registration and inspection to all community mental health services. The new Part 5 will provide a strong statutory basis to underpin the making of these regulations. The significant and complex objective of drafting the new mental health Bill has been well under way for some time. I am pleased to say that the mental health Bill has been selected for priority drafting for the spring legislative session. Officials in my Department are working hard to progress the Bill with a view to the Bill being introduced as early as possible this year. The scale of extending the Mental Health Commission's regulatory remit to inspect all community residences and services will be sizeable and officials in my Department will continue to engage with the commission on both the drafting of these regulations and on the particulars of how the commission will take on the additional responsibilities. This, and any further recommendations for the Department arising from the commission’s independent review, will be considered on receipt of the Mental Health Commission's full report, which I understand will be completed by May of this year. Deputies will all be aware of the significant timeframes associated with finalising new primary legislation, and new regulations, and I know that I can rely on their support to expedite this as quickly as possible over this year, since this is important legislation. An important new approach is that statutory entitlement to engage with an advocate will be included as one of the numerous proposed changes for the care and treatment of children in the Bill. This is grounded in a rights-based approach and belief that young people and their parents have the right to be listened to and consulted about their care, with meaningful participation and engagement that will assist their recovery. In line with the current national policy, Sharing the Vision, HSE national mental health services is committed to further developing an advocacy service that will ensure service users are empowered to lead in their own care as is their human right. Advocacy services are currently available to all adult inpatient acute units provided by Peer Advocacy in Mental Health. While the need for independent advocacy services across CAMHS has always been present, the Maskey review has highlighted the need for independent advocacy services for both community and inpatient settings across the country. The youth advocacy programme, YAP, provides advice to young people and their families, and it plays a vital role in supporting them in their journey through CAMHS. I was pleased to launch this programme last August. It is operating in CAMHS in Galway, Linn Dara in Dublin and for CAMHS community services in Kerry. Further roll-out of this programme to the CAMHS units in Cork and north Dublin and to local community-based services is being progressed by the HSE. The independent Maskey report of the review of care provided by south Kerry CAMHS made findings regarding significant failings across multiple levels of the system and made 35 recommendations to improve service delivery. These recommendations cover a broad range of areas such as re-establishing trust in CAMHS, governance of the service, delivery of clinical services, improved clinical practice and the use of information and communication technology to support the delivery of services. The Government and the HSE are committed to implementing the recommendations. The 35 recommendations have led to 63 actions, 19 of which, both national and local, have been implemented, with others under way. Three specific audits are being carried out to provide assurance to those who use CAMHS. The HSE has commissioned independent national audits on prescribing practice, chaired by Dr. Colette Halpin, compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines, and research into service users' experiences of CAMHS. These audits will greatly help the potential for service improvement and expanding good practice. The information arising from the audits will be used to ensure that services meet the needs of patients and their families, and that services are provided to the highest of standards. I turn to Kerry CAMHS and would like to outline developments. The consultant psychiatrist post at south Kerry CAMHS has been fully funded since 2016 but is unfortunately still vacant. The substantive consultant post has been advertised several times but is yet to be filled. Although extensive efforts to recruit to this post have been undertaken, the HSE does not envisage this post being filled in the short term due to a shortage of qualified personal applying in the area. Notwithstanding that, we have 80 consultant psychiatrists working across all 73 CAMHS teams. Extra clinical and administrative supports have been put in place at south Kerry CAMHS to support the team there. As part of the implementation of the Maskey report and for completeness and good practice, a file identification exercise was initiated by the HSE in north Kerry to identify any remaining files where a doctor may have had an involvement, at any level. A screening exercise was carried out to establish what type of involvement the doctor had in each of these cases. From the screening process, a relatively small number of files was identified as requiring a full review. Dr. Maskey also undertook this review, which is now complete. The outcome of this review was that some children were identified as having an adverse outcome and some a minor event. The HSE commenced an open disclosure process on 14 December and offered to meet all the families involved. These cases fall within the same categories as the initial 240 identified by Dr. Maskey in the context of his original report. I have fully supported the further reviews by the HSE into CAMHS in north Kerry. I am clearly concerned that 16 further cases have recently come to light in this area. I have been closely monitoring developments in this with the HSE and I am satisfied that appropriate action is being taken by the HSE. The HSE in CHO 4 will now establish a lookback review to focus on the files of young people currently under the care of the north Kerry team. The terms of the lookback review are being drawn up and the focus is on progressing this as quickly as possible. In April last year, the Government approved a compensation scheme for individuals identified as affected by the Maskey report. This scheme is being administered by the State Claims Agency. Such a compensation scheme was called for by many mental health advocates, including families in south Kerry, and I was determined to drive this through to conclusion. I thank everyone who was here to listen to me and I will deal with other issues when I wrap up at the end.

I begin by thanking Dr. Susan Finnerty and the Mental Health Commission for this report. I welcome to the Gallery representatives from national mental health and children’s organisations, including ADHD Ireland, Shine, ISPCC, Mental Health Reform, A Lust for Life, Children's Rights Alliance, BelongTo and Pieta. I will have a number of questions throughout my speaking time that I ask the Minister to respond to in his closing remarks and if he is unable to, I would like a written response.As we know, this interim report was published early because of the level of risk to children identified in CAMHS. Have the Minister, the Minister of State, the Department of Health or the HSE asked the Mental Health Commission to delay publishing of this report? If so, when did this happen and why was there a request to delay this report that had identified significant risks to children? These risks were escalated to the HSE. When I asked the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about the nature of these risks in December she told me that the HSE did not inform her what they were. When did the Minister of State become aware of the nature of these risks? There is a huge disconnect between the Department of Health, the Minister and the Minister of State and the HSE. Where does this buck stop? Who is ultimately accountable and responsible for the current crisis in CAMHS? Nobody in a senior role in the HSE or the Department of Health was held accountable despite huge governance issues highlighted in the Maskey report. Sinn Féin has been calling for the reinstatement of a national clinical director for mental health in the HSE. The role was discontinued in 2016. What was announced this evening is an assistant position. That is simply not good enough. The Minister of State has responsibility for mental health and her colleague is the Minister for Health. They must instruct the HSE to appoint a national director who will be accountable to her and responsible for mental health within the HSE. If I was Minister with responsibility for mental health that is what I would do. I am going to provide some solutions. First, we need ring-fenced funding for CAMHS. It needs a clear and accountable budget. Sharing the Vision, the Government’s mental health plan, has not been costed and there is no timeframe for implementation. Sinn Féin set out a multi-annual funding plan in our alternative budget. The Government must do the same. That would give CAMHS the autonomy to put in place its own recruitment process that would not have to compete with other healthcare disciplines. The HSE needs to start doing comprehensive exit interviews with all staff who are leaving the service. That would to help identify the problems around staff retention and put measures in place to keep these vital workers in CAMHS. As the Minister said, children need to move between primary care, disability services and specialist services, such as CAMHS, according to their changing needs. The never-ending waiting lists for children’s therapies are having an impact on children’s mental health. There are more than 13,000 children waiting on an appointment for primary care psychology. We have waiting lists for Jigsaw of up to 20 weeks. There are 4,000 children waiting on an initial appointment with CAMHS. That is an 86% increase in children waiting for vital mental healthcare under the Ministers' watch. I have spoken with families who are frustrated, distressed, and frightened as they try to cope with deteriorating mental health difficulties while left waiting. I am calling on the Minister to put in place a strategy to co-ordinate relationships between CAMHS, community disability network teams, primary care services and NGOs. As we heard, the HSE is conducting three national audits into CAMHS. They cover the areas of prescribing practice, operational guidelines, and service user experience. Can the Ministers explain how there were no risks pertaining to CAMHS documented on the HSE risk register despite three ongoing audits? Are they aware of any risks to children identified so far by the three HSE audits?  The Mental Health Commission made repeated requests for an action plan for identified risks in the report. The plan, when finally received, was not sufficient to address the risks. In some areas reviewed, there was limited understanding as to what constituted a risk, how it was assessed and how it was escalated. Some CAMHS teams were so frustrated they did not bother to escalate risk as there was no point and that resulted in a haphazard reporting of risks. An urgent training programme on risk management must be rolled out to all staff at all grades in CAMHS.  I want the Minister to produce a report on the recommended minimum staffing levels in CAMHS. The last time this was done in any meaningful way was in A Vision for Change, 17 years ago. Education and training places must be rapidly increased across higher education to give us a pipeline for CAMHS staff. Children are presenting with more complex needs than ever before. The Minister must invest in early intervention for psychosis. Staff are working beyond their contracted hours and are burnt out and frustrated. Staff in CAMHS go into this vocation because they want to help vulnerable children. As the Minister said earlier, some excellent treatment has been delivered by these staff in CAMHS. However, the report’s states that CAMHS depends heavily on a model of care which places the onus on a single profession, namely, the consultant psychiatrist. The report states that this is not in line with international best practice. Has the Government considered an alternative model of care?  One area the Government can put in place quickly is an integrated IT system. It is 2023. We should have that at this stage. Most services do not have an IT system that manages appointments and maintains clinical files. Only one CAMHS area had electronic records and these were provided through an independent agency. I understand that this is the St. John of God Hospital in CHO 6. The one CHO area that is operated independently from the HSE passed this review with flying colours. I think that says everything. What engagement has the Department of Health had with St. John of God to see how it manages risks, governance, and IT? That is a conversation that needs to happen. From my previous career working with people who have addiction problems, I know the value of care plans. They are vital for a person’s recovery and personal growth. Care planning in CAMHS was either absent or of such poor quality to be meaningless. High quality care planning does not require extra resources and it is hard to understand why this was not taking place. This is another area with the proper training that could be resolved very quickly. One of the most damming parts of the report was the evidence that some teams were not monitoring antipsychotic medication in accordance with international standards because there are no national standards at the moment. Some children were taking medication without appropriate blood tests and physical monitoring which are essential when on this medication. The Taoiseach acknowledged this in the House during the week. It is of serious concern that in some CAMHS teams children with open cases were lost to follow-up. That means that children who should have had a review of prescriptions or monitoring of medication did not have an appointment for up to two years. That is downright scandalous. These included young people who had reached their 18th birthday with no planning, discharge or transition to adult services or any advice about medication. We need a plan for expanding CAMHS to help young adults up to the age of 25. This is international best practice, but currently we are letting children drop off a cliff edge at 18 years.  For one team, there had been 140 "lost" cases. This is a complete mess and children were put at unacceptable risks. Every resource possible must be put into finding these lost children and making sure an appropriate treatment plan is put in place. A complete clinical audit of every open case must be done as a matter of urgency. I know the Minister said this is going to happen. I would like to see a timeline on that clinical audit. The Government must set national standards for monitoring the use of antipsychotic medications by children and young people. That should be part of new regulations under the Mental Health Act focused on regulating CAMHS. It is clearly needed to ensure that no more children are given strong medication and then forgotten about. Can the Minister commit to implement this solution as soon as possible? I am one Deputy with one member of staff and in less than ten minutes I have given the Minister and the Minister of State solutions to improve the quality of care in children’s mental health. There is no greater crime than denying a child the right to reach their full potential. Both of the Ministers have numerous staff, special advisers, a whole Department and the HSE at their disposal. Surely they can implement the solutions to keep our children safe. If they cannot do so, then it is time for someone else who has the ability, the strength, and the political will to address this crisis caused by their Government and successive Governments. I will finish by acknowledging the work that staff in CAMHS do. I deal with them daily. They find the systems are working against them. Recruitment and retention and the panel system of recruitment needs to be looked at. It is something that can and should be done. It is delaying the processes.How many of the 73 CAMHS teams which the Minister mentioned are in place are fully staffed? It has been stated that 97% of the time CAMHS responds to children in a couple of months. How many of them are responses that go to families to say it will be back in touch in a couple of months to give an appointment maybe this time next year? Some 600 children have been waiting for an initial assessment with CAMHS for over a year, which is not good enough. The Minister said that early intervention is key. We need to put things in place to ensure children get the care they need when and where they need it. A child who gets the early intervention is less likely to need more acute CAMHS care.

I start by retelling a nightmare story endured by a family over the past 11 days. It is one of hundreds of stories that have happened under the watch of the Government. It is a story about a father and his 16-year-old child. It started on Monday, 16 January when the parent received a call from the school that the child had attempted suicide by overdose. She was taken by ambulance to the accident and emergency department in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital where she was admitted for treatment and given antidote medication. That was the fourth time this child had been admitted to hospital for the same reason. On Wednesday, 18 January, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital discharged the teenager with an appointment for CAMHS the next day, Thursday, 19 January. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital indicated that no further treatment was needed. On the night of Wednesday, 18 January, the teenager self-harmed again. On Thursday, 19 January, at the CAMHS appointment, CAMHS advised she should be referred to a residential care facility but the doctors did not know when, where or if any place could take her. CAMHS felt that in the interim she was not safe at home and told her family to take her back to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. On Thursday, 19 January, the teenager was readmitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. On Saturday, 21 January, a social worker at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital tried to get her father to take his daughter home, saying that the hospital was not the right place for her. However, her father stood his ground and stayed there until Monday, 23 January. On the morning of Monday, 23 January, the father had to take his daughter to CAMHS for an appointment, but when he collected her from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital the hospital had discharged her and advised him not to bring her back over concerns for her safety. They attended the CAMHS appointment where her referral for residential treatment was confirmed by the doctor but with no place, no date and no time. On Monday, 23 January, her father, petrified for his daughter's safety, took her to Tallaght hospital where there is an adult psychiatric facility. He simply could not bring her home owing to concerns over her safety. For three nights the man and his teenage daughter were left sitting on a bench without even a pillow in a glass room with people walking by and staring in. The hospital advised it did not have a psychiatric bed for her and as she is an adolescent it could not admit her or give her a bed as she is deemed psychiatric and not medical. It is not the staff's fault. They were left in a room for three days and nights. The staff in Tallaght then liaised with the psychiatric doctors and eventually the teenager was told she would be admitted to St. Joseph's Hospital. However, that only happened because of the staying power and strength of her father and the remarkable stance he took. It only happened because he went public with a plea for help. The Michael Reade show on LMFM highlighted their plight over consecutive days with the father telling shocked and appalled listeners what their family had to endure. Here are the facts. There are no emergency places for adolescents in crisis in emergency departments. That is the Government's policy. No psychiatric beds are readily available for adolescents in crisis. That too is the Government's policy. How many teenagers do not make it because of Government policy? Hundreds need to go through this nightmare every day. That is the Government's policy. Parents are being told there are no psychiatric beds and no beds in emergency departments. Parents are told to take their child home and they are verbally given a home safety and care package. That is the Government' policy. If families were to sue the HSE every time a child or adult presented in a mental health emergency and were refused adequate care or admittance, would the Government be quicker to change its policies? Can we imagine a person presenting with cardiac arrest and being told they could not be admitted because the hospital had no defibrillator, no trolley and no bed? Mental health care is just as important as general or physical care. The Government has treated it as the Cinderella of our broken health system for far too long. I listened to both Ministers' opening statements. How can they sit there and listen to these stories that are happening every day? Time and again they listen to them. It is not as if this is the first time these issues have come to light and they still do nothing when they know full well that more families today, tomorrow and the day after need to live through the nightmare I described. Why is that? It is because it is the Government's policy. At what stage will it put those wrongs to right? For goodness' sake that is its job.

However, let no Minister or politician hide behind staff in an attempt to avoid or dodge political responsibility for failures in the system. There are obvious capacity failures which have been identified for many years. This is not something that we learned about from this interim report. This echoes and reinforces what we already knew that capacity was not there. There have been governance issues in the system for many years and there was a failure to deliver. We cannot dodge political responsibility for all those failures. In his opening statement, the Minister said that about 4,000 open cases will need to be reviewed. These are children who were prescribed medication and where a review or monitoring has not happened within six months. The obvious question is why was that not done beforehand. We now have a report telling us that this needs to be done but where is the capacity within the system for that to be done? Both Ministers said it will start shortly. How long will it take? Has the system the ability to do it? Has it the staff to do it? That question needs to be answered by both Ministers present. Why did it get to a point where we now need to review 4,000 cases? Why were those cases not dealt with before now? That is a clear failure. Somebody needs to take responsibility for that failure and it seems that nobody is. The big challenge in healthcare across all settings is with workforce planning. The Minister talked about south Kerry CAMHS where we cannot recruit a consultant. There are many of examples in CAMHS where we cannot recruit staff to deliver the services that we need because we do not have a credible, comprehensive workforce planning strategy. The Minister talked about youth mental health services. I think we need to develop a new child and youth mental health service that includes people from 18 to 25 years of age because far too many children once they reached the age of 18, reach a cliff edge and do not get the services they need. For many of them adult services are not appropriate and we need a serious realignment of that policy. Both Ministers will need to accept their fair share of the blame and responsibility for the clear failures identified in this report.

We were given repeated commitments that efforts were being made, plans were being drafted, funds were being allocated and that the issue would be sorted. Things are now worse than ever before. There are 276 children in CH04 who have been waiting for more than 12 months. This is by far the largest number of children on waiting lists in the State. Before Christmas, a constituent contacted me. She had to take her child to an accident and emergency department. She had been on a CAMHS waiting list for a long time. She was at serious risk of harming herself. She was discharged from the accident and emergency department with a letter for CAMHS. A week later still no letter had been received by CAMHS. The mother contacted me because she was distraught worrying about her daughter. I had to contact the HSE and everyone I could get on to.Within an hour, we got that letter so that CAMHS could see that young girl. A Deputy should not have to send emails and make phone calls to everyone when it comes to life-saving treatment a child or adolescent needs. This is not a CAMHS issue alone. This goes to the whole issue of the crisis in the health service. I also raise the issue of the Psychiatric Nurses Association and the statement it put out this week. The Minister is probably well aware of that statement, which referred to staffing levels in Eist Linn in Cork. It is a 16-bed unit, the only one in the southern region. I am hearing through the grapevine that Eist Linn is losing a significant number of staff. In the next few weeks, staffing levels will be only 58% of what they should be. Some of the staff are going to Australia because they will be better paid, better treated and will be able to access housing. This goes to the nub of staff retention, a point on which my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, touched. The Government is completely failing to enable access. That is the reality faced by children and adolescents in the mental health sector. The staff, children and their parents need to know what is happening in Eist Linn. Will the Minister give us an update on the proposed plans for the facility? Will he guarantee that no beds will be lost in that unit? The Minister said earlier that he empathises. Parents of children and adolescents with mental health issues do not need empathy. They need help and support. I am asking the Minister to guarantee that none of those beds will be lost.

There has been discussion of the issue this week, including this evening. The presence of both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is testament to the issue's importance. It is often the case that evening debates on a Thursday in this Chamber will not attract the presence of the senior Minister, whatever the topic under discussion. The senior Minister is here, along with the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, because this report is one of the most damning we have seen. Even on a scan of the report, the key words that occur to the reader are "frightening", "negative", "worrying" and "damning". When one reads the report in detail, there is little to provide any comfort that our CAMHS is not broken. The report states that some CAMHS staff have been found, in some cases, to provide a good service for many young people and their families, who have received excellent care and treatment within often limited resources. That is mentioned at the start of the report and it is accepted. We all know people who have been treated in CAMHS and families who have received a good service. However, the report goes on to deliver its assessment of the community healthcare organisations, CHOs, it examined. It begins with governance, which it describes as "inefficient and unsafe". The report identified a failure to manage risk or fund staff, which is a departmental and HSE issue. It identified a failure to recruit key staff and a failure to look for alternative models to provide services where staff could not be recruited. That shows an inflexibility throughout our health service. We see that reflected in Kerry CAMHS, where a funded position has been in place but not filled since 2016. The statement made earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, indicates that position will not be filled in the near future. The report also identified a "failure to provide a standardised service across and within CHOs". Even if a CHO is performing well relative to other CHOs, there may still be CAMHS services in the area that are not performing well. The report goes on to state "There is no ring-fenced funding for CAMHS". It is incredible that CAMHS must fight for funding and compete for it with other health services. Underpinning all of this is early intervention. Such intervention with multidisciplinary teams will help to keep people healthy, safe and out of acute care, ultimately saving the health service time, money and resources. At the earliest point in people's lives when they face mental health difficulties, we have a service that is competing with other health services for basic funding. We have no real integration in children's mental health services and risk management is obliterated in our CAMHS. The report identified that "risk management was poor, with lack of communication and lack of actions to mitigate risks". It stated "There was limited understanding in a number of teams as to what constituted a risk". That is incredible. Teams that are working do not even know what constitutes a risk. That is why this report is damning. The documenting of risks was described in the report as "haphazard". Individuals and families put trust in our health service, specifically our youth mental health service, and have to read a report that describes the documenting of risks as "haphazard". The report went on to state that "minimalist generalised actions [were] recorded on the CHO risk register". All teams were found to be significantly below the staffing levels recommended in A Vision for Change. Some were below 50% of the recommended level and all teams were below the recommended level. That has resulted in the long waiting lists we have all heard about in the responses to multiple parliamentary questions. Those waiting lists have been discussed on the floor of the House many times. The report states "The CAMH service depends heavily on a model of care which places the onus on a single profession i.e., the consultant psychiatrist". That takes us back to the situation in south Kerry and the presentation from the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. This inflexible system cannot change or provide a different model of care and cannot recruit key positions, including the one key position of consultant psychiatrist. That means care for everyone else falls down. The report also states, "In three CHOs, the digital infrastructure was mostly absent apart from the use of Excel spreadsheets and Word documents." If somebody contacts the offices of any of the Deputies here today, we have a system to record the representation, raise the matter with the relevant Department, the HSE or CAMHS. Our system allows us to set reminders and schedule when to send further emails and letters. We have such a system. It is an old system but it is functional and works. In our health services, according to the report, "Most services do not have an IT system that manages appointments, schedules rotas, maintains clinical files and provides reports on activity." If someone sends a Deputy a report from an occupational therapist or a doctor, he or she can scan it and save it on our systems while the HSE and CAMHS cannot do so because they have no IT system. That is incredible. No one would believe that our health services are dealing with Excel spreadsheets and Word documents. Every eight-, nine- and ten-year-old who goes into his or her first ever computer class learns to use Excel spreadsheets and Word documents. The system in this organisation is more than 30 years old but still functions. We do not even have something of that age and functionality in our CAMHS. I will move to the issue of medication and the fact that children are being lost to antipsychotic medication without clinical and physical backup. That is incredible and very worrying. Specific medications are not mentioned in the report but we all know which are the most commonly used medications. They have side effects and require regular blood testing. There are international standards but we do not have national standards, and the international standards are not being applied. Not even good, basic care is being applied to these young people who are on very heavy drugs. We have two generations of antipsychotic drugs. There are traditional ones and the newer ones from the 1990s. They are all very heavy and have considerable impacts, including physical impacts, on patients. Young people are being lost. They are being prescribed these medications and are not being given check-ups.It is an absolute scandal. We need action to ensure that a proper audit is done and that there is no child or adolescent out there who is on anti-psychotic medication and who is not getting the required supportive clinical care, be that blood tests or physical checks. In regard to the mental health reform, it has been doing great work in advocating in this area and supporting Deputies on all sides in providing information. Its key ask is a youth mental health assistant director, which was promised in budget 2023 but has not even been advertised for recruitment. We need a national director for mental health. Why is that not being provided to report directly to the CEO of the HSE? The Government is moving in this direction but is not going far enough. If we are talking about governance we need a co-ordinated strategy at national level. That starts at the very top if we are serious about resolving this and not having this same debate when the full report comes out. In fairness, a reform of the Mental Health Act was mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in her contribution.  There were 140 children lost in the midwest CAMHS system and 46 children in south Kerry suffered significant harm. There are unknown numbers of children and adolescents on heavy medication without the appropriate care. We have seen articles in newspapers this week about individual cases. I met a woman at a local event yesterday whose child is on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, therapies through CAMHS is getting the care but her worry is that next year, she will age out of the service. There is no pathway. There is no ADHD clinical specialist in our CHO. She will age out of the service three months before her leaving certificate examinations, when she turns 18. What is going to be done there? The individual cases will go on and on but as was said by the CEO of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, in a letter to The Irish Times, the system "is broken”. That is the only way to describe it.

There is clearly an issue there. The findings of the report are damning, especially in the Kerry area. My heart goes out to the families and the children who have been impacted by this. As has been brought to light recently, there is a mental health unit in CHO 4 in Bantry General Hospital which recently has been forced to close from an 18-bed unit down to a 15-bed unit. Reducing to a 15-bed unit in the midst of huge pressure on the services, huge need for extra mental health services, is not good news by any stretch of the imagination. The HSE challenged the recommendation of the Mental Health Commission to reduce it to 11 beds so it could have been much worse. However, it certainly underlines the urgent need for a specifically purpose-built facility to cover that area of west Cork. That is vital. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is aware of it, I brought it to her attention at the very start. While we have lost three beds it is important that we see the investment that was promised in the agreement outside of court to bring it back up to an 18-bed unit in the interim because the services are very stretched. CAMHS in west Cork constantly looks for extra services. It has a facility in Dunmanway in which to meet young people. We need to expand the services in Clonakilty. The Minister of State visited Clonakilty hospital as well and heard that plea. There is a similar theme happening here. Earlier this week I spoke with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about the provision of home support services. There is a theme whereby the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, have secured record amounts of funding for the health service. It was an increase of 40% from €16 billion in 2019 to €23 billion throughout the service, as well as €1.2 billion for mental health. These are record amounts of funding and finance going into mental health. However, the HSE needs to be held accountable. We need to get value for money. We need to see a return on this investment.  In the time I have left I want to bring up another issue which is related to the mental health of women and pregnant women. Yesterday, I brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, the issue of hyperemesis and the difficulty in accessing the treatment for hyperemesis, Cariban. Hyperemesis is a debilitating condition whereby women in pregnancy experience severe nausea, vomiting and loss of the ability to function because of the extremity of the nausea. Over the past 24 hours since a campaign started on this, I have been contacted by hundreds of women throughout the country who have brought their experiences to my attention. I want to take this opportunity to thank each of those women who shared personal, intimate and sometimes graphic experiences of what they have been through. It is important that I do them justice and take this opportunity because I may not get an opportunity to speak on health again in the coming weeks. It is important that I take this opportunity to raise their concerns and give examples of what these women have had to go through. Some women who contacted me went through pregnancy where on some days, they vomited up to 50 or 60 times a day. I cannot even begin to imagine what that must be like. In some instances it was so severe that they experienced nosebleeds or the dehydration was so bad they had to be connected to intravenous drips to battle the dehydration. Coming back to the mental health issue, in many cases it increased the chance of post-natal depression. Many women who contacted me spoke about that. It reduced their ability to function, to go to work and in the worst cases they had to be hospitalised. That is how serious it is. One woman said it was so severe that even though they intended to try for another child she could not go through it again, so they did not.  I wanted to give a flavour of what women are experiencing when they have hyperemesis. There is a treatment, a drug called Cariban. It works. It eases the symptoms but it costs money. For example, one lady who contacted me spent €6,000 on Cariban over the course of two pregnancies. Another lady paid €3,000 over the course of her recent pregnancy. This is a great deal of money for something that should be affordable and accessible for all women. Other figures were €140 per week. Many of these women were experiencing financial difficulty anyway. They may have had mortgage repayments or rent to pay. One woman who contacted me described the situation where she had to choose between the weekly shop or a course of Cariban. It is a serious condition and it requires treatment. What is the issue? Thankfully the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, listened and in budget 2023 secured agreement that Cariban would be covered under the drug payments scheme. This is an important move. It was welcomed throughout the country especially by those people who were campaigning for this. The difficulty is, it emerged in January, that while the drug can be prescribed by a GP, it was only available for reimbursement under the drug payments scheme if it was prescribed by a consultant obstetrician. That is one of the issues. When the consultant obstetrician is prescribing this drug there has to be a manual filling out of a form which has to be scanned and then may take days to get a response. It is cumbersome and takes too long while these women are going through this experience.

To get back to this issue, we are a small State that pays its department heads and health managers handsomely, so the very idea that CAMHS is in the state it is in is a damning indictment of that management and the Ministers. The very idea that in one CHO alone we have 140 children described as “lost” within the system is staggering and should have all the alarm bells ringing. Has it not dawned on all this management in the HSE that medicine in any area, especially mental health, is not a numbers and management game but a game that involves having the right people with the right expertise? My blood ran cold when I heard a young doctor talk last year about simply being a person who was rostered in to fill a job in mental health when his training and experience was minimal. It ran even colder when the person said they were left doing that job in mental health without adequate support or supervision. I felt sorry for this doctor. I cannot imagine the stress of being in that position, feeling that you are just a number looking after other numbers. Is it any wonder that the invisible wounds in our children are being missed when they are being treated by doctors who are not qualified in the sense of experience, practice and area interest? I doubt very much that the same well-paid management would put a junior respiratory doctor in charge of amputating a leg or removing a gallbladder, but when it comes to the mental health of our children and young people, it seems that anything goes. That is why my heart goes out to the trained teams who have the expertise and the practice, and who are having to work way beyond their hours and limits, but do so anyway because they are committed to the care of our young people. We are very lucky to have them. The Minister must do as the inspectorate recommends and review all cases currently open within CAMHS, focusing especially on children lost to follow-up and looking at children on antipsychotic medications. We have to put the regulation of CAMHS under the Mental Health Act 2001. The Minister started his speech by saying the current figures are unacceptable. When we say something is unacceptable, that should mean we do not accept it. Please do not tell us about lessons being learned because our fragile children are living them, and they are the ones who have to accept these failures.

The following quotes appeared in a media report, and I thank Dr. Susan Finnerty of the Mental Health Commission for her contribution to that. The report states:A deep dive into mental health services for children and young people in Ireland has shown several regions in the south - including Cork - to be facing very serious issues that could be placing kids at risk. … A failure of management and governance was leading to what the report called "inefficient and unsafe” CAMHS services and there were specific instances of very worrying dysfunction - such as evidence that anti-psychotic drugs were being given without proper supervision or monitoring. The report goes on to identify several other issues:Children getting 'lost' in the system with families facing a maze of bureaucracy in their search for helpLong waiting listsStaffing problemsLack of capacityLack of emergency and out-of-hours servicesFailure to manage riskFailure to properly resource services or support staff Ironically, Deputy Butler is the third Minister of State with responsibility for mental health in the short time I have been in the House. I sit on the Committee on Mental Health. I remember talking to a child psychologist who was involved in CAMHS and who came as a witness to the committee. The first question I asked that gentleman was whether he had been threatened by senior management not to come in as a witness, and he said “Yes”. There is a dysfunction within the HSE and it is rotten to the core. One of the speakers mentioned Bantry Hospital. We are talking about mental health yet we are still closing a 22-bed mental health respite centre, the Owenacurra Centre in Midleton, and I want to put that on the record. I have also been informed that Cork is lacking and is probably 20 to 30 years behind the rest of the country. The Minister spoke about value for money. Back in 2018, we spent about €40 million on cognitive and other therapies but we are spending more than €400 million on medicine, so there is a massive overreliance on medication for people. It is disgusting when we find young children on one of the strongest medicines in the world. It is crazy. Although we are discussing this in the House now, an hour ago, Róisín Clarke of Mental Health Reform pointed out that we are still going to admit children to adult wards, which is in contravention of the child's human rights. This is 2023. I appeal to the Minister to take everything on board. I am here a while. I have lost faith in the mental health system in this country, but not in the staff.

It is a year to the day since the publication of the Maskey review into South Kerry CAMHS and the situation remains dire. Vulnerable children are being utterly failed on this Government's watch and the Minister’s colleagues’ chorus of concern is of little help. I note in particular that the Taoiseach and Tánaiste described the report as "concerning" and "unacceptable". I would agree, but it is almost like they are surprised. We would be forgiven for forgetting that both are former Ministers for Health. This Government is just playing to the gallery. They have known about this crisis for years. How many more children have to suffer because of Government inaction, which the Minister today described as “unacceptable”? How many more reports do they need before they take meaningful action? This is a service which treats some of the most vulnerable children in our society but it remains poorly resourced. It is a postcode lottery, and if you find yourself in the wrong CHO area, your child could languish on a waiting list for months, even years, or become one of those "lost" cases. Is there a more harrowing description than a “lost” case? These "lost" cases were cited in this week's damning report and they are particularly concerning. These are children and young adults with open cases who have been lost to follow-up. In some cases, children who should have had follow-up appointments for review of prescriptions or monitoring of medication did not have an appointment for two years. As if that was not bad enough, we also know that when some young people reach their 18th birthday, even if they have not completed the leaving certificate, they simply fall off a cliff. There is no planning, no discharge and no transition to adult services, and no advice about medication, simply abandonment. This brings me to a related issue which impacts the whole health service but the crisis in CAMHS has brought it into sharp focus. That is our IT infrastructure, or the lack thereof. Yesterday, officials from the Department of Health appeared before the Committee on Health regarding electronic records, and they did not inspire much confidence. The e-heaIth strategy is now eight years old yet we heard that the project is "only at the starting line". That is scandalous. How are we still talking about starting lines eight years later? Why are we so far off course? We will never make progress on integrated care without the implementation of electronic records. In fact, why are we talking about the implementation of electronic records in 2023? The Government’s failure to modernise our IT infrastructure has major implications for CAMHS. The interim report revealed that four out of the five CHOs visited used paper-based files. The report said these paper-based clinical files were frequently disordered, incomplete, sometimes illegible and devoid of logical filing systems. In 2023, it is completely unacceptable that most CAMHS teams are still reliant on paper and pen. Aside from making us an outlier internationally and a joke by any sort of modern metric, this outdated system of filing makes it difficult, if not impossible, to follow the care and treatment pathways delivered by CAMHS. This may seem like a peripheral issue in the grand scheme of things but it is at the very heart of the problem. Another factor in this crisis is a lack of accountability and local decision making. The centralised nature of the HSE is totally flawed. When scandals come to light, everyone is to blame but, most importantly, nobody is held responsible. Last year, we learned that a junior doctor was effectively running CAMHS on his own in south Kerry, with little or no supervision. That junior doctor should not have been scapegoated for the entire scandal. There has to be accountability for this stunning failure of the senior management and those with ministerial responsibility, but without serious restructuring of the HSE, that will never happen. We are still waiting for the Minister for Health to implement the new regional HSE structures mandated by Sláintecare. Under those reformed structures, there would be legally enforceable accountability among senior management teams for failures in clinical care.This radical restructuring will completely shift the balance of power in the HSE, devolving power to local regional bodies. Aside from the clear benefits in accountability, it will provide for more patient-focused services and improved health outcomes, something desperately needed not just in CAMHS but across the entire health service. This is a key recommendation in the Sláintecare report but, like so much of the plan, implementation is proceeding at a snail’s pace or still at the starting line. As we have seen with countless reports, it is a case of all talk and no follow-through.  It is 17 years since A Vision for Change was published. This report detailed a number of deficiencies in youth mental health services, yet the system remains in disarray. As matters stand, staffing equates to just 56% of what was outlined under A Vision for Change guidance on staffing levels. That is a shameful indictment of successive Governments. This chronic understaffing of CAMHS is having a detrimental impact on the mental health of so many children. It is time the Government stopped wringing its hands about dysfunction in CAMHS and did something about it. As well as seriously scaling up recruitment, the Department and HSE need to engage in proper workforce planning and move away from centralised recruitment. Due to this model, local services have serious difficulty hiring the staff they need at the time they need them. These measures should have been taken years ago. I urge the Minister to immediately progress them to address this historical and horrific understaffing. While I welcome the announcement that a national clinical lead for youth mental health will be appointed, this process, which was promised in budget 2023, must be a prioritised. It essential that the recruitment process beings immediately. However, this is not the only new appointment needed. There has been no national director for mental health since 2016. The Government committed to reinstating this post in the programme for Government but I have yet to see proof of any progress beyond that. Ultimately, we need to know that the Minister has the political will to overhaul mental health services. Behind every CAMHS waiting list figure is a child in need and a child who is being left behind. Almost 600 children were waiting over a year for a CAMHS appointment last November, an increase of 168% since June 2020. I appreciate that Covid-19 has exacerbated the problem but the need is great and the will must match it. We should be treating mental health just like physical health and not allowing conditions to worsen to a point where emergency interventions are needed more often. On every level it makes sense to fund these services. This chronic under-investment cannot continue. Our piecemeal system needs root and branch reform because too many children are falling between the cracks. This resistance to change has to stop. The children who are being failed by CAMHS will not get their childhoods back. The Mental Health Commission's report may have been interim but the Minister’s response must be immediate.

While this report does not strictly fall within my bailiwick as a party spokesperson, I felt compelled to read it. When I started reading the report I had to get to the end of it and having read through it, I felt compelled to speak on it. If it is a difficult read for me, I can only imagine how difficult it is to read for somebody who is working in CAMHS and experiencing the burnout referred to in the report and being burdened with overwork. I can only imagine how it must be to read it as the parent of a child who is struggling to access services. I note that Mental Health Reform in its briefing note, for which I am very grateful, described the Mental Health Commission’s interim report into CAMHS as a damning indictment of a deepening crisis in our mental health services. It is difficult to read the report in any other way. I acknowledge the Minister's comment that the contents of the report are unacceptable.  Article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which we ratified in 1992, states that all children have the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. We often hear trotted out on the floor of Dáil a famous line from the 1916 Proclamation which commits us to cherish “all the children of the nation equally”. Are we living up to the standard of that foundational document set out over a century ago? We are seeing in this report that children with mental health difficulties are essentially prisoners of geography unless their parents have the means to transcend that geography and step outside the public system. The Minister was careful to say that we have to acknowledge that much of the care received by children in CAMHS is very good, and that is also acknowledged in the report. However, it should not be the case that the standard of care received should depend on where people live or how deep their pockets are. That is not vindicating our commitment under Article 24 or cherishing all of the children of the nation equally. As I said, the report makes for difficult reading and demands a Government response. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, set out in detail some of what is being done to tackle the issue. I also acknowledge that the report is a result of research commissioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to get a better understanding of what we need to do. The very fact that the Inspector of Mental Health Services, Dr. Susan Finnerty, felt she had to issue an interim report is a measure of how seriously and urgently she views the situation. As I said, it is important to acknowledge the work of the 770 people who are working in CAMHS and how difficult this report must have been for them to read. I know each and every one of them strives to provide the best possible service to the people in his or her care. It must feel like the task of Sisyphus for them every day when they go back into work and the boulder, again, is at the bottom of the hill. I also acknowledge that 21,000 children are accessing CAMHS and also Dr. Finnerty's explicit statement that, for the most part, the quality of care received by those children is excellent. That is also important. We must highlight the deficiencies and prioritise those areas in which we can drive improvement but we should depict the service as a complete failure. That would not be an accurate picture. The Government and Oireachtas have an obligation not just to identify the problem but to begin to set out solutions as we see them. As Deputy Gannon and other Deputies noted, we have to look at workforce planning and benchmark the staffing levels we require within CAMHS. We know this cannot be solved immediately but we need to do so in the medium term. There is a role for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in ensuring we deliver the people who will fill those roles into the future. We need to recruit more people into CAMHS. On a related matter, we also have the children's disability network teams, CDNTs, in which there is also a major issue with recruitment. That is also part of the picture. Services must connect better and I include primary care in that picture. It, too, is identified in the report. We have to ensure the communications between the different strands of the health system are better connected and speak to each other. As we know, that will take time but we can refine that planning now. Dr. Finnerty pointed out that there is no ring-fenced funding for CAMHS. With regard to my earlier point about workforce planning, unless we have a ring-fenced budget and benchmarked staffing levels, I am not sure how we can engage in workforce planning. Perhaps the HSE can address that. I also mentioned that the integration of children’s mental health services is not where it should be. We need CAMHS to talk to the CDNTs, primary care and GPs for the benefit of the child. Services should be child-centred and follow the person and we need to ensure communication streams are better. On digital infrastructure, it should not be the case, as highlighted in the report, that some records are held in physical format, with pieces of paper often added as the file is developing.The type of recordkeeping for CAMHS that exists in each of the CHOs has to to streamlined and standardised. It should be the same across all our CAMHS. That is something Government focus can help resolve. Deputy Gannon referred to the wider matter of the digitalisation of health records, which was discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health yesterday. Let us expedite that. The Chief Whip is present. I know the health information Bill is priority legislation. Let us make that happen so that, for example, somebody's PPS number can be used to hang health records onto in order that digitisation can begin in a meaningful way. Procurement is a matter that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Ossian Smyth, might look at. If there is no standardised approach to the digitisation of records across CHOs, should the State not enter into a process of consultation with the CHOs, ask them what they need from the digitisation of records, go ahead and procure that, provide it to them, provide the necessary training and make sure there is consistency across the board? On the supervision of medication, which was referenced by some Deputies, there is a network of pharmacists. Is there a role these people can play in the supervision of medication? They are highly trained, competent, and the network exists within our communities. Is that something that can be activated in response to this issue? I would not claim to be any sort of specialist on this matter. The Minister and his Department are far closer to it. As I mentioned, it commissioned research to better understand the picture in front of us. I am responding to this issue as a parent and in empathy with the parents who have to navigate that torturous and labyrinthine pathway to getting the mental health supports they need for their children. If you are a parent, and your child is struggling and you reach out to the State for help, it is so important that the State is there. We have to live up to that obligation. As I said, this is something we have committed to in ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992. This matter sits at the heart of that cornerstone document and the foundation of our State. It is something I feel strongly about. The Minister and the Ministers of State have outlined the many ways this Government intends to respond to this report. It is incumbent on all of us to engage with that so we push that agenda forward in a constructive manner for the good of all the children in the State.

This includes various levels of support, whether it is therapy or supports through CAMHS. They are being so severely failed. Of course, this is not a new issue. In my constituency, there are 247 children in CHO 2 across counties Roscommon, Galway and Mayo who are all on CAMHS waiting lists. These are children, who are very young in some cases, whose childhoods are being destroyed. Parents, in particular, loved ones and, in fact, the entire family are left to beg for support and services, and to feel helpless, as they watch their child or children struggle. The question of how seriously this issue is being taken by the Government has to be asked. I saw a prime example of this in my constituency shortly after I was elected. The e-mental health hub in Castlerea was opened in June 2020 to great fanfare. It was a wonderful facility for older people but it was closed. They were sent here, there and everywhere away from their families. These were older people with dementia. Money was spent on the building and it was done up. In 2021, following many questions, I discovered no funding had been provided in 2021 to staff the facility. It was a fancy, done-up, empty building. That continued until funding was eventually announced late in 2021 after I repeatedly raised the issue. That service is now in place and is at long last fully staffed, which is welcome and will make a difference. That is what we are seeing on the ground. It is why I question how seriously this issue is being taken, when the State puts money into a facility and then does not bother to pay to staff it. This report is frightening. It is a lot more frightening for those people who are affected by the issue, especially those on waiting lists. Children on waiting lists are being failed across the board. I looked at the waiting lists for psychologist appointments in counties Roscommon and Galway. Some 804 children are waiting. Of the 702 children on the County Galway waiting list, more than half are waiting more than a year. It is an incredibly appalling situation. Everything possible needs to be done to turn this around and get these children the supports they so desperately need and that they deserve.

Our major hospital is in a perpetual state of crisis and our mental health services are not functioning as they should. Last week, in Limerick, thousands of people marched in protest at the conditions in University Hospital Limerick. We now see those young people who are suffering mental health challenges are not receiving the supervised treatment they need. The Mental Health Commission report outlines familiar failings, such as the lack of staffing and capacity. Mental Health Reform notes there were more than 700 mental health staff vacancies. The author outlined five areas of particular concern, including a lack of staff and a high staff turnover; lack of capacity to provide needs-based therapeutic programmes; poor monitoring of medication; lack of clinical governance; and long waiting lists that are impacting on the safety and well-being of children. Mental health is as important as physical health. To see such concerns raised about the treatment of children and adolescents must be treated as a major concern, both by the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and the Minister. I received a call from a HSE staff member the other night, who was upset about the terminology used in the report. This person did not express any upset about what happened. They were upset that the phrase "lost children" was used. In my constituency of Limerick, I understand 140 children are defined as being lost in the system, although the HSE was more concerned about the use of the term "lost children" than sorting out those children's situation. I urge the Minister to ensure that those children are found. They are not lost but each of them is somebody's child. Some of them were on medication and not having a follow-up for two years is outrageous. It is inexcusable that some children on anti-psychotic medication were not properly monitored. Whatever way the Minister or the HSE frames it, this report is damning. It is a damning indictment of our mental health services, a damning insight into how we treat children at risk of mental health challenges, and damning evidence that the Government does not treat mental health issues with the urgency they need. The report's author, Dr. Susan Finnerty, put it aptly when she said the commission decided to issue an interim report because of the serious concerns about, and consequent risks for, some patients that were found across CAMHS areas 4 and 5. My time is running out so I will try to get in as much as I can. In January 2023, 138 people in one CHO area were waiting more than a year. That is young children waiting more than a year for treatment out of a total of 423-----

It makes for very stark reading, to say the least. The issue of no clinical oversight is at the heart of the report. That is what it comes down to. That branches out to underfunding and understaffing, which is an indictment of mental health services for young people. Young people make up 25% of the population. That is the group that CAMHS provides a service to, yet that cohort of young people only get only 10% of the entire mental health budget. That is also an indictment. Some 90% of the budget is invested in adult services. We have spoken many times in this House regarding spending on mental health budgets. Sláintecare recommends 10% of the overall health budget. Currently, in this country, the figure is probably less than 7%. The WHO recommends 12% so we are well below European standards for overall spends on our mental health services. CAMHS would get five times more funding if expenditure on it was made equivalent to that for adult mental health. That is a fact. The report is so serious in respect of children's well-being that it warrants an independent inquiry. That inquiry should examine the funding and the staffing of CAMHS in both primary and secondary care. The report finds that staffing levels were to a point almost dangerous. Once there is lack of staff, mistakes will happen right across the board. Also important is the fact that when people are put under serious pressure there is burnout, lack of retention and demoralisation, and that seeps through an organisation. I acknowledge the amazing work those professionals who work in CAMHS provide. They provide an enormously important service. When children get the proper intervention at the proper time, the outcomes are hugely significant for those people. There is hope, positivity and a chance to recover. However, when there are situations such as those referred to in the report, situations which continue, the outcomes will not be very good. I wish to make a number of points as to what such an inquiry could look like. The prescribing rates and the pressure on parents to accept medication for their children are very important matters. The overprescribing of certain drugs is highly unethical. I am sorry, but no child should be on antipsychotic drugs for years. That leads to my next point, which is about the failure to provide alternative treatment. It is easy to give a child a medical intervention. There are circumstances where a child needs medical intervention via drugs, but not all the time, and that is very important in the context of the overprescribing of certain medications. The underfunding of CAMHS, to which I have alluded, is very important. That goes to the heart of the matter, as does the lack of inpatient CAMHS beds in primary care. Overall, the interim report is most serious in respect of children's health and well-being. If anything can come of the interim report and the issues to which it alludes, it is that they have to be addressed immediately. Otherwise, children - they could be our children or our nephews or nieces - will not get the treatment and intervention they need. Once that does not happen, we will fail all the children in respect of mental health services.

From dealing with issues relating to health on the health committee for a long period dating back to the health boards, I am deeply conscious of the urgent necessity to respond quickly. I acknowledge the work the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has done already and the serious burden placed on her in the course of recent years. The fact is that it was ever thus with the health service. The same issues occur again and again because this is a demand-led service. People do not become ill at a particular time of the day or night or a particular time of the year. They become ill at all times. It is absolutely necessary that the health service is capable of dealing with those situations when and if they arise. We here have all had to deal with the situations that have arisen in our respective constituencies over the years. I will take a moment to speak about young people. I tabled a parliamentary question a number of years ago on the number of young people who self-harmed and were referred to hospital as a result. I was amazed by the age groups affected, down to as young as ten and nine years of age, an appalling situation. One can only imagine the concern of the parents in dealing with that kind of situation. In many cases there was more than one attempt at self-harm such that it was an ongoing issue. It did not go away. It did not go away with a change in the time of the year or the day or whatever else, nor did the degree to which they were affected. The issue arose again and again. It is in that regard that we need to respond to the requirements as they arise. Every patient is a part of the experience. Every patient, whether a child, an adolescent or an older person, is a challenge to the system. They need urgent attention, and urgent attention needs to be built around their cases because it is not just one case but several cases, and the one moment of attention given to the one particular patient will resound many times. However, the question about the health service is and always has been how long we wait before we attend to the needs of the particular patient. For instance, I remember not so many years ago a patient being turned out of hospital in the middle of the night, at 4 a.m., with no place for the patient, who slept in a railway station, probably on one of the coldest nights of the year. It is appalling to have to admit to that in this day and age, when we are supposed to be responsive and supposed to have made huge strides - and we have - in respect of medicine in general, whether medicine for physical or mental ill health. It is obvious that we have to provide for what the need is at a far quicker rate than we have done in the past. In general - and I know that the Minister of State is committed to this - we have to try to do what can be done to address those situations that keep occurring again and again. I know she does that all the time, but the system has to respond. The health service has to respond. The health service has to respond on the basis of the cases presented: how many of them there are, how often the patients have presented, what the nub of the problem is and how quickly we can respond. It should be remembered that there is no sense in responding five years later. That is cold comfort to the people now affected. Five years later a response is of no benefit. It is of benefit eventually, but five years is a long time. If you are waiting on the roadside with a puncture in your car tyre, five years later is no time to respond. I am not for a minute blaming the Minister of State for what is happening; this is endemic in the way the services are delivered. We also need the patient, whether a child, adolescent or older person, to be able to access a residential place. Very often it is the only thing that can deal with the situation because under supervision something can and should be done and the medical expertise is readily available. The patient knows in the back of his or her mind that he or she is in the right place and is being looked after. The patient's family know in the back of their minds that the patient is in the right place and can be looked after. Consider the situation of there being no place for the patient - very often a very young patient - to go, which has often happened. The parents try always to get hospital accommodation of one kind or another. Even those patients have had to wait a day or a day and a half on a trolley. That does not change the situation. The patient is still in the same condition he or she was in before, and accommodation has to be made on an emergency basis to be able to deal with those kinds of situations when they arise, especially where supervision is required and, in some cases, where suicide watch applies. We cannot cover it up; we have to face it, deal with it, get that residential accommodation as quickly as possible and try to ensure we can deal with the patient and reassure his or her immediate family. Like every Deputy, I have dealt with cases in the middle of the night where I had to comfort people who were desperate, including families of people who were seeking assistance and crying for help. In some cases, the patient’s family were at their wits’ end and could not understand why, given the advanced society we lived in, it was not possible to resolve their immediate problems. They knew that if the problem was not resolved, there would be consequences. I do not want to go on for too long and I thank the Acting Chair for facilitating me, but this is an emergency. It was an emergency 20 years ago, and it has not changed since. The population has grown rapidly in the meantime and it will grow even more. There is no sense in saying that, because the population has increased, people have to wait longer. That will not solve the problem. We have to do whatever we must. We have to identify quickly the knots in the system that are delaying delivery and then deliver services as best we can in the shortest time possible.

That is a joke, but the system is a joke that we need to fix. It is an easy fix that we have managed not to implement for many years. Like other Deputies, I wish to thank the Mental Health Commission. I also thank Dr. Susan Finnerty for her excellent work on this. We will all say that we are shocked but not surprised. We in the House go around and around the garden when dealing with healthcare, particularly mental healthcare. We talk about how resources are not in place and how we cannot provide children with the services they need and to which they have a right. There are 617 children waiting for CAMHS in CHO 8, which is my CHO area. I accept the comments about the large number of people involved in mental healthcare who are doing excellent work. A large number of people are also thankful to be able to access that service. However, many of the conversations in the House revolve around those who cannot access services. This report goes beyond even that, and we are now talking about lost children. That is unacceptable. I do not know of any time or place where it would be acceptable. We only know of 140 in one team, but the Minister spoke about 4,000 cases that needed to be reviewed. We need a timeline for that. The sooner they are reviewed, the better, but it must also be done comprehensively. I have been over and back with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on many issues. In fairness to her, we have tried to deal with them on an individual basis, but neither of us is a doctor and that is not the way to do business. Deputy Munster spoke about the case of a father, Richard, and his 16-year-old daughter, Amy, who were going through a crisis. We have all raised cases on the floor from time to time and Richard had already gone public on "The Michael Reade Show" on LMFM. We can sometimes get traction by raising cases and bring them to a head, but that is not the way to do business. Numerous calls have been made, be it in respect of mental health reform or the work being done by my colleague, Deputy Ward. We know what the requests are. I do not know how many times the Dáil has to discuss workforce planning, but let us be clear, in that we cannot be sure that all positions will be filled next year, the following year or even the year after that. We speak about the lack of psychologists, occupational therapists and necessary services. If we move beyond mental healthcare to disability services and so on, those numbers are even greater. We must become far better and ensure that we have a throughput of people who can do this work. Be it primary care, disability services or mental health services, people are sometimes unable to access CAMHS for their children because the services operate in silos. Ping pong is played from time to time. For example, a service might accept that a child with autism might have some anxiety, but it will say that it cannot provide help and the child must go elsewhere. A large number of families are being failed abjectly. We can keep having these conversations, but we need to offer people solutions. Otherwise, more Deputies will raise individuals’ stories in the Chamber. Those individuals might be lucky and get dealt with, but doing that does not provide the solution that is needed across the board. The cases need to be reviewed as soon as possible. We need to put a better governance structure in place as regards anti-psychotic drugs. I do not know where someone can go in that regard. First and foremost, though, we need a timeline that we can present to our citizens for when the Government will provide a service that will deliver. Regardless of what area of healthcare we discuss – it is CAMHS today – we are talking how people are being failed abjectly.

The report sets out a large number of issues and is a damning indictment of the services, which are putting children’s safety at risk. It is clear that poor clinical governance is a national issue across the health system. This is an interim report rather than the full report, but it highlights failures in the management of risk, the recruitment of key staff and the provision of standardised care across the mental health system. It is important that we adhere to the report and put in place the actions required. I heard the Minister on radio this morning. He spoke about consultation, speaking to someone and so on. To be honest, the time for talking is over. We need action, and the first action must be the recruitment of an assistant director of youth mental health services, as promised by the HSE. This post is needed and filling it should not take another nine months. It should be filled swiftly. Of course, rather than an assistant director, there needs to be a full national director of mental health services who reports to the CEO of the HSE so that there is someone who is accountable to the CEO and the Minister for what is happening and who ensures that everything is carried out as expected. The report highlights the urgent need to reform the Mental Health Act 2001 to ensure that children’s rights are adequately protected when they need mental health services. It is damning that €11.4 million of the €24 million allocated in budget 2022 went unspent. This funding was provided to make additional investments in the service. According to a survey carried out by nursing staff, there was a shortage of 700 mental health nurses as of November. This is cause for concern. According to the survey conducted across all CHOs, 4,000 children were on waiting lists as of October.That is an alarming fact. The HSE has still not published either its prescribing audit or the compliance with the CAMHS operational guidelines 2019 audit, which it had promised to publish in quarter 4 of last year. This is another indication, I believe, that a lot of lip service is being paid to the problems that are there. We cannot dilute this report. We cannot make allowances for the report. This report is telling us to get up and get going with what needs to be done. We do not need any more reports. We do not need any more working groups. We do not want any more bringing together of people to discuss what has to be done. The report is the template and what we need to do is have the courage to make sure that it is implemented. From my reading of the report, I believe that we as politicians over the years have allowed this service to fail. This is to blame not Government, but politicians. At the outset, both the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, praised the staff. While I concur wholeheartedly, we also must do something else; we have to apologise to the staff for not giving them the back-up they need to carry out their duties. I will publicly say that this evening. As a politician, I apologise to the staff who are trying to do a job without the services and without the back-up, note-taking and so on. One will ask, what are we to do? We have a report; let us get the action done.

In the two and a half years since I was elected, I have stood on the floor of this House probably some 12 or 14 times to speak on CAMHS-related issues. I will say that the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has always listened. I have always got action. We are at the stage we are at tonight because Deputy Butler insisted on the review. It is a timely review. It was instructed in April. We have an interim report. It is a serious, damning interim report. I commend the good staff that are in CAMHS. We have three CAMHS units in Wexford. There is not a full complement of staff, which in itself, causes problems. There are many issues for the staff within the CAMHS units. I do not want to label them but there are issues that certainly need to be addressed. I have voiced them on the floor of the House but I expect that this is where we now start. The days of talking, as my colleagues have said, do not come to an end but there has to be talk of action. I will not repeat what everyone has said. I commend Dr. Finnerty on having the courage to bring out an interim report. I commend Dr. Niall Muldoon, who is the Ombudsman for Children. I commend Mr. John Farrelly. These are all people from whom we have heard the problems previously but we now have an in-depth review that the Minister of State instructed. Let the Minister of State not forget that. It is a proactive step and it has to continue in that frame. Money, in many of our health services, is not an issue. It is an issue here. There are some disparities that need to be addressed. We need to provide a dedicated fund to CAMHS. A dedicated CAMHS fund is strictly what the report says. For instance, in Wexford, we had an issue with a child psychologist. We had a child psychologist available to us for two years. She was ready and able to take the position but, because she was not part of the panel, she was not eligible. That type of crap - excuse me putting is straight - has to change. We cannot have a system that obstructs the focus of helping our children with their mental health. We have to be practical. We are short-staffed. We have a retention and recruitment crisis. We cannot keep saying we have it; we have to do something about it. If a child psychiatrist who held the position previously was available, it is only a matter of somebody knocking heads together and saying that here we have a child psychiatrist who wants the job and to give it to her. We now have a child psychiatrist but that is not the point. Two years went by in which we did not have one. I look forward to the future. I look forward to assisting the parents who will come to me with their problems.

In the mid-west, we have 116 children on a waiting list for assessment for over a year. Many of these children are from north Tipperary. This failure affects our children and young people, our vulnerable and voiceless citizens. It is a disgrace, an abomination and a scandal. It is heartbreaking to learn that so many young people have been utterly failed. People are angry. They are disgusted and above all else, they are frightened. The mental health of our children and adolescents has been compromised. The question on everyone's lips is, how is it possible that so many cases within CAMHS system were simply lost? How is it possible that cases were not followed through once a child reached the age of 18? How were young people left taking anti-psychotic medication indefinitely without the required monitoring that is essential to their well-being? These are not isolated incidents. The fact that it happened in four out of the five CHOs makes this a national scandal of the highest order. This lack of follow-up has left some families without a review appointment or advice about their child's care while on medication. These practices have grave repercussions for a child's physical and mental health. It cannot and should not be tolerated. It is evident from the report that there are serious deficiencies in leadership, management and integration structures that must be urgently addressed. There is a massive problem with staffing deficits. The CAHMS interim report points to stress and burnout in a significant number of team members. There is insufficient staff to provide a safe level of care across the vast majority of healthcare services. Thousands of staff have fled the Irish healthcare service. Excessive demands are being placed on remaining and existing healthcare staff. They are overwhelmed and simply cannot cope. A vital health service cannot run successfully unless there is sufficient manpower in place to keep the wheels turning. Until we succeed in retaining and recruiting staff, we will not see improvements in our health services. Providing extra capacity and additional services is absolutely necessary but it is a wasted exercise if there are not sufficient people to allow them function. Since this damning interim report was made public, the Minister has said that the HSE is seeking to appoint a national clinical lead for youth mental health, which will bring consistency to how teams across the State are regulated. I welcome it, and I also welcome the recruitment of an assistant national director to ensure the kind of integration that the interim report has highlighted. This will bring the provision of mental health services in line with the way in which adult mental health services are delivered. While such announcements are welcome, it is critical that they materialise as quickly as possible. Every action taken to address the dysfunction and anomalies is welcome. However, we must also acknowledge that we are attempting to close the door after so much damage has been done to defenceless victims. It is certainly cold comfort to the children, adolescents and their families who have fallen victim to the recent malfunction of the service. The Minister and Minsters of State, together with all Members of this House, have an obligation and a duty to ensure effective action is implemented with urgency.

I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on insisting that this happened, that the research was done and that we got a real drill-down to the detail of where the system is at. We have all known for years that there are difficulties and problems but there are some really stark and frightening outcomes in that report. As the Minister of State will be aware, I have on many occasions raised with her the issue of mental health, both with adolescents and children and with adults.I hate to admit it, but I firmly believe that in CHO1 and especially in Cavan-Monaghan, we have one of the highest rates of suicide. I take this opportunity to plead with the Minister yet again to deliver Jigsaw in Cavan-Monaghan. He has made huge inroads in delivering a service in CAMHS in Cavan-Monaghan, but the reason I ask for Jigsaw specifically is that visibility and recognition are hugely important. We talk about teleservices or tele-therapies for young people. I still strongly believe in face-to-face contact. We know services are available at the end of the phone. However, we also know that when people are at their darkest moment, it is simply too late. I have never seen anything like this Christmas and New Year in Cavan-Monaghan. There was a huge loss of life, especially of young people, because of suicide. As the Minister will be aware, I have campaigned for a long time for Suicide Crisis Awareness, SCA, nurses and I am grateful to him for the delivery of SCA nurses. I strongly believe in them. They are very effective. We have seen that they have worked and they are a huge component part of mental health services. I wish the two nurses who took up those roles in CHO1 the very best in their important and significant roles. They can have a profound impact on the lives of people who find themselves in a dark place. Everyone around the House has been able to share experiences from their constituency offices. I take this opportunity - it is great to have it - to speak frankly and openly with the Minister. One experience I can share with the Minister is of a 15 year old girl who was desperately crying out for help. She had the presence of mind to tell her parents, her social workers and the staff in her school that she needed help, but she had to fight the system to get it. When I say fight, I mean that her parents should not need to ring a Deputy to ask for help and to explain that their child needs intervention, specialised care and a bed. When I rang her school, with the agreement of her parents and the community around her, to find out how much on the radar of the school she was, I was told that in a school of 500 children she was in the top five of the children at risk. The school was able to recognise that and yet to get the professional help she wanted and knew she needed, she had to fight for it. That should not be the case. She should not need to come to me. I was more than happy to help her and when I made the necessary calls, she got help, but she was at the end - when her family rang me they said they had never phoned a Deputy before. They were sure it would not be something I could help with. Thankfully, I was able to help, but she should not need me to help. In Cavan-Monaghan we do not have the residential care and services required for children and adolescents. When children and adolescents find themselves in that position, they end up in clinical care alongside adults and that is simply not right. That girl got a bed in Linn Dara. I am grateful for that bed and the staff there were able to provide the care she needed. I am so glad to tell the Minister that because of the specialist care, that young girl is around today to tell that story. However, she and her parents would be the first to admit that had she not received that care and intervention, that might not be the case. That is one example. We all have endless numbers of examples of types of crisis and cases we have heard about. I join with all the voices, including that of the Minister, to concur that what is needed is oversight and accountability. We have heard many times tonight that recruitment is an issue. We know that it is an issue in the HSE. Does CORU not have a part to play in this? I am aware of professionals who wanted to work with the HSE and have had to wait nine to 12 months to make the cut, to get through the paperwork and the nonsense that goes on with bureaucracy in order to get on the panel, to be part of the system and to take up the positions they are more than qualified for. CORU must be part of the solution. I will finish with the case of Dan Hogan. He is not a young person I knew. I know his brother Rory Hogan. His mother spoke openly and honestly on Drivetime this week. I was driving to the constituency when I heard her interview with Cormac Ó hEadhra. Elaine Clear gave the most harrowing account of what happened to her son. He went into mental health services at the age of 13 and he died at 17. This happened eight years ago. What upsets her most when she hears what we are talking about, hears these debates and reads that report, she is crippled by the thought that nothing has changed. You would have to stop the car, stop in your tracks when you hear about the experience she had from when he was 13 until he lost his life at 17, what they went through to try to get him the help and services he needed. This was her experience. When they got him into clinical care, he was brought to the clinician who was looking after him who gave his father the option of either signing the boy into a service she described as a prison, where the doors were locked - he went through five locked doors to get to the room he was going to be cared for in - or the service would get a court order to sign him in. His mother did not want him to have a record in his adult life so she agreed to sign him in. There were no phones. No parent was allowed to stay with him. It is bizarre that would be the case. When would a parent ever be asked to leave a child? They were asked to leave a child who was in that kind of deep, dark, hollow, black place that we cannot imagine, told they could not stay with their child, could not sit with him. She would have given anything to stay the night with him. She, her husband and her brother would have rotated. They wanted to be with him. They were not allowed. They were locked out of his care. She told me that her son eventually got a phone somehow. He was not allowed phone contact or anything like that but he got a phone and he was whispering on the phone as though he was in prison. He was asking his Mam to take him out, to collect him, to get him out of there. She has to live with that now. It must of course be acknowledged there are great people there who are under huge pressure. Mental health services and especially CAMHS is in very good hands. I know that the Minister of State leads this with her heart as much as her head. I would like to support her in any way I can to do the work she is doing.

I thank the Mental Health Commission and all those who work in the extremely difficult area of mental health and especially in youth mental health, including in my area, the Dublin 15 suicide awareness group Genesis Psychotherapy and Family Therapy Service CLG, Jigsaw and all the private counsellors and therapists who provide support to young people and who hold those young people at risk who should be in services such as CAMHS. To be honest, the publication of this damning interim report on CAMHS has not shocked anyone who has any knowledge of the system young people have been trying to access for many years. Those of us who have worked with young people will have experience of the significant challenges faced in trying to access mental health support services for children and young people in CAMHS. The report describes a situation of children who should have had follow up appointments including to review prescriptions and to monitor medication, waiting for an appointment for up to two years in some cases. It is absolutely appalling.In CHO 9, which covers my area of Dublin West, 153 people are waiting up to six months, 74 young people are waiting six months to a year and ten children are waiting over 52 weeks, and that is the lower end of the scale. If one looks at the reports from all of the CHOs, CHO 9 is operating the best - if you could describe it as that - yet those numbers should shock anyone and appal everyone. Across the State, there are more than 4,043 children on CAMHS waiting lists. Statistics from Mental Health Reform state that 741 children with mental health difficulties attended emergency departments from January to November 2022. They were in such dire need due to their mental health state that they attended the emergency department of a hospital. People who attend an emergency department because of their mental health know that the services do not exist there and that they will be left sitting for up to 24 hours to be told there will be an appointment for them within four to six weeks. They are in such a state of distress that they attend hospital and they are told "Sorry. There are no services here. You will have to go off and, in a couple of weeks' time, we will have an appointment for you." The HSE audit of CAMHS, including both the prescribing audit and the compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines audit, were promised to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. They still have not been published, as per the HSE's statement on 23 January. Despite the lack of availability of public CAMHS beds, the HSE does not have any memorandum of understanding agreements in place with private providers for the provision of private mental health beds for children and adolescents attending CAMHS. It is failure after failure in pretty much every area. This is no surprise to anybody. Approximately half of the budget, some €11.4 million of the €24 million, allocated to mental health services in budget 2022 for the development of new services was not spent. A survey by the Psychiatric Nurses Association revealed the existence of over 700 mental health nursing vacancies in mental health services throughout the country. I know from speaking to and working with people who work in the HSE, in mental health services and in Tusla that some places are too stressful and much too difficult for them to work in and they burn out very quickly. The support services are not in place for the workers and that must be addressed. Otherwise, we are not going to hit any of the targets being set. It is clear that CAMHS is not working and that we must put in place an urgent strategy to tackle the crisis. It is time to hold the Government to account as well. Every child and young person who cannot access a service in an appropriate timeline means the Government has failed them. I refer to those who are responsible for providing mental health services for children and young people in distress. If they cannot access that service in a timely fashion, we have failed them and the Government has failed them and this country has failed them, so we must get this right. It is way too important. Children's lives and young people's lives are at risk as we stand here and speak.

Families up and down the country with children and young adults experiencing mental health difficulties are all aware of the huge failings within CAMHS. The CAMHS report shows that a radical overhaul of mental health services for young people is urgently required. I fully agree with the views of Mental Health Reform that the crisis in CAMHS requires an urgent national co-ordinated response. The Government must absolutely prioritise urgent recruitment within the service, particularly in the area of CAMHS intellectual disability specialists. My office has, unfortunately, been inundated in recent months with families of children and young adults who have been left in limbo, pushed from pillar to post and, quite simply, desperately failed by a system that is supposed to assist them when their children and young adults reach their lowest points in their life. It is just so sad. My experience of the greatest failings is that when these vulnerable children have a dual diagnosis - our must vulnerable children - they are being failed even more dramatically as no one wants to take responsibility. Disability services say they do not have the expertise. I salute the staff who are in these services. The vast majority of them, who are doing their very best, do not have the capacity to support children who are displaying mental health difficulties. CAMHS has pushed these children back to disability services claiming that their autism is the reason for their difficulties and that they, therefore, do not have the capacity or expertise to support them. It is particularly clear that these children, and their families, are being failed and they are the responsibility of the Government. Recruitment difficulties is not a sufficient excuse to leave children in desperate situations with no support or assistance. The lack of CAMHS intellectual disability, ID, specialists is a serious failing and must be urgently addressed. I welcome the recent appointment of a new CAMHS ID specialist in CHO 5 who serves south Tipperary. However, she needs a full team around her and the absence of appropriate CAMHS ID units in this country is simply appalling. The experience of families that have come to me in tears and in fear for the lives of their children is an abusive situation. The State is literally abusing these families and putting them in the most awful of situations. I do not say that lightly. I dealt with a case involving a teenager who is self-harming, has been out of school for long periods due to extreme levels of anxiety and is expressing suicidal thoughts. It seems that because of a diagnosis of autism, CAMHS can offer no supports. The services say that the issue is the autism diagnosis and that it is a matter for disability services. Disability services say they cannot support this child through these mental health difficulties. The child is left in limbo and the only option is for the child to present to the paediatric ward or the accident and emergency department of Tipperary University Hospital, TUH, which can give no support. A CAMHS specialist may or may not attend. Having spent two weeks in hospital, this child was sent home with "a safety plan" for the parents that basically consisted of "if you or your child's life is in danger, call emergency services". That is just awful. That was the extent of the services available for this child. The mother reported sleeping on the floor outside of the girl's bedroom every night as she feared for her life and his life. I have been dealing with another case, involving a teenager of 15 years of age who is experiencing severe mental health difficulties. I am sure the Minister of State comes across such cases every day of the week. The CAMHS psychiatrist refused to see this child. Again, the service said that autism is the reason for the child's difficulties. Despite being admitted to St. Patrick's University Hospital in Dublin for a period of ten weeks, the CAMHS psychiatrist discharged the child and refused to see him stating that the child had no treatable mental health diagnosis. The time given to assess this child by the CAMHS psychiatrist was a mere ten minutes - deich nóiméad. It took ten minutes to say that he had no treatable mental health difficulties despite having spent ten weeks in a mental health unit for adolescents. Again, this child presented to TUH in a very severe state. He waited four days for a psychiatrist to come to carry out an assessment. The CAMHS psychiatrist came and, again, said it was a matter for disability services due to the child's autism diagnosis. Thankfully, after much representation and phone calls, another psychiatrist came to assess the child and he has finally been taken under the care of CAMHS and is being seen by a psychiatrist. However, the fight continues with disability services for them to provide supports to deal with the other side of the child's diagnosis, as he has a dual diagnosis. Another case is that of a young 14-year-old child who had no access to a psychiatric assessment following the retirement of the CAMHS ID psychiatrist in CHO 5.Thankfully, after much lobbying by the child's parents, the HSE approved funding for the child to be assessed by a psychiatrist who travelled from the UK. This psychiatrist described this child's case as one of the most challenging and difficult to manage presentations he had encountered in over 30 years as a consultant practising in a city of 3 million people. While the mother of this child had regular interaction with the psychiatrist, she was left to administer huge doses of medication with little to no clinical oversight or monitoring of the child's vitals. This child requires an urgent residential placement yet they wait and plead for the most basic of services and limited respite. This family is left in circumstances that no family could or should have to endure. They have been in crisis for almost two years but they have gone beyond crisis. The mother is facing extreme burnout and they have to fight and fight for limited supports. They need urgent intervention and supports from this State and they are being failed. The parents will not rest until the child receives an urgent residential placement. It is so badly needed. Procurement is spoken about. They cannot get houses and staff. It is an awful situation. We have had several meetings with this family and the HSE.  Another case I dealt with involved a primary school-aged child attending CAMHS. He was prescribed high levels of medication that made him physically sick. When he ultimately refused to take the medication because of how ill it made him, he was immediately discharged from CAMHS. It could offer him no further assistance other than medication.  I could go on and list many other cases with which I am dealing and I thank my staff for dealing with these traumatic cases but, unfortunately, it is the same story. CAMHS could offer no supports. "Present to the emergency department" is the answer people are faced with. We all know a emergency department is not a nice place even if you are in full health and only have a cut finger or a broken bone. I do not need to tell anyone here that advising a child with autism experiencing severe mental health difficulties to attend his or her local emergency department is not in any way appropriate. It is hugely inappropriate for both the child, his or her family, the staff and management in that hospital and other patients. The setting is not appropriate and will often only lead to further distress for the child and could lead to distress for other children attending paediatrics but this is the best that our current mental health services can offer. The families with which I have been dealing, and they are many, do not want to bring their children to the emergency department and cause them and others further distress. Their love and care for their children are being abused daily by the HSE. The HSE get away with wilful neglect of our most vulnerable because they know these families will not abandon their children despite how utterly burnt out they are. I wish we could see light at the end of the tunnel but we cannot. We must fight on for these people and have a national response to sort this out. These are just a few cases. They are told to present to Tipperary University Hospital or other emergency departments and they get no services. Our most vulnerable children are being failed and we cannot stand back and say "sorry we don't have the staff or the expertise". We cannot watch them being pushed from pillar to post. This requires a full overhaul and I am pleading with this Government to take this matter seriously because the distress being caused to families, their children and their communities is awful. I am begging the Government to do something because as somebody said earlier, it is 20 years too late. It just has to happen.

It should be noted that in every Mental Health Commission annual report, she always has a section on CAMHS and always makes the point that the situation is dire. This interim report has shown once again a total breakdown in our health services. We see again some of the most vulnerable people in our State being let down again and again by the services that are supposed to look after and care for them and be their safety net when they are ill. We see children lost in the system; children left on medication for years without any sort of review; children waiting for days in emergency departments; some reaching 18 without transfer to adult services; chaotic paper-based record keeping; and staff not properly trained, not properly supervised, overworked and overwhelmed. Everybody knows that this is not an attack on those workers. They are putting their full time into their work with children who need support. All this is from a sample of just 10% of the 6,000 children in CAMHS. We know from the Maskey report that there were 240 children with serious shortcomings in their care in south Kerry alone. These are the children who were lucky enough to get into CAMHS in the first place. The report found acceptance rates of referrals range between 38% to 81% in different CHOs without any clear reason why. How many more children have been lost and let down by this system? How many cannot even get into it? Mental Health Reform, MHR, has said that 4,043 children were on the CAMHS waiting list as of October 2022 and 741 children with mental health difficulties attended emergency departments last year. As of last October, only 37.1% of the Maskey report's recommendations had been completed. The HSE audits of CAMHS promised by the end of last year have not yet been published. No agreements are in place with private providers for children and adolescents attending CAMHS despite the lack of public beds Around half of the €24 million allocated for new mental health services in the 2022 budget has not even been spent. There were over 700 mental health nurse staff vacancies in mental health services as of last November.  We knew already from the Maskey report and the Mental Health Commission's 2021 annual report that this system has been failing. The Government has known this system was failing yet clearly not enough has not been done to help these children and their families. MHR has said the Government's approach is not working. Professor Matthew Sadlier from the IMO says the Government has implemented unfunded and under-resourced structural changes with no consultation with those on the ground. Funding for CAMHS is not ring-fenced and must compete with other services. We know we are facing a shortage of hundreds of child psychiatrists by 2030. People working in these services are warning that this situation will just get worse. I hope that from today, the situation will get better for those workers.  The report found that only one CHO provided excellent services. This was the only CHO with electronic records and it was not run by the HSE. This was actually put to the Government at the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child on Tuesday. How can this country be the location for the offices of all the big global tech companies and still run paper-based records for the care of some of its most vulnerable children?  This system is clearly not working. It is clearly letting down thousands of children in this country. The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2023 needs to be brought forward immediately. I heard the Minister of State say this will happen. She will not find this side of House wanting when it comes to pushing the legislation through very quickly if necessary. We must legislate full rights for everyone receiving mental health services in this country and set out clear responsibility when those services fail them.  The next budget needs to properly increase our mental health spending as a percentage of total health spending. The World Health Organization recommends 12%, the UK has 13% and we have 5.5%. This needs to be in the form of spending increases. It needs to be put towards developing new services and needs to be properly planned, allocated and ring fenced for different services. The post of national director for mental health in the HSE needs to be immediately reinstated. Having an assistant national director is not good enough. The national director needs to report directly to the CEO of the HSE and needs actual funding to develop new services and a new administrative system to take pressure off the existing system.  This crisis is not acceptable, it never was acceptable and it should never have got this far. We need immediate action to protect these children and we need a system with proper planning, oversight, transparency and funding to make sure these failings never happen again.

One of the grimmest aspects of it is that we are here at 7.50 p.m. on a Thursday discussing this important issue. Obviously the political agenda of the week was dominated by relatively minor electoral infractions by both sides of the House.On Sunday night, I learned that this report was going to be in the media the following morning. I pay tribute to the main author of the report, Dr. Susan Finnerty, and the Mental Health Commission for driving that report. It is fair to say they have done the State some service. In the report, we learned of poor monitoring of medication, children waiting for days in emergency departments for psychiatric care, and children left unreviewed on antipsychotic medication for years. Deputies have said that this is completely contrary to best practice. It should not take ordinary people to know that. We are supposed to have a health service staffed by experts. The report states that staff are exhausted, overwhelmed and inadequately supervised. It states that psychiatrists are not trained to work with children, that there is poor risk management, poor clinical governance, and chaotic paper-based record-keeping. The area that I represent, Clare, is not identified in the report but it was identified in The Irish Times. It is obviously part of the mid-west community health organisation, CHO, which covers Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary, where it was found out that there were 140 open cases. A serious risk to the safety and well-being of children accessing CAMHS was identified, including the 140 with open cases who had been lost to follow-up. The immediate response from the HSE was, as it typically is, a defensive one. A senior psychiatrist from the HSE was on RTÉ the next morning to say that the HSE had found that out before the Mental Health Commission report, as if it was somehow a defence that the HSE had seen it a year before the Mental Health Commission identified it and reported on it, but had seemingly done nothing about it. It is beyond me how that came to pass. The part of the report that I found perhaps most depressing was the discussion of systems. I have long held the view that we have no systems anywhere in our healthcare. We have excellent people but no systems. It seems that, as a nation, we do not do planning particularly well and we certainly do not put systems in place. It might be something to do with a post-colonial legacy. I do not know but we do not do it. The report states:- One CHO in our review had a system that they had devised themselves which allowed generation of reports but did not provide electronic records.- Only one CHO had electronic records; this system was provided through an independent agency which also provided the CAMHS service.It is important to highlight that it was an independent agency. I do not highlight it with a view to suggesting that independent agencies should be providing all of the services within CAMHS, but if they can do it, surely to God the HSE can put a system in place. The report continues, "A small number of teams had independently tried to set up basic information systems within their own teams, through their own knowledge of information technology, to increase efficiency and monitor patient files and outcomes. But time spent on such matters takes away from time on patient care and national system would be the most efficient and effective manner of dealing with this." It later states that paper-based files were the norm rather than the exception, that those paper-based files were often incomplete and contained handwritten notes which were illegible. I would welcome it if the Minister spoke on that. It meant that people could not travel out of an area to receive a service but had to be provided with the service in an area. If that was not depressing enough, on Wednesday, we woke up to learn that Professor Martin Curley, who was tasked with delivering the digitisation of health services across the entire HSE, had resigned from his position, saying there were bad actors within the HSE blocking the implementation of this. He helpfully pointed out that Ireland had been loaned €200 million from the European Investment Bank. We have one of the biggest budget surpluses in Europe and we have been loaned money from the European Investment Bank. Even then, we cannot put information systems in place. Who is blocking this? I am sick of the HSE defending this. Over Christmas, the Department defended itself and said it was the HSE's fault, while the HSE said it was the Department's fault. Frankly, I do not much care. I know the Secretary General of the Department of Health was appointed to the board of the FAI during the week. If he can bring his defensive capabilities from our health system to the FAI, we may have a team with a defence like Italy, but Italians return to a functional health system. We in Ireland have an utterly dysfunctional health system. Deputy Joan Collins pointed out how little we spend on mental health. It is quite true that it is utterly inadequate. We spend as much money on health in this State as Austria and Denmark spend per capita, but we do not get a return. The complete lack of systems is part of that.

This has been an exceptionally important debate. Whether it happens on a Thursday evening or at any other time does not take from the importance of it. The contributions that have been made have all been valuable. The issues that are being touched on impact on us all and all of our families. The one commonality in all of this is our common commitment to ensuring that we build the best possible service that our children and adolescents deserve. I would utter one word of caution to everyone, which is that as public representatives, we need to be conscious that this is a particularly sensitive area. It behoves us to build some degree of hope and instil some confidence in people who need the services that they will not be abandoned or left without care and that all of us are committed to looking after them.

I have reviewed some of the core documents about implementation of Sharing the Vision and of CAMHS, as well as the report itself, during the debate. I want to make a few quick points. I thank colleagues. I have found this debate useful. It shows that Dáil Éireann can work well when we are united on a common goal, which we are on this matter. Our goal is to have the best possible services for people who need them, which they can get as quickly as possible. The full answer to that lies in these reports, which are the implementation plans for Sharing the Vision, and Sharing the Vision itself. As I said, part of the answer is CAMHS, but much of the answer lies outside CAMHS, including prevention, lower acuity care and early intervention. There has been much talk about recruitment and retention. Some 10,500 people work in mental health services, with an extra 500 having been added in the time of this Government. There has been a flurry of additional recruitment activity recently, led by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who has really pressed the system to get moving on many hundreds of sanctioned posts that were not being actioned and recruited for to our satisfaction. The higher specialist training posts, for non-consultant hospital doctors to go on to become psychiatrists, have to be expanded.They were expanded last year, when the number rose from 22 to 46. That was in one year so there has been a big increase and we will continue to go further. My view is we need to double college places for healthcare professionals. It is something that I am working on with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I have met several universities about this. We must have a strong pipeline of new healthcare professionals coming forward. The new consultant contract will help. It is a very attractive contract. It will help to hire the very best people. The NCHD task force is going well to make sure that NCHDs have what they need in their training. Deputy Ward raised the issue of panels earlier, and I agree with him. There is work to be done on the panels. They are not working as well as they need to in this and many other areas. The second point I want to make is on waiting lists. Quite rightly, Deputies have been focusing on the 4,000 children who are waiting. Importantly, 1,500 are waiting less than 12 weeks. They are all of concern, but the greatest concern is for those who have been waiting more than 12 months, of whom there are 579, and those waiting between three and 12 months, of whom there are around 1,800. The Minister of State and I, along with the HSE, will focus intently to drive down the number of those waiting too long. We have had success in other areas. Over the past year and a half, the total number of people waiting for an outpatient appointment for more than 18 months has dropped by 50%. The numbers waiting more than 12 months have dropped by 40%. These are big falls, because we have been targeting the long waiters. We will do that here too. The final matter to which I will refer is political will. One or two Deputies asked whether there is political will to deal with this issue. I will make a few points in this regard. The Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that we have the best possible healthcare services for children, adolescents and adults. That is why one of the we have a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people. The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has succeeded in increasing the mental health budget by €200 million in the lifetime of this Government. The overall budget has risen from €1 billion to €1.2 billion. Do we need to go further? Of course we do. However, a 20% increase in just three budgets is significant. This speaks to the Minister of State's and the Government's prioritisation of this matter. It was the Minister of State who sought this report. The Mental Health Commission can report on whatever it wants. It agreed that it would compile this report, and that is its choice, but it was the case that the Minister of State actively sought it. The Minister of State wanted to ensure that a light was shone on these issues. She fought very hard and succeeded in securing a full national audit on medication in the aftermath of the Maskey report and other issues. I work very closely with the Minister of State and I assure that House that she is pushing the HSE very hard. She is pushing it harder at times than the HSE would like. She is seeking these detailed reviews and big increases in funding and pushing for recruitment in order to ensure that we have the money, staff and strategy that are required and that, through our work in this area, we know where the challenges lie. In knowing where those challenges lie, we can all work together in this House to meet them.

We have listened intently. That is one thing I always do whenever I sit on this side of the House. I listen and take notes. It has been a really difficult week. There is no point in saying otherwise. Deputy Niamh Smyth summed it up when she said that you should not have to fight the system. We all see that you have to fight with the system even though we have really good people working within it. In that context, Deputies Ó Murchú and Munster referred to a particular case. That case was brought to my attention yesterday afternoon by Deputy Fitzpatrick. It relates to a young child in the midlands. There were an awful lot of difficulties involved. Thankfully, by yesterday evening, through my efforts and those of my staff, that child got an inpatient bed. It was the first I heard of it yesterday afternoon. There should not be a case where someone has to go to a politician to try to get access to a bed or the necessary supports that are needed. There is something we must be cognisant of. Many comments were made today. I do not have a medical background of any sort, and nor do many people here. This is about dealing with the most complex, challenging and vulnerable people and consultant psychiatrists make a decision after many years of being trained and many years of experience. I will always accept and respect that decision because I do not have the medical wherewithal to challenge it. We hear a lot about young people who do not gain access to CAMHS. Only 2% of all young people with mental health difficulties need the support of CAMHS. That decision has to be taken by a multidisciplinary team. It determines whether the child meets the criteria or not. I am concerned that it varies widely from 38% to 81% depending on which CHO area a person lives in. That is something that I am looking closely at. I have had many meetings this week with the Minister and the HSE. I had a meeting with the Taoiseach earlier today. We have to push so hard on the IT systems. It is not acceptable to still use paper files in 2023. That is really difficult. Another area in which I have zero tolerance relates to governance. There cannot be a situation where governance and standard operating procedures are not in place. The standard operating procedures were introduced in 2019. We dealt with Covid and a lot of other issues, but it is down to me now to push this as hard as I can. I will immediately seek to ensure that all CAMHS multidisciplinary teams have an acceptable level of staffing. We hired 90 people in December. Much of the hiring goes on towards the end of the year. There are an additional 85 people working in CAMHS in the last two and a half years since the Government came in. Yes, we need more. We have 280 staff under recruitment at the moment. Across the multidisciplinary teams, staffing sits at 64%. It varies higher or lower depending on location. That is an area where we are challenged. There was much talk about children lost to follow-up. I do not agree with the choice of language used in this regard, and I will explain why. There was one team in CHO 3 which was identifiable. In that one team, 140 children who had open cases had been lost to follow-up. The children had not been lost; the case had been lost to follow-up. The team had already started the process of a desktop review of these cases and had informed the Mental Health Commission when it came in. A further 28 cases have been looked at. That is 168 cases in total. They are being actively followed up. Consultation has been held with most of the children in this case and their families. I remind everyone that HSE live is available to support any children or families with concerns. The freefone number is 1800 700 700. We have 21,000 children who avail of the help of CAMHS. As of yesterday evening, just under 40 contacts had been made on that issue and eight had been escalated. I reassure people that the phone line is working and the supports are being put in place. We have a lot more work to do on this. There will be another motion next Tuesday night and I will be in here to take it. I will also be in the Seanad next Wednesday. We will make every effort that we can to make sure that we will improve the system. I thought the Ceann Comhairle's words were very wise. Some 21,000 children receive support from CAMHS. They will have appointments again on Monday morning and their families will be listening. My job is to build confidence in the system because there is a lot of good work, really good work, going on. That was stated in the report. CAMHS staff work extremely hard to try and provide a good service. That is stated in the report. We are aware that many young people and their families have received excellent care and treatment. It is stated on page 20 that: "We were pleased to note that, in the majority of the sample of files reviewed, the physical monitoring was completed for children and young people with ADHD on stimulant medication." My main concern in the context of children on stimulant medication was whether physical monitoring was taking place and whether such medication was being overprescribed. There was no evidence of that in the report. I thank all the Deputies for their time. I appreciate it.

The NowDoc service is an out-of-hours GP service covering three municipalities, Carrick-on-Shannon and Ballinamore in south Leitrim, and Boyle in north Roscommon. There is a possibility that this will be privatised and moved from HSE control. I am concerned about the impact of that. There is a probability, which I will explain in a moment, that this change would ensure that out-of-hours calls would be diverted to a centre in Carlow and that out-of-hours services in Carrick-on-Shannon would be diverted to Sligo after midnight. I have here a consultation document examining the GP out-of-hours service in Donegal and south Leitrim, NowDoc. The document considers the objectives and some of the proposed options. One of the options proposed in phase 1 is to examine the options available to locate Carrick-on-Shannon under Sligo Caredoc. There are many issues with the NowDoc service and I do not have time to go into them. I want to focus on the possible closure of the Carrick-on-Shannon office after midnight. As of now the NowDoc out-of-hours GP service covers just more than 70% of the week, operating from Monday to Friday from 6 p.m. until 8 a.m. and 24 hours on Saturday and Sunday. That comes to 118 hours per week, which is significant. However, under these proposals there may be a cut in the out-of-hours service from 118 hours to 62 hours per week because if the service in Carrick-on-Shannon is to finish at midnight any client who requires the out-of-hours GP service would have to be directed to Caredoc in Sligo - a round trip from Carrick-on-Shannon of 108 km or from Ballinamore of 128 km. It is clear from the options presented in this document that if this goes ahead, in a few years rural areas particularly south Leitrim and north Roscommon will not be well served. I want to ensure that optimum care is provided in the NowDoc area so that people can access out-of-hours GP services in a timely fashion. I am aware that NowDoc and Caredoc have identified a number of concerns that impact on patient safety and quality of service. They are listed in this document and they need to be dealt with. It is crucial that whatever changes are made must benefit patients. They must provide a safe service but they must also ensure greater access to healthcare rather than any diminution of services. As I said, some of the options presented in this consultation document would result in a withdrawal of certain out-of-hours services from Carrick-on-Shannon. I raised this issue this evening to highlight it and to look for a guarantee from the Minister of State that there will be no diminution of services under any changes proposed to this service.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-01-26 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	494	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The provision of out-of-hours GP care is a fundamental component of general practice and appropriate access to GP out-of-hours services must be maintained. Under the general medical services scheme, contracted general practitioners must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum or deputy, for emergencies outside normal practice hours. Most choose to participate in GP out-of-hours co-operatives or other GP out-of-hours service providers to meet this contractual requirement. These services have developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services. Access to GP care outside of usual practice hours is necessary to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that urgent care needs are met in the community rather than in an acute care setting. The NowDoc out-of-hours service provides urgent GP care to patients of County Donegal and south Leitrim. As the Deputy will be aware, while GP out-of-hours services are largely provided by private co-operatives, the NowDoc service is run and managed by the HSE in partnership with Caredoc, which provides GPs for the delivery of care. The HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, for the region concerned has advised that it has entered exploratory discussions with relevant stakeholders to examine the most effective arrangements needed to continue to deliver a safe, quality-driven service for County Donegal and south Leitrim. This examination of the service forms part of the HSE response to significant clinical concerns raised by the Caredoc GP board members. The HSE has given assurance that no decision has been made on the redesign of the operating model for those areas, and no decision will be made without the active involvement of relevant stakeholders. The HSE will continue to communicate and engage with all relevant stakeholders to ensure they are fully consulted regarding any future developments. The HSE CHO has confirmed that there are currently no plans to move the treatment centre from Carrick-on-Shannon or change the level of services provided there. It should be noted that the GP out-of-hours service for Sligo and Leitrim is managed as a singular model of service through a service level agreement with Caredoc. As this model is operating effectively, it is not included in the current examination under way. Regarding out-of-hours services in general and across the country, the HSE engages regularly with all service providers and provides significant supports towards service delivery. The out-of-hours support grant that has been in place since 2020 was increased this winter. Additional temporary funding has also been provided to out-of-hours service providers to allow the rostering of more doctors in treatment centres between the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. This allows for more patients to be seen over this busy winter period and helps reduce the need for emergency department attendance. Service quality and patient safety in the delivery of out-of-hours GP care remain paramount for the HSE, and direct its decision making on the provision of services by providers including NowDoc.

She said, "The HSE has given assurance that no decision has been made on the redesign of the operating model for those areas, and no decision will be made without the active involvement of relevant stakeholders." It is fine that there are no plans. However, this is the document I am concerned about. This is the consultation document that the HSE has put out there. One of the options is to locate Carrick-on-Shannon under Sligo Caredoc. The options cover three phases and this is right up there in phase 1, which means we can be sure that this is an important part of what the HSE is considering. I am concerned that we may end up at the point where the service is not designed to suit the people but is designed the other way around and the people have to travel long distances to access healthcare to suit the service. Any service needs to consider settlement patterns, especially where there is dispersed population. That needs to be taken into consideration when designing services. This option is the very opposite. The Minister of State can understand that people are concerned when they see this. It is not a plan or a decision right now.The purpose of my contribution is to try to impress on the Minister of State and the decision-makers that it must not become a plan or decision. Too often, we read lovely words about streamlining, consolidating, centralising and redesigning. Those are lovely words that at the end of the day often mean a reduction in services. I would not like that and do not want to see it happen.

Her point is well made. To reiterate, the HSE continues to work in partnership with NoWDOC and Caredoc to ensure the delivery of a safe and appropriate GP out-of-hours service. No decision has been made with regard to any redesign of the service in the area and any such decision will involve the stakeholders concerned. The HSE CHO has confirmed that there are currently no plans to move the treatment centre from Carrick-on-Shannon or to change the level of the services provided there. The Deputy is trying to ensure that does not happen. I assure her that while the HSE CHO concerned is currently examining the delivery of out-of-hours services for the area, no decision has been made and, in particular, there are no plans currently in place to move the Carrick-on-Shannon treatment centre or to change the services provided there. I take on board the points the Deputy has made about the importance of out-of-hours services provided by Caredoc and NoWDOC, or whatever other services are being provided. Those services are hugely important, especially for those who are living in predominantly rural areas, small villages and towns. I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the relevant CHO.

I have been meeting with tenants living in flat complexes across Dublin. I attended a meeting earlier today in Pearse House. The level of neglect by the Government and Dublin City Council is horrendous. There are affected flats in Beech Hill, Rathmines, Cuffe Street, Digges Street and York Street. There are too many flat complexes to name individually but I assure the Minister of State that every block of flats has shocking levels of damp and mould. We know that mould has a serious impact on the health of young and old, in particular. A young child died because of mould in a flat in the UK. The time for concern is long gone. We need action now. The chance of the council sorting out this mess and these issues is long gone. The Government needs to intervene directly. It needs to set up a task force with ring-fenced funding for the battle against mould. It is far too serious an issue not to do so. Tenants at Mercer House, Digges Street and York Street deserve better. The climate change funds can be used for insulation to make the flats warm, modern and, crucially, energy efficient. It seems that emission reductions are only for the wealthy. No such schemes are being made available to those in flat complexes. Why not put solar panels on top of flat complexes to heat the flats below? There is none of that innovation because the flats have been, and continue to be, neglected and forgotten. None of the flats has schemes to make them more energy efficient. Every flat should have new secure doors that reduce the need to keep the heating on. Every flat should be insulated and warm. Let us ensure a task force is set up with the funding needed to get rid of the dangerous mould in so many flats.

We have the highest rate of hospitalisation in the OECD for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. Mould triggers and exacerbates respiratory conditions and also causes death, as in the case in England to which my colleague referred earlier. I am sure the Minister of State has heard about that case. The coroner in England made the defining judgment that the death of Awaab Ishak was due to chronic exposure to mould in the apartment in which he was living. That judgment is also of critical importance to us in Ireland because of the amount of mould in the country. We have similar weather to the UK. I know of a case in north Kildare where the roof of a home has been deemed the cause of serious mould. The council's response so far has been to paint the ceiling. People should not be living in these kinds of conditions in the 21st century. It is unimaginable. That the public should be subsidising these conditions with public money is disgraceful. I would like to see plans for a mould audit. We should require all local authorities to undertake an inspection and audit of their housing stock for mould. We should mandate a designated number for the reporting of mould in all local authorities. It is a health issue. We should ensure that public money is withheld from any private landlords whose stock is deemed unsuitable. The public should not be funding properties that are bad for public health.

It is a very serious public health issue. I absolutely agree that it needs to be tackled. In accordance with section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, local authorities are legally responsible for the management and maintenance of their housing stock. Local authorities also have a legal obligation to ensure that all of their tenanted properties are compliant with the provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019. Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in those regulations and focus on tenant safety. They specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as ventilation, structural repair, fire safety, sanitary facilities, heating and the safety of gas, oil and electrical installations. The regulations apply to all properties let or available for let, including social housing. All landlords, including local authorities, have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the standards set out in the regulations. Responsibility for enforcement of the regulations in the private rental sector, including approved housing body properties, rests with the relevant local authority. The Government is committed to ensuring that a high quality stock of rental accommodation is available for households who rent, be it in the private market or in accommodation provided directly by local authorities. Notwithstanding the legal obligations on local authorities to manage and maintain their housing stock, our Department does in a focused way provide annual funding to local authorities to support their work in this area. For example, under the voids programme, our Department supports local authorities in refurbishing vacant social homes and returning them to productive use. This funding programme was introduced in 2014 and to the end of 2021, returned significant numbers of properties to use with funding of €261 million from our Department. Our Department launched the energy efficiency retrofitting programme in 2013 with the aim of funding the retrofit of social homes requiring insulation and energy upgrade works. Since the programme commenced in 2013, over €188 million of Exchequer funding has been provided under this scheme. Poorly adapted insulation can sometimes be the cause of mould in properties. That is worth addressing. My Department also provides for the disabled persons grant, DPG, scheme which provides funding for adaptations and extensions to existing social housing stock to meet specific needs of the local authority tenants with a 10% contribution required from the local authority. From 2011 to 2021, a total of €138 million was spent under the DPG scheme. The selection of properties for inclusion in these programmes and the nature of works to be completed in line with the criteria of the schemes are matters for each individual local authority. The implementation of these focused programmes is separate to the local authorities' legal responsibilities under the Housing Acts to ensure that they maintain their housing stock to the appropriate legal standards. My Department will continue to support local authorities in these focused stock improvement works and work is also ongoing with the local authority sector, through the City and County Management Association, CCMA, to drive a planned maintenance approach to the management and maintenance of all local authority housing stock. Local authorities are entrusted with providing high-quality housing stock to social housing tenants. The Department is funding the development of a national asset management system for the sector that should greatly assist the sector in this task. I will come back with a supplementary reply. Both Deputies have suggested a mould audit and a task force on this issue. Those suggestions are worthy of consideration. The issue can sometimes be caused by poor insulation or ventilation. It can also be caused by overcrowding in local authority stock, which is a real problem. Sometimes good advice to tenants can be of considerable assistance in terms of ventilating properties.I will come back in on the supplementary again to follow up on the specific question.

We cannot entrust the local authorities to fix this problem which has been there for decades. The homes are passed with just a bit of paint or bleach, which some tenants are given. The days for that are long gone. Government needs to intervene and ensure that the funding is there. The funding can be there if the Government is committed to it. It is not being taken seriously. We need action. We are not seeing action. We have inadequate funding to tackle this serious problem. I believe the Government is overwhelmed by the extent of the mould and neglect in the flats. Glovers Court is not far from here. It was supposed to be retrofitted years ago. Canon Mooney Gardens in Ringsend was also supposed to be treated. That has not happened. There is no real commitment by the Government. It has never been done. People are still living in shocking flats. I spoke to a resident earlier on and he said, "These flats were built to replace the tenements and now we are living in modern-day tenements". I just came from a meeting in Pearse House where that was said to me. Residents living in the flats deserve better.

Sometimes people are told it is a ventilation matter. They are told to make sure their vents are not blocked. In many cases they are not blocked. That is not the cause of the mould. Earlier I spoke of a tenant who reported her leaks 16 months ago to Kildare County Council. The contractor came out and told her the roof needed to be replaced. The council went out a year later, which was a couple of months ago, and replaced part of the roof, not all of it. The plaster is coming off the walls in some places. The exposed brickwork is still wet. Windowsills are swollen from water and they are rotten. The windows need replacing as well. I appreciate what the Minister of State said. I hope he will take it on board because I do not believe the Department is taking this very seriously. We have to look after our council stock. As landlords, local authorities are responsible to make sure that they are providing decent accommodation. Will the Minister of State try to get a circular out to the local authorities to tell them they have to make sure that their accommodation is up to scratch?

I say this in regard to flats and social housing stock and all housing stock. That is critically important. I have encountered this in Traveller accommodation. It is a serious public health issue. We saw the case in the UK. We are perhaps not fully aware of the impact it is having on children's and young people's health in particular. We will certainly follow up on the questions that have been put to us. Some good ideas have been brought forward and they are worthy of a response. If we look at the retrofits, there are many good retrofit programmes that the Government has led on and funded. If the wrong retrofit programme or the wrong type of insulation takes place it involves awareness-raising with residents and tenants in regard to ventilation. The ventilation should be part of the retrofit programme. That is vitally important. Certainly I will take back the points that have been made by both Deputies. They are valid and very useful from our perspective. As I said, the issue of mould is a very serious public health risk and needs to be eliminated. I thank the Deputies for the question.

I was delighted when I saw that our Bill had been chosen in the Bills lottery before Christmas and to get the opportunity to bring this Bill to the House on Second Stage. As I discussed at some of the committees, this Bill is designed to give parents who are employees the legal right to parental bereavement leave when their child has died. Every person here and every parent listening I am sure hopes that this devastation will never visit them. However, for a few, it does, including indeed some people in this House. For that reason I imagined that this would be a gentle Bill, that it would go through the House without resistance. It is also a strong Bill. The Bill would have real power to protect employee parents when they have lost their child. Deputy O’Reilly and I made the Bill as clear, as distinct and as workable as possible in theory and in practice. Under the Bill in regard to a child, son or daughter under 18 years of age, or a stillborn baby after the 24th week of pregnancy, the term of the parental bereavement leave is to be no less than ten days. It would be applied for and notified within 42 days of the date of the death. That death date would be considered day 1. Our Bill establishes parental bereavement leave separate from all other leave and ensures that it qualifies as continuing employment in terms of length of service or benefits accruing later on. No working parent should be penalised later for leave needed and taken on the death of his or her child. The Bill also lays out clearly the rights and responsibilities of both the employer and the employee. Critically it establishes parental bereavement leave as a legal right for a worker. In this way it establishes it as an employment right to be vindicated, as opposed to a personal favour or kindness to be requested and conferred at one of the most difficult times that any parent could face in his or her life. I believe it is critical in a time of such loss and heartbreak that a worker should be able to rely on the simplicity and order of such leave being in legislation. Since death does not delay there is a real urgency to this Bill. For employers and employees alike there is a real need that the effect of this Bill be in statute as soon as possible.  I was upset and taken aback to see that the Government has proposed an amendment to delay the Bill for 12 months and for reasons that can wait and therefore I believe do not hold. The examination of these issues does not and should not preclude the Minister from withdrawing his amendment. There is no reason this Bill should not proceed without the 12-month delay and the examination of the issues the Minister raises continue in tandem. By contrast death does not delay. Death does not wait and will not wait. If the Minister persists with this amendment and the 12-month delay, bereaved parents will be left waiting even longer for something that should already be in place as their right as valued citizens of this State. We talk a great deal here about compassion. The Government is great with its “be kind” hashtags. With this Bill the Government would have the chance to show real kindness and compassion to bereaved parents in our actions as legislators, not merely in words. It is actually hard to believe that this leave is not already established as a right for a bereaved parent. I suspect many people think it already is and probably imagine they could rely on it if an appalling event occurred, but it is not and it is badly needed. To delay it further would be both unnecessary and inexplicable. I implore the Minister to reconsider his amendment and withdraw it and give parents the dignity they deserve.

I understand he has had a busy week so it is very welcome that he found the time to come in. This Bill is very simple. I thank my comrade, Deputy Cronin, for the work she has put in on this Bill, not just here but also, as she has alluded to, at the committee. This issue is important. We are lucky and thankful, and I am as a parent, that this is not something that will be used by a huge number of people.For those who will use it, it is essential. This will put onto a statutory footing what already happens in most workplaces. Most employers will grant without hesitation time off work for a parent who is bereaved but they do not have any guidance. The worker does not know he or she can ask and the employer does not know what it can give. Essentially, what we are talking about is codifying what most decent employers do anyway and then, obviously, the legislation deals with those employers who perhaps do not do the right thing when the opportunity presents itself. This should not be left as a grace-and-favour arrangement. It should not be something that a worker has to ask for or try to arrange when he or she has lost a child and is in the midst of that grief and of the turmoil and turbulence that will come after that. This brings a degree of certainty and it codifies the position. I genuinely believe that most employers will try to do the right thing but many workers will not ask. If they do not know they have a legal entitlement to it, they will not necessarily ask for that leave because there is that uncertainty, coupled with the fact their whole life has just turned upside down. I cannot imagine it. When I think about my daughter and my grandson, I just put it out of my head. I cannot think about how awful that would be, but to then have to do something practical like trying to supplement their income would be very difficult. As the Minister will know, many people are living from week to week and from pay cheque to pay cheque. They simply cannot afford unpaid time off work. They need to know that when they need this leave, the leave will be available to them, and putting it onto a statutory footing is an important part of that. Many parents may never feel ready to return to work but return to work they must because, as with everybody else, they have to eat, pay their bills and pay their rent. The landlord does not know the parent or the worker is bereaved, the person at the tills in Tesco does not know the parent is bereaved and the ESB does not know the parent is bereaved and so the bills keep arriving in the middle of all of this. All that this legislation does is to give that little bit of certainty. The Minister's amendment is shameful. I do not think it is necessary. The Minister knows the legislative process. I heard his party leader say the other week that it takes two and a half years to learn the job. Here we are. The Minister knows the legislative process and he knows it is not fast. He knows we could be doing in parallel the work of consultation and anything else that is required. I think it would send a positive message from this House that we would start that work now instead of kicking it to touch. Another reason I am concerned about the Minister's amendment, which is a tried and tested Government tactic, is that I was at committee yesterday discussing legislation on retired workers. The Minister's colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy English, had kicked to touch for 12 months the legislation they wanted implemented to allow for a period of consultation, and nothing happened. When I asked people were they consulted, they said they sent in a submission but nothing happened. That time was not used. Past performance is an indication of future performance, in my opinion, and there is no point kicking things to touch and kicking them down the road. This is something that could be done now. We could actually start that work now instead of delaying it for 12 months. It is not lost on me or anyone else that bereaved parents who are working in the Civil Service are already entitled to this leave. That argument has been won with the Government as employers. The Government is a large employer. That argument has already been won and that concession has already been given to those workers. They already have that right. We do not need to debate the merits and whether or not we need it. I think we can all agree that it is a worthwhile thing to do and, indeed, that argument has already been won on the Government side of the House. This will not impact many people, thankfully, but for those who need it, it will mean the absolute world to them. It will be a godsend to them, a small bit of certainty in the middle of having their whole life turned upside down and ripped to shreds. If we are all agreed on this, as I think we are, I genuinely do not understand why we have to wait.

I am not a dad myself but I know that the grief of a parent on losing a child is unimaginable. I have no doubt there may be parents watching this discussion today and I want to offer my condolences to anyone who has been bereaved in this way. The proposals in this Private Member's Bill bring an important focus to bereaved parents and the ways in which a workplace can support them. As Deputies have outlined, the Bill would amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 to introduce a statutory minimum of ten days' bereavement leave for parents of a child, with a child defined as being under the age of 18. The leave is to be taken within 42 days of the death of the child. The Bill also includes amendments to provide for the protection of employment rights while a parent is availing of the leave. There is currently no form of statutory bereavement leave of any kind in Ireland. This type of leave is normally dealt with through employment contracts and, as the Deputy said, many employers will do the right thing in these situations. The broader policy on workplace leave is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but, as this particular leave would apply to parents only, it is for consideration by my Department, which holds the policy on family leave. There have been significant developments in the forms of leave available to working parents in recent years. This includes introduction in 2019 of paid parents' leave and the expansion of that leave last year and this year so that it now provides seven weeks paid leave to each parent of a child under the age of two. In 2019, unpaid parental leave underwent a significant extension, with the entitlement now standing at 26 weeks for a child under 12. These developments have taken place alongside a broader expansion of entitlements for all workers, like statutory sick leave and the embrace of the more flexible working patterns which have emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. As we have discussed previously, new measures are being brought forward as part of the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022, which will include the introduction of five days' leave for medical care purposes, five days' paid domestic, sexual and gender-based violence leave, the right to request flexible working for parents and carers, the right to request remote working for all employees and, of course, the extension of breastfeeding breaks. I recognise that none of these types of leave, none of these positive advancements, would address bereaved parents specifically but I highlight them as a context in which change in leave has taken place in recent years. In consultation with employers and social partners around the development of new or extended entitlements, issues come up such as the impact it has on employers and the ability of employees to avail of their statutory entitlements. Both employers and employees need to be comfortable and confident that they can and do ensure that all leaves are taken appropriately and fully availed of. The Government recognises that these developments, which are of huge benefit to parents, must also be practical and fully meet the needs of both parents and carers. The Government fully appreciates that parents who have experienced a bereavement need support, need understanding and need time and space to process their grief. Providing leave from working obligations is one way to address this but there can be broader concerns around how a workplace can meet the needs of a parent in that situation. Providing leave on its own without other supports may not always be the answer in a particular parent’s situation. As Deputies will be aware, my Department has commissioned a research project on the workplace impact of pregnancy loss in response to the issue of miscarriage leave, which has been raised previously in this House.This is being undertaken through the PLACES study, which is the Pregnancy Loss in Workplaces: Informing policymakers on support mechanisms, and is being led by the pregnancy loss research group in University College Cork. This brings together expertise from the medical and business schools in UCC and NUIG. This particular study will examine whether policy interventions are required in the workplace to better support people following pregnancy loss. Informed by international best practice, the study will put forward recommendations for formal and-or informal support mechanisms that could be introduced in the workplace to better support working people experiencing pregnancy loss. Support mechanisms may include the provision of compassionate or bereavement leave, flexible working arrangements, or other workplace policies. This study will focus on people who experience pregnancy loss prior to 24 weeks' gestation, as people who have a pregnancy loss after 24 weeks' gestation can avail of full maternity leave and paternity leave entitlements. That study has three phases and the final report is expected in August 2023. The recommendations in the final report will help to inform Government policy, including the development of legislation to address the issue of miscarriage leave. I fully recognise that the issues around pregnancy loss and the loss of a child after birth are not identical, but in both cases we are talking about a bereaved family who may need time away from their work, or may need to be supported in other ways. We believe it is important that there is some coherence in how these issues are considered and addressed, and this is the reason the Government is bringing forward a proposal for a timed amendment today. We want the opportunity to allow the PLACES research to take place, to avail of the expertise which we have brought forward, and to recognise another distinct key issue in supporting parents and workers in a very difficult period of their lives. Once we have the opportunity to examine and understand that research, when this Bill comes to Committee Stage, we will be able to look at its provisions, informed by the research which has been undertaken. We may, indeed, be able to bring forward, potentially, legislation that will address both of the issues Deputies have raised today and issues that I am sure, Deputies will agree, are also important, which have been brought forward in the past in this House, and on which the Government has responded through the commission of dedicated and targeted research. There is a process going forward and this legislation will be held and will go forward on Committee Stage in 12 months' time. I am very happy to continue to engage with Deputies to ensure we can make provision for parents who are bereaved and for parents who have suffered a miscarriage. I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach.

It could equally be called the compassion Bill because that is really what it is about. It is about showing compassion to people who find themselves in horrific circumstances, something that none of us would ever like to imagine facing. This will impact a very small number of people and, as the Minister said and everyone would agree, the vast majority of employers will accept that and be understanding but that is not always the case and we must ensure that people have that right. Most workers will probably get ten days but when we talk about this particular issue, we always say, and it is agreed right across the House, that politics is not family-friendly. We have to do everything to make it more family-friendly. The Minister listed off a number of measures which have been taken to make it more family-friendly, so I just cannot understand how the Government could delay this. Having listened to the Minister, and with no disrespect intended, I still do not understand why he could delay this Bill for 12 months. The process will take years. It is imperative that this compassion Bill which shows compassion is started now rather than waiting for 12 months to go to Committee Stage. I still do not understand and perhaps the Minister will make a further contribution and outline clearly why the Bill would be delayed for 12 months because I do not think that most people would understand that. Ideally, the Minister would withdraw that amendment. It is unnecessary to delay the Bill and why would he do so? People are at a very vulnerable point when they lose a child. It is a devastating blow and we have to ensure that people are shown that compassion. Perhaps the Minister will outline again why the Bill will be delayed because it makes no sense. I know that the Minister is a man with compassion which is clear in all of the work he does. I ask that he withdraw the amendment and move this Bill forward as a matter of urgency.

I do not believe anyone in this House claims, and I know I certainly do not, complete ownership of compassion. I completely recognise the issues as well as the need for those raised by the Deputies to be addressed. The Deputies have said that this issue is provided for by the vast majority of employers. However, their concern, which is a legitimate one, is to ensure this is not something that is offered, but is something that is there as a right. I fully understand the Deputies' desire to legislate in that way. Previously, and it was in response to Opposition Private Members' legislation dealing with the issue of miscarriage leave, we, as a Government, brought forward the proposal to undertake research. I take the point made about other situations where timed amendments have been put in place and nothing has happened. I do not believe that criticism can be levied here because research is being undertaken at the moment which is looking at how we can support parents who have suffered a particular bereavement in the context of miscarriage leave. I also believe that where we are dealing with issues of a similar and interlinked nature, we should try to address them in the same legislation. That is why in the context of the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, I worked not only to implement the issues in the work-life balance directive, but I also introduced a number of key innovations in respect of extending breastfeeding breaks and, in particular, paid domestic violence leave. Bringing things together into a substantial piece of legislation ensures that legislation gets through. The weight of the various issues behind it gives it a prioritisation which, I fear, it would not have if there was just one issue being dealt with. That is why I brought in domestic violence leave into that legislation because I was worried that on its own, it might not get the necessary prioritisation. The issues the Deputies have brought forward today and the issues my Department is looking at are similar and could be brought together effectively in the combined legislation.In 12 months' time, when the research that our Department has commissioned on the potential for miscarriage leave and other supports has been undertaken, we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to look to see if there is a possibility of integrating the two issues. That would result in legislation being brought forward that would have a meaningful impact for many parents, both those who have suffered bereavement due to the loss of a child, in addition to the much greater number of parents who have suffered a miscarriage in the course of their relationship. That is my view on the best way to proceed. I recognise Deputies do not agree with me but that is the position of the Government and the position we will work from.

A little like my comrade, Teachta Andrews, I still do not understand. I will go through what the Minister said. I am very glad he recognises that none of the types of leave that he spoke about, and read out from his script, will address the issue of bereaved parents. That is a very important clarification that I am glad he made because, to be fair, he spent a lot of time talking about leave that would not apply to this particular group. I understand that context is important in all things but much of the Minister's contribution referenced leave that might be under way or coming, which will not impact in any way on parents who are bereaved. He also said he was not opposing the legislation, but he is not supporting it either. He is just standing in the way of it or trying to delay it. I do not understand why we cannot begin to progress this. The Minister said he is concerned about the impact on employers but he agreed with me that most employers are doing this anyway, which they are. What they need, however, is guidance because they do not know. It is a tough thing. A lucky employer might never encounter this issue. Other employers might find themselves in a situation where they do. It is very useful if there is a legislative framework, and leave on a statutory footing, because everybody would know where they stood. As I said, the ESB or Tesco do not know whether somebody is bereaved. Bills mount up and people need to safeguard their wages. The Minister also spoke about the need to wait for the dedicated and targeted research, which is being done by PLACES. That research is very welcome and I am sure it will inform other legislation but it will not refer to parents who are bereaved in the way that has been described. That research is on early pregnancy loss, which is different. That will not be relevant research. Essentially, the Minister is saying that this legislation will be delayed for a minimum of 12 months while we are waiting for "dedicated and targeted research", which is not dedicated to this type of bereavement leave or targeted at those parents. It is for that reason that there is genuine confusion. It is a Government tactic to delay things by 12 months and to kick things down the road. I can only speak about my experience of where this has been done. It was not a good experience. It most definitely was not a good experience for the workers who were sold a pup, effectively, and told that 12 months were needed for dedicated, targeted research, consultation or whatever it is. In truth, precious little was done and those workers are still back where they were. They are still at the starting point. That time was, in effect, lost. I urge the Minister to withdraw this amendment. I do not see that it is necessary. With the greatest of respect, I do not believe that he has in any way, shape, make or form, offered us a cogent or coherent reason why this cannot be done. If we are all agreed, and we are, we should be able to move on this now and not waste any time.

I have several questions because I am wondering what his amendment has to do with our Bill. Pregnancy loss and domestic violence leave are very important. I note the Minister said five days. I am sure he knows it was ten days in the report that our committee published, but none of that has anything to do with our Bill. I am afraid none of what he said really holds. I cannot help but think that the Minister has again been sent out deliberately to delay legislation that is already long overdue. This is legislation that would bring compassion to our employment laws at a time of the most profound loss and bereavement following the death of a beloved son or daughter. Looking at this at its most basic level, bereaved parents need time to make practical arrangements, whether these involve the child who has died or wider family arrangements. Their whole family life has been turned upside down. We all know what a bereavement is like but only a few of us understand what bereavement due to the loss of a child is. I am sure that is a challenge to somebody's ability to get on with every minute and every hour, never mind every day. There is a sheer mindlessness to tasks that eats into us when we are just shocked and lost but being bereaved due to the death of a child is of a completely different order. People should not have to rely on the kindness of their employers at that time. We should not preside over a situation whereby those working in the pubic sector and Civil Service can avail of this leave - it is not statutory bereavement leave but a contractual arrangement - but those working in the private sector are not entitled to it. It is unworthy of our workers and families and, frankly, it is beneath the Minister. No parent recovers from such a loss; they simply learn to accommodate it. As legislators, we should be able to accommodate them in their right to take leave from their jobs. With this amendment, the Minister is seeking to delay the matter even further by examining issues that could be examined in tandem with the legislation. It takes a long time for legislation to go through the Dáil. The Government is playing fast and loose with the needs and rights of employees in the private sector at a profoundly difficult time in their lives. I do not see that this delay is necessary at all. A friend of mine lost her son last week. I heard about it when I was getting ready for work in the morning. I could not get even my make-up on because I was so upset and my eyes were filling up with tears - a minor thing - but it cuts into our hearts when we hear about a family we know losing a child. It is every parent's fear. It is the reason we check the cot to check in on our babies and listen at the door to make sure they are all breathing. It makes no sense because we will not catch them at the exact time something happens, but it is a guttural fear for every parent. It is why I ask the Minister to withdraw this unnecessary amendment. I told the Minister that he got the short straw. I cannot believe he has been sent to the House yet again on this matter but it is entirely within his gift to withdraw this amendment. I ask and implore him to do so.
