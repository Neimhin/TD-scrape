          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_23">Amendment No. 32 replaces subsections (1), (2) and (3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of section 11 of the Refugee Act 1996 and deletes subsections (6) and (7) of that section. The changes are threefold. The references in the present subsection (2) to section 12 dealing with manifestly unfounded cases are not reproduced because amendment No. 46 will replace that section completely. The reference to remittal backup cases by the tribunal to the commissioner in the present subsection is not reproduced. That is because that possibility is to be removed by the combined effect of the new section 12, dealt with by amendment No. 46, the new section 13, which is dealt with in amendment No. 47, and the new section 16(2), which is dealt with in amendment No. 50. Finally, the new text takes account of the arrangements for dealing with withdrawn and deemed withdrawn applications already in the amendment to the Refugee Act contained in the Bill as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The changes in the new subsection (2) primarily have the effect, in conjunction with the proposed replacement of section 13, of simplifying the paper trail associated with the investigation of an applicant. This will work by confining the scope of the report to be made under section 11 to a report of the interview itself. The report to be prepared under section 13(1) will as a result of these changes contain the material regarding the other aspects of the investigation of the asylum claim which is at present provided for in the report under section 11. That will provide greater flexibility than at present for the commissioner to deploy her resources, but it will not otherwise affect the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">New subsection 11(3), as inserted by this amendment, will have two effects. It will put on a statutory footing the right of the UNHCR representative to attend any interview under the section, which has heretofore happened only on an informal basis. Secondly, it will relieve the commissioner of the need to wait in every case for seven working days to elapse after interview before a recommendation on the application can be made. Matters which might have been raised in representations during that period can instead be raised on appeal where a negative recommendation is made. The proposed provision as worded does not prevent the commissioner from considering matters raised by representations made in the interval between the conduct of an interview and the making of a recommendation. It merely says that a period of seven days need not elapse as a matter of legal obligation in every case. In fact, representations made after the interview are made in very few cases and I see very little merit in delaying the progress of every case for more than a week in circumstances in which the provision is little used and where the right of appeal, in any event, more than satisfies the requirements of a fair procedure. This does not limit the right of the applicant or of the UNHCR to make representations at any stage in the process, nor does it prevent the commissioner from taking into account, if she can, representations made even after the interview has taken place. Common sense, however, dictates that if representations do not come in until after she has made her recommendation, she no longer has any means to take those into account. The proposed deletion of subsections (6) and (7) is consequential on inclusion and Government amendment No. 47 has similar provisions for section 13.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">The effect of these two changes taken together will be to oblige the commissioner to supply the applicant with copies of documents submitted in the course of investigation in any case where there is a negative decision that can be appealed instead of in every case, irrespective of the outcome, as happens at present.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_27">Some aspects of this are welcome. Subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) is improved because the High Commissioner or any other person concerned may make representations to the commissioner in relation to any matter relevant to an investigation under the section and the commissioner shall take account of any such representation made or during an interview.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Even more importantly, the High Commissioner may, whenever he or she so requests, be present at an interview under subsection (2). That is a valuable precaution and should be welcomed by the High Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I am concerned about the manner in which subsection (2) deals with an interview taking place. This is a new procedure when there is an investigation of an application by the refugee applications commissioner. It includes the phrase that an interview "where necessary and possible, be conducted with the assistance of an interpreter". What is the value of an interview if the person cannot communicate? Can an interview be held in any sense of the word if someone speaks a different language? Surely an interpreter should be an essential requirement if we are to fulfil the conditions of the convention in relation to having an interview with the commissioner. Someone should be able to translate if a person cannot communicate in a language spoken here.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Interpretation will always be provided where practicable and possible, having regard to the fact that for certain languages there are limited numbers of interpreters available in the State. For certain dialects in South America or other places, it would be impossible to guarantee that an interpreter could be found. I agree with Deputy Costello but there are circumstances where it is possible to communicate as best one can through a third language. I do not want to be in the position where a person says that he or she speaks a rare Himalayan dialect and refuses to deal with me through Nepalese or Hindu in which they could also be understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I assure Deputy Costello that we do not dispense with interpreters to suit ourselves. If an Irish person presented himself in another country and insisted that his native language was Irish, they might say that they think he is able, however inadequately, to communicate through English. In such circumstances, to bind ourselves to the proposition that there will always be an interpreter would be a mistake. In many larger countries tribal dialects exist and I cannot bind myself to the proposition of an interpreter in the chosen language of the person in every case.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_36">That is my point. The amendment only states "where necessary and possible". Is the Minister satisfied that every situation is covered by that? Surely an interpreter is necessary in all cases where the language is not English or Irish. The legislation is silent on what happens if it is not possible to find an interpreter. It should be a requirement that there is an interpreter - not necessarily of the chosen language, but someone who is capable of ensuring there is communication.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Has this situation arisen where an interpreter has not been available? Is it the case that interviews are postponed or a person is detained for a period? How regularly does this scenario arise?</p>

          <p eId="para_38">The Department does its best in every case. In some cases people are brought over from Britain because there are not people who speak every dialect available in Ireland. The Deputy can be assured that the standard "where necessary and possible" is a very high one. The alternative is to say "even though impossible" and I could not possibly put that in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">If it is impossible to get an interpreter, the interview would not have much content. In those cases every reasonable step is taken to ensure the interview can take place. If someone claims that we cannot get through to him in any way, by this stage he will have claimed asylum and he must have been able to communicate with us in some way to do that. We are debating the number of angels who can dance on the head of a pin. The reality is that an interpreter is always provided unless for some extremely unusual reason it is impossible to find one.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 32 seeks in the proposed new section in the third line, after "officers", to insert "who shall, as far as practicable, be of the same gender as the applicant,". It seems an obvious suggestion but situations have occurred where male interviewers have inquired about detailed aspects of sexual assault in countries with practices different from Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">There can be vastly different cultural experiences and norms for non-nationals who come here and we should, as far as it is possible, ensure a person of the same gender conducts the interview. This would avoid embarrassing situations that might arise in relation to alleged sexual assault or sexual mutilation. Such topics could cause distressing scenarios and this has occurred in the past. I do not know why we could not insert an amendment that would direct an authorised officer or officers, who shall, as far as practical, be of the same gender as the applicant, to conduct the interview with the applicant.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_45">I am not disposed to accept this amendment for a number of reasons. First, on a lot of occasions husbands and wives are interviewed at the same time, so the mind boggles as to what kind of interviewer Deputy Costello has in mind. Second, of course there are occasions where people are alleging female genital mutilation or sexual assaults on them. To be honest, in practice many of those cases are sent to persons of the same gender. I do not want to introduce a legal obligation to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">There are often mixed questions involving these and other issues. These may not be the only issues in relation to a particular case. We have to be reasonable here. If one goes before the District Court in relation to a sexual assault case, one does not choose the gender of the judge——</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_48">This is a constraint that I do not intend to bring into the system. The common sense of the commissioner, Bernice O'Neill, can be relied upon in all these matters. It is not reasonable that women applicants should have women interviewers as of right. This frequently is the case in reality, but I am not going to make it a right. The workload in any particular period may well make it impossible to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I am not proposing that it be there as of right, full stop. I am proposing that interviewers be of the same gender of the applicant as far as is practicable. That is the usual formula that is put into legislation to ensure that if one is unable to fulfil the desirable requirement, the provision is sufficiently flexible to provide an opportunity to opt out - in this case, whereby the interviewer would not necessarily have to be of the same gender. However, the Minister does need to enshrine in legislation that a reasonable effort should be made to ensure that somebody of the same gender would conduct the interview. There have been some very distressing situations in the past. It has happened.</p>

That is not reasonable.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">There are such cases, and it is an in-house policy that this is done anyway. However, I do not want to make a dog's dinner of the Act. I do not want a situation whereby a male Nigerian has to be interviewed by an Irish male when no aspect of sexuality or gender is relevant to the case at all. One could then have a situation where people from certain faith groups do not like having anything to do with women as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">There are certain world cultures in which men regard themselves as entitled to deal with a man only. I have been in places where one does not bring a woman even on a diplomatic mission. The female members of the team are left behind in the hotel. We cannot reflect those kinds of attitudes in our law. These peopleare coming to Ireland because we are Irish,not because we are a reflection of their own society.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_60">We will not dwell too much longer on this. When an interview is being conducted, however, a considerable number of personal details will be sought, particularly when the case relates to persecution. A lot of persecution involves physical assault of one sort of another, and very often physical assault on a woman takes the form of mutilation or sexual assault. It is not as though we are dealing with ordinary, run of the mill citizens. We are dealing with a particular category of citizens who are claiming to have suffered persecution. A disproportionate number of them, particularly in the case of women, will be alleging that particular practices or assaults took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">We have to formally try to take that into consideration. I do not know if there is a code of conduct in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that gives guidelines, instructions or directions as to how cases should be dealt with where it is fairly obvious that the situation could be quite distressing, very personal and so on. It is not quite good enough for the Minister to leave it entirely open. We need to have something here that gives a direction on how to handle an interview in a proper, courteous and humane fashion.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_32" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_62">I do not want to spend much more time on this but the term "as far as practicable" means something in law. It means that one must take every practical step to bring it about. The Deputy's proposal is that men will only be interviewable by men, as far as practicable, and that women will only be interviewable by women, as far as practicable. That is the objective meaning of this amendment and what I am dealing with here.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">If the Deputy is suggesting something different, if he is suggesting that it would be appropriate that cases involving highly sensitive matters be heard by an officer of one gender rather than another, I can assure him that this is already the practice in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. They do not try to embarrass people.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Just because a refugee applicant is a woman does not mean, in the great majority of cases, that there is a gender specific angle to her application. Frequently a family moves as a unit to Ireland to escape persecution in places such as Kosovo. There may well have been a rape or some other angle to a Kosovan application for asylum seeking. In those circumstances, nobody is embarrassed by our system. However, there are other cases, Romanian males who claimed they were homosexual and because of homophobia in Romania wanted to come to Ireland. That may sound strange but it was the basis of a number of asylum applications. Who would the Deputy want in such cases - a man or a woman?</p>
          <p eId="para_65">The Deputy's proposal would disimprove the Bill significantly and make it difficult to operate. It would also rob us of the expertise of many women who have experience of general political issues and ask them to excuse themselves from cases in which they would be perfectly competent to deal with the issues in question, on the basis that the person with whom they are dealing is of the wrong gender. That is not a good idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">It is my intention to make the situation better, not worse. The last thing I want is to rob the system of women interviewers. They would probably conduct the interview in a more sensitive fashion than men. The spirit of what I am trying to do is to recognise that in highly sensitive situations it would be desirable that women would not be interviewed by men. I asked the Minister if he would give us some indication of whether there are guidelines and what sort of criteria operate within his Department to deal with a situation like this. Has it been recognised as an issue and are there guidelines to deal with it?</p>

Training is provided for interviewing vulnerable groups, including gender sensitive training. That is being done under the auspices of the UNHCR. There are 300 staff in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner so we do have the flexibility to deal with these eventualities and where gender issues are likely to be relevant we follow a general rubric in that office that as far as possible there is the same gender.

It will add considerably to the process if an officer in ORAC, who has just heard a case and has the details fresh in his or her mind and the notes to hand, must put the case away for seven working days, and then take it out again because something may have arrived in the meantime. Seven working days is ten days really because a weekend is bound to intervene. Material of that kind submitted before the decision is made in a case, which will usually be a matter of a few working days, will be considered as a matter of fact. If the decision is made and the material comes in it will be available for the purpose of an appeal if the decision is going against the person in question. Seven working days is ten days and it adds a fortnight to every case. Only in a minority of cases does anything actually come in. In reality this is an unnecessary lengthening of the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">It appears that when the interview is taking place the person, and maybe the solicitor if he or she has one, could review the position and might want to put in some final documentation immediately afterwards to tidy up loose ends. This could be part of the final adjudication. Not everything would be known until the interview took place and there would be an opportunity in the next couple of days for the applicant and the legal adviser to submit any final letter or documentation that would tidy up the submission. That might be a useful way of finalising the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">The Deputy is right in the sense that if at the end of a hearing the solicitor for the applicant were to say that having heard how it went he or she had some extra material, in every case the deciding officer would as a matter of course ask for the material to be submitted by a certain date. If the next day the RLS person were to phone and say he or she had material to show the officer, that would be accepted. We should consider the opposite situation in which somebody manifestly either is entitled to refugee application status or is not. If the case is completely cock-eyed, the idea that somebody has to wait effectively for a fortnight, or seven working days which covers a weekend, before making a decision only adds to the complexity of the case. If one is going to grant status why wait all this time or if it is obvious that one is not going to grant status why wait an extra seven days in case things come through?</p>

          <p eId="para_83">It is another aspect of the tightening up of procedures and the reduction of time and opportunity to ensure the applicant gets a good hearing. We have been talking about months and years of delay in processing applications. A week seems a short time and this is the crux of the issue. The person may not have a solicitor. There may be a few short days remaining to make the final submission that would deal with it because it may well be the end of the road.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">The waiting time has contracted dramatically in the past year. The graph for waiting time is coming down. That is a good thing because if one is getting status one wants to be integrated into Irish society soon and work and look after one's family out of directly provided accommodation and the like. If not, equally, it is in the State's interest to clarify that as quickly as possible. I want a system that works and that works reasonably smartly. I do not want people hanging around in limbo for a long time with people saying they are being given the best and being kept out of work. I simply want a system that works where a decision is made in a reasonably expeditious way. It is in the interest of genuine asylum seekers that their status is recognised quickly. It is clearly in the interest of bogus asylum seekers that the system is ineffective. I favour the genuine asylum seekers.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">This amendment proposes to delete the subparagraph, which is the provision whereby the Refugee Appeals Commissioner is obliged to give the applicant any documents that he receives in the course of his or her inquiries. Again, this would seem to be a retrograde step where the applicant is not informed of what the interviewer knows in terms of documentation. It seems contrary to natural justice. How can one get a fair hearing if someone has a particular form of documentation that may be prejudicial to one's application and it is not communicated? It seems that the applicant is in an invidious position trying to counter an argument that he or she has no opportunity of studying. It seems that is part of the Minister's streaming process to tighten up the interview process. However, is the Minister ensuring that due process is adhered to if documentation is withheld? The effect of this provision is to withhold documents from the applicant such as evidence and information that may have come to light in the course of the interviewer's inquiries.</p>

Instead, they will be allowed due process at appeal stage when they are supplied with the documentation. Surely, it is at the initial interview stage that the proper full hearing should take place. Very few applications are successful at initial hearing, whereas there are two to three times the number of successful applications when it comes to appeal. Part of the reason for that may be that documentation was not available. Up to now the documentation should have been supplied, but was it all supplied?</p>

          <p eId="para_111">We have to be careful about these figures. People can conjure up figures to prove any point. By necessity, the appeals are only concerned with cases that are prosecuted onwards and people are taken seriously. The original applications deal with cases that are put out there for effect. Ones that are appealed are ones in which at least the applicant has some considerable degree of faith. The Deputy is not comparing like with like.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">It does not worry me in the slightest that the success rate from the appeal tribunal is different in any particular category of cases from that at first instance. That only underlines to me the robust independence and the fact that the two groups are not operating some co-ordinated policy. I would be suspicious if there was some mathematical correspondence between the two and people would say that it is a strange coincidence. It underlines the independence of the appeal process in that it is impossible to take out some slide rule and say that it is exactly the same as the initial process. Appeals by definition are those where one party to the decision is dissatisfied with the original result. Unappealed applications are where the applicant accepted the decision from the beginning. There is bound to be variations between the two. It is something people look at and ask if it is significant. In my view it is not significant. If there was a direct linear correspondence between the two processes, I would say there must be some explanation for that. If there is a variance between the two, that underlines the fact that it is a separate independent process conducted by people who are not tick-tacking with each other to arrive at co-ordinated outcomes.</p>

They do their job, knowing there is an appeal process. It would be strange indeed if we said that because many people succeed on appeal, that shows that what the original deciding officers are doing is necessarily defective and that they should bear in mind the outcome of appeals, which are often successful, and therefore soften up or change the approach. If that were to happen, a small number of people would succeed on appeal and it would then be argued that the appeal process was not satisfactory because so few people succeed in it. The Deputy would be waving the opposite statistics at me and saying there is something wrong with the appeal process.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">I have already raised in the Dáil the discrepancy between the number of cases that a member of the tribunal receives and those received by another tribunal member. Some members have not had a single appeal case while others had vast numbers. Some clarification is required regarding the distribution of cases to the various members of the appeals tribunal. It seems that under this legislation the desirable independence of which the Minister has spoken will no longer exist in terms of the appeals tribunal because its review of the applicant's case after it has been refused by the commissioner will be a very limited one.</p>

If an applicant cannot furnish an indication within a three-week period that he or she wishes to continue his or her application or appeal, it is stretching credulity somewhat that a reason that was not apparent at the time should subsequently occur to the applicant or otherwise emerge - likewise in the case of an applicant who applies for asylum and disappears without leaving a contact address.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Yet again the amendments are based on the assumption, which I believe to be mistaken, that open-endedness in these matters is ipso facto fairer to asylum seekers than reasonable but finite periods specified in the Government amendment. I stress the fallacy involved. The only people to profit from open-endedness are those who want to drag out the process as long as possible without regard to the drain on resources and the slowing up of the processing of sincerely made applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">That is the reality. If in any given stream of 100 asylum seekers there are eight to ten bona fide applicants, the State apparatus could find itself spending its time sifting through the other 90 or so, never being able to close them off. When a decision is just about to be made, a solicitor's letter is issued, for example, demanding that the process be revived. Then the whole system grinds to a halt. As I said yesterday, we want people to realise that when they invoke the protection of the Irish State, they must do so in a serious, committed and sustained fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">We would allow someone deemed to have withdrawn his or her application for some extraordinary excuse, for example, being unconscious in hospital during the relevant period, to reapply. The person could start the process again if there were some extraordinary circumstance such as being on a life-support machine in hospital so that everything passed him or her by. In section 17(7) of the Refugee Act 1996 there is a provision that "A person to whom the Minister has refused to give a declaration may not make a further application for a declaration under this Act without the consent of the Minister." That consent could be reviewed judicially if I refused it. For instance, if someone were on the flat of his or her back in hospital receiving treatment throughout the period and came to me afterwards saying that he or she had been deemed to have withdrawn the application and I unreasonably refused leave to reapply, the person could apply for a judicial review.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">I have to give my consent on reasonable grounds. The system is not absolutely impenetrable, but someone who effectively fails to co-operate and play the part would have a significant job explaining what had happened to satisfy me that there was a really good bona fide excuse for the failure. That is how the system would work. If, for instance, I found out that someone had spent three weeks in a psychiatric hospital and was effectively incommunicado, not having known about all those things or been able to deal with them because of something happening, and it turned out that the Refugee Applications Commissioner had deemed the person's application to be withdrawn, I would consent to the person reapplying.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">It is not merely discretion. I must either consent or refuse to consent, but that decision, which would be within the Minister's discretion, can be reviewed judicially. I cannot simply make an unreasonable decision not to consent.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_138">That is undoubtedly some protection, but perhaps we might take the section with which we are currently dealing. The new section gives the applicant three working days to furnish to the Refugee Applications Commissioner an explanation for non-attendance. If that is not forthcoming, the application is deemed to be withdrawn. The timescale is very tight. I suggested 20 days and Deputy McGrath five. In any case, a working week seems the minimum that would be expected and should be given. Three days seems an incredibly tight period. If that timescale is imposed, it seems that one needs another safety valve, and that is the reason I have tabled this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The provision states: "If such reasonable excuse is subsequently furnished the Commissioner may deem the application to have been revived." The Refugee Applications Commissioner, having studied the case, is aware of the position. Somewhere down the line a reasonable excuse may be given and the Refugee Applications Commissioner would be a more appropriate person than the Minister to deal with the matter. Why should the case go to ministerial adjudication when the Minister will have to seek the original documents and study the matter? It would be simpler for the commissioner to revive the application if there were a justifiable reason given for non-attendance and the failure to give an explanation. If the person does not turn up for the interview and then has three days to give a reasonable explanation, how can that happen? Will there be communication? The wording is messy and untidy as it stands. If one wishes to leave in the three-day stipulation, it would be simple to insert a safety net of the nature I describe, which would be appropriate to the process and the manner in which it is currently being conducted, unlike what the Minister proposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I know, that is the point. Effectively the Deputy is talking about a whole month, so that a month would go by before anything could be done, and that is not acceptable. The vast majority of applicants are in touch with other applicants because they may live together and be advised by the same legal services. We envisage that every applicant will understand the rules if Ireland insists on a three-day limit. To some extent this is like introducing the advantage rule in football. One cannot give the advantage rule to the fellow who is responsible for the foul to see if he can do any better. One gives the advantage to the other side. I suggest that, since 53% of people do not show up for interview, that is a message in itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">I will go through what I said yesterday. Such interviews require a good deal of preparation and they frequently require interpreters. The officials must study the files and the country involved since they must be able to ask intelligent questions of the person claiming asylum. A good deal of preparation is necessary in each case. A fortnight's advance notice is required of someone who for some reason is not able to attend. However, if someone does not turn up and gives no explanation, the person has another three days to give a reason - because the train was derailed or the taxi engine burnt out - bearing in mind that he or she is living in Ireland and that the main item in life is to get asylum status in Ireland. The person is not permitted to work and the focus of his or her life must be to get the application through. If it is not, the person is not serious about the persecution in the first place and engaging with the Irish system in the second place.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The rules will be clearly understood. People who do not turn up for interview - the number is currently more than half of applicants, which is a scandal - must realise that if they do not have a bona fide excuse which they communicate within three days, as far as we are concerned, their case is finished and the file is shut. They may have some extraordinary excuse, such as not being present where they were supposed to live, being unaware of the interview, not being able to ring up to cancel or postpone or being prevented from turning up by something on the day. If they have such an excuse and they do not make it within three days, they will be facilitated with the right to reapply provided there is a good faith explanation which is consistent with them carrying out their duty and engaging seriously in the process. They will be entitled to seek the Minister's consent to reapply but with the State having put all this together for them, they will have to explain the no show in convincing terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I want to get across the message that we are not dealing with passive asylum seekers. They take on an obligation to prove their case to us. That is the international law. We provide the venue, the expertise and all the background and translation facilities and bring a lawyer along to the interview to represent them and if they do not show in those circumstances, they must come up with a reasonable explanation within three days. If they do not, we shut the file and the only circumstance in which the matter is reopened is where they apply to the Minister for consent to re-engage with the process, in which case he will make a decision based on reasonable grounds. He will not unreasonably refuse to give consent but the person will have to come up with a credible and convincing explanation as to what happened.</p>

We are streamlining the system by giving the applicant a very short space of time, three days, in which to come up with a reasonable explanation, but the reasonable explanation may be that he or she has not been communicated with. If a reasonable explanation is forthcoming, the person should then go to the commissioner who has been dealing with the case rather than leap-frogging to the Minister to reopen the whole application. That is crazy. It is jumping a number of stages that should not be jumped. This is the right approach and it will only take place if a reasonable excuse is furnished. Why is the Minister not prepared to allow the commissioner the authority to reopen a case after it is deemed to be withdrawn on the grounds outlined in the Bill? That is absurd. This is a very reasonable and helpful amendment. It will only apply to a few cases but it is the commissioner who is most qualified to re-examine those cases he has already examined.</p>

That is what we are offering. People who do not show up, do not telephone to cancel an interview, leave the applications commissioner representative sitting in a room with an interpreter and a lawyer, with all the research having been done, and do not explain the reason they did not turn up will have their files shut at that stage. If they want to start the process again they can do so but they will not be able to wander down to the commissioner to say that their dog got lost or something like that. We do not want to hear that.

          <p eId="para_185">If these two paragraphs were to be removed from the subsection, it would effectively mean the requirement to co-operate with the process would be set at nought. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) allows the commissioner to form the view that an applicant is failing in his or her duty to co-operate with the commissioner or to furnish information relevant to his or her application for a declaration. If somebody is singing dumb and simply giving nonsense answers, not responding to letters, not giving information or giving wholly incredible information about himself or herself, a point must arrive where the commissioner can declare that if the applicant does not indicate that he or she will co-operate, the application will be deemed withdrawn. That is provided for in this paragraph. It allows for formal notification to the person concerned. If it were used unreasonably, I have no doubt that somebody would be down to the High Court to have it quashed instantly. There is always the protection of a judicial review in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">If, on the other hand, somebody is giving different accounts of where they are from - say, Liberia, Ghana or Nigeria - at some stage, the commissioner may say he cannot investigate these claims if mala fide information is being provided by the applicant. In those circumstances, this section provides that the commissioner can serve notice on the person saying they propose to regard them as having withdrawn their application. If the commissioner abused that power in a heavy-handed way, it would be open to all asylum seekers, who have access to legal advice, to go to the High Court immediately to quash the notice on the basis that it was being sent unreasonably. It is not just a matter of me indicating to the committee that this power will only be used reasonably, it is also the case that if it is used unreasonably it will expose the commissioner to judicial review.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The second subparagraph provides for the Minister to notify the commissioner that an asylum seeker is in breach of residence rules or has not given the appropriate address. In practice, where the address has not been given, it probably will be the case anyway that the new procedures will lead to a fairly rapid decision deeming the application to be withdrawn. Under subparagraph (<i>b</i>), if somebody goes on the run or is not known at the address, at some stage somebody has to draw a conclusion as to whether the applicant has gone to ground, disappeared into Irish society, leaving no forwarding address. That is what this is all about.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">The end result of this, therefore, will be that applications will be withdrawn due to people's failure to furnish information in a fairly highly subjective situation. It is one thing for the commissioner to be involved but it is strange that the Minister should notify the commissioner at this stage. What sort of procedure are we talking about? Is the commissioner notifying the Minister and how will the Minister know about a case with which the commissioner is dealing?</p>

          <p eId="para_189">The reception integration agency might say that a party of asylum seekers, who were being accommodated in Tralee, have suddenly disappeared without leaving a forwarding address. At that stage I might use this power to notify the commissioner that the applicants are no longer resident at the address, having left it. Unless they have made some alternative arrangement with the commissioner, at that stage, when they have put themselves beyond her power to communicate with them, she will be in a position to bring the matter to a close, rather than pretend that the matter is still pending.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">In the present situation, applicants may change address not so much with intent to avoid an interview, but to find alternative accommodation for one reason or another. Is the Minister saying that such a situation will not arise in future under the new provisions?</p>

          <p eId="para_191">Direct provision is my intention in all cases from now on but it is not the equivalent of some form of detention. One is legally under a duty to reside at the direct provision address but that does not mean that one commits a criminal offence - or is liable to be arrested or brought back by the Garda Síochána to where one should be - if one goes missing. The Garda Síochána might become aware of when an asylum seeker goes missing and might inform me of the matter. It frequently happens that in the ordinary course of their duties, the Garda Síochána comes across somebody residing somewhere else and would draw it to my attention. In those circumstances, the commissioner would be so informed. The new powers, procedures and policy of direct provision are designed to ensure that for a comparatively short period, which runs to a matter of weeks, somebody resides at the address that is allocated to them. In those circumstances, their application is processed while they are residing there.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The truth is that a large number of people never intend to avail of the direct provision accommodation. They just arrive, make their application and disappear, never intending to process the matter further. There are many such cases where people disappear as soon as they have made an initial contact. They want to establish their status as asylum applicants and disappear. They hope that when they are found, if ever, they will be able to claim they are asylum applicants and presume that there is some process they can pursue. To use a Dublin expression, they will "act the daw", saying they have no idea what is happening and will be passive spectators in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Far be it from me to deny or reject what the Minister says as being anything other than the Gospel truth. How can it happen in the system, however, that somebody arrives and then disappears somewhere if they have made an application for asylum? Where would they go? Would the first step not be that they are looking for rented housing if they do not go into direct provision immediately, although they may do so in future? Would it not be easy to find them within the system because they do not go underground and disappear into the blue? It appears that the system would be able to track them fairly easily.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are putting together a joint policy committee with a view to co-ordinating their activities on asylum seekers. I do not want to contribute to any urban myths by speculating where such people might go. One of the problems is that when applicants dispose of their travel documentation they can invent several personas. Without documentation, for example, an applicant can call himself John Smith, James Smith and John Smithson and nobody knows who he is because there is no objective way of identifying the person, except that on the original asylum application a Eurodac fingerprint has been taken. That is the only basis on which a connection can be made between a person and an application.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I want to be careful about what I say because I do not want it to be suggested I am generalising too much. If one is wholly undocumented, it is easy to recreate oneself as a multiple personality, to process different welfare claims and different employment histories and to be a welfare recipient in one name, an asylum seeker in another name and somebody working in the black economy or whatever in a third name. There is also the possibility that one could go to the United Kingdom. Although we do not know the proportion of the totality they represent, there have been a number of instances of people being detected running double applications for asylum, running multiple persona to exist in both jurisdictions and travelling backwards and forwards on a carousel basis depending on what was happening in either jurisdiction. It is not easy to keep an eye on things, especially when there is a common travel area.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">They will not be untouched by the remainder of the legislation but by the carrier liability provisions. They will be fingerprinted and will have a single identity. There will be a common comparison of asylum seekers' fingerprints between Ireland and the UK under Eurodac. If one exists in both countries, one should be detectable as running two parallel asylum applications. In truth, it is difficult to stop an English asylum seeker residing in Ireland unless one stops him or her at Holyhead or wherever and asks who he or she is on the suspicion that he or she is not documented to come to Ireland. Alternatively, it is almost impossible for me to say of the 53% who do not show for interview and who presumably disappear into the woodwork that a considerable number of them are not going to the United Kingdom and existing there. By definition, we cannot know.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">One of the problems which distinguishes us from the civil law countries in Europe is that if one goes to Luxembourg, one cannot simply rent an apartment as a matter of choice one afternoon. One must go to one's local prefecture with countless documents and photographs of oneself. One must register with the police and so on and establish one's identity. One cannot even open a bank account without huge paper transactions taking place. For instance, Irish civil servants who go to work in Brussels need nine photographs of themselves to engage with the Belgium system. They must inform the local police that they reside in their area. There are all those provisions. This is something——</p>

One simply cannot rent a house in Belgium by walking into an estate agent, plonking down a wodge of cash on the counter and saying one would like to rent a house for the next month. The world does not work in that way.</p>

In other words, the commissioner will assess the situation and will make a judgment on the basis of that assessment. It would give the commissioner some scope in the event of somebody failing to co-operate or to furnish all the information regarded as appropriate. The commissioner could exercise a degree of discretion and flexibility in relation to how he or she deals with the matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_206">This amendment is being opposed for the same reasons as the previous two amendments. As they stand, the provisions of the Bill set out the circumstances which, when present, give rise to a strong indication that the applicant is not co-operating with the asylum process. Ordinary, decent, right-thinking people would say that whenever those indicia are there, steps should be taken to close a case because we cannot throw costly State services at people who have no interest in the claims for protection they have made. What Deputy Costello wants me to do by way of discretion is not to close files on every occasion, but I think they should be closed on every occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The important point about this is that asylum seekers should know that a fairly mechanical sequence follows non-co-operation - in other words, they will not hope against hope that they will fall through the cracks. If they do not co-operate, their files will be closed and they will not be in a position to say, "I thought I was still a pending case". They will get the chance to attend an interview and to respond to this notice. After that, they will know the sequence will be a fairly mechanical one, that is, that their files will be effectively closed, that their status will be decided and that they will be deported when found subject to their right to make humanitarian representations.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I make no secret of wanting a system which asylum seekers know requires their full involvement, that when it is not forthcoming, it responds in a particular way to that situation and that it is not a matter of hoping against hope that the bureaucracy of the State will somehow fail in their cases, that they may fall through the cracks or that their files may sit on a shelf somewhere. They should know that if they do not respond to the notice, their cases are closed and the State will deport them. The result will be that asylum seekers will engage actively with the whole process and that they will not do what some feel there is an advantage in doing, that is, semi-engage, float around the edges of the system and come in and out when necessary to keep the system alive. That ethos will be gone when this comes about. It will favour genuine asylum seekers and will not favour those who are bogus. That is what I am trying to do. That 53% of people who are not showing for interviews will diminish and people will show for their interviews because they will know that the consequences of not showing will be terminal for their cases.</p>

There will be a burden of work on the commissioner if 53% of people do not turn up for interview and they must reply within 15 working days. That is a short period. I understand the Minister increased that in the Seanad. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">The purpose of this amendment is practical and straightforward. The provision will allow the Minister to make regulations for the purpose of setting out the details of the conduct of an interview under section 11. These regulations, to which section 27 of the Act will apply, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the usual way under that section.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">As part of the investigation process under section 11 a variety of types of cases fall to be considered. In some cases, for instance, it becomes clear from a very early stage that the person is a refugee. In these circumstances it should be possible to conduct the interview in such a manner that the case can be expedited without the necessity of a prolonged examination where that is not required. Equally there will be cases where, for example, a person is from a safe country of origin designated under the provisions of the proposed new section 12 to be inserted by amendment No. 46 where, under the proposed new section 11A to be inserted by amendment No. 45, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the person is not in need of protection. In such cases the interview may need to be more focused and structured in such a way that the person is given every opportunity to make his or her rebuttal. Then there is the middle ground between these two where there are no pointers either way on the basis of the application, and the investigation in these cases may need to be more diffuse as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">However, I am satisfied and believe that others such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees share my view that a one-size-fits-all approach to interviews does not necessarily service the applicant in the investigation of his or her claim. This provision will permit the making of regulations periodically which can assist the Refugee Applications Commissioner in dealing with different types of applications. The commissioner must always have regard to his or her general responsibility set out in section 11(1), which is to investigate the application for the purpose of ascertaining whether the applicant is a person in respect of whom a declaration must be given. While regulations to be made under this power may prescribe different procedures for investigations of different types of applications, they cannot compromise that all-important aim. If they did so, the courts would be quick to rule them invalid as being <i>ultra vires </i>the Act. The commissioner must always examine the merits of each case, and this regulation-making power will not change that.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Regarding Deputy Costello's amendment, the conduct of an interview structured to meet the requirements of specific cases under investigation can only assist in the early identification of those requiring protection and the refusal of cases that fall outside the definition of "refugee". The regulation-making power provided in the Government amendment is with a view to making the process of establishing whether a person is a refugee more efficient, and the point of my amendment is to put beyond doubt that regulations will be able to specify differently for different types of cases. Otherwise, I could just rely entirely on the general regulation-making power of section 23 of the Refugee Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">How does the Minister reconcile the requirement in the Geneva Convention that every application must be assessed individually with the fact that he is going to regulate for and prescribe different procedures for different classes? This would appear to strike at the heart and core of the approach that should be taken. Once applications are lumped into classes, it undermines the thrust of what the Geneva Convention specifies in terms of the merits of each individual application. It would appear to go against the spirit and letter of the convention.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I do not accept that. For example, it should be possible under the amendment to differentiate between people from countries that will be designated as safe third countries of origin, which will raise the presumption that the people in question are not victims of persecution. At present, it is not possible to make that claim on the same basis for a European Union member state as it is for many states in the world.

          <p eId="para_233">Maybe so, but at least the common travel area should assure Deputy ÓSnodaigh that anyone from those countries can come and reside here as long as they are not a danger to public order or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">If someone coming from Australia, Canada or New Zealand alleges the state is tyrannical, one must come to a common sense view. Will one deal with that on the same basis as people coming from states that are manifestly tyrannical in their nature? If people examine, on the one hand, the political background of a Third World country that is subject to a dictatorship and which has the international reputation of being cruel and oppressive to its citizens and, on the other, someone coming from Canada, it is reasonable to provide by regulation that the process for examining the political history of both states should be different and that people are not examining American or Canadian history and conducting extensive searches. The issue under the Geneva Convention is the same regardless of whether the person is a refugee.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Regarding the procedure for determining whether it is the case, it would be wasteful of public resources to apply the same procedure to both. I am advised the UNHCR takes the same view, that it is wasteful of resources to treat every highly improbable and objectively incredible claim on the same basis as those which are highly probable and credible when it comes to procedures.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">The Minister's aim up to now has been to produce a streamlined and standardised approach so that anyone who applies for asylum or refugee status will understand the procedure from start to finish, yet if we are to accept the Minister's argument and reject Deputy Costello's amendment we will have different procedures from different people. That removes the presumption that those applying have a case to make and that we, as a host country, must presume the case is valid until it is determined otherwise. Obviously there are what the Minister calls safe countries, yet within many of those there is persecution. It may not be on as wide a scale as some of the countries from which we receive most of our applicants but it exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">If anyone doubts that, I travelled on behalf of the European affairs committee to an annual conference in Brussels on human rights in the EU, at which over 400 pages of documentation were produced which detailed human rights abuses in various countries. Amnesty International also produces a report on all the countries in the world which is very valuable to those working in this area. That report highlights areas where human rights are breached by these safe countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">We should have a standard procedure. Then we could make quicker determinations in the cases of the US and Canada, as information is more easily available than, say, in African countries. One can use a search engine on the Internet to cross-check with organisations in those countries and there is no need for a separate procedure. Ireland could be classed as a safe country in some jurisdictions but that is not to say there has not been persecution of some of our citizens - for instance, the Traveller community might agree with that statement. I am not the one to determine that. I am not saying that it is the same in other countries but a similar situation exists for the Roma gypsies. One reason Romania will not join the EU next year is that it has not reached the required human rights standards. It is the same for Turkey and while that is good, even when those countries have reached the standard necessary there will still be some residual persecution, discrimination or abuse of the human rights of some minorities in those countries. It would be remiss of us to categorise those as safe countries to argue and that there should be a different procedure. We should have a system in place which is standardised and which produces a determination as quickly as possible. I do not see why different procedures should apply.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">I believe in the safe country of origin concept and that it helps focus the mind. Everyone involved in the system gets merit-based consideration. Nobody is simply sent down a blue or green channel because of where they come from and is rejected as a matter of law. In every case there is merit-based consideration. The difference is that in some cases we provide that there is a rebuttable presumption that the state is not an oppressive state, while in other cases there is no such presumption and it is an open issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">It is reasonable to say that if someone comes to Ireland from Sweden they should face the rebuttable presumption that Sweden is not an oppressive state persecuting them. They can have a hearing but they face an uphill task to establish that the Swedish state is persecuting them. In other cases it would be ridiculous to have a presumption that there would not be persecution when we know there would be every likelihood of persecution. That is the difference and it is not unreasonable to have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">We would be unusual internationally in not differentiating between safe countries of origin on the basis of a rebuttable presumption. The UNHCR could have no objection to rebuttable presumption. The safe country of origin concept is recognised by the UK, Holland and Germany and will also be provided for in EU procedures and directives so it is not something public servants in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform dreamed up one morning to make their lives easier. It is the future. It is arriving in Ireland and we must prepare for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">There is no reason the work should not be easier. If one is asked under contract to paint a room and one finds most of it was painted six months earlier, the idea that one sands everything down and starts again may be treating everything evenly——</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I did not question the idea of the safe country, I questioned the idea of a difference in procedure. A safe country means the decision can be made quicker because the Minister for Foreign Affairs can be involved to rule on a declaration being true, for instance. In this case it should not have to be a different procedure, it should be the same procedure but with a quicker determination provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">The amendment provides for the insertion in the Refugee Act 1996 of three new sections dealing with the burden of proof, credibility of the applicant and the duty on the applicant in the investigation of an asylum claim. The new section 11A addresses the question of burden of proof in the asylum process. The UNHCR handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status under the Geneva Convention is a useful publication of high international standing. While it is not binding, its content is generally regarded as being of persuasive authority. At paragraph 196 in the part of the handbook dealing with the principles and methods of establishing the facts in asylum claims, it states:</p>
          <p eId="para_284">It is a general legal principle that the burden of proof lies on the person submitting a claim. . . In most cases, a person fleeing from persecution will have arrived with the barest necessities and, very frequently, without personal documents. Thus, while the burden of proof, in principle, rests on the applicant, the duty to ascertain and evaluate all the relevant facts is shared between the applicant and the examiner.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Refugee Act 1996 has, heretofore, been silent on this question. Practice in the Irish context has generally acknowledged the shared responsibility of the applicant and the RAC in ascertaining the relevant facts. This has, however, been in the context of a statute that so far has not provided for the concept of countries being regarded as safe countries of origin or, in layman's terms, countries that do not generally give rise to valid claims for protection. The amendment seeks to change this position by introducing a means whereby the Minister can designate countries as safe countries of origin. Along with this, it makes provision that the refugee commissioner should also spell out particular types of cases where the general principle recognised by the UNHCR in its handbook should apply. Thus, the new section 11A identifies the circumstances in which the burden of proof, in line with this principle, is to lie on the person submitting the claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The first of these circumstances, in section 11A(1)(<i>a</i>), is where the applicant is from a designated safe country of origin. The next, at paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the same section, will arise where the person has already applied for asylum in another convention country. In either of those cases, there will be a presumption, rebuttable by the applicant, that her or she is not a refugee. If the person comes from a safe country of origin or comes in the context of having applied somewhere else, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the person is not a refugee. The effect of this will not be that a person in either category will never be recognised as a refugee, but rather that such a person will have the opportunity to show whether in his or her particular circumstances there is a well-founded fear of persecution on Geneva Convention grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The Dublin Convention and the EU instrument on the same subject, known colloquially as the Dublin regulation, which will replace it next September, address the issue of the appropriate country to examine a particular asylum claim. Provision for implementing these instruments and for providing for safe third countries are contained in the replacement for section 22 of the Refugee Act in Government amendment No. 60. Subsection (2) of the new section 11A sets out that where the question of transferring an asylum claim from this State to another convention country or a designated safe third country is to be decided, the onus will be on the applicant to show that Ireland is the country that should deal with the application.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The final subsection of the new section 11A spells out in the primary statute that in the situation where, after investigation of the asylum claim, the commissioner makes a negative recommendation and the applicant appeals that to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the onus will be on the appealing applicant to show that he or she is a refugee.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">These statutory clarifications as to where the onus lies in these circumstances are fair and reasonable, and are necessary to ensure that the resources of the commissioner and the tribunal for determining these issues are efficiently deployed so as to facilitate the early recognition of asylum applicants who are refugees in need of Ireland's protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">This amendment also inserts a new section 11B in the Refugee Act 1996 to deal with the issue of assessing the credibility of the applicant. These are matters of real concern. Credibility goes to the core of an assessment of a claim for refugee status. As the UNHCR handbook states at paragraph 41: "an assessment of credibility is indispensable where the case is not sufficiently clear from the facts on record." If someone is untruthful or inconsistent in his or her accounts, it must raise doubts as to the genuineness of the refugee status claim. However, I wish to make it clear that where one of the factors set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>l</i>) of section 11B arises, it is not in itself necessarily fatal to the claim for asylum. The new section merely lists matters to which regard is to be had in the assessment of the applicant’s credibility as part of the investigation for refugee status.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The matters listed are largely a matter of common sense. They cover questions of documentation, where such is available; the reasonableness of not having any, where it is not available; untruths or reluctance to give full details about verifiable matters such as details of the journey to Ireland or the basis for the persecution; whether a previous asylum claim has been withdrawn or let drop; whether the claim has been made in circumstances where it puts a potential deportation on hold; and whether there is evidence of non-co-operation with the asylum process. The weight that should be given to any of these factors is a matter for the person making the assessment, whether that be the commissioner and her staff or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The proposed new section 11C states in statute what is already recognised by the courts as a duty on the applicant to co-operate in the determination of his or her asylum application. In several judgments of the High Court it has been held that the asylum seeker has that duty. I want to make that clear to anyone who reads the law but who does not have access to our case law. Every applicant is told of this requirement in the notice given to him or her under section 11(8) of the Act of 1996 at present, and that will be reinforced by the changes at section 6(<i>c</i>)(ii) of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Subsection (1) clearly states this duty and subsection (2) provides that compliance with this duty requires the applicant to furnish the commissioner or the tribunal with all information in his or her possession, control or procurement relevant to his or her application at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_294">The Minister is imposing a burden of proof and creating a new category of a safe country of origin. This is the Minister's creature and has no stature in domestic or international law to date. He couples this creation with the Dublin Convention. Effectively he is saying that somebody from what he regards or designates as a safe country of origin can seek refugee status. Will he elaborate further on what these countries are and what the criteria will be, or whether he already has a list of countries he will designate under section 12(4)? We see the European Union as a block of countries with a reasonably common set of principles underlying its operation but outside of that what category of countries is the Minister talking about?</p>
          <p eId="para_295">A person is entitled to make an application irrespective of the operation of the DublinConvention. When an asylum seeker arrives in a country he or she is entitled to make a separate application, which would be discussedon its merits. The Minister's amendment will effectively do away with this. While the Minister has given us a comprehensive statement in regard to amendment No. 45, it is a major introduction concerning credibility, the burden of proof, the country of origin and the Dublin Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Will the Minister assure us that we will remain in line with the Geneva Convention if we implement this section? It seems the Minister's amendment departs further from the requirements of that convention in categorising people. It states that if a person is in a particular category we will deal with him or her in a particular fashion. If we can now create this new designation of a safe country then the person is in another category and if he or she is in breach of the Dublin Convention we will not consider the application.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">We have certainly gone considerably along the road towards undermining a simple principle of the Geneva Convention that one does not deal with categories but with individuals, and that each individual application, irrespective of where it comes from, must be dealt with on the basis of its merits, by the country where the asylum seeker is seeking refuge. The thrust of this amendment is in the opposite direction.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_171">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_298">With regard to the last amendment, all applicants have the right to have their request determined on the basis that they make the application. I am concerned that the concept of a safe country would take away some of the rights of an applicant to be dealt with on an individual basis as per the universal declaration of human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">There are one or two other points. The Minister quoted the UNHCR handbook. In regard to 11C it suggests the addition of a paragraph at the end to state that the following conditions should be met: the applicant should make a genuine effort to substantiate his or her claim; all available evidence should be obtained and where possible checked; and the examiner should be satisfied that the applicant's statements are coherent and plausible and do not run counter to generally known facts relevant to his or her case. The applicant will be granted the benefit of the doubt. This is a general principle of international law and is reflected in the UNHCR handbook - paragraphs 203 and 204. That might add to what the Minister is trying to produce here.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Section 11B(<i>c</i>) states that the applicant must provide a full and true explanation of how he or she travelled to or arrived in the State. The UNHCR states that in general travel and arrival are not material to refugee status determination and therefore should not form the sole basis of credibility assessment. We need to be careful on that one. I suggest an amendment to state that it may be just one point but not the only point under which a determination is made. Sometimes asylum seekers lodge applications in another country and flee or move from that country for various reasons. It should not be the sole determining factor in deciding on their application.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_172" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_301">It seems it is common sense that we should try to prioritise and sort out by category those people coming from different States. I emphasise that every case is given a hearing on its merits. I emphasise that in establishing an obligation to participate in the process, as far as I am concerned, that obligation already exists as a matter of judge-made law and I want to make it clear that it applies as a matter of statute law.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">On the question of the accelerated procedures for people coming from safe countries of origin, it seems this is simple common sense and that it should be the law in Ireland. We would be foolish not to have it as part of our law.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">It has been said that the fact that one has applied for asylum status in another Geneva Convention country should not be pertinent to whether one is viewed in Ireland as a valid asylum seeker. If one has a good reason, having applied in one country, one went to another country, that will be taken into account by the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in relevant cases. If one is in the business of making applications which are not proceeding and substituting an application in one country for another, there is a very strong presumption that one has made at least one application without an intent to prosecute it to a finish. That has to raise the question as to whether the applicant is just forum shopping and country shopping rather than genuinely seeking to avoid persecution and applying for protection in the first safe place. The proposal as contained in the legislation is reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">On the proposed section 11B, it is the case that some people - I fully accept this - will find themselves either undocumented or badly documented if they are fleeing persecution. I have no doubt about that. If a person has no passport, it is highly unlikely that he or she would apply to the foreign affairs department of a state that was persecuting him or her, with a view to obtaining a passport, if he or she were in genuine fear of his or her life.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">On the other hand, it is the case that people come to Ireland via the United Kingdom, use a passport to get into the United Kingdom, travel through the common travel area, get to Dublin and then announce that they have no papers. They are willing to get as far as England by using regular papers, presuming they are not travelling on a forgery, and second, when they get to England, they travel on to Ireland using the common travel area. To make it impossible to establish their movements and their identity, they throw the passport in a bin. Ireland is faced with a person claiming to be the person he or she is but who has thrown away any real evidence of identity. Inquiries that could be made about the person in the ordinary course of events, as to his or her background, become all the more difficult because the Irish authorities are effectively confronted with a wholly undocumented person. If the latter was the motive to obscure one's background, to make it possible to make claims about oneself, such as claims that one was in a political movement, when the truth is that one was a jailbird or whatever in the country in question, a person can destroy all documentation and present himself or herself using a brother's or cousin's name or whatever. If that is the purpose, that raises the issue of the person's credibility, and there is no point in pretending it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Likewise, there is a doctrine that in certain circumstances people who have come to the country illegally will be, for perfectly legitimate reasons, unwilling to specify exactly how they got here for fear of exposing to punishment other people who assisted them. I can see that argument but there are many cases where people effectively avail of those notions to create a complete impenetrable bush around themselves and the thicket of assertions made by them means that nobody can ever get to the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">This Bill will provide criteria of credibility which are not in any sense mandatory in the sense that failure to pass one of these criteria will result in rejection of the application. These are criteria which by statute an officer of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or a member of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal will be able to have regard to without being told afterwards that the case was ultra vires and not within the purview of the legislation, and the applicant could say: "You should never have asked me any questions about my destroyed documentation or you should never have asked me about the fact that I had made a previous application - that was a wrong thing to take into consideration."</p>
          <p eId="para_308">One of the principles regarding the Irish law of judicial review and the Irish law relating to whether people are acting lawfully <i>intra vires </i>or <i>ultra vires </i>in an administrative or quasi-judicial process and one of the criteria that the law lays down is whether they had regard to matters which were extraneous to their consideration. When one is assessing an individual’s credibility, does one believe the account they are giving or is it all cock and bull? It is frequently the position that somebody deciding one of these cases must make a decision because he is looking at an improbable case, but on the other hand it could be true. In those circumstances, the deciding officer must come to a view on the credibility of what he or she hears.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Section 11B provides that in the examination of credibility regard may be had to these issues. They do not determine anything and it does not mean that people are lying and should not be believed because they destroyed their documentation or because they made false representations earlier. It does not mean that this should not be done as soon as possible. The mere fact of a delay does not indicate somebody is lying on the merits of his or her case. However, these issues and failure to co-operate are ones to which a deciding officer may have regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">While I acknowledge that the UNHCR says that the facts about the journey to Ireland are not relevant to the central question of whether the person is a refugee, I do not accept that a deciding officer has to determine that all such issues are irrelevant, that no attention should be paid to them and that they cannot be allowed to influence the officer's view of the applicant because there is no statutory basis for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">If an applicant was asked how he or she got to Ireland and said he or she had come to Dublin Airport and took the train to the city centre, it is known he or she is lying on basic detail, which is irrelevant to his or her claim. In deciding who is credible and who is incredible, from my days as a barrister I know that it is frequently from matters of small detail extraneous to the central issue of a case that it is possible to sort out who is credible and who is willing to commit perjury. Although it is not a courtroom procedure, the same has to apply to somebody conducting a searching examination of an application. If an officer finds that constantly coming up on the radar screen are small lies on peripheral matters, it must be open to the officer to make some inference from that as to the credibility of the applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">We must make it clear beyond doubt that under the law in Ireland there is a duty to co-operate. People cannot believe they can come here and be marginal participants in a process, which the State sets in train for them. Lawyers advising them must indicate they have a duty to co-operate and in certain circumstances to take on the onus of proof. On Report Stage I may raise the issue of people raising at appeal matters with which we might reasonably have expected them to deal at first instance. That frequently happens and a completely different story is told at appeal from what is raised at first instance. Whereas it is not beyond the bounds of possibility for somebody to tell a lie and have a Pauline conversion to the truth on appeal, it is also the case that an applicant whose first story fell apart and was disbelieved might try to assemble a completely inconsistent but on the face of it more credible story the second time around to get out of the hole they dug for themselves on day one.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">These are in effect methods to strengthen the hand of the investigative process and to assist in the process of distinguishing between credible and incredible, between bona fide and mala fide applications. These are urgently needed changes to our law.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">The two major proposals here relate to the safe country of origin. I asked the Minister to indicate the countries he has decided to designate as safe countries of origin and the criteria used. Under the Dublin Convention if a prior application has been made, the applicant shall be presumed not to be a refugee unless he or she can show reasonable grounds. The UNHCR specifically asks that that section be deleted.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Page 4 of the UNHCR document deals with amendment No. 12, burden of proof. The UNHCR does not agree that the mere fact that an applicant had lodged a prior application for asylum should automatically lead to a presumption that the applicant is not a refugee as there might be valid reasons that he or she has left the State. It goes on to urge the deletion of lines 3 to 5 on page 11. This would indicate that the UNHCR sees this as contrary to the Geneva Convention in that there may be grounds in which a second application could be lodged.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">For example if people travel between the two islands here it would not necessarily indicate they were country shopping so to speak. Asylum seekers arriving in the Irish or British jurisdiction might suddenly realise the ease of travel between the two countries. If they are genuinely fleeing persecution and genuinely anxious to get refuge in a country that is English speaking, they might like to hedge their bets by having applications in two countries.</p>

Stating, "shows reasonable grounds for the contention that he or she is a refugee" effectively rules out the possibility of that situation occurring. The Minister has stated his intention to eliminate all these secondary applications, so to speak. That is fine in a sense, but it is contrary to the UNHCR's rules. The UNHCR does not agree. It states that under the 1951 convention, it should not automatically lead to a presumption. The Minister is automatically presuming that the applicant is not a refugee and the UNHCR disagrees with him on this matter. I ask him to respond to that and to the safe country designation. I am not aware that any other jurisdiction has this clause. The Minister has told us that the European Union already has the carrier liability. What is the position with regard to the "safe country" concept? Has it any status in international law? Surely, it does not arise under the Geneva Convention? What is the Minister's source for this designation and what are the criteria for such designation of a country?</p>

This sets out the criteria to which, having consulted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I must have regard. One criterion is whether the country concerned is party to, and generally complies with, obligations under the convention against torture of the international covenant on civil and political rights and, where appropriate, the European Convention on Human Rights. A second criterion is whether the country has a democratic political system and an independent judiciary. A third criterion is whether the country is governed by the rule of law. Those are criteria which would distinguish most democracies from other countries.</p>

A fascinating aspect of the decision of the United Nations Commission in Geneva is that the great majority of the states involved would not accord a jury trial to anybody in any of those circumstances. The commission, in its wisdom, decided that our method of differentiating between cases which do or do not get a jury trial was unfair. What fascinates me is that while most of those involved are totally ignorant of jury matters, they presume to lecture us on our selection process. Our Special Criminal Court, for which I have great respect, is fairer in its procedures than nearly all their non-jury courts - they do not have juries. It is extraordinary that people should lecture us on our selection processes, although their own arrangements do not remotely approach our position in terms of civil liberties. It appears to be the modern approach that one is subject to judgment by people whose standards are far lower than one's own in many respects and one has to take it on the chin and move on.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">The United States is a friendly country. The Deputy should address his amendments. I was asked what is a safe country of origin. I have referred to the concept which I believe exists. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees may be uncomfortable with that proposition, but that is the direction in which Ireland and the European Union are going. The UNHCR is not opposed to the concept of designating safe countries of origin for procedural purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I wish to come to another point raised, that in some sense people will be denied their rights. That is not the case. One is not deemed not to be a refugee, one is presumed not to be a refugee. That presumption means that one must, by some affirmative evidence, displace a presumption that if one has applied elsewhere, but has not proceeded with that application, one is under an onus to provide a credible excuse as to the reason that is so and that if one does not comply in that regard, one will fail. Such a rebuttable presumption is not a form of rubber stamp whereby one faces an impossible task. It requires one to undertake an onus of strong explanation as to the reason the circumstances outlined have come into being.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I wish to make it very clear that the burden of proof generally lies on persons making a claim. In this case, however, if one is running two parallel asylum applications, I suggest it is perfectly reasonable to require a satisfactory explanation for that state of affairs, failing which it will be presumed that the person concerned is not an asylum seeker. The person will be given a full opportunity to rebut the presumption and to show, on the merits of the case, that he or she is in fear of persecution or whatever. However, if a person is running horses in two races at the same time, we will presume that they are not eligible to win in our race. That is the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Deputy Costello referred to the position of a person who comes to Ireland and later finds that he or she can go to England. If one comes to Ireland and applies for asylum status, one may not leave Ireland without the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the circumstances the Deputy mentioned, all those concerned who go to the United Kingdom are in breach of the law. They came here on the basis of seeking asylum in Ireland and one of their undertakings in that regard was that they would not leave Ireland without the permission of the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">No. The requirement is that an asylum applicant shall not leave the State without the permission of the Minister. That is one of the rules - one must remain within the jurisdiction during the entire period one's application is being processed. A person in that position who goes to Britain without the Minister's permission will already have been warned of the consequences. This is not just a provision sitting in a statute book - people are given a leaflet setting out the terms under which they are allowed to apply for asylum status in this country. It is made clear they need not apply if they do not wish to do so but that if they apply, they must remain in this country unless they get the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to leave. There is no existing right to go on one's holidays to the Costa Brava or to England in search of a somewhat more amenable system of asylum seeking - people may not do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I believe so. This underpins the Dublin Convention in that when a person goes to a particular country and makes an asylum application, he or she is required to remain there rather than wander around the world making other applications and considering other options. If one is claiming the protection of the Irish State, one must be serious about it. One of the terms by which we determine whether the person is serious is on the basis of whether he or she is willing to agree to a condition that he or she must remain here until his or her application is fully processed. That is our law, which I do not regard as onerous.</p>

There is a Europe-wide system whereby it can be checked whether a person has applied in more than one jurisdiction. Between Ireland and the United Kingdom a common travel area exists, which is obviously vulnerable, but we have to have it due to the all-island dimension. It is very much in our interests that the area should continue to exist. It is a myth that it is somehow lawful for an asylum seeker to travel to the United Kingdom having applied for refuge here.

          <p eId="para_399">This amendment is referred to at No. 13 on the explanatory memorandum. It replaces the current section 12 which deals with manifestly unfounded applications. This matter will now be encompassed by the new section 13 according to the provisions of amendment No. 47. Amendment No. 46 provides that the Minister may direct the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to accord priority to certain classes of asylum applications according to criteria set out in proposed sections 12(1)(<i>a</i>) to 12(1)(<i>n</i>), inclusive. It allows also for designation by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of certain countries as safe third countries. To provide the committee with a better flavour of this amendment and of the way in which it fits into the overall scheme of things, it is necessary to advert in general terms to the content of Government amendments we have not yet reached. I ask the Chairman’s indulgence to refer forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Amendments Nos. 46, 47, 50, 56 and 57 offer a complete replacement of the current provisions of the Refugee Act 1996 for the foreshortened investigation of certain applications. The replacement scheme provides for the prioritisation of applications at first instance by reference to a range of criteria and for the acceleration of the appeals process for negative recommendations at first instance which have certain characteristics. The provisions of the 1996 Act imply a foreshortened first instance investigation process for an application which comes within one of the categories set out in section 12(4) of the Act at present and a recommendation under the section by the Refugee Applications Commissioner to the effect that the applicant should not be declared to be a refugee. Such a recommendation can be appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, but the appeal must be made within ten working days rather than within the usual 15 working days. The appeal will be determined on the papers with no oral hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The tribunal, under the present section 16(2) of the 1996 Act may affirm the commissioner's recommendation that an application is manifestly unfounded or set it aside to be sent back to the commissioner for investigation. A difficulty with these provisions is that it is often not possible to determine whether an application comes within the categories in section 12(4) of the 1996 Act until it has been fully investigated. The power on appeal to remit such a case for a second full investigation can lead to a duplication of work for the commissioner and, possibly, for the tribunal if the matter is further appealed after a negative recommendation following the second investigation. The procedure is not really an accelerated one. If an applicant whose application is manifestly unfounded appeals, it means that a process which was meant to fast-track weak cases will turn out to be even slower when addressing cases which were slightly more complex than was imagined.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The proposals of amendments Nos. 46, 47, 50, 56 and 57 are designed to replace the above provisions with new arrangements which have a number of significant features. They provide for a priority investigation of selected classes of applications at first instance. A power is provided to allow the Minister to designate the classes for priority treatment. Selection for priority treatment at first instance does not carry any implication as to the soundness or otherwise of the basis of the application. Selection for priority treatment does not mean anything less than a full examination of the merits of each case, which is a point worth stressing. It represents an important departure from the implication if not necessarily the practice of the present section 12.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Minister is to have the power to designate for priority investigations applications relating to safe countries of origin and to designate such countries with regard to the criteria set out. Following full investigation of an application as a priority or in the ordinary course, the commissioner produces a report which sets out the findings of the investigation and recommends whether the applicant should or should not be declared to be a refugee. If the report of an investigation with a negative recommendation includes a finding of the kind set out in section 13(6) of the 1996 Act, any appeal will be dealt with in an accelerated manner. The time for making an appeal in such a case will be ten working days rather than the normal 15, as is the case in manifestly unfounded cases. The appeal will be made on the papers only and no oral hearing will be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The findings set out at the new section 13(6) of the 1996 Act proposed in Government amendment No. 47 are broadly comparable with, though, in particular because these findings would apply only after the negative recommendation has been made following investigation of the claim to establish whether the applicant is a refugee, not necessarily equivalent to, certain of the "manifestly unfounded" criteria under the current procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Minister may direct that certain classes of cases be dealt with under a special procedure with the following features: applicants whose cases are to be dealt with under this procedure are to be notified at the start of the investigation that their cases are being dealt with in this way; and, if, following investigation, the commissioner makes a negative recommendation and the application has one of the characteristics set out in new section 13(6), any appeal against the recommendation must be made within four working days from the recommendation, as opposed to ten working days for other such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The Refugee Appeals Tribunal's power to remit certain cases will no longer exist and, accordingly, the tribunal may not set aside the commissioner's negative recommendation unless it is satisfied that the applicant is a refugee. It must, therefore, address the merits of the issue on the appeal. The tribunal will, as a matter of priority, deal with cases having one of these characteristics in advance of other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">These provisions could lead one to ask what the proposal is designed to do. From now on, it will be possible to designate classes of cases according to their nature or country of origin, to have a fast-track appeal and for the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to prioritise such hearings. A person with a manifestly unfounded case, as we might describe it colloquially though not legally, will, therefore, find himself or herself brought to the top of the queue to be dealt with. In addition, we will no longer have circumstances whereby such persons will be sent back if their case is found not to be manifestly unfounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">One of the criteria for the prioritisation of an application is the likelihood that it is well-founded. Therefore, a person who enters the country with a weak case will not be able to go through the procedure and rely on it to allow him or her to stay here for two to three months, depending on the state of play at the time. Likewise, the proposal aims to preclude persons with a weak case from trying, on realising there is a backlog of two or three months in the Refugee Applications Commission or Refugee Appeals Tribunal, to stay here for two or three months or, with good luck on their part, six months, despite having an unstateable case.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">We are proposing to bring about circumstances in which a person in this category, that is, where there are good reasons to suspect that he or she is going through the motions to get a foothold in Ireland for the purpose of disappearing or other reasons, will face a regime in which he or she will be brought to the top of the queue at first and second instance, dealt with quickly and his or her case dispensed with, on a full hearing of the merits at both levels, on a priority basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It will also be possible to extend this procedure from cases which do not appear to be well-founded to those which do not appear from the written application to be stateable cases. Currently, when such cases are declared by the Refugee Applications Commissioner to be manifestly unfounded, the applicant may appeal and if the decision is reversed, he or she may start the process again and obtain considerable mileage from it. Essentially, we are proposing a system in which it is possible to give priority to bogus or apparently bogus cases. In other words, people who believe they can stay here for a number of months on the basis of producing a flimsy and bogus case will find that the system will respond to their case by giving them priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The obverse side of this coin is that persons who are obviously refugees and have clear cases do not find themselves having to go through the procedures and will also be prioritised. If, for instance, we are aware of a genocidal conflict in Rwanda and an aeroplane full of Rwandans arrives in Dublin and it is manifestly clear that they will be given refugee status, they will be brought to the top of the queue, pushed through the system, given refugee status and allowed, effectively, to participate and integrate in society, get jobs and residency permits and make plans accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The section is a recognition that the current system does not allow adequate prioritisation, either for manifestly well-founded or manifestly unfounded cases. It offers a way to sort out the sheep from the goats and give the former the priority to which they are entitled and the latter the priority their cases require.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_414">In this section, the Minister proposes procedures for prioritising cases through a process which would not, perhaps, adequately deal with the substance of the applications in question. In other words, the system of procedures will take first rank in terms of prioritisation, whereas in the Geneva Convention the merits of the application receive first rank in terms of priority. The amendment proposes to prioritise the merits of the procedures. I accept, however, that the UNHCR is not dissatisfied with some of the proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Minister is assuming the responsibility and discretion for directing the commissioner and tribunal on this matter. It is difficult to envisage how the proposals will work out in practice given that it would be difficult to be able to come to a conclusion on many of the conditions. For example, with regard to the criterion that a case may be prioritised where applicants have made false or misleading misrepresentations, how will one ascertain whether this is the case before the commissioner has had an opportunity to examine the application in question?</p>
          <p eId="para_416">In section 12(1) it is proposed that, where the Minister considers it necessary and expedient to do so, he or she may "give a direction in writing to the Commissioner or the Tribunal or to both requiring either or both of them, as the case may be, to accord priority to certain classes of applications." The Minister is putting the cart before the horse. One cannot decide on prioritisation until a substantial examination of the merits of the individual case has been completed. The only person who can decide on the merits of a case is the independent commissioner and, subsequently, the tribunal. The proposal would place the reins of prioritisation in the Minister's hands and allow him to decide who are the sheep and goats, thus removing a major part of the functions of the tribunal and commissioner. In doing so, it allows him to take a number of decisions integral to the work of the commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The range of conditions for prioritisation include the country of origin of the applicant, any family relationship between applicants, the dates on which the applications were made, considerations of national security and thelikelihood that applications are well-founded. Frequently one must wait until a substantial examination of a case has taken place before one knows whether an application is well-founded.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Other conditions include whether there are special circumstances regarding the welfare of applicants, whether applications do not show on their face grounds for the contention that the applicant is a refugee and whether applicants have made false or misleading representations. This <i>prima facie </i>evidence will not be immediately available in most cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">A further condition refers to whether applicants have lodged prior applications - it will be some time before this information is available. Section 12(1)(l) of the new section to be inserted states that priority may be accorded to certain classes of applicants by reference to whether applications under section 8 were made at the first available opportunity after arrival in the State. I do not see why this constitutes a reason for prioritisation. Section 12(1)(<i>m</i>) states that reference will be made to the matter of whether applicants or foreign nationals have a right of residence in a foreign country designated as safe under the new section.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">There will be a considerable lapse before the Minister can decide on the prioritisation procedure referred to in the Bill. It is impossible to see how prioritisation can be achieved without first considering applications, during which it would become apparent whether some person or group of persons should be afforded priority status. Under the legislation, as it stands, people will be put into categories into which they do not fit and they will be prioritised for the wrong purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">Suppose a foreign language student - who has been in the State for three years and who has outstayed his welcome - is approached by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and informed that he has been in the State for three years, that his residency entitlements have expired and that it is time to go home, that student might decide to make an asylum application. However, he would be in a different category from somebody who has just rushed into the country claiming he or she has been suffering persecution in another country. If a person has lived here for three years without having said a word about his having been persecuted he or she is in a different category.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Deputy Costello should note that there is no sense in which prioritisation changes the onus of proof. This is not like the matter we were dealing with previously - there is no presumption in these cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">That involves the Minister making a decision by reference to something which, in his view, involves a prioritisation. However, "priority" only refers to the order in which the RAC does its business. If 300 Canadians come here on a plane and state that Canada is a tyranny and I give a direction that they are to be prioritised, it does not mean that their hearing will be different to that pertaining to others from different countries of origin - they will all get a hearing on the merits of their cases. I am looking at the matter from an outside-the-box, political point of view and I have to be in a position to say if a case will cause a problem and that we should deal with the people in question immediately. The integrity of our system would ordain that they not be simply made join the queue to be dealt with when everybody else is dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">Yes. I have to be in a position to deal with all eventualities on the basis of what is happening. The RAC is supposed to comprise an independent group of people who are supposed to carry out examinations of cases that come before them. They are not expected to constantly inform the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about where each group of applicants comes from, be it Australia, New Zealand or wherever. They are not supposed to devise policy on the system but to carry out a function that is given to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">My officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are in touch with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and we are examining trends relating to the countries from which people are coming and identifying new areas of persecution. If 1,000 women came from Islamic countries claiming that they were at the receiving end of threats of honour killings, somebody would have to take an overall view of the matter and decide whether this case should be dealt with immediately or whether the women in this new category of claims should simply be placed at the end of the queue. Prioritising is merely the giving of a direction that certain people are to be brought to the front of the queue and given exactly the same treatment as they would otherwise be expected to receive.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">I have a problem with the list of matters by reference to which priority can be given to certain classes of applicant - it could lead to the prioritisation of everybody. If there were an accelerated process by which the Minister prioritised people on the basis of paragraphs (<i>e</i>) or (<i>f</i>), for example, would this have an effect on the applicants in that they have the burden of proof, given that it can take a while to prepare one’s case? If they are accelerated to the top of the list to be dealt with urgently, would this impinge upon the time they have to prepare their cases?</p>
          <p eId="para_429">In deciding whether to make an order under the new section 12(4)(<i>a</i>), the new section 12(4)(<i>b</i>)(i) states that the Minister shall have regard to, “whether the country is a party to and generally complies with obligations under the Convention Against Torture, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and, where appropriate, the European Convention on Human Rights.” A country either complies with its obligations under these conventions or it does not and therefore the word “generally” should be removed from the paragraph.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) also states that, in deciding whether to make an order under section 12(4)(<i>a</i>), the Minister shall have regard to whether the country is “governed by the rule of law.” The rules of law by which Saddam Hussein or Hitler governed their countries are not ones that we would like. The UNHCR uses a definition which should be included in this case. It deems a safe country of origin to be one that is governed by the rule of law, which observes the right to liberty and security of the person, the right to recognition as a person before the law and equality before the law, and which provides for generally effective remedies against violations of these civil and political rights and, where necessary, for extraordinary remedies. This would allow our legislation fall into line with the UNHCR designation guidelines, which necessitate that a country have a democratic political system and independent judiciary but also that its rule of law complies with the general norms of the criteria outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">The new section 12(1) involves the Minister's giving, on an ongoing basis, directions in writing to the commissioner or tribunal, or both, requiring either or both of them, as the case may be, to accord priority to certain classes of applications by reference to all the matters designated under the subsection.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">Why not do it the other way around? The Minister has charged certain independent people to deal with applicants, interview them and decide on their cases. Why could he not draw up a regulation that would dispense with the need for individual notifications in writing and say to the commissioner and the tribunal that, if the conditions listed in the legislation are fulfilled, they should be prioritized? How will the Minister be able to make the decision before the commissioner or tribunal? Rather than have written communication between the Minister and the commissioner, I would have thought the Minister would have told the commissioner and the tribunal to prioritise such cases. Why should there be an interjection from the Minister in the matter? The Minister will have to exercise discretion in cases when he or she is in possession of less information than the commissioner. The Minister will have to go through the list of considerations that are, essentially, part of the commissioner application, interview and determination process.</p>

If we were all agreed that Norway, for example, was a safe country of origin and I declared this to be the case, I could tell the commissioner to give priority to all cases of people from Norway. Likewise, if there was a civil war in Norway in which people were being butchered and the country was not a safe country of origin, I could ask that those coming from Norway be given priority and allowed to come to Ireland as refugees and to work and support themselves.</p>

People can be querulous, quarrelsome and argumentative. It is a difficult one with which to deal. With insulting behaviour, it is new to the list of definitions included in the previous legislation. Rather than automatically qualifying as disorderly conduct, it should be defined as behaviour that could lead to disorderly conduct. The Bill states that "disorderly conduct" means "any unreasonable behaviour by a person on a licensed premises which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to cause injury, fear or distress". It should not be taken that quarrelsome behaviour falls into that category, but it could. My amendment would cover that and make the provision more effective.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">Deputy Costello is taking the opposite tack, he is trying to make these the necessary exemplars of such conduct.

Being quarrelsome is such a normal part of human behaviour that it is not exclusive to a public house, it happens regardless of whether alcohol is consumed. It is not good to introduce behaviour in the Bill that is broad in its interpretation - "violent", "threatening", "abusive" and "insulting" are more clearly defined. "Quarrelsome" is open to many interpretations inside and outside a public house and it might be better if it was not specified in the legislation. The Minister should think about this because a Minister who gives as good as he gets could be deemed quarrelsome from time to time.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">Hoteliers asked what would happen if there is a counter in the corner of a room of a hotel where a wedding is taking place. They wanted to know if that would be considered the bar of the hotel. They said that if that was the case, children attending weddings and functions would be out of the equation. In amendment No. 30, rather than amending the definition of "bar", we are expressly providing for the family issue raised by hoteliers. If children are at a private function in a room in a hotel which would not ordinarily be described as the bar, the presence of a counter will not mean a criminal offence could be committed, whether, for legal purposes, that room would constitute a bar on another occasion.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">To some degree, but the definition of "bar" is extremely broad. I do not know if that is the intention. It means "any open bar or any part of the licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor". That is clear, it is a fixed place. The section then goes on to include "any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public;". The Minister may say that is contained in the 1988 Act but, nevertheless, it is very broad.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_263" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_488">The problem here is that we are using the same definition for different purposes. If we are describing a bar for the purpose of deciding what is the bar of a hotel, one description applies. Someone suggested, and I considered it fanciful, that the reception desk in a hotel could have drink served across it and it would be considered a bar, but the case law would not follow that line of interpretation.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Taking the first three lines, a nightclub could argue that it is not a bar at all, that the main purpose of the premises is dancing and that drinking is entirely peripheral. In those circumstances we must say that if drink is served over a counter, it is a bar, regardless of the fact that 90% of the activity taking place is dancing.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">This is a complex area and I do not wish to get bogged down in it. If I changed the definition of "bar", I would create massive loopholes. Practically any premises which is not mainly used for the purpose of consumption of alcohol could arrange itself on a temporary basis as a bar and escape the law in its entirety. It is a minefield but I intend to address hoteliers' concern with amendment No. 30 and leave things as they are.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">Yes, but drunkenness is only one aspect of that. I would not be attracted to that amendment. I ask the committee to note that paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>), about permitting drunkenness to take place in the bar or admitting any drunken person to the bar, apply to the bar of a premises rather than a hotel or somewhere else on a premises. One could permit a drunken guest in a hotel to go to bed, and it is not an offence to permit, for instance, drunkenness in a private dining room in a hotel. It is only drunkenness in the bar that we are dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">It would be an offence, under paragraph (<i>a</i>) to give more drink to a drunk in a private dining room or to permit a person to consume intoxicating liquor, but the mere fact that somebody is drunk in one’s hotel premises does not constitute an offence. It is only in the bar of a hotel that the more serious provisions, paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>), come into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Paragraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) require people to regulate their bars in the same manner as one would expect a publican to regulate his bar, even if it is a bar in a hotel, and not allow people to be drunk on their premises. I remind people of the definition of drunkenness in the Bill. It no longer applies to somebody whose intellectual capacity is significantly impaired, as it was when the heads were published. One has to be intoxicated to such as extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger himself or herself, or any other person. One needs to be decidedly drunk before this offence kicks in. Just being merry, boisterous or a bit drooly or incoherent of speech is not drunkenness.</p>

Yet, as we know, in many cases in public houses the licensee may not actually be on the premises. Can an agent or person appointed to act on behalf of the licensee conduct all kinds of administration within the public house or does this just refer to the licensee?

          <p eId="para_514">Licensees have been made criminally liable for a long time, and there is a consistent body of case law to the effect that a licensee commits an offence if any person to whom he delegates his functions or his employee acting within the scope of his or her duty does so. One cannot escape one's liability by going off on a holiday and leaving a manager in charge. If, say, a licensed premises was divided into the four zones, the mere fact that the licensee could not physically see what was happening in all of them does not let him off the hook.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">This matter was raised in the Seanad and I referred Senators to Mr. James Woods' book <i>Liquor Licensing Law in Ireland</i>, third edition, which contains a long description of the case law in relation to that.

If the licensee reported to the Garda that a man had tried to get into his or her premises four times and was loitering around the front, the Garda could arrest the person because there would be reasonable cause to suspect him or her of being guilty of such an offence.

          <p eId="para_531">The purpose of section 8(1) is to strengthen the hand of licensees with their customers. They can warn a customer to stop provoking other customers with the threat of calling the Garda and arresting the customer. It is an alternative to saying that the person shall leave the premises on being requested to do so and not re-enter. It enables a licensee to threaten to call the Garda. Maybe in practical terms it is more likely that the licensee would tell the person to get out and the person would leave and that would be the end of the story. If, for whatever reason, the licensee thought that to put a group of football supporters out was not practical in the circumstances he or she might threaten to call in the Garda to arrest the ringleader who was behaving badly.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">This is an important amendment because it deals with the offences with which we are concerned. If a publican is guilty of one of these offences, it is mandatory that there shall be, in addition to any penalty imposed by the court, an order for the closure of the premises, in this section referred to as a temporary closure order. This means that if, for any reason or under any circumstances, the licensee permits drunkenness or disorderly conduct, or it occurs on the premises and is not dealt with in a satisfactory manner, the premises will be closed for a period. While the length of the period is not important, given the nature of the offences, the effect of this penalty appears to be harsh for a first offence. The same penalty applies in the case of the much more serious and, in my view, criminal offence of serving alcohol to a minor.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The definition of "drunkenness" and "disorderly conduct" is broad. Such offences should not incur the same severe penalty in the first instance. The closure of premises is a serious matter. Notification must be displayed on the premises, making it also a public affair. The penalty of closing a premises because of an offence in the first instance is harsher than it need be. The amendment proposes that a temporary closure order for a period not exceeding seven days should be applied to the second and not the first such offence. Amendment No. 8 follows the same pattern.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_314" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_552">The purpose of this section is to bring back to publicans a sense of obligation in respect of intoxication and public order on their premises. It is to make clear that the public now looks to them in a way it is have never done before, even though publicans always had a duty in this area. The public is now serious about them complying with their obligations. There has been a tendency on the part of publicans, especially those with larger premises, to exercise little control over who is drinking the drink they serve through a network of lounge staff and to take little moral responsibility for what happens on their premises or to their patrons.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">There was strong support for this measure on Second Stage. Publicans must now realise it is a serious business to allow somebody to be drunk on their premises. If a publican is caught in such a position, there will be consequences. It would be open to the District Court to apply the Probation of Offenders Act where it finds the facts proved but decides not to proceed to a conviction for a trifling and inconsequential offence. I state this in case anyone believes this will produce harsh results, even in cases which are more theoretical than real.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">However, if, as Deputy Costello suggests, we provide that pubs will be closed for only the second offence, then those publicans who were not guilty of a first offence would not be deterred by this provision. This would be difficult for me to sustain, especially given the concern expressed about the lack of enforcement of the law. If publicans in Dublin knew that this closure order was never going to happen unless there had been a first outing to court and a conviction, they would regard themselves as having a free run until such time as they were brought to book for a first offence. This would be a serious mistake because if we want publicans to reconfigure their policy on serving alcohol, we do not want them, by the same token, to know that this new measure - which is supposed to be tough medicine - will not apply to them unless they have one fall from grace which has resulted in a conviction by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The proposal also ignores the reality that the Garda, will on occasion, knock on doors and tell publicans that there have been complaints about drunkenness and that they must get their act together. On many occasions, gardaí will informally advise publicans that if such behaviour continues, they will be prosecuted. While trifling events can be dealt with by the Probation of Offenders Act, the Garda also has the capacity to warn people. If I was to accept what Deputy Costello suggests and what some publicans want, which is to give them a free run on the first offence with no threat of closure, the great majority of them might take the view that no threat applies unless they are brought to court. That would emasculate the provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">On Second Stage, I welcomed the introduction of this provision because for a long time the expression, "honoured more in the breach than in the observance" has applied to liquor licensing legislation. Unfortunately, it has been the case that the publican always got a first free bite. The previous sanctions of endorsements and fines were tantamount to a yellow card and were not observed by publicans. The whole thrust of the legislation is that an offence must be met with a sanction. If there is to be a sanction, there must be must be real deterrence, such as a closure order. That is the only thing publicans understand. The Probation of Offenders Act covers minor offences.</p>

I am concerned at the proposal to impose a severe penalty for offences relating to drunkenness and disorderly conduct, terms that are not clearly defined. The application of the legislation will be open to much abuse. I cannot see how the Garda can tell publicans that too many drunks are being allowed on the premises, or that disorderly conduct is being allowed. Where any instance of such activity occurs, even if it is only quarrelsome disorderly conduct, an offence will have taken place which carries with it a District Court conviction plus the additional penalty of closure, which will apply in the first instance. We should perhaps consider a process involving some kind of counselling or advisory system, as is applied in the United States, where the publican is read the riot act and told what procedures will apply if offences continue on the premises. He or she is warned that closure will take place and that the licence will not be renewed.</p>

I understand Deputy Batt O'Keeffe pointed to something of which we are all aware, that many of the super-pubs do not exercise any control over their premises.

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_606">Deputy Deasy has consistently argued for a blanket ban on the advertising of intoxicating liquor. That is one approach, but, fundamentally, it is a health-driven issue. Two consequences arise from it. First, it is for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to develop policy proposals in this area, rather than for me to do it. In saying this, I am not trying to shirk my responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Second, under EU law, I cannot take action which would interfere with EU inter-state trade without consulting the EU Commission and receiving its permission to do so. If, for instance, the EU Commission took the view that it was legitimate for Pernod to try to break into the Irish market to the extent that it has done by advertising, the Commission might say a ban on alcohol advertising introduced by me would be likely to favour indigenous brands, so as to knock Pernod out of the market. I do not say that would be right or wrong, but if it was to be covered by the legislation, it would breach European Union regulations following which, I understand, Ireland would be liable for a fine. We could be told by the European Court of Justice that the entire measure was invalid for failure to notify.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">This is not entirely academic. It happened in Sweden, but it also happened in Ireland. Some of the measures taken with regard to smoking by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had to be scrapped and devised again from scratch as a result of a failure to notify the European Union. The Attorney General's office has now become much stricter on measures that I might take. Even the regulatory power in this legislation directed at the "Drink as much as you can" promotions had to be watered down to allow for it to be provided for by regulation, so that we would not fall foul of the European Union ban.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Regarding advertising, I fully accept that times change. Yet there was a time when advertisements, such as "Guinness is good for you", were of little significance. I question the notion of advertising per se being wrong, or specific forms of advertising being wrong. Again, this is not academic. RTE, for some reason, has an internal house rule against advertising spirits. I do not believe that it is legally enforced, but one never sees gin, whiskey or Bacardi advertised on RTE, although UTV and Sky broadcast advertising for Irish whiskey into Ireland. One can have the best will in the world, but one cannot keep advertising out any more. I would much prefer for Ireland and the United Kingdom to agree a code of conduct for advertising regulation in that area, so that advertisements would not be directed at young people or suggest that sporting or sexual prowess or status were enhanced by alcohol. Particular products aimed at young people would not be advertised at all. That would be a sounder way to proceed. However, my colleague, Deputy Martin, is responsible for these matters and he intends to put forward his own policy initiatives. While I welcome Deputy Deasy raising this matter as I regard the present advertising situation as unacceptable, it is for someone else to deal with it.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_611">Amendment No. 44 in my name reads:</p>
          <p eId="para_612">In page 22, subsection (1), between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_613">(<i>a</i>) prohibiting or restricting the advertising, sale, display or marketing of intoxicating liquor or products connected therewith,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">My amendment would come under the regulations permitted in this section, so that the Minister would have the scope to make regulations. I am not suggesting that there should be an amendment to the Bill itself whereby he would immediately prohibit items but that the regulations envisaged under section 22 regarding intoxicating liquor in licensed premises and the happy hour in section 20 tie up with the thrust of what he is doing. In the fullness of time, he could use the enabling facility to allow him to restrict the advertising, sale, display or marketing of intoxicating liquor when he has checked everything with the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I do not agree that the matter comes specifically under the remit of the Minister for Health and Children. It comes jointly under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Health and Children. The former has as much responsibility in the matter. It would be a good idea for the Minister to seek a code of conduct on advertising from RTE and other Irish and British television stations. I would like to see it written into the Bill if possible. Young people are being targeted by advertising promoting intoxicating liquor, and the Minister's responsibility comes into play. I would like him to initially examine restrictions - I would say prohibiting - on all advertising that related alcohol to young people or sought to establish a link between it and young people having a healthy, enjoyable lifestyle - and also that between healthy sporting activities and alcohol, which is a misleading form of advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">This comes within the Minister's remit, and regulation would be a proper way to proceed. The legislation would provide the Minister with the enabling facility and he could, as circumstances arose and cultural attitudes developed, extend or restrict the regulations regarding advertising while letting the advertising industry know of its responsibility and that he has, at the stroke of a pen, powers to introduce regulations that would enforce such a requirement on it. This Bill should not pass without providing for this, for advertising is a major part of the problem, especially when it is directed at young people.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_617">It is important to make a clear distinction in the legislation between the supply of and demand for alcoholic liquor. Here we are dealing with supply and the regulation of supply is the one area where we have control. We opened the floodgates over the last few years - wrongly, in most people's view. Legislation or regulation dealing with the demand for alcoholic liquor is an entirely different area, albeit a very important one. Practically every speaker on Second Stage made the point about taking a multidimensional and multifaceted approach. To conflate regulation and legislation in this area would only confuse a much bigger issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Having said that, I agree with practically everything Deputy Deasy said regarding advertising and with his draft section, particularly regarding third-level education and institutions. In my own constituency, we have a major and growing problem of serious antisocial behaviour arising out of pure drunkenness in third-level institutions. It is a huge problem, and Deputy Deasy touched on it. Advertisers are pumping millions of euro into such institutions every year. They are not doing it for the good of their health - and certainly not for that of the students. The logical conclusion is that they get a huge return on their investment. The problem is that, in doing so, they are creating an environment of pure drunkenness. I can speak about third-level institutions in my own constituency. While I agree with the thrust of what has been done, it would only confuse what liquor licensing legislation is all about.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_619">It strikes me that there are some in the Government who have made careers out of ignoring Europe, the Minister for Finance being one. I know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform feels that our alcohol abuse problem is terribly serious and that our drink-related street violence levels are off the scale. We must go to the European Commission and fight our corner, explaining that we have a problem. All the Minister need do is show it the statistics, for no one in his right mind would say that we do not have a problem. The Minister can go to the European Commission or whoever and make that argument, saying that we need this as a matter of priority. It is not good enough simply to say that we have got in trouble in this area before. This is radically different, and radical approaches need to be taken, whether with the European Commission or whoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">My party does not believe there is a middle ground, for it must be banned completely. In fairness, the Minister has talked about this and has addressed the matter, as has the Minister for Health and Children, but it has been going on endlessly. The Minister must take the necessary steps and take on whoever he needs to. Whatever legal or legislative impediment he sees in front of him, he must tackle the matter aggressively. Advertisers will find a way around this if the Minister simply waters it down. They will target not just young people but those of all ages. That it is very effective is one of the reasons that we have such a problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_338" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_621">My colleague, Deputy Martin, announced, the day after I had made public the heads of this Bill, that he had obtained the sanction of the Government to prepare a Bill containing legislative measures regarding the control of alcohol advertising. He is currently working on that and I do not want to convey the impression that nothing is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">On promotional activities, I take the point that advertising is not engaged in for the good of society at large. It is done with a view to increasing market share and, to be fair, some form of advertising is intended to maintain market share within an area. For instance, beer and cider brands advertise against each other to keep up consciousness of the brand. It is important to producers that they have brand identification and so on. I do not want to go over the top and say that all advertising, ipso facto, is bad because that is not a position in which I believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I do not see a problem with advertising wine. Wine advertising probably does not serve to produce public drunkenness and the like. Advertising new forms of wine and drawing them to people's attention by saying they can get a case of wine in Superquinn for X euro per case does not worry me very much. I know what Deputy Deasy is driving at and I have identified the individual brands - I do not propose to do so again. He is talking about the "in your face" type of advertising which tells people that if they drink a certain product it will improve their sex life, athletic life and social life. That is pernicious, but allowing Senator Quinn to tell people that Beaujolais is available at €40 a case or whatever is not damaging.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I will give Deputy Deasy one example of unintended consequences in advertising bans. When I was Attorney General, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, brought forward proposals to prevent tobacco products from being visible in shops. There was to be no promotional material in shops and they were to be put under the counter. That was all very well until two individuals who owned a cigar company in Grafton Street or somewhere in the centre of the city wrote to the Minister to point out that their shop sold only this material and that if the proposed regulations were introduced, it would be impossible for them to have any advertising in their premises. A person would go into an empty room, see a counter and wonder what was sold in that place. Eventually, some arrangement was made whereby shops that were exclusively devoted to tobacco products could allow customers to see some of their produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">We have to be careful here. We start off with the best of intentions and then find ourselves falling flat on our faces because there is an unreasonable outcome. My view is that wine advertising is not damaging and that old-fashioned, point-of-sale advertising of Guinness or Heineken is not damaging.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">I do not want to do the regulating. I should have made the point that to set up a system, to regulate it and to come up with proposals, public servants and agents will have to examine advertisements that come in and decide whether they correspond to proper standards. We will have to have the whole machinery established. The Office of Tobacco Control, for instance, does that in respect of the advertising of new brands. If I rather than the Minister, Deputy Martin, were to accept the responsibility, I would have to establish a separate unit in my Department to enforce the law. I would have to check newspapers and go to points of sale. To be honest, I would prefer if we left that with the Department of Health and Children.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">I fully accept Deputy Deasy's idea is that this would be done by regulation and one may not have to put the same warning on a bottle of champagne as one would on something else - I presume that is his thinking. The question is what kinds of warnings should be used. Would they be similar to a health warning on a packet of cigarettes? This is something which the Minister, Deputy Martin, will have to carefully consider. What kind of warning should be put on beer bottles and should a warning be put on glasses that are used for draught drink? At what stage does one give up on having warnings in a pub? There are many issues involved. When the Minister, Deputy Martin, goes down this road, he will have to grapple with all these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">From an entirely practical point of view, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is simply not equipped to deal with health issues and whether a particular warning would or would not be proportionate or even accurate, which is one of our problems. There are many matters to be decided in that regard. Alcoholic strengths is an issue which the Minister for Health and Children may want to consider in respect of some products. For example, is it absolutely essential that beer should have this or that alcoholic content? When I was a kid sitting on the No. 13 bus going to Gonzaga College, I recall looking at advertisements suggesting that Wincarnis tonic wine was good for one's health. The Chairman will also remember that advertisement. Buckfast and products such as that were prescribed by doctors, especially to little old ladies for their good health. Incidentally, I discovered that Buckfast, which I believe is made by monks somewhere in England, is the favourite tipple among loyalist youths in Northern Ireland. They drink it by the bottle, which is interesting.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_349">
          <from>Mr. Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_661">The point raised by Deputy Deasy is valid, although it is probably outside the Minister's remit. We have been hearing for the last two decades about the damage alcohol has done to society and about the cost of it to our economy. Research throughout the United States and modern western economies has shown that cost. I mentioned to the Minister some time ago about certain brands of shots. I was discussing this Bill with a hotelier a couple of nights ago and he told me he does not stock those drinks. He runs a good premises. The effect of these drinks is similar to being injected with the alcohol. It goes straight into the bloodstream and has an immediate effect. That is a dangerous type of drinking for youths. While it might not be within the Minister's remit, Deputy Deasy's suggestion is valid. Perhaps the Minister would bring up this issue with his colleague at Cabinet. I intend to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I like a pint but some of the drinks now available can blow the mind of a young person. They are extremely damaging. This is an affluent society whereas when I was a young man 25 years ago we did not have the money to drink. There is plenty of money available now and people are using it to the wrong effect. In ten or 20 years time we will see the results of this imprudent drinking. The reckless amount of alcohol content in certain drinks must be stopped.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">I agree with the Minister that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children because it is a health warning. Something needs to be done in this regard. The health warning is different, however, from the health warnings on tobacco products. Tobacco <i>per se </i>is damaging, not only to the smoker but also to those who inhale secondary smoke, so the health warnings required in this instance would be different. It will require a complicated response from the Minister for Health and Children to get it right. However, it is important that it is done. The Bill that is due to be brought forward by the Minister for Health and Children should provide for a health warning. That Bill should be speedily introduced so something like this can be implemented.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_664">I appreciate Deputy O'Donovan's comments. Many young people are drinking the drinks identified by Deputy O'Donovan without knowing the consequences. It is becoming increasingly clear, and the evidence for this is good, that it causes liver damage in young people. The suicide rate is also increasingly linked to high rates of alcohol consumption among young males. The devastating health consequences of drinking heavily at a young age are finally being recognised by this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Some members have made a comparison with cigarettes. Twenty or 30 years ago there was not the same amount of knowledge about or evidence of the damage done by cigarettes. That damage is now verifiable. However, that knowledge still does not exist in the psyche of young people. There must be at least a health warning to counteract the money the advertisers are putting into the promotion of these drinks. There must be something to introduce some element of doubt into their minds about drinking lots of alcopops or other drinks. It has to be something physical they can read which will instil a doubt and make them think that drinking seven or eight of these drinks a night is not good for them. It is a common sense, simple measure. We have done this with tobacco. Now that we know the devastating health consequences that can result from drinking at a young age, it is reasonable to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I will not push the amendment. I accept the Minister's comments about the Minister for Health and Children. However, members of the Government must address the issue; it must be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_667">I agree with Deputy Deasy that it is something that must be done. I wonder whether the most effective way of doing it, and this is another matter which the Minister for Health and Children will have to consider, is to stick labels on bottles containing dire warnings or to require the drinks industry to contribute to a fund which would allow him to produce television advertising graphically showing the effects of these drinks. Perhaps there could be a combination of both. These are policy issues which the Minister will have to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">What Deputy Deasy has said about liver and brain damage, strokes and so forth must be brought home to drinkers of all ages but particularly to younger drinkers who believe, like with tobacco, that they are invincible and immortal and that nothing can damage them. The Minister will have to consider whether concentrating his fire on putting a label on a bottle of beer which points out that excessive alcohol consumption causes cirrhosis, strokes and heart disease is the right way forward or whether he should consider putting graphic advertising on television showing the real consequences of alcohol consumption. He should also somehow get the drinks industry to counterweigh its advertising efforts by directing this truth at young people. The great advantage of professionally created advertising is that it can be directed at young people and can capture their imagination. If it is just a label on a bottle, it might achieve the same result.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_680">In page 11, before section 10, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_681">10.-It shall be lawful for a court which is considering an application for the grant or renewal of a licence to attach conditions requiring the putting in place of a system of closed circuit television monitoring in or outside the premises and conditions in relation to the operation of such a system.".</p>
          <p eId="para_682">This matter has cropped up on several occasions in debates on public order legislation, private security services legislation and, indeed, on this Bill. One way of addressing a problem of public order in the vicinity of, or inside, a public house or off-licence - particularly if it is a flashpoint where such problems have arisen before - is to make the installation of CCTV a condition of the issuance or renewal of a licence. If such flashpoints relate to particular premises, a court considering an application for renewal could impose this sanction whereby, over and above any precautions the licensee might take, they would install a closed circuit television system to ensure monitoring of public order. They should take what the court would regard as all necessary precautions to prevent disorderly conduct taking place there in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">In the case of an application for a first licence, it might be possible to introduce a similar requirement depending on the size of the premises. The obligation could also be imposed in the case of a super pub or if the licensed premises is in an area traditionally known as a flashpoint for disorderly behaviour. I hope the Minister can accept the amendment.</p>

On a number of occasions I have asked what was the Department's interpretation of the matter and I have heard the Minister express his concern about requiring small pubs to install CCTV. Can somebody explain where the line is drawn in such cases and who will be required to install CCTV under the legislation? Will it be night-clubs or pubs over a certain square footage?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_364" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_685">I am sympathetic to the idea of installing closed circuit television systems in licensed premises and the Minister will consider it further in the context of the codification Bill next year. In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Deasy, there is no concept of licensed premises of a certain floor space - we are talking about special exemption orders. Section 11(4)(<i>b</i>) already goes some way towards meeting the issue raised by Deputy Costello in providing that the District Court will have power to require the installation of closed circuit television. It is specifically mentioned that the court may impose such other conditions as it thinks proper, including, as appropriate, a requirement to install a closed circuit television system. We have expressly written into the legislation the option that a court may require the installation of CCTV in the event of an application for a special exemption order. That does not depend on the character or size of the premises, it applies to everyone who is seeking a special exemption order.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">In tabling his amendment, Deputy Costello has moved one step further by proposing that:</p>
          <p eId="para_687">It shall be lawful for a court which is considering an application for the grant or renewal of a licence [that would be any licence, either at the initial grant stage or at the annual renewal stage] to attach conditions requiring the putting in place of a system of closed circuit television. . .</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I am sympathetic to the idea and the Minister will consider it in the context of the codification Bill. As regards this Bill, however, the Minister took the view that special exemption orders needed to be addressed urgently and a principle of proportionality is required. The Minister is not convinced that small premises need closed circuit television and, in the absence of more extended debate on the issue, he fears that the costs involved might jeopardise the viability of many smaller licensed premises in towns and rural areas. While the Minister cannot accept the amendment, he is prepared to consider the issue further in the context of the codification Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_689">The Minister of State referred to the Bill's provisions concerning special exemption orders, which give greater cause for concern about flashpoints of disorderly behaviour. I am not referring to small pubs, most of which are very well run without problems. Situations often arise, however, concerning super pubs which are well able to afford CCTV systems, so there is no reason not to install them. If hundreds of people are pouring out of a pub at a particular time and if complaints have been made about their behaviour and the way in which the premises is run, a court should have such powers, not just concerning special exemption orders but also for normal non-licensing situations. For example, a court might have powers of sanction, including the CCTV system, following a resolution passed by a local authority about a particular premises with a bad record. This might also apply whether it concerns an initial licence application or a renewal and may not necessarily relate to special exemption orders.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I agree with Deputy Costello that the Minister will have to extend this provision beyond special exemption orders. When the smoking ban comes into effect, some people will enforce it by asking customers to step outside the premises. There is a concern that while ten or 15 people are hanging around outside having a smoke it could lead to the possibility of public order offences outside pubs. That will have to be borne in mind in dealing with this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">There are not enough gardaí to deal with current levels of street crime, particularly in urban areas, so there will have to be some other deterrent. Senior gardaí have been telling me for months that, in many cases, Garda overtime is insufficient to deal with the situation. Therefore, the legislation will have to be extended beyond the special exemption orders. I have sought a written memo from the Department concerning its plans in this regard but the Minister of State should re-examine the matter for Report Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_367" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_692">Deputy Costello disavowed any intention of causing any difficulties for smaller licensed premises. He pointed out, as is the case, that many if not most of them are run in a orderly manner. The fact remains, however, that the terms of his amendment apply to all licensed premises on the grant or renewal of a licence. The amendment is universal in scope and is not restricted to super pubs or pubs of a particular character. It is universal in scope and would apply to every renewal at every annual licensing session. It would be a far-reaching provision. I make this point to indicate the Minister's intentions here.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">With regard to special exemption orders and Deputy Deasy's concerns about late night activities, all in the nightclub sector and many of the so-called super pubs need the special exemption order provisions to operate, so at least a real start is being made here. Members should remember that this start supplements the provision in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003, to which I think Deputy Deasy referred in an earlier contribution, which expressly empowers the court, on the commission of an offence having been proven and in the context of a closure order, to impose a requirement to install a closed circuit television system. We have already legislated to provide for this in the context of proven misbehaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I have a slight reservation about one matter raised by Deputy Costello, namely, that the local authorities might assume some sort of role or intervention in this matter. We have legislated for the court to have the power in the event of proven misbehaviour. In this Bill, we propose to legislate that it apply to all special exemption order businesses. The Minister has indicated he is more than willing to look at the question in the context of all licensed premises and the codification Bill, but he is not prepared to take that final step in this measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_696">I accept there is already a provision to deal with the special exemption order. I will not press my amendment, but the Minister should take it on board because if we state in the legislation that all these matters will be dealt with by the District Court, all licences should be subject to the court's jurisdiction. A relatively small pub in an isolated area in which all kinds of undesirable behaviour takes place may well be required to install this monitoring device as part of the conditions.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">This is an important amendment. In recent years, there has been a proliferation in the number of children and young people employed in public houses. In many ways, it is adding to the problem, given the money earned and the experience gained. Very often the money is spent in the worst possible way. If we are to introduce legislation in which nobody under the age of 18 years may drink and where publicans have discretion to increase that age limit in terms of access to public houses, it is totally contradictory for a young person under the age limit to supply people with alcohol. If we are to try to keep young people and children out of pubs, they should not be employed in them because it gives the wrong example.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_706">That is not correct. I will set out the position. I will not accept this amendment for two technical reasons. First, the Deputy does not describe what is a child for the purposes of the section. In addition, the matter is regulated by section 38 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which is not referred to in the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Apart from the technicalities, it raises an interesting and important issue, as Deputy Costello pointed out. Section 38 of the 1988 Act permits the employment of certain persons, who are under 18 years but not under 16 years, in licensed premises. Children under the age of 16 may not be employed in such premises. The employment of certain 16 and 17 year olds for general duties is permitted. These duties are confined to serving tables and returning empty glasses to the counter. They are not permitted to sell intoxicating liquor behind the bar. That is the strict legal position.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">A code of practice specifying the conditions of employment has been adopted and is set out in regulations made by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and may be found in SI No. 350 of 2001. The regulations provide that a young person may be required to work up to 11 p.m. in such premises on a day which is not a day immediately preceding a school day during a school term where the young person is attending school. The code of practice provides that before employing a young person in a licensed premises, the employer shall obtain the written permission of the parent or guardian of the young person. It also deals with issues such as training, study time and health and safety. As the social partners and the licensed trade have signed up to the code, it would be inappropriate to set it aside without necessary consultation. The amendment would also prevent family members of licensees from assisting in premises at weekends or during school holidays and it may have an adverse affect on young persons considering a career in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I consider that the amendment raises important issues because on the one hand, there is no doubt this is one of the main sources of income for young persons in those age categories, while, on the other hand, it may have to be re-examined if we embark on a new direction in public policy in terms of re-evaluating our attitude to alcohol. Again, I suggest this is not the time to do so in the context of an amendment which is not formulated with exactitude to address the problem and in a context where certain procedures have been put in place in consultation with the trade and the relevant union interests.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_710">It is a case of things being desirable, but not yet - in other words, this is not the place to address them and they should be left for another Minister at another time. The Minister has relaxed the position in amendment No. 30, which states "It shall not be unlawful for such a holder to allow a child who is accompanied by his or her parent or guardian or a person who isaged at least 15 years but under the age of 18 years . . .". The Minister has used the same terminology as me. However, in his amendment the child can come into the bar area only if he or she is accompanied by a parent or guardian, yet this other child, the one with whom I am concerned, can serve drink unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. It is not much use to say we might stunt children's future career in the pub trade by preventing them from working in a bar at 16. We must face up to this inherent contradiction in the legislation. It is not good enough either to say that because children do not pull pints behind the counter, the problem is mitigated. They serve at tables and collect glasses, mixing in the environment and culture of the pub. If they served behind the bar they might be out of the way to some extent. The response to this is inadequate.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">That is the essential point. One cannot have children in pubs under a guise, whether it is through remuneration or because they are working with family members. Existing legislation sets out the rules governing the position of family members. No restrictions are imposed on their presence in a pub or hotel bar. However, it is not possible to restrict the presence of young people in bar premises at certain hours while turning a blind eye to them working on the same premises. Existing legislation merely provides that they shall not work beyond a certain time, which is around midnight. Given these contradictions, the Minister should reconsider this aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">I do not see this apparent contradiction because the employee is under the direct control and direction of, and is in a position of subordination to, his or her employer. There is no equation between a person who is an employee on a premises and a person who is there by invitation or in the society of another customer. There is a fundamental distinction here. The person of 16 or 17 years of age employed for reward in a licensed premises is under the control of the licensee regarding his or her behaviour on the premises.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_725">In page 11, before section 10, but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_726">10.-(1) The Minister for the Environment and Local Government shall, within 2 months of the passing of this Act, propose regulations lowering the permissible level of alcohol in the blood for persons driving on a provisional licence to zero and for other persons to 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, with corresponding reductions for the permissible level in urine and breath.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">(2) It shall not be necessary for a member of the Garda Síochána to form any particular opinion before requiring a person to give a sample of his or her breath under the Road Traffic Act 1961.".</p>
          <p eId="para_728">This amendment refers to alcohol-related offences, another area where the Minister has reneged on his obligations. There is nothing in the legislation which addresses the continuing serious problem of drunken driving. The Minister has stressed the need to get his proposals through the House, but this area is the cause of many fatalities and other problems. The Minister's proposals will not even bring us into line with the European norm, reducing the amount of alcohol per volume from 50 milligrams to 100 millilitres.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The amendment also provides that it should not be necessary for a garda to form any particular opinion before requiring a person to give a breath sample under the terms of the Road Traffic Act 1961. The Minister may say this is a matter for the Minister for Transport, but it does not require a major response. The Minister has said the Minister for Transport will look at this matter in the distant future under the aegis of traffic regulations in the distant future but if the Minister is not going to do these things, why, if it only involves the stroke of a pen, did he not get commitments that other Ministers would do so? He has said the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Health and Children will do certain things in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Much of the responsibility in this area lies with the Minister. Random blood testing is a Garda matter and the level of alcohol in the blood with which one can drive is also a matter for the Minister. It is a policing matter. It is an offence to have a certain amount of alcohol in one's blood when driving. It is not enough for the Minister to wash his hands and say such matters are the responsibility of other Departments. He should accept this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_732">On the technical side, the amendment is flawed because it refers to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government rather than the Minister for Transport, who is responsible for road traffic legislation. The Government is collectively responsible for devising a strategy to deal with the alcohol problem, which is informed by the findings of the strategic task force on alcohol. It then falls to particular Ministers and Departments to take initiatives which require to be taken. That is why the Minister, who is responsible for licensing legislation, has brought this immediate measure before the Oireachtas. It is for the Minister for Transport to deal with this matter in the context of the road traffic legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The substance of both amendments relate to the road traffic legislation. As the Minister said on Second Stage, a high level official group is reviewing the road safety strategy and the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol are part of that review. Some of the recommendations of the task force are embodied in Deputy Costello's amendment, including the zero blood alcohol level for learner drivers, a reduction in the overall limit for blood alcohol levels and random testing. These are the main issues raised by the strategic task force which the review group is examining and which will in due course report to the Minister for Transport. It will then fall to him to take the necessary measures. The Minister does not consider it appropriate to amend what is essentially licensing legislation with a Road Traffic Act provision. While he has always been receptive to the supplementary amendment of legislation as it passes through the Houses, that would be a big step to take with regard to these measures.</p>

However, we are still left high and dry on the question of when, if ever, these important amendments will be dealt with. The Minister has decreed he has no say with regard to most of the amendments being tabled here. This is urgent legislation, pending his <i>magnum opus </i>next year, yet these urgent issues will not be included and we do not know when they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Minister does not appear to have consulted with the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Transport. There is no commitment to address any of these matters. It is easy to fob us off and say it is not his responsibility, but the Minister has not been able to tell us that the Minister for Transport has a deadline for introducing legislation dealing with random testing, alcohol levels or provisional licence holders. Similarly, although he has spoken about it, the Minister for Health and Children has made no commitments in terms of addressing the health aspect, especially the points raised by Deputy Deasy's amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">(3) Where a person applies to the District Court for a nightclub licence in respect of a nightclub of which he or she is the owner and occupier, having duly given notice of his or her intention to do so, the Court shall cause a certificate to be given to the applicant entitling him to receive, on paying the Revenue Commissioners the fee specified in this Act, a nightclub licence in respect of the nightclub unless the Court, in consequence of an objection under section 4 of the Licencing (Ireland) Act 1833, prohibits under that section the issue of the licence on the grounds of the character, misconduct or unfitness of the applicant or the unfitness or inconvenience of the premises.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">(8) The provisions of the Act of 1927 relating to prohibited hours shall apply to any premises to which a nightclub licence applies as if subsection (7) of this section were substituted for subparagraph (i) of this Act, and the Act of 1927 shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">(9) Any person who contravenes the terms of a nightclub licence shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,000 and the offence shall be deemed, for the purposes of Part III (which relates to the endorsement of licences) of the Act of 1927, to be an offence to which that Part of that Act applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">(10) A holder of a nightclub licence shall cause a copy of the licence to be displayed prominently in the premises.".</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The Irish Nightclub Owners' Association asked me to table this amendment. The more I think about it, the more I agree with it that there should be a separate nightclub licence. Nightclubs appear to fall between the two stools of the on-licenced public house and the special exemption order licences which the bars get. However, they differ from both in that they start late and do not have normal on-licensing hours. They have a strong element of dancing and socialising as well as the consumption of alcohol. They operate at a different time and generally close at a later time.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I understand there are approximately 400 nightclubs in the country which do not give rise to disorderly conduct to any great extent. Often it is the proliferation of exemption orders for late night bars and so on that causes disorderly conduct. Given that the setting at nightclubs is different from the other premises, it would be desirable to consider them specifically with a view to having a designated type of licence. This could follow on from what the Minister has agreed to do with regard to the sporting arena licence, referred to in the Bill, where he is giving his imprimatur to a new type of licensed premises. The Bill provides that the Minister may issue to the owner or owners of a designated national sporting arena a certificate of proof of the issue of a licence in respect of the arena. The sporting arena is now being recognised as an area which is suitable for a new type of licence in a new designated area. Nightclubs should be treated similarly.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I support the amendment, which is well thought out. The Minister should accept it. The nightclub owners have pointed out that in their case, someone attempting to enter a premises in a drunken state is usually refused, whereas in most other cases they can be drinking from, say, 8 p.m. and come out on the streets in a drunken state at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. There is no check on entry to ascertain if they have a responsible attitude towards drunkenness. Despite problems in the past with nightclubs and so on, an attempt should be made to ensure they are treated separately in the legislation. The Minister should consider the amendment to ensure that some recognition is given to the different role they play, other than being bars or places that sell liquor.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">I have considerable sympathy for Deputy Costello's viewpoint but the amendment would effect significant structural reform in the licensing system if it was accepted. For example, it provides for a licence that would permit the relevant premises to remain open as a matter of ordinary routine until 4 a.m. The present arrangement of a special exemption order can ensure the vitality of the premises until 2.30 a.m. That would be a fundamental change to the licensing system.</p>

Subsection (7) provides for an exemption other than on Christmas Day or Good Friday or on any other day between 10.30 a.m. and 4 a.m. the following day, which, potentially, is a long time.

          <p eId="para_774">That should read "p.m.". The Deputy can understand my reaction when I read it. However, when the Government established the Commission on Liquor Licensing, its membership included a representative of the nightclub industry. The commission made recommendations regarding nightclubs in its second interim report. It did not recommend the creation of a new nightclub licence, despite the presence of an industry representative. It was recommended that nightclubs should continue to operate within the general framework of the special exemption order system. The Minister met the nightclub delegation and he undertook to review its case for a specific nightclub licence, even though the commission had not recommended it. He accepts nightclub owners have made a strong case for a separate licence but he believes that will require further consideration and can be dealt with in the codification Bill next year.</p>

I am surprised the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is wielding the blackthorn stick in the bushes telling us when to drink and when to go home. One of the major difficulties is the significant volume of people rushing on to the streets in the early hours. By introducing a later closing time, there would be less of a rush to get taxis and buses at the same time. Deputy Costello is proposing a practical measure that would reduce the flow of people onto the streets in the early hours. There would be a more gradual flow onto the streets and people would be able to exercise their own good judgment regarding when they dance and drink. I would like this sensible proposal to go further.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">In page 11, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_793">10.-(1) Section 2 (as amended bysection 3 of the Act of 2000) of the Act of 1927 is amended in subsection (1)(b) as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_794">(<i>a</i>) by substituting ’11.30 p.m.’ for all appearances of ’12.30 p.m. on the following day’.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">(<i>b</i>) by substituting ’(vi) any other Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday between 10.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m.’ for ’any other Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday between 10.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m.; and ’.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">The Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended that closing hour should be changed from 12.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. on Thursdays. It has been part of Fine Gael policy for some time that the same should happen on Fridays and Saturdays. The amendment is self explanatory. Without resources and without the presence of gardaí as a deterrent on the streets, the problem is evident. The liberalisation of the drinking laws three years ago has led to an increase in drink related street violence. The hours should be returned to what they were originally before summer 2000.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_799">According to Garda reports the main increase in street violence occurs in the hours after special exemption orders expire rather than in the revised hours provided for in the intoxicating liquor licensing legislation amendment. While I understand the reason the Deputy has proposed the amendment, I cannot accept it. Last year, the Commission on Liquor Licensing sought submissions from the public on the issue of trading hours. A great variety of views were expressed. Having looked at all the submissions, the commission concluded that a balance must be struck between the legitimate needs of those who do not abuse alcohol and the protection of vulnerable persons and their dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The commission was concerned at reports that later opening on Thursday nights was having an adverse impact on young persons reporting for work or training or turning up for classes or lectures on Friday mornings. It considered this a worrying development and recommended a rolling back of the Thursday night opening hour to 11.30 p.m. The Minister agrees with that view and has included a provision to that effect in the legislation. However, he does not propose to extend the roll-back to Friday and Saturday nights. He would be willing to revisit the issue in the context of next year's codification of the licensing laws, but he cannot accept the amendment at this stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_801">The Minister of State has made it clear he will look at it and make his judgment over the next year. I find it hard to accept that he can agree to change it for Thursdays and admit that damage is being done in regard to absenteeism or students being groggy in the morning. Young people work on Saturdays also. If the argument is made for Thursdays it can also be made for Fridays. As we have gone through this with the Minister, I will not press it but it needs to be done. It has added to the street violence problem. It was said that gardaí have indicated this is to do with special exemption orders, but the later closing has added to the problem. Every garda on the beat to whom I have spoken has said that, since liberalisation in the summer of 2000, longer drinking hours have exacerbated the problem in urban areas. If we are serious about dealing with drink related street violence, we must revert the closing hour to 11.30 p.m. I know this will not be a popular measure but people will get used to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">We have thousands of bona fides drinkers, many of whom enjoy having a late drink. However, we cannot have it both ways. We cannot say there is a crisis while avoiding taking unpopular decisions such as this.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_804">My argument is much the same as the one I made earlier. I accept there is a problem of an increase in street violence and that abuse of alcohol has fuelled it, but I do not accept that curtailing the hours of drinking will lead to a significant reduction. We need to have more gardaí on the streets when people exit from licensed premises and we also need to severely control the number of super-pubs that continue to come into existence in towns and cities. These two measures will do far more to control the amount of violence on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">As somebody who has lived in the centre of Dublin for the last ten years, including in Temple Bar for a period, the most significant change occurred when large pubs were allowed to come into existence. The kind of control that a publican can exercise over a pub that is perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 square feet in size is completely different from the kind of control that can be exercised over a pub of 20,000 or 30,000 square feet. We need to provide more controls over very large pubs. We must also reorganise the Garda Síochána in order to have significant Garda numbers present when people are on the streets. From my knowledge of streets such as Dame Street and South Great George's Street in Dublin 2, there are not enough Garda numbers present to deal with the hundreds, if not thousands of people coming on to the streets from these premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Many speakers have referred to the large number of gardaí on the streets to help with the Special Olympics. If even a fraction of those numbers were on the streets when people are exiting licensed premises we would do a lot more to curtail street violence. By getting rid of many of the controls over opening hours, there would be less of a rush to the doors at the same time. That would assist in reducing the amount of violence on the streets. I therefore oppose the section.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">This amendment relates to the special exemption orders. The section refers to the period the order shall specify. It provides for it to be different on Mondays, when it shall expire at 1 a.m. In any other case it will be at 2.30 a.m. There might be an argument for providing for a special order for Sundays, but it is strange to do so for Mondays.

          <p eId="para_810">I remind the Deputy that we are discussing Sunday night. Monday starts at 12 midnight on Sunday, so that is why the Bill is drafted on that basis. The Bill provides that on Monday mornings, a special exemption order has to lapse at 1 a.m. unless the Monday is a public holiday, in which case it is assimilated to the normal position of 2.30 a.m. The general idea is that Monday is the first working day of the week. The amendment proposed by the Deputy would permit special exemption orders to operate until 2.30 a.m. on Monday mornings, on the first day of the working week. I am not disposed to accept the amendment. The issue was examined during the consideration of the 2000 Act and fears about absenteeism from work on Mondays were expressed at the time. The Minister is not willing to reopen the issue in the context of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_812">We are considering the whole issue of trading hours and while Deputy Costello made the philosophical point that perhaps we should have none at all, Deputy Deasy has taken a very different view and sees merit in them as habit-creating limitations. If we are to have hours at all, it is reasonable for the Legislature to say that a week has significance as well as a day and that the path of reform can start on a weekly basis rather than on a daily basis.</p>

Monday morning would probably be the quietest day because the pubs close at 11 p.m. on Sunday evening and there is likely to be less activity about town.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">I mean the licensing associations, or perhaps representatives of licensees in a particular area. The resolution could be varied, for example, it could deal with expiry times referred to in section 5 or it could be for individual premises or an area. An area could be established that is not in a residential area and local authorities could decide to recommend that the expiry times would be different from other areas. It would cover any consultative process where the local authority might consider passing a resolution - a substantial decision - that the licensees or those directly concerned should also be consulted at some level, along with the Garda.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">I am concerned about this issue. The local authority could apply for an expiry time different to what is stated and extend the hours to 4.30 a.m. or some other time. If two adjoining local authority areas sanctioned varying expiry times, it could encourage people to travel from one area to another, which would raise the possibility of drink driving. It would also leave our local authority colleagues open to lobbying by the licensing federations and bar owners to alter the expiry times to suit their business needs. I can understand that a local authority in a tourism area might want an expiry time to be slightly different to facilitate the industry, but this should not be left to the authority. If we are to adopt specific closing times there should be one rule for all across the State or else no rule, as some have suggested.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_422">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_821">I oppose the section. I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh. The initial idea of allowing local authorities to extend pub closing times in their areas arose about four or five of months ago. This does not go that far. It would allow the local authorities to pass a resolution, which would then have to be considered by the District Court, when deliberating on a special exemption order. It is not a good idea to give this authority to councillors. The Minister understands the very close relationship that local representatives have with publicans in many cases. Local authorities and their members should not be put under this pressure. I have cited cases where five members of a nine-person council drink in the same pub. They will come under undue pressure to make such a resolution and bring it to the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Deputy Ó Snodaigh is correct in saying the possibility of two local authorities having different closing times will encourage drink driving. At a time when we are grappling with that issue, this is madness. The section should be deleted.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_823">There are a number of Garda stations in my constituency. In one area, the owner of a nightclub received a letter from the superintendent or inspector in charge stating that in future, no special exemption orders that go beyond 1.30 a.m. will be given. This appears to have been done unilaterally without putting a notice in a newspaper or allowing people to make any representations. While it might not be the deciding factor, it has great moral influence with others who are making the final decision. There should be a method whereby the officer in charge of the Garda station could take on board representations and let people know that the whole matter would be considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I agree with the Chairman. It seems to be out of line for any member of the Garda to indicate that an exemption order would not be allowed beyond a particular time. I would like to see some clarification on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">I take a different view to my colleagues on this issue and I support the Minister, largely because I support local democracy on the issue. A local authority is a body that deals with administration and planning in a local area and the councillors are elected to represent that area. It is in the interests of good planning and administration for councillors to adopt a resolution for a variation in expiry times in parts of the area. I do not accept the argument that councillors are in the pocket of publicans or that they are being brought under undue pressure.</p>

          <p eId="para_827">I will withdraw my statement if the Deputy takes offence. There was a suggestion that they would be subject to unacceptable pressure from publicans. Publicans lobby councillors, like everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">This is a healthy development. People seek special exemption orders without anybody having a say in the matter other than the Garda. It is proposed here to provide local authorities with a statutory basis to go through the rigorous process of adopting a resolution that will form the basis of a recommendation to the court. The councillors will not make the decision. The can only make a recommendation to the court in the same way as a Garda recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The local authorities should do this on a consultative basis with the Garda and the licensees to ensure there is a proper and responsible operation of licensed premises in the area. This is not to introduce a heavy handed approach but to provide an extension of the consultative process in the granting of special exemption orders that will involve the local authority responsible for the area's administration, just as the Garda has responsibility for the area's policing.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_831">I will first deal with Deputy Costello's amendment. Section 11 provides that the local authority, before adopting a resolution on special exemption orders, must engage in this publicly announced consultation process. The authority must then consider any views submitted by any person concerning the resolution and any views submitted by a Garda officer and any other persons, including views on any health aspects of granting a special exemption order. I am advised that "any person" in this context includes a licence holder. There is full scope for the relevant local licensed interests to make their views known to the local authority in a statutory way under this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The local authority is required to give one month's notice of an intention to propose the resolution. This notice and the proposed expiry times must be published in at least two newspapers circulating in the area. There will, therefore, be adequate opportunity for the licensed trade and other relevant interests to make their views known.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The wording of the amendment would cause problems, as it is vague. For example, how, can and why should a local authority determine what persons are representative in a particular area? Once the section is broad enough - as we are advised it is - to cover a member of the licensed trade, it is not desirable to have a statutory procedure or machinery for a local authority to become involved in deciding who appears to be representative of licence holders in their functional area.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The section as it stands is wide enough to allow any person with an interest in this matter to make their views known. Those with an interest would not be restricted to licence holders, but would also extend to people who are residents, have businesses or carry on professional activity in the community and who hold a view about how they are affected by an extension proposed to a special exemption order. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Costello, although I appreciate his general support for the thrust of the Minister's proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked if this is a restrictive provision or whether the local authority could extend the hours. That cannot happen. The only representation the resolution could contain would be for a restriction of the order. I refer Deputies to subsection (5), in which the times of the special exemption order are set out, allowing for an extension to 1 a.m. on Monday morning and 2.30 a.m. in any other case. The subsection goes on to state: ". . . unless the court, for stated reasons, considers it expedient to grant the order for a shorter period". In effect, the only matter on which the local authority will make a resolution is on whether the order should be for a shorter period.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">This raises the question, to which Deputy Deasy referred, as to whether the local authority can oppose the order totally. On my reading it could do so, perhaps on the basis of recommending that the order be extended for only minute's duration, which is tantamount to wholly objecting to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Deasy canvassed various objections to the involvement of local authorities in this area. Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned the dangers of lobbying.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_430" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_839">Yes. However, Deputy Deasy made another point which, in a sense, relates to lobbying. In rural areas of Ireland, the licensed trade includes many family owned businesses and the persons concerned are often prominent personalities in local communities, possibly with a close relationship with members of local authorities. That could put a councillor under great pressure in the type of situation to which I assume Deputy Deasy is referring, where there is substantial local pressure to restrict the hours which the licence holder wishes to have fully extended. Those seeking election to local authorities are liable to be put under pressure. It is part and parcel of political activity. Those participating in the local government elections next year must understand that politics involves making decisions and that it is not possible to keep all of the people happy all of the time, or, for that matter, to fool all of the people all of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, raised a particular case. I am not familiar with the facts but, treating it in a hypothetical manner, the Garda has no function in determining the duration of special exemption orders. That is a function for the District Court. The Garda is a notice party in this matter. Essentially, this provision will put the local authority on a similar footing to that of the Garda. However, neither of those bodies can pre-empt the decision of the court, which must decide as to what is appropriate. I do not know if I can assist the Chairman further on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Deputy Deasy outlined his reasons for opposing the section. The Commission on Liquor Licensing accepted the Garda view that many public order offences take place after 3 a. m. - after the expiry of special exemption orders - and that this problem needs to be addressed. The mechanism proposed by the commission includes a role for local authorities in determining the duration of special exemption orders in their areas. Since the section of the 1927 Act dealing with special exemption orders has been amended on several occasions, this section contains a re-statement of the law regarding such orders. Subsection (7) provides for the proposed local authority role.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The District Court will retain discretion in granting such orders, but the court will now be required to have regard to any resolution adopted by a local authority in the area in which the premises are located. As the Minister indicated yesterday, the secretary of the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland has written to congratulate him on the proposal to give local authorities this role. A local authority must consult with the Garda and consider the views of any other person, as I outlined in my reply to Deputy Costello's amendment. That can include views on the health aspects. Accordingly, a view submitted by a licensee in the area must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">We have already discussed the provision allowing for the possibility of the District Court requiring an applicant for a special exemption order to install a closed circuit television system. This need arises mainly with regard to larger premises. It will enable the Garda, which is a notice party, to request the court to attach a condition regarding closed circuit television where it has reason to believe it will be justified or appropriate. It is a small imposition on large premises.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">This subsection refers to drinking-up time. I was taken aback by the proposal to end entertainment during the specified 30-minute period. The Green Party believes in the right to party and dance - which is more beneficial than drinking - until the time one leaves a premises. It brings to mind that rather brief moment in the evening before exiting when the lights go on and the music. This Bill proposes half an hour of bright lights, while one stares at those around, before leaving the club. That is not the right way to proceed. It is like the scenario in which Amhrán na bFhiann is played and then the hall or pub is silent for half an hour, while people finish their drinks, until it is time to leave. It makes better sense to allow dancing or entertainment to continue during that period. I am perturbed by the proposal to stop the entertainment a full 30 minutes before patrons are expected to leave the premises. Perhaps the Minister should get out more often and see the situation for himself.</p>

          <p eId="para_856">I echo some of Deputy Cuffe's comments. I am not sure as to the effectiveness of the provision with regard to drinking-up time if entertainment is not permitted during the period. If, after the serving of drinks ceases at a particular time, one is still allowed to dance and sing, one is less likely to be drunk. Of course, under this legislation, drunkenness is not permissible in any event - one is liable to be thrown out on the basis that it is an offence. The time in which people are dancing is a sobering one and it is not unreasonable that entertainment should be allowed to continue during the last 30 minutes. My amendment proposes a reduction in the period. There should be a 30 minute period following the closure of the bar with a subsequent ten minutes drinking up time. I am attempting reach a compromise to resolve the problem.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_857">My instructions are clear. The Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended that entertainment be prohibited after the expiry of normal trading hours and special exemption orders. The purpose of the section is to implement this recommendation. The commission noted that the purpose of drinking up time is to facilitate an orderly clearing of a premises. The provision of entertainment is not conducive to that aim. On the contrary, if entertainment is under way, the drinking up time becomes part of normal hours and drinking up takes place when it expires. The Minister is prepared to review this change in the light of experience gained during next year's codification exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">When the 1962 Act was enacted, the drinking up time was ten minutes. Subsequent legislation extended that period to 30 minutes. It is an interesting example of how we legislate in minute detail to regulate matters of human conduct. I fail to see how 30 minutes is needed to drink up as against ten. The Minister has made this provision to facilitate the orderly implementation of licensing measures.</p>

Concern has been expressed in both Houses of the Oireachtas and by other interested parties that the provisions in the Bill which prohibit persons under the age of 18 from being in the bar of a licensed premises after 9 p.m. might adversely affect wedding receptions and other private functions. To make the matter clear, the Minister has decided to submit amendment No. 30, which provides that it shall not be unlawful to allow a child accompanied by a parent or guardian or a person aged 15 to 17 to be in the bar on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending. I hope this provision allays the fears which have been expressed on this subject. The Minister does not propose to change the existing provisions of section 35 of the 1998 Act, which prohibit persons under the age of 18 from bars where an exemption order is in force.</p>

If a parent or guardian is present, should there be a restriction on any age group in a public house?</p>
          <p eId="para_903">How is this provision to operate? Complaints were made in relation to the bar areas of hotels and to function rooms. What provisions are being made to accommodate tourism in the west, where there are many small pubs and hotels? The tourism industry believes that unless children are also allowed in the bar area, this provision will eliminate much of the business anticipated by small public houses. While this is partly addressed in that the prohibition will not apply to the bar area of a private function in which a substantial meal is served, is there any reason a person over the age of 15 years should not be allowed into the bar area where a substantial meal is not served or a function held? For example, will families staying in a rented cottage in Connemara for a week be prevented from remaining in a pub after 9 p.m. if there is a nice sing-song taking place or a group of musicians playing in a corner?</p>
          <p eId="para_904">These are some of the reservations that have been made to Members, not only by the Irish Hotels Federation but also by the rest of the tourism industry, which believes it will lose out. How can we marry the different views on the matter? By and large, the circumstances I described present no threat to anybody. There is no threat of disorderly behaviour, nor do any of the Minister's other concerns arise. Concerns have been expressed because visitors from continental Europe expect to be able to go into sessions in pubs in the countryside as a family. This is regarded as a normal experience but does not appear to be permitted under the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">There are no restrictions if the session takes place outside a bar. The provision relates to bars, whether in hotels or elsewhere. However, function rooms, dining rooms and entertainment rooms are not captured by the legislation and children of any age may attend them for a wedding, funeral, traditional music event or other reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The policy of the legislation is clear. We are making a real change. Aside from children who happen to be employed on the premises in question, which we discussed earlier, and the exemption provided for with regard to private functions at which substantial meals are served, many of which are family-type events, our policy is to stipulate that children will not be permitted on licensed premises after 9 p.m. Were we to take the route envisaged by Deputy Costello, we would set aside the policy of the legislation, which is clear on the signal we want to send on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_907">I understand the Minister of State's concerns and the reasons young people should be discouraged from being in bars after 9 p.m. However, anyone who has attended events such as engagement parties and late afternoon christenings, will be aware that most of them take place in licensed premises, at least in the Dublin region. The definition of a bar in the Bill as a counter or a barrier across which drink is and can be served would, I presume, include most function rooms. Function rooms, whether in a GAA club or even a hotel, usually have a counter. Perhaps the definition needs to be changed. Many pubs are more akin to a lounge than a bar. Should differentiation be applied on this basis? There should be some attempt to facilitate family occasions and tourism. Anybody who has visited the west will have seen sessions at which children sit quietly enjoying the music.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Perhaps we should move towards some of the continental models in which separate children's rooms allow young people to enjoy themselves, whether with PlayStation or in other ways. This is especially important in terms of tourism as it would allow adults to relax. At 9 p.m. most people, especially in rural areas, are getting ready to go out, whereas in Dublin, where the culture is different, most have already gone out by that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_933">This section is about the production by persons aged between 18 and 21 of evidence of age, which can be established by a Garda age card or a passport, identity card and driver's licence. There is considerable concern among organisations such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Youth Federation and the Council for Civil Liberties that we are targeting young people and imposing on them the burden of having to produce documentation proving their age. They believe that to be discriminatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">The section puts on a statutory basis a fairly unworkable requirement. It seems that the compulsory requirement for young people to prove their age coupled with the need to do so using specified documents - we all know from recent statements that these documents can be easily replicated - involves our pretending that we are doing something to address the matter. It is causing anguish abroad that we are operating in a fashion that discriminates against young people. I have some concerns about the section.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_935">I have similar concerns. The section criminalises legal activity by outlawing the consumption of drink among those who are of an age at which they are entitled to do so if they do not carry specified identification. This measure does not exist in any other jurisdiction even though the Minister referred to New Zealand. However, it does not have such a law and specifically rejected a similar proposal in 1999. Under age drinking is best tackled by enforcing a requirement to check people's ages but not by making it a crime to fail to carry identification. A voluntary scheme is already in place, of which almost one third of people have availed. Approximately 30% of publicans found guilty of selling alcohol to people under 18 did not have their premises closed, although this is required under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000. Our legal system should implement existing laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The requirement that a certain age group rather than another possess identity cards breaches the spirit of our equality law and might be contrary to Article 40.1 of the Constitution, which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_937">All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">I ask that the criminalising of young people not be pursued by the Minister on Report Stage so that those who are between 18 and 21 can legally consume alcohol without the threat of a criminal conviction or a fine.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_940">The new obligation to produce an age document to gain admission to bars is intended to assist the licensee to ensure compliance with provisions relating to under age consumption of alcohol and to assist the Garda in enforcing the law. I was intrigued when Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to "legal activity" but drinking is not so much a legal as a lawful activity, provided that it is carried out in accordance with the legislation - that is a technical point.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">The requirement was amended on Committee Stage in the Seanad so it would apply only after 9 p.m. Since people under 18 years must have left licensed premises by that time, amendment No. 33 means that the mandatory requirement will apply only to those between the ages 18 and 20 who are in the bars of licensed premises at any time between 9 p.m. and 10.30 a.m. the following morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Several types of document are specifically mentioned in the legislation, including a Garda age card, passport and driver's licence. Provision is made for prescribing other documents by means of regulations. For example, the Minister will consider prescribing a Northern Ireland voter's card as an acceptable age document to facilitate visitors from Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">We must be serious about the manner in which we tackle under age drinking and this section, which I accept weighs on a particular section of the community, has been introduced so we can enforce the law. There is no question of young people being targeted in isolation. The principal people targeted by the legislation are the licence holders, who are being threatened with closure orders in the event that the age requirements of the legislation are breached. A closure order can be issued in the event that the provisions of the Act, in terms of age restrictions, are not being complied with. Furthermore, to ensure clarity of identification of persons in licensed premises, it is necessary, for the greater good, to introduce this provision. While I accept that organisations representing young persons may express reservations about this provision, when the nature and scale of the problem we face is balanced against the infringement of personal freedom that is involved it becomes justified on the basis of the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Amendment No. 33 is a drafting amendment to make clear that the requirement applies only to a person of 18 to 20 years who is in a bar after 9 p.m. The third subsection is being amended to make it clear that the offence can take place only after that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">This does not improve the situation. There is an inherent contradiction in it. While I understand it is the intention of the Bill that this should be going on with the knowledge of the licensee, the licensee is immediately penalised for knowing about it, irrespective of what action he takes to deal with it. He is immediately in breach of the Act from the moment he has knowledge that it is happening. What licensee is going to telephone the Garda to report this? It should be deleted.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">Currently, gardaí are not allowed to enter a premises if they are not in uniform. The Minister is concerned that undesirable behaviour is likely to be discontinued once the person concerned sees a garda in uniform. However, this raises a question about a garda inspecting, examining or observing public houses. How will this work in practice? Is there any precedent for this? Will a garda sit in mufti at a bar and wait for someone to commit an offence or become quarrelsome and then arrest him or her?</p>

There must be some way in which a garda out of uniform can identify himself or herself as a member of the force. Citizens on the street have the right to ask for identification. If gardaí can enter private premises without a warrant, citizens should have the right to know his or her rank, station etc.</p>
