#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator McHugh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline his plans to provide a solution to the student protests in Ramelton, County Donegal, regarding the overcrowding on the school bus to Mulroy College and Milford community school.I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide the necessary resources to upgrade the Mullingar sewer network and sewerage treatment plant in order to allow the town to develop as a gateway town, as envisaged in the national spatial strategy.I have also received notice from Senator MacSharry of the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to review the allocation provided in the pre-budget Estimates for the local government fund with a view to increasing the allocation to reflect the rising costs local authorities face in the execution of their functions.I have also received notice from Senator Minihan of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the reason for the delay in awarding the building contract for a new Cork school of music.I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain to reason for the delay in the building of a ten bed extension to Carlow District Hospital.I regard the matters raised by Senators McHugh, Glynn and MacSharry as suitable for discussion and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Minihan and Browne may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Will the Leader of the House consider a minor amendment to the Order of Business which would allow a short debate to take place on No. 2? I understand fully that it is a procedural motion to allow all relevant documentation to be sent from the sub-committee to the tribunal of inquiry to investigate matters surrounding the Abbeylara incident, but two members of my party – there may well be others – are interested in contributing on the matter. I am not suggesting that a long debate should take place. While I am aware this issue was not debated in the Dáil, we order our own business. I would be interested to hear from the Leader the reason we are not being given a chance to have a short debate on the matter in which, no doubt, there is a degree of interest among Members on all sides of the House.In relation to a substantive matter, will the Leader find out from the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the reasoning behind its decision to close the youth offenders centre at Shanganagh in south County Dublin? This is a retrograde step. The lack of available spaces for young offenders is a scandal. The Minister proposes to close a further 20 places at the disposal of the juvenile justice service for young people out of control. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister to reconsider this proposal. It is wrong in the extreme that he should be deciding to asset strip various parts of the prison system in order to make up for shortfalls in funding in his Department. I ask the Leader to express this view to the Minister, given the fact that crime figures announced yesterday show a substantial rise in the level of serious and juvenile crime. We need adequate, well resourced places in our prison system for young offenders. Taking away a further 20 such places at this stage is a retrograde step.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Is the Senator proposing an amendment to the Order of Business?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I will not propose one at this stage, but will be interested to hear the Leader's response.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Before I call the next speaker, on a point of information, the tribunal has sought the records and documents relevant to the investigation by the joint committee into the Abbeylara incident. Standing Order 91 provides that such records or documents can only be released with the express leave of the Seanad.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am aware of that.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I support Senator Hayes in his concern about the closing of the centre in Shanganagh. I listened with interest to the interview with the Minister, Deputy McDowell, this morning. He introduced an element that was a little troubling when he pointed to some posters put up by Amnesty International in which there was a general context of racism and a question asked about members of the previous Administration. It may have been an unfortunate poster, but that is not a reason to exclude Amnesty International. It places us in an invidious position compared to other countries which have allowed in Amnesty International. I understand the rationale is that there is already an inquiry taking place, but I do not see the reason it should be excluded, particularly in view of its record.The Government is selling off State assets to cover its debts. There is no doubt about this, but it is false economy. It appears as if the centre in Shanganagh has been deliberately starved of placements with the result that there are now only 21 young people there which gives an apparent reason for closing it down. There are many more applicants who would be suitable. It is a great pity in a situation where treatment is available.In the last Parliament there was legislation which got a certain way in the Dáil concerning the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law. While it fell with the calling of the general election, I believe it will be introduced again. Will the Leader indicate when this will happen, if it will be introduced in this House and if the Government contemplates any changes to it? As usual, it was heavily based on the UK model. We have learned a little since. Perhaps it would be a good time for the House to use its expertise to include better material and a fresher way of looking at things than the tired old UK model.Will the Leader indicate if time will soon be made available to take No. 19 which deals with the military operations envisaged against Iraq, our part in them with the refuelling of aeroplanes at Shannon Airport and, in particular, the arrest by Irish security personnel of Irish citizens merely taking photographs of aeroplanes and personnel? This is quite extraordinary, if we are a neutral country. In the light of the fact that none of these arrangements passed through either House of the Oireachtas we really should debate the matter.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I have no problem with the Order of Business. I am somewhat reluctant to support Senator Hayes in regard to No. 2. I read the High Court judgment on the Abbeylara inquiry and it did not make great reading for Members of the Oireachtas. There was a succession of mistakes made and we would need to be well advised before we return to the area again. First, we must get the constitutional and legal matters sorted out.Will the Leader provide time for a debate on a disturbing story on the front page of this morning's edition of the Irish Examiner? It relates to a claim by the respected campaigner for the homeless, Fr. Peter McVerry, that homeless persons are routinely assaulted in four Garda stations in Dublin. This is disturbing regardless of the view taken on its veracity. It is a classic example of the type of situation that should be dealt with by an independent Garda authority, which we do not have. It is unfair to the Garda that there is no process to deal with such complaints. It is also unfair to society. There is a certain irony in the situation developing in Northern Ireland where convicted terrorists may well end up supervising the police while ordinary law-abiding citizens down here have a sense that the Garda is not accountable to them at all. It is a matter of urgency that we debate the case mentioned and the wider issue of the proper accountability of the Garda.Senator Hayes raised the issue of crime. It is right that the related issue of alcohol should be raised by one such as me, who is fond of a few jars. I do not believe the laws in regard to under age drinking are sufficiently rigorously enforced. Any parent of teenage children knows that this is the case. Unless parents lock up their children, they know they are not safe in this regard. A cultural shift is necessary in order to create an impetus for the enforcement of the law in this respect.The last time I raised this issue an angry senior member of the Garda contacted me and said I was criticising the force. I was to the degree that the gardaí involved were not doing their job, but the issue is greater than that. Violent crime in society cannot be separated from the 50% increase in the per capita consumption of alcohol over the past five years.I refer the Leader to the disturbing situation which has arisen in Palestine in the Middle East. A UN official was killed by the Israeli defence forces last week in controversial circumstances. Saddam Hussein has not got that far yet. He has never killed a UN official. There is a case for a significant debate on the Middle East. It is a festering sore, which is an offence to civilisation, whichever position one takes, and most of us are revolted by the brutality on both sides. However, we should not walk away.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I raise an issue which relates to, as always, the spectacularly empty Press Gallery. Is it time to find some other use for it because it is never used for its intended purpose?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The bold boys could be sent there.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Perhaps.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Senator Ryan to continue without interruption, please.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Three issues that were raised first in the House and perhaps in the Lower House were run as major news items by the media a week or six months later. Senator Higgins raised the question of the refusal of permission to Amnesty International to conduct an inquiry in our prisons. This was reported on in today's newspapers as having been raised in both Houses a week ago, yet the media did not notice. One of my colleagues raised the issue of the delays in driver testing and a full response was provided by then Minister of State, Mr. Bobby Molloy. Three months later the media made a major fuss, having discovered the information that had been made available to this House. Last week we discussed the question of the capping of the supplementary rent allowance during Labour Party Private Members' time and four days later the media discovered the story. We should to say to our friends in the media that they should pay a little attention because real business is done in both Houses of the Oireachtas. Journalists do not have to create artificial stories because real stories are raised if they paid attention, which they can only do if they are present in the Press Gallery.There was torrential rain in Cork earlier. I would like the Leader to raise with the Minister for Transport the conditions which Iarnród Éireann imposes on its customers. I saw people queuing in torrential rain to buy parking tickets at machines which are located in the open despite the availability of plenty of shelter at the station in question. It is the most idiotic parking facility that has ever been conceived, even by the most obdurate bureaucracy
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	That is a matter for CIE.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I would like the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Transport who, in turn, should raise it with Iarnród Éireann. It is an absolute disgrace.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I look forward to a similar 15 minute contribution. I refer to the issue of flooding and the relief made available to be administered by the Red Cross in counties Meath and Dublin. There has been serious flooding in Cork. The relief needs to be extended equally throughout the country. There has been severe flooding in Togher and Blackpool and companies have been put out of business. We must be fair and equitable across the board in regard to flood relief. The time has come for us to seriously examine the implementation of proper, corrective measures to address flooding in order that we do not have to provide relief all the time. I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to attend the House to issue a clear and definitive statement that humanitarian relief will be extended and debate the measures he is putting in place.I would welcome a debate on the Middle East. I have an interest in the Middle East, having served on a number of occasions in Palestine as a peacekeeper. It is an issue of huge international importance.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Will the Leader make time available and ensure the attendance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a debate on the Garda annual report which highlights our alarming crime statistics? The Minister said he was concerned about the 83% increase in the incidence of assault and the 81% increase in sexual crimes. If Members of the Oireachtas allow this report to pass without debate it will be an indictment of us and indicate an acceptance or tolerance of this level of crime. That is not our intention and I hope the Leader will ask the Minister to discuss this as well as the closure of Shanganagh Castle and the other matters mentioned by my colleagues. An urgent debate is required on this issue.I also wish to raise the situation of survivors of child abuse and the Government's decision to renege on its commitment to make an interim payment of €10,000. That commitment was made last February but it has come to the notice of organisations representing the victims of abuse that it will not now be paid and that a further report is awaited. It is unacceptable to treat such a sensitive matter in so cavalier a fashion.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Senator has made his point.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The third matter I wish to raise relates to flooding and compensation. Six years ago £2 million was supposed to have been provided for flood relief in south Galway—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Senator has made his point.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I support the call for a debate on flood relief. Six years on and the money has not been spent in south Galway. That is not fair and we want the issue of compensation investigated.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I allow considerable latitude to the spokespersons of each group but I must remind other Senators that there is only half an hour for contributions on the Order of Business. Members should be as brief as possible.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Unlike Senator Ryan, I am grateful to Iarnród Éireann for bringing me to the Seanad in good time but I agree with his comments on the lack of enforcement of the law on under age drinking.I wish to raise an equality matter. Perhaps on an appropriate occasion the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will come to the House to discuss the enforcement of the Equal Status Act. I am glad a prestigious golf club such as Portmarnock Golf Club will stage the Irish Open but I am distressed that it is one of two clubs which do not obey the equality law. If there is a prosecution and fine, the Bord Fáilte grant might be withheld. I am surprised that members of this club are happy to be seen as a bastion of social reaction. The law is not just for the little people but also for the big shots.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	As a patron of the Irish Penal Reform Trust I was concerned about the refusal to allow Amnesty International into the prisons, particularly when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated in an interview that it was because there were other people with clipboards going around the prisons. They could have been told to take their time. In view of that and the recent protests by prisoners in Mountjoy Prison against changes in visiting rights, could we hold a debate on the Prison Service and its value? We could discuss the recidivism rate which is, apparently, the highest in Europe. There is also a high number of mentally ill people in the prisons.
#MargaretCox	unknown-#MargaretCox-party	unknown-#MargaretCox-dob	unknown-#MargaretCox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	As you will remember, a Chathaoirligh, in the last Seanad, Senator Henry introduced a Private Members' Bill on assisted human reproduction. At that time it was agreed that the Government would introduce a Bill in this area. We are now hearing reports of babies being cloned in Italy so it is time for us to regulate such matters because such work could be undertaken here. We need to address the matter immediately.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Senator Cox is quite right – cloning could take place here.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to attend the House for a debate on the Downings Harbour development project? Urgent confirmation of the project is required. A community led development group in Downings was given a commitment of €631,000 by the former Minister, Deputy McDaid, on behalf of the previous Government.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	There is no need for the Senator to elaborate on the matter for which he is seeking a debate.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Confirmation is needed because the money earmarked for the project has been withdrawn. This constitutes a serious breach of faith by the last Government, which is the same as the current Government.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Is the Senator seeking a debate on the matter?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Not one cent has been made available for Downings Harbour. Since the situation is serious the Leader should confirm whether the money has been withdrawn.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Leader should seek clarification, and perhaps even correction, from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General on the insurance issue that is currently being debated on the "Today with Pat Kenny" show on RTÉ Radio One. We now find that an anti-terrorism clause has been included in domestic insurance policies. It would appear that members of certain religious and political groups are not covered in the event of damage to their person or property because insurance companies put such damage down to anti-terrorism measures. The Leader should clarify whether there is a choice of having an opt-out clause for policy holders.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I support Senator Minihan's call for the relevant Minister to attend the House to discuss flood alleviation measures. In November 2000, severe flooding occurred in Lucan and in response the local county council carried out substantial flood alleviation work. Further work is to be undertaken in January 2003. This year the Lucan area seems largely to have escaped the deluge.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	It went elsewhere.

We had a wide ranging discussion on the fishing industry last week while debating the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. It would be appropriate, therefore, for the House to convey its good wishes to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in his deliberations. He faces a tough job in conducting those negotiations so I am sure we all wish him well in trying to secure as good a deal as he can for our fishing industry.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to return to the House to discuss a number of important issues included in his brief? In particular, I would like him to address something to which he referred on radio this morning. He said he was not taking seriously incidents of violent street crime against young people. He also said it was not worth putting resources into it. This is absolutely unacceptable. I had a young person in the car with me this morning and when he heard this, he said it was a joke. He could not believe the Minister would treat street crime in such an offhand manner.The Shanganagh issue is related. Why are there not more people in the centre in Shanganagh? Is it because there are no prosecutions against them? The Minister should also address the situation in Mountjoy Prison about which we heard a lot during the week. He should further address the Lindsay tribunal report and the possibility of taking criminal proceedings against the pharmaceutical companies, as recommended here by the Minister for Health and Children. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is saying it would be a monumental waste of resources to take action.On a lighter note, I have great respect for the Minister but he said this morning he hoped to be canonised after his term in government. He has a lot of work to do before being canonised.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Does the Leader believe it is appropriate for the Secretary General of the Department of Transport to investigate her own Minister? Would it not be more appropriate for the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the matter? This issue is obviously unhelpful to the Minister and Aer Rianta, who have much important work to do instead of being distracted and having their time wasted. The matter needs to be cleared up as soon as possible.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I support Senator Hayes on the need for a short debate on the Abbeylara tribunal. Why has it taken so long for the issue to be dealt with? It is two and a half years since John Carthy was shot and there is much public disquiet. I would appreciate a short debate on the issue.Following the publication of the White Paper on rural development, the national rural development forum was set up. Three times in the last three years a date has been set for it to meet, but each time it has been postponed. It was given the responsibility for monitoring and ensuring funds from the National Development Plan 2002-06 went to rural communities. There is public disquiet among several organisations. I represent an organisation—

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Due to the significant increase in the crime figures, I ask the Leader to question the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about additional resources for the Garda, as 2,000 extra gardaí per year were promised before the general election. There is no provision for the recruitment of extra gardaí in the Estimates. We can all be critical of the Garda, but there was a report yesterday stating there was no wrongdoing in the compilation of crime figures in Waterford Garda station, a matter about which there was a lot of controversy earlier in the year.Senator Mansergh would be better off taking the matter of Portmarnock up with the Taoiseach as he is an honorary member.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Will the Leader raise the redevelopment work at Punchestown racecourse with the Minister for Finance who should conduct some form of value for money audit into the £25 million spent there by different Government agencies on redeveloping its facilities? It seems much of the money drawn down by Government agencies was not spent on what it was supposed to be spent. This should be examined.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Senator Hayes asked for a short debate on the Abbeylara inquiry, a question which the Cathaoirleach answered. Senators Hayes, Higgins and others were involved in the inquiry but, as the Chair explained, it is a procedural matter.Senator Hayes also raised the question of Shanganagh prison and asked if I would convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the concerns of the House about Shanganagh. I will do that. This matter was also raised by Senator Norris and others.Senator Norris also raised the question of allowing Amnesty International into prisons to make a report. This matter was also taken up by Senator Ryan. We have already raised this matter in the House and I have contacted the Minister. I wait to hear from him on the matter.Senator Norris asked when the European Convention on Human Rights legislation would be introduced and if it could be initiated in this House. He also raised the issue of item No. 19 on the Order Paper which calls for an explanation of the situation in Shannon Airport whereby American flights are allowed to pass through and stop without the expressed wish of the Oireachtas. I will raise this matter with the Government.Senator Ryan raised Father Peter McVerry's allegation of wrongdoing by gardaí in four Garda stations with regard to homeless people. I have no details on this matter but I will raise it with the relevant Minister. With regard to alcohol and crime, there is no doubt that alcohol plays a role in crime, particularly the consumption of alcohol by young people who are not capable of dealing with large quantities of drink. Senator Ryan also called for a debate on the Middle East and spoke about the flooding in Cork.Senator Ryan raised an important point regarding the absence of journalists in the Press Gallery. Press people do not need to sit in the gallery because they can listen to the proceedings in the Seanad in their offices. The excellent Mr. Jimmy Walsh writes often on the proceedings in the Seanad and I would not like Senator Ryan's criticism to go unchallenged. Nevertheless, Senator Ryan has raised a serious point. We debated the issue of the new housing grant before it was mooted in the other House. The issue of Amnesty International visiting prisons is being raised this morning in the Dáil but it was raised here by Senator Jim Higgins and others ten days ago.I do not know what we can do about this question. Perhaps we are too modest and demure.

Senator Henry spoke about the quantification of the benefits of prison and called for a debate on the Prison Service. I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House again for a debate on this issue. In that regard, we could address the issue of equality raised by the Senator.Two weeks ago Senators O'Meara and Cox raised the matter of surrogacy and how people are going from Ireland to the UK to have surrogacy treatment. They also raised other issues, including cloning. I wrote to the relevant Minister about it and I am awaiting a reply. I saw an Italian man on television this morning talking about cloning and he looked quite dotty. I do not know if he knew what he was talking about.Senator McHugh raised the issue of funding for the Downings Harbour development project very forcefully. I will certainly ask the relevant Minister about that. Senator Feeney raised the issue of the anti-terrorism clause, which I had known about. If one is a member of either a religious or political group, it appears one is penalised by insurance companies on the grounds that one might be subject to terrorism. We are subject to that all day long.Senator Tuffy raised the matter of flood alleviation and said that the Lucan floods had disappeared but one can bet that they erupted somewhere else. It seems that if one stops the floods in one place they come up somewhere else.We all agree with Senator Kenneally in sending good wishes to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern.

I made a major statement on tourism to the House in recent weeks and do not propose to rehearse the same ground in what I have to say today. The Bill is tightly focused and its purpose is to provide a statutory basis for a new national tourism development authority. When the authority is established, Bord Fáilte and CERT will be dissolved and their functions transferred to the new body. The Bill also provides that certain provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts will be repealed to take account of its provisions.Tourism is one of the largest industries in the world and has been on a continuous growth track for years. That growth was somewhat derailed in 2001 for obvious reasons, but if we can surmount the current period of international political uncertainty, there is every likelihood that global tourism will resume its upward trend. Irish tourism has also performed strongly over the past ten years or so. For much of the 1990s it was one of the best performing tourism sectors in the OECD and a star performer among the northern European tourism destinations. Tourism is now one of our major economic sectors. Recent economic studies suggest that it accounts for approximately 5.4% of annual GNP. It generates approximately €4 billion in foreign earnings and approximately €1.2 billion from domestic tourism. The industry supports approximately one in every 12 jobs in the economy.Tourism suffered a reversal in 2001 and is now facing considerable challenges. These, together with significant institutional changes arising form the Good Friday Agreement, are driving a reform of the institutional architecture which the State uses to support tourism development. The Bill is a vital part of this reform package.Before considering the content of the Bill it will be useful to consider the role of the current State agencies dedicated to supporting tourism. Under the Good Friday Agreement, tourism was designated as an area of co-operation. In December 1998 the parties to the Agreement decided that a publicly owned limited company would be established jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, commonly known as NITB, to promote tourism to the island of Ireland. That company, Tourism Ireland Limited, was incorporated in December 2000 and since January this year has taken over responsibility for the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourism destination.In carrying out its international marketing remit Tourism Ireland Limited is undertaking a number of functions previously carried out by Bord Fáilte. These include ownership and management of Tourism Brand Ireland, strategic all-Ireland destination marketing in all markets outside the island of Ireland and responsibility for the entire overseas office network. The new company is also responsible for the international delivery of product and regional marketing programmes on behalf of Bord Fáilte and the NITB while the underlying products will continue to be developed by these two bodies.Tourism Ireland Limited has a staff of 150. Its head office is located in Dublin and it has a regional office in Coleraine. In addition, it has offices in major overseas markets, such as Britain, France, Germany and the United States. It has a board which is mainly drawn from its founding agencies, Bord Fáilte and the NITB, and the tourism industry, North and South. It was an enormous challenge to launch a new international tourism marketing agency just three months after 11 September, but having observed the new company in action in the six months since my appointment as Minister, I can say it has done a remarkable job in meeting this challenge.The longest established tourism agency in the country is Bord Fáilte Éireann. Currently, Bord Fáilte has 130 employees and its head office is in Dublin. As Bord Fáilte has been the State's primary tourism agency for decades, the major element of the Tourist Traffic Acts is concerned, in one way or another, with its functions or the functions of its predecessors.Following the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited, Bord Fáilte retains responsibility for product development, marketing of domestic tourism on the island of Ireland, research and strategic planning, niche/specialist product marketing and promotions, regional marketing, implementation of specific initiatives such as the sports tourism initiative, statutory functions for the registration/grading of certain tourist accommodation, co-ordination of activities of the regional tourism authorities and tourism and the environment.These functions may relate to providing a range of supports to the tourism industry, including those concerned with building the business capability of the industry, improving the quality of product which the industry offers and enhancing its competitiveness. The six regional tourism authorities, RTAs, continue to operate under the aegis of Bord Fáilte.In 1994, there was a major review of the operations of Bord Fáilte. The outcome of that review was a decision that the primary focus of Bord Fáilte should be on international marketing. Matters extraneous to that priority were to receive less attention. The increased focus of Bord Fáilte on international marketing led to greater efficacy in our international tourism marketing which has paid handsome dividends.One consequence of that refocusing of Bord Fáilte's operations, however, was that a decreasing portion of its staff and resources have been devoted to other areas, for example, product development and the environment. These issues have taken on a greater prominence in recent years with a growing emphasis on competitiveness, quality and standards and the actual reality of the visitor experience. Bord Fáilte needs to focus, once again, on some of those areas to help preserve unique elements of the Irish tourism experience.CERT Limited is the State's national tourism training agency. It was established, as a company limited by guarantee, by Bord Fáilte in 1963. CERT has some 90 employees and its head office is in Dublin. It has a number of training centres around the country. Currently, CERT provides education, recruitment and training services for the tourism industry. It has broadened its original role of training support for the hotel and catering sectors to include business development support for all tourism and hospitality businesses.More recently, CERT has moved in the direction of a wider business development role. It helps to build industry capability by focusing on human resource management and improving cost competitiveness.As far as labour supply is concerned, the focus has been on attracting and retaining school leavers, adults returning to work and skills development for workers. These services are delivered through development, provision and design of a range of education and training programmes, together with innovative delivery methods, to meet the needs of industry.As far as industry competitiveness is concerned, the focus has been on enhancing productivity and performance, benchmarked against best international practice. Any business experiencing costs and pressure on margins has to look again at the way it is doing things to determine the efficiencies it can introduce into its purchasing, organisation of work, etc. Tourism businesses are not any different. If support is required, CERT has a range of experience and programmes upon which to draw, a process which I hope to see developed by the new authority.Fundamental changes have occurred in the nature of the tourism industry both globally and in Ireland over the past decade and more. In the context of these changes there has been a growing realisation by the Irish tourism industry that there are other issues which are more important for the industry's future than just visitor numbers. Yield, regional and seasonal distribution and access are key issues on one side of the equation. On the other side of the equation, we have the quality, range and competitiveness of the facilities and products that the tourism industry here offers to its ever more discerning customers.I have spoken in this House recently on the need for industry to maintain its competitive edge. If it does not do so, it will fail to reap the due reward for the massive investment of public and private funds in the sector over the past 12 years, an investment that some economists put at over €4 billion.Another ingredient, the key to the successful development of tourism, is the quality and levels of service that the industry has to offer. It makes little sense to invest millions of euro in building state-of-the-art facilities unless the necessary steps are taken to ensure the quality and level of service are in accordance with what the customer wants and consistent with what that customer has been led to expect, or, to put it another way, excellence in the physical design and quality of tourism products and good investment planning must be matched with equally good operational planning and delivery of services. If operational standards do not match the physical quality of facilities, the market potential of these facilities, from both overseas and domestic markets, may not be realised.In a nutshell, the future success of tourism is dependent on the industry developing and maintaining quality product and quality service which provide good value for money, supported by effective, consumer-led, marketing programmes and the enhancement of its overall business capability.On this day 12 months ago the Government decided that there was a compelling case for streamlining and integrating the delivery at national level of the State's activities in supporting and promoting product marketing and development, human resource development and training in the tourism industry. It approved the creation of a new body for that purpose to encompass the existing range of functions of CERT and those remaining with Bord Fáilte following the establishment of Tourism Ireland Limited. Setting up this new body means that the tourism industry will be able to avail of support from a strong and well resourced agency which will have a clear mandate to take whatever actions are appropriate to help the industry in its efforts to enhance the quality of its products and services and to do so in a manner designed to help it hold and increase its market share in well defined market areas.It will be essential that the closest possible links, teamwork and working arrangements are put in place and maintained between the new tourism development agency and Tourism Ireland Limited. Such linkage is critical to keeping the Irish tourism product closely in line with international consumer demand, and Tourism Ireland's marketing strategy and plans. Accordingly, the working and funding arrangements in place at present between Bord Fáilte and Tourism Ireland Limited will be maintained and strengthened.I have mentioned a number of the key issues facing tourism. While the Bill is not about any of these factors in themselves, it is about putting in place a strong and well resourced body with a clear mandate to take whatever actions are appropriate to ensure these issues are properly and fully addressed. The integration of functions within this new agency should provide a better range of streamlined programmes and services to support the future development of the sector. This new body will be charting the future course of tourism and will build on the existing knowledge, skills and experience within Bord Fáilte and CERT.I hope, however, that it will do more than this. We do not want a new organisation which just consists of two old organisations lightly tagged together and continuing to do exactly the same old thing in the same old way. We need a new dynamic, a clear vision and an organisational structure to deliver on this. A lot of work has already been done on the mapping out of that structure and vision by a joint Bord Fáilte-CERT group, under independent chairmanship, earlier in the year. I hope the result of all this work and the Bill before us will be a highly effective, highly regarded body for the development of tourism in Ireland in the years ahead.There has been strong support for the principle of integration of the functions of Bord Fáilte and CERT from the two bodies, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the staff trade unions. Building on this support I established an interim board on 4 July this year which is charged with the task of ensuring the new authority can be up and running in time for the 2003 tourist season. It has an independent chairman and includes the chairpersons and some existing members of the board of Bord Fáilte and the council of CERT as well as a departmental representative.The interim board's arrangements for recruitment and appointment of a candidate to the position of chief executive officer designate are very well advanced. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the interim board to date and look forward to its successful conclusion.I will now give a brief summary of some of the main provisions of the Bill. This is a tightly focused Bill primarily designed to provide the statutory basis for the new authority. On the establishment of the authority, Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited will be dissolved and their functions transferred to the new body.The Bill contains three Parts. Part 1 contains a series of standard provisions regarding title, interpretation, expenses and the laying of orders made by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas. Provision is also made for the repeal of some provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts which relate to the corporate governance of Bord Fáilte. This is necessary because the governance provisions of the Bill will obviously replace the old provisions relating to Bord Fáilte.For clarity, I should point out that CERT Limited, which is a limited company established by Bord Fáilte, is not a statutory body. There are, therefore, no provisions in the Tourist Traffic Acts which pertain to the corporate governance of CERT.Part 2 is the core of the Bill and contains those provisions necessary for the authority to come into existence and to carry out the functions being ascribed to it. Section 6 allows me to set by order a day for the establishment of the authority. While the official name of the authority is the National Tourism Development Authority, section 7 allows the authority to describe itself as Fáilte Ireland for operational purposes.Section 8 could be regarded as the key section in the Bill and it describes the authority's functions. The primary functions of the authority will be to encourage, promote and support the development of tourism traffic within and to the State and the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services within the State. Within that overall context, the authority will seek to develop the recruitment, training, education and development of persons to be employed in the tourism sector. The authority will engage in research and planning and may engage in advertising and publicity or provide advice, consultancy services, training or support, including financial support.The authority will continue to exercise the powers currently exercised by Bord Fáilte relating to the registration and grading of certain types of tourist accommodation. These powers are spelled out in various provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts which will remain in place. While the Tourist Traffic Acts incorporate the functions and powers in relation to registration, grading and listing of accommodation, they do not prescribe the particular criteria with which a premises has to comply in order to be registered. These are set out in regulations made, from time to time, by Bord Fáilte, with ministerial consent. That process has worked satisfactorily in the past and I propose that it continue under the new authority.I also propose, as soon as the Statute Law (Restatement) Bill has been passed into law, to arrange with the Attorney General for the restatement of the remaining provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts. That will create a single source of coherent and easily accessible legislation relating to the registration and grading functions transferring to the authority.Section 9 is standard and allows me to confer additional functions on the authority. Section 10 gives the authority power to set up companies and to acquire interests in companies. Section 11 allows the authority, either at my direction or with my consent, to delegate certain of its functions and describes the types of body to which functions can be designated. One body specifically mentioned in that context is Tourism Ireland Limited. Tourism Ireland Limited has been constituted as a joint subsidiary of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Irish Tourist Board which is dedicated to the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourism destination.It is timely, given the current challenges facing the peace process, that we insert, via this Bill, the first statutory recognition of Tourism Ireland Limited in the Tourist Traffic Acts. In this context, I understand that tomorrow, the House will be dealing with the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Bill, 2002. The agreement attached to that Bill has important implications for the functioning of Tourism Ireland Limited, as well as for the various implementation bodies under the British-Irish Agreement. I commend that Bill to the House also.Section 12 provides that the authority may contract out certain of its registration, grading and inspection functions under the Tourist Traffic Acts and Schedule 2 lists the relevant provisions. This will allow for the continuation of the current practice whereby Bord Fáilte contracts out some of its inspection and grading functions to private contractors.Section 13 allows me to give general policy directions to the authority as is currently the case with Bord Fáilte. Sections 14 to 22 are standard provisions governing membership and meetings of the authority and conflict of interests and disclosure of information by members or staff of the authority. The authority will consist of a chairman and 12 members. It is important that the authority can establish committees to help in the better performance of it functions and section 23 allows it so to do.Section 24 is a standard provision which puts a cap on the aggregate level of advances which the authority, from moneys provided by the Oireachtas, can make for the purpose of supporting enterprises and projects relating to the development of tourist traffic and the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services. The cap is set at €65 million.Section 25 allows the authority to provide financial aid in relation to the carrying out of its functions and to administer EU schemes. Throughout the 1990s, the administration of EU tourism development schemes was a major factor in the work of both Bord Fáilte and CERT. Although their significance has diminished in the current round of Structural Funds, Bord Fáilte is still involved with administering such schemes. It is important, therefore, that we ensure that the authority is empowered to undertake such work.Sections 27 and 28 contain standard provisions in relation to the submission and auditing of audited accounts and annual reports. Section 29 provides for the application of the Freedom of Information Act to the authority. Section 30 is a standard provision allowing the authority to accept gifts on conditions consistent with its functions. Sections 31 to 33 contain some standard provisions relating to the chief executive of the authority. Section 34 is a standard provision for the appointment and remuneration of staff.Section 35 provides for the transfer of the existing staff of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited to the new authority, on the establishment day, on terms and conditions no less favourable than those to which they were subject immediately beforehand. This provision is designed to give a degree of comfort and security to staff of both organisations who will, naturally, have been subject to a certain degree of anxiety when faced with the prospect of a merger of both organisations. Management or Ministers can give guarantees to staff but from the staff perspective, the legislative guarantee gives the best security of all. When I recently met representatives of the Bord Fáilte and CERT unions I told them I would seek to underpin their position in legislation and I have delivered on that promise. Section 36 is a standard provision governing superannuation.Part 3 contains standard transitional provisions concerning a range of items, including the dissolution of Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited, the vesting of property and the automatic transfer of the rights and liabilities of the two organisations to the authority.Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 list provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1998, that have been repealed, or may be contracted out, as a consequence of the provisions included in the Bill. Finally, I remind the House that I recently launched a process to review Irish tourism policy with a view to generating a new policy framework for the future. The outcome of that review will shape the policy environment for the new authority.I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Senators.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I welcome the Minister back to the House. He was correct in saying it is only two weeks since we had a full and frank exchange of views on the position of the tourism industry. During his address that day, the Minister informed us he would bring this Bill before the House as soon as possible and I commend him on his expediency.I understand the Bill was published on Monday. However, last week when I received a schedule of this week's proceedings, I intended to get a copy of the Bill but was unable to get one. I am sure I speak for the majority of Members when I say I would have preferred to have had the Bill earlier in order to read it and to have had more time to research its contents before expressing my views.I welcome the introduction of the Bill. The Fine Gael group is broadly in favour of its contents. There are many differing views on how the tourism industry should proceed. It is true that CERT and Bord Fáilte fulfil a distinct role in the industry. As the Minister correctly said, CERT was set up in 1963 as a subsidiary of Bord Fáilte so, in one sense, this is a return to the position which existed in the past. I agree with what the Minister said in regard to Tourism Ireland. In recent months it has shown that it is working well promoting Ireland as a tourist destination. Given the context in which it was set up, that is, as part of the Good Friday Agreement and cross-Border co-operation between North and South, it is important that Tourism Ireland has been a success. It shows how cross-Border initiatives in areas of mutual concern can be beneficial and work from a business perspective.There are a number of sections in the Bill about which I have concerns. The Minister referred to section 11 which deals with delegating functions. It states that, subject to the Minister's consent or at his or her direction, the authority may delegate certain functions to another body. This is a rather loose formula of words. It is very important that the new body be independent in so far as possible. It would benefit from being cut free to a greater extent from the Department. It would be more appropriate, therefore, if the formula of words used was not as strong as it seems to indicate.Section 13 allows the Minister to give general policy directions to the authority. It is not appropriate in this day and age that the Minister would have such a wide-ranging role in the functioning of the authority which needs to be allowed to stand on its own two feet. The provision for policy directions from the Minister should not be contained in the Bill.Section 14 deals with the membership of the authority. In the current climate many questions will be posed as to who the members of the new authority may be. Many will wonder whether it will be the usual suspects, the usual array of party political hacks who tend to inhabit such roles in various State organisations. It is important in this era of greater transparency that there be more transparency in the appointment of members to the authority.Section 14 also deals with the time-span which members of the authority will serve. It stipulates a term of up to five years. Membership of the board of most Government agencies tends to last for up to three years. It would be more appropriate if the term of office of the members of the authority was reduced to a period of around three years.Section 35 concerns the transfer of existing staff, a matter about which the Minister has spoken. Inevitably, however, once the two organisations are merged there will be a certain overlap or duplication in administration. I was interested to note that the Minister had discussed the issue with the trade unions concerned. I have spoken to people involved in Tourism Ireland who expressed the view that the development of their authority was hindered by the lack of consultation with the trade unions prior to its establishment. I hope the Minister has learned from this and that he will consult the trade unions affected in both organisations before the new authority is set up.It is quite possible that many members of staff of the new authority will find that their roles have effectively disappeared once the two authorities merge. This is something at which we need to look. Duplication of roles may necessitate a reduction in the numbers currently employed in certain areas of the administration in both Bord Fáilte and CERT.The Bill refers, in section 30, to the acceptance of gifts. I am glad to note that this is at the complete discretion of the Minister concerned. I hope there will be no brandy, cigars or whiskey involved in these gifts.Fine Gael is broadly in agreement with the objectives of the Bill, but it is important that the role of the Minister's office be looked at. I accept that the Minister is a fairly level-headed individual, but there is no guarantee that that situation will continue into the future—

It is important that sections 11 and 13 be amended to take account of this. So many people come to this country with a view of what to expect from the tourism industry. They expect the céad míle fáilte, the broad welcome that has been traditional during the years. However, industry currently employs a large number of people who do not come from the country. While I welcome people coming here from all over the world to work in the industry which would not function without them, it would be appropriate that the new body would undertake some sort of orientation course for non-nationals, as well as indeed nationals, to extend to them the idea of the céad míle fáilte. This is something that is missing in large parts of the industry and needs to be addressed by the new authority.Perhaps the Minister will inform us what impact last week's Estimates will have on funding for the new authority. It is one thing to set up a new authority, but it is another to impose constraints upon the funding available to it. It is very important that sufficient funds are available to it.The Minister mentioned the issue of competitiveness, of which there has been a distinct lack in the tourism industry in the past couple of years. We have seen huge increases in tourism costs. It would be appropriate at this time for the Minister to have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to see if he could look favourably upon VAT reform in the upcoming budget to place us on a more level playing field with our European counterparts. The rate of VAT is much lower in many countries.While I know the Bill does not deal specifically with disability, it is a pet interest of mine, and I would like the Minister to address one issue for me. I received a copy of a disability magazine during the week which quoted Mary Davis, the chief executive officer of the Special Olympics. She said she expected up to 20,000 visitors for this event in 2003. Elsewhere in the article she states, "Carefree Journeys and Holidays – A Guide for the Disabled," which has been published jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board up to now, but has not been updated in this country in over six years and is no longer in print. As an issue particularly close to my heart, it would be appropriate for the new body to look as a matter of urgency at updating this guide for disabled people in the light of the fact that we will host the Special Olympics next year. I ask the Minister to address this matter.The Bill deals with the quality of the product we provide. The Fine Gael Party has no major issue with what is contained in it. I support it and look forward to Committee Stage when the relevant amendments to the sections I outlined can be made.
#KieranPhelan	unknown-#KieranPhelan-party	unknown-#KieranPhelan-dob	unknown-#KieranPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I welcome the Minister to the House to take this important legislation, the main purpose of which is to provide a statutory basis for the new National Tourism Development Authority.  Upon its establishment, Bord Fáilte and CERT will be dissolved and their functions transferred to the new body. This will mean that one body will be responsible for the promotion of training, human resource and marketing skills development in the tourism industry as well as the other vital tasks and roles currently undertaken by the two bodies concerned.The remit of the new authority will be to promote tourism within the State and the development of tourism facilities and services, including the promotion of training, human resource and marketing skills development in the tourism sector. With responsibility for international tourism marketing now resting with the new all-Ireland body, Tourism Ireland Limited, the intention is that this new authority, to be known as Fáilte Ireland, will work closely with the tourism industry supporting the further sustainable development of the sector in Ireland. Perhaps one word, "synergy," best sums up the new body. By taking the best from Bord Fáilte and CERT, the National Tourism Development Authority will be able to influence the tourism market through cohesive policy implementation.While I pay tribute to the excellent work done for many years by Bord Fáilte and CERT, as well as draw notice to the manner in which they co-ordinated such a cohesive approach to the tourism sector, which allowed them to work in tandem with great effect, it goes without saying a single body is surely more able to move in a manner that will benefit the industry as a whole. Merely from a point of implementing policies that will be put in place across the industry, this new system should have a dramatic effect on how we control the industry in the short, medium and long term. Instead of placing the focus on one aspect of the industry, the new body will have scope to implement any changes it foresees as being necessary across the spectrum of the indigenous tourism market. Never has there been a better time to implement this far-sighted approach to the industry.Up to 2000 the country benefited from ten years of exceptional growth in the tourism industry, peaking with the generation of €4 billion in annual foreign revenue earnings and €1.2 billion in domestic expenditure per year. However, 2001 saw an end to this period of growth due to a number of factors with perhaps the most telling being those outside our direct control – the foot and mouth disease crisis and the incidents of 11 September. This change in fortunes has presented many challenges for the industry, but there may be a small silver lining to its decline – it has allowed us time and space to alter the direction of tourism policy.This has been another difficult year for the tourism industry. There has been a marked shortening in the booking period for holidays, which has meant that operators have had great difficulty in predicting the level of business they will experience from month to month. While the latest official figures available from the CSO indicate that the first quarter of 2002 saw an increase of 10.3% on the same period last year, there are other points of concern. While the general level of tourism here has been offset by the increase in the British market, which provided a 6% growth in visitor numbers, the numbers of visitors from the United States and mainland Europe, in particular Germany, have dropped.Some good news emerging in this difficult period has been the ongoing strength of the home tourism market. The most recent figures show that the hotel bed night sales in the market have risen by 15% this year. This surely highlights the importance of the domestic market to the tourism industry. That is the reason the National Tourism Development Authority is such an important addition to the tourism structure. A new strategy needs to be put in place for the future of tourism in order that we can make the most of this great resource in terms of foreign markets and the domestic market. The new structure allows us this opportunity by providing scope to implement change across the industry instead of having to develop a co-operative approach where various aspects would have pulled in the direction that may best suit their particular niche.A number of problems will face the tourism industry in the near future. There needs to be an increased emphasis on delivering value for money, competitiveness, a high quality of service and a unique experience for the international visitor. The cost of insurance cover in the industry is another example of a threat to its competitiveness. Thus, the value of the service we supply will have to be examined.While these may be issues for another day, we cannot hope to achieve these changes without the help of a single body which has power to change the tourism industry as a whole. That is exactly what the National Tourism Development Authority will provide. It is for this reason I urge my colleagues to support the Bill as it represents the best way forward for the industry.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I welcome the Minister. I also welcome the Bill and wish the new agency, Fáilte Ireland, every success. I am delighted to have a chance to speak on the Bill. I come from a hotel business background. Members, therefore, will have a job to stop me talking about this sector, about which I am so enthusiastic. I am also enthusiastic about the commitment of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to the tourism sector.The new agency comes at a critical time for tourism, although I do not think its setting up – useful and necessary as it may be – will have much impact. Much more critical to the future will be the strategy review of tourism that the Minister has instituted, in respect of which I wish him the best of luck. I have every confidence that something can happen from it.The last time we took a root and branch look at the needs of tourism the results were truly spectacular. That occurred in the late 1980s after nearly 20 years of virtual stagnation that dated from the outbreak of the Troubles in the North in the late 1960s. By the late 1980s it was clear that tourism was a tired product that was going nowhere. We saw the writing on the wall, as did those involved in it, but for once did what was necessary at the time. In one of the actions we took we were helped along by Europe, in particular the Commissioner with responsibility for competition at the time, Mr. Peter Sutherland. He forced airline competition onto the European agenda and also introduced competition in other ways. The success of companies such as Ryanair and Easyjet is directly due to the doors he opened for them. He could not have done this without the type of competition he sought to develop.The arrival of competition in the Irish market, particularly airline competition, meant the removal, virtually overnight, of the largest structural obstacle to tourism – the high cost of getting to Ireland. This meant that Ireland started at a disadvantage as against other countries in Europe, even compared to our next door neighbour, Britain. The success of tourism in the 1990s was firmly based on low cost access. However, I would not hold out the prospect that cheap access could do the same for us any more.The other major element we got right on the last occasion was the product. We faced up to the fact that compared to other destinations Ireland was quite a boring place to visit in the 1970s and 1980s. There was very little for visitors to do, not only in the evening, but also in daytime and at night. We revitalised the product, which involved a vast amount of work in which we were helped by Europe in the form of the Structural Funds, which we used quite cleverly.We invested heavily in visitor facilities. We made sightseeing for the general visitor much more meaningful with such things as interpretative centres. The centres get a lot of criticism on occasion but they have made it much more interesting for visitors to come and see the countryside. We developed a very impressive range of facilities for the more specialised market to encourage activity holidays; not just sport but other types of activity holidays. We improved the range of ways in which people could find amusement after dark.In his previous ministerial appointment, the Minister helped a great deal by listening to the debates on the legislation he introduced. Backing that up was a corresponding investment in hotels and restaurants that matched what they offered to the varying needs of the modern visitor. The result was 15 glorious years and it was no wonder many people thought it would go on forever. Of course it could not last. Long before the twin shocks of last year – the foot and mouth outbreak and September 11 – there were already many signs of overheating in Irish tourism.All the aspects that are now pointed out, such as the dwindling value for money, the lessening of our traditional welcome, the pressures that come from many visitors on a little island – were all becoming increasingly obvious to anyone watching the industry from the outside. But while the good times continued, nobody wanted to hear.My father started a holiday camp in 1947 called Red Island, which was in Skerries, in north County Dublin. It was just after the Second World War. There were beds for 500 guests who all came from the north of England: Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and so on. His objective was to get them to come back again and it worked very well. That is the business I grew up in. I would love to think his success was due to my eight year old self, backing him up but I am not sure I would get away with that. It was a great way to grow up and a great business experience as well. It was a perfect tourism product for that time. We did not have competition then from Spain, Portugal, Italy and everywhere else. It suited the England of that day also because access elsewhere was not that easy. The business continued for over 20 years and we even made a little money.But then things changed and what had been the perfect product slowly lost its shine. This was not because of anything we did or did not do, but because the world had changed. It had moved on and what was a great holiday idea in those lean first years after the war, was no longer right for the very different marketplace that was evolving in the late 1960s and early 1970s. We did the sensible thing; we closed Red Island down.We did not make the mistake of thinking that the world owed us a living because we had got it right once. We did not look for subsidies or tax breaks to cushion an inevitable decline in business or for grants to transform one kind of holiday formula into another. We faced up to facts and we acted accordingly. There are very few things that are permanent in the world of tourism. One of the key facts that the strategic review has to face up to, is that the future will simply not be able to sustain all the businesses that thrived in the golden years. We are moving into a different kind of world and I hope we will be smart enough to realise it. It is only if we do realise it and plan accordingly that we can get the best for the country out of tourism in the years ahead.The prospects for growth have radically altered. During the 1990s we saw the graph of world tourism stretching beyond 2010 and the forecast said it would continue to boom into the future.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I will give Senator Norris four or five minutes. I do not believe the boom will continue. What happened in 2001 in New York and this year in Bali or whatever other calamity may befall us in future, this is not just a blip on a steadily rising curve. It marks a change in the development of world tourism and we must plan for that change rather than hope it will disappear. Tourism will continue to grow but not at the exponential rates that people used to expect. In any case they were unsustainable from an environmental and cultural point of view on a little island like this. People will continue to travel, but they will travel more carefully, more thoughtfully. They will become much more demanding in what they expect. Since travel now has a risk as well as a cost, they will expect it to deliver more than they did in the past.The destinations that will prosper in this new environment are those who can adapt to it and give the new travellers what they want. Even in a smaller world tourism market, and a smaller share for Irish tourism within that market, we can increase the benefits that tourism brings to the country. First, we must stop trying to be all things to all men. At one time, only the numbers counted because the only way to go was up. Attempting to grow Irish tourism by growing the numbers is to rush towards unsustainability. There is a limit, which many would say we have already reached, to the number of visitors who can fit on a small island without radically changing the nature of the product on offer.The second thing we must do is to compete through excellence on the quality of what we offer rather than the price. We cannot compete by lowering prices, but we can do so by raising our quality to match the prices we have to charge. I was interested to see yesterday that according to the Condé Nast organisation, Ireland now has four of the top ten hotels in Europe. That is the kind of achievement on which we can build. We cannot build one of the ten best hotels in Europe in every backyard. We are not going to build a profitable and sustainable tourism sector without a rethink of where we are going. I welcome the Minister's review and believe it will succeed if he takes that attitude. I do not believe we will waste our resources trying to flog a dead horse. It is in the hands of Tourism Ireland and I look forward to seeing it in future.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Quinn, for allowing me to share his time. He is somebody with considerable expertise in this area and I sincerely hope he did not cut himself short.I welcome the Minister to the House. He may like to know we are discussing the report on the task force on immigration this afternoon. I expect it will come as some relief to him that he is now in a Ministry that handles tourism rather than these other matters, although he has done a good job in both, so far anyway.While listening to the debate on the monitor, I was struck by the absence of reference to the establishment of the national tourism development authority on an all-island basis. It is striking that we have this united approach where there is co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Republic. It is very significant. These slow moves behind the scenes are crucially important in building a good relationship between both parts of the island. I notice that it can be called Fáilte Ireland and presume that is principally for the south although I am sure the idea of fáilte extends across the Border.I am sure the Minister is well aware, as I am, of the significance of cultural tourism. It is an area that needs to be protected. People do not come here for the climate. The Minister will have the support of many in this House for seeking to protect the fairly small tax concessions to owners of large historic houses. It is very important as people come to Ireland to see these places. I take my hat off to people like Tony Ryan who did such a stunning job in Lyons. He is a wealthy man and perhaps he does not need it but he is entitled to be rewarded for the wonderful work he has done. That house never looked as good, even on the day it was built. Places such as Birr Castle, Castle Leslie, and Clonalis where the O'Conor Don comes from are all part of our cultural heritage. People come from all over the world to see them and they should be protected. The Minister knows that the centenary of James Joyce's great novel Ulysses is coming up in 2004. I am aware that he has plans as he is farseeing in this and he is taking a very keen and interested approach. Although the James Joyce Centre will be very centrally involved in marking this event, we are also going to need help. Next year for the first time every last cent of State assistance will be removed. It is an extraordinary situation.I recently spoke to the person who heads our FÁS scheme, which is being terminated even though it is a headline scheme, about her position in terms of redundancy. We will have no staff, which is extraordinary. We are heading towards 2004, when we will be attempting to make bricks without straw. The Minister is aware of this and I thank him for his positive attitude. However, something must be done. In the long term the only way that centre can remain open, when I am in my box or sunning myself in Cyprus, which I hope to do in a few years, is through the provision of statutory funding. If we are serious about cultural tourism, this issue must be examined.I refer to the question of what we offer. Senator Quinn mentioned the product, some of which is absolutely stunning and marvellous and of which we should be proud. However, there are elements of which we cannot be proud. I will take, for example, North Great George's Street, a section of this city which I know very well. We have won the battle in large measure. Several buildings are open to the public and attract people to the area, which represents a section of the 18th century, preserved as it should be.Revolutionary plans have been drawn up for O'Connell Street that may rehabilitate the entire area, but the link between that street and North Great George's Street is Parnell Street, which is a scab on the face of Dublin. It is intolerable that such a street can be permitted to continue in its current state in the heart of the Taoiseach's constituency. It is full of lap dancing clubs, gaming establishments and half demolished buildings while the Ambassador Cinema has been turned into a boozer.Tourists who send letters to newspapers write about how they love the countryside, the welcome and farm house holidays, in particular, but complain about public drunkenness, people urinating and vomiting all over the place and the dirt and filth of the streets. I salute the workmen of Dublin Corporation for their heroic attempts to keep O'Connell Street clean, but this issue needs to be addressed.Following the establishment of the new authority, I hope a proper, good marketing campaign will be undertaken in countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom and America to promote the product. We have been weak in this regard. I hope the authority supports Aer Lingus which is usually the first port of call for visitors to Ireland and has operated to a high standard.I also refer to the way in which the authority will deal with other aspects of the tourism industry. It was noticeable, particularly in Dublin, that in its old, unreconstructed days, Bord Fáilte had a terrible tendency to peddle only its own product and neglected other groups, cultural attractions and so on. The board must broaden its scope as it cannot get along any more peddling its own product only and not advising or briefing its staff about other issues. We need to sell the whole of Ireland, not merely what Bord Fáilte selects.Let us end the discrimination against the north side of Dublin. For example, the Georgian Trail is located on the south side of the city, but the greatest Georgian architecture is to be found on the north side. There is a fear, however, in this regard because of the existence of places such as Parnell Street, to which the tourist authorities are afraid to direct middle aged tourists in case something untoward befalls them.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	76	As a Dublin based politician, I do not aspire to follow Senator Norris, but warmly support many of the sentiments and views expressed by him. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire agus go n-éirí an t-adh leis san phortfolio nua atá aige. I commend the Minister for initiating this important Bill after a brief period in office at a crucial time in the history of tourism. On 4 July last he signalled his intention to accelerate the reform of the State's tourism agencies by appointing an interim board charged with the task of putting a new national tourism development agency in place. It is one of the key tourism elements of the new programme for Government.The introduction of the legislation is another significant step as it will provide for the establishment of the authority on a statutory basis and is an important strategic move forward as part of an overall package to address the industry. The authority will bring Fáilte Ireland into being and subsume Bord Fáilte and CERT. Notwithstanding Bord Fáilte's shortcomings, as articulated by Senator Norris, I pay tribute to the board's work since its establishment in the early 1970s and the work of CERT, which the board established.While I have more experience of dealing with CERT than Bord Fáilte, I commend CERT for the enormous work it has done in spreading the message, not only within Ireland, but also abroad to attract and encourage foreigners to visit Ireland. CERT provided high calibre training during the years that was second to none. I am delighted Senator Quinn referred to his previous existence running Red Island camp. When I moved to the north side of Dublin in the early 1960s, the camp was one of the key tourism projects with which northsiders identified and about which there was tremendous enthusiasm among them. Although it went out of business, it had a tremendous reputation in terms of the opportunities it afforded to the people of Dublin and its hinterland. I salute the contribution the project made to the industry at the time.However, as various speakers have pointed out, the tourism industry is experiencing changed times following a period of unbroken and unsurpassed growth over the past ten to 15 years. One of the most telling features of the Minister's brief stewardship has been his speedy response to the changing fortunes of the industry. He has a programme of action in train which has been widely welcome throughout the industry. It is heartening that Members, who have great knowledge and experience and insight into the industry, have commended him on his work.Significant events, such as the foot and mouth disease crisis and the fall-out from the 11 September tragedy, have affected the industry, but they were well flagged. Equally, the ITIC's examination of the industry in the form of the Tansey report pointed out a deep deterioration in price competitiveness since 2000. Senator Quinn, when referring to prices, stated it was not the only issue. While I defer to his experience and insight, I want to focus on it as part of the overall question of value for money because it cannot be easily ignored. If we do, it will be at our peril.Last week the Minister announced a major review of tourism policy in the Dáil. I warmly welcome this as the most significant strategic move he has made and, like others, believe it will be one of the most fundamental steps taken in terms of the long-term viability of the industry. The review is an acknowledgment of the difficulties being experienced and the crossroads at which the industry finds itself. It will seek a wide ranging rounded package of measures to take on the new challenges facing the industry. Reservations have been expressed by Members on the other side of the House about the Department leading this major review but I warmly welcome the Minister's decision to have the Department spearhead it. It is intended to complete the review by March.One of the central tasks of the review is to address the developments of last year. They were important developments but they do not hide serious growing concerns about the price and quality of the tourism product we offer our customers. That is the what we should be addressing now and it has been prioritised by the Minister in the review. There is a vigorous national debate on this matter, some of it anecdotal and some of it emotive, about the competitiveness of the Irish industry and the prices being charged.What must be conveyed throughout the tourism organisations and right down to the smallest operators, and I am sure the Minister and the Department are doing this, is that it is not their perception of value for money that is important or relevant but the perception of visitors from mainland Europe, and in particular Britain. Britain is traditionally our biggest market for the tourism product. Paul O'Toole is the chief executive of Tourism Ireland Limited, the new body being established in this significant step for the future development of tourism. It will replace Bord Fáile and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Mr. O'Toole spoke about his concern that the events of last year were markers for long-term issues. He said it is no longer good enough simply to be "cool" to attract tourists. He regards competitiveness or value for money as the issue.In 1995, almost two thirds of European visitors surveyed on behalf of Bord Fáilte rated Ireland as giving good value for money. By 2001, however, that proportion had declined to just one third. This deterioration is even more acute if one looks at the German market, although Italy, France and the Netherlands show similar trends. We have to face up to the disturbing developments we see in the results of these surveys. A Forfás study indicated that Ireland is the second most expensive country in the eurozone behind Finland. Under the headings of pubs and restaurants, the latest ranking of consumer prices positions Ireland as the joint most expensive country of the 12 eurozone countries and the second most expensive for drink.I have heard stories from people who have visited hotels in Dublin, none of which is at or near the pinnacle of the market, and been charged up to €5 for a cup of cappuccino. In many instances they were charged more for a cup of cappuccino than most other establishments would charge for alcohol. That is abominable. There is no justification for it. One can talk about Government policy and Government intervention in the market by way of VAT, excise duties and so forth or one can talk about the upward trend in inflation but it does not take an economic wizard to know that these prices are way out of line with inflation, regardless of whether it is wages or general inflation.I am not trying to talk Irish tourism or Dublin tourism into a type of negative psychological trap. That is not my purpose or motivation. Great things have happened in the tourism sector. There has been a marvellous ten to 15 years of unprecedented growth. The industry developed to such an extent that by 2000 it had left farming behind under a number of headings. Could anybody ever have believed that it would outstrip farming? This industry plays a key and strategic role in the economy and we must ensure we do everything possible to maintain and promote it. In so doing, we must remind the operators at the coalface that they bear a heavy responsibility in this regard and should work with the Minister, the Department and the various agencies.

I can understand the demands on his time. I welcome the Bill. The Labour Party has no reservations about it at this juncture.Tourism has been a major part of our economy in recent years and during the economic boom it seemed to take on a life of its own. No matter what one did, it seemed to be successful. It generated massive revenue but suffered a devastating setback with the events of 11 September 2001 and the foot and mouth outbreak, neither of which anybody could have foreseen. It is important when such debacles occur that we have an appropriate recovery programme which can be used to help limit their effects and assist the various elements of the tourism industry to get back up and running as soon as is practicable.This Bill provides for the amalgamation or merger of two distinct bodies, one of them statutory. I presume this decision was not taken without many consultations and negotiations over various issues. The merger of any two organisations can have teething problems which cause certain degrees of difficulty. The views and reactions of the people involved in both boards are critical to a smooth transition to a new entity which has the same functions of the original two entities. It is important, particularly in this sector, that issues do not arise under the single governing body which would hinder the progress of the industry in general.The majority of our tourists, as Senator Fitzgerald pointed out, come from the UK. It is important that we market this country in the UK and seek to exploit every ounce of potential in that market. For years before our tourism industry became so successful the majority of our tourism business came from the UK, particularly in times of low economic performance. It is important, therefore, that we continue to concentrate our marketing in the United Kingdom. As the saying goes, "when all fruit fails, welcome haws". I do not intend that remark to be flippant but it is important for the tourism industry that we maintain a strong emphasis on marketing this country abroad and particularly in the UK.The training and development agency CERT provides a high standard of training to the many people who go through that school of education. It has been critical to the delivery of a good service in the sector. That is of the utmost importance. Service is something everybody is conscious of when they go away on a break or on a holiday. It is critical that there is a good standard of service and the people who deliver the service should be suitably qualified to do so. One can have the best product in the world but if there is a bad conduit between it and the public, the product can fail as a consequence. CERT has proved over the last number of years that it is an institution of high standards, including high academic standards. It also ensured the delivery of all products in whatever areas to a standard that was second to none.The level of expertise and professionalism was obvious in bars, hotels and other sectors of the services industry. We must maintain the emphasis on attracting people to that sector and, as with other occupations, such positions must be lucrative in order to attract key personnel. We must concentrate therefore on providing such factors because if one pays peanuts one will get monkeys. We must continue to scrutinise remuneration levels so that suitably qualified personnel will continue to be employed in the services sector.In the context of the Bill, I presume that trade unions, employers and the employees themselves have been consulted in order to successfully merge both existing bodies. It is welcome that progress has reached this advanced stage.Senator Fitzgerald quite rightly mentioned the exorbitant price of a cappuccino. One can spend much more for a cup of coffee in upmarket cafés and hotels in Dublin and elsewhere, excluding Cork and Kerry of course, than one would in a foreign holiday destination. Even taking taxes into consideration, there is an unswerving determination to get every last cent from customers. That is a bad mindset, however, because people are easily influenced by high prices. We should keep an eye on prices that are being charged in the services sector and overpricing should not be tolerated. In the end, it comes down to the customer's decision whether to purchase a product, and that can determine whether visitors will return to a destination. If they feel the person behind the counter is acting like the famous highwayman of old, Dick Turpin, then they will not come back. Not everyone who comes here steps off the plane at Shannon Airport with money spilling out of their pockets.I thank the Minister for taking time out of his schedule to debate the Bill with us. We may wish to tease out particular issues on Committee Stage.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I wish to raise a few concerns about the Bill. Section 11 allows the authority to delegate certain of its functions, but that may have an impact on staff who may find that their functions have been delegated to Tourism Ireland, for example. Bord Fáilte has an environmental role and in certain cases it can object to planning applications, yet this is not referred to in the Bill. In addition, the tourism review should be completed before the Bill is enacted.Staff should enjoy mobility between the national tourism development authority, Tourism Ireland and regional tourism authorities. Such an interchange would facilitate both the staff and organisations concerned.In his speech the Minister mentioned niche marketing as an important role of Bord Fáilte, yet it is not referred to in the Bill. Perhaps he could explain that omission in his reply.As regards the membership of the proposed national tourism development authority, there will be no worker director on the board. The Minister should explain why this is so. The Bill refers to TDs and Senators not being members of the board of the authority but councillors are not mentioned. I would question that as well.Section 32, which restricts the chief executive from commenting on governmental decisions or from criticising the Minister, is a broad provision. It appears to be extreme and is obviously topical at the moment. Section 8 allows the new authority to establish and operate tourism information offices, but I am concerned as to how this will affect the role of regional tourism authorities.Tourism development is close to my heart because there is huge untapped potential for such development. Many areas are not considered to be traditional tourist destinations but they should be. I represent an area of west Dublin which includes the Liffey Valley, many heritage buildings, environmental amenities, shopping facilities and very good hotels. There is therefore a major potential for developing tourism in that area, particularly heritage and environmental tourism, but to my knowledge there is no tourism office in the area.We need to broaden the focus on tourism to include areas which are currently excluded, such as Kildare, Mayo and Sligo. While the international marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination is important, we must also exploit the domestic market to its fullest potential.I hope the finer details of the legislation will be addressed on Committee Stage.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for his work to date on tourism development. I recognise also the work undertaken by the previous Minister, Deputy McDaid. He did an excellent job and it should be remembered that during his term of office many unforeseen difficulties arose which caused major problems.The proposed authority will deal with the country as a whole, which is something that should have been done years ago. Nonetheless, I recognise the amount of work that has been done in the past by many organisations promoting tourism on a countrywide basis. In particular, I compliment all the regional tourism authorities that were involved.On Committee Stage I look forward to questioning the Minister in order to clarify certain issues in this regard. The regional authorities did an excellent job, although complaints arose about overlapping of responsibility for tourism promotion, in some instances by local authorities which had tourism committees. I refer to the midlands region where we had Shannon Development which did an excellent job in tourism promotion in south west Offaly, north Tipperary, County Clare and part of north Kerry. However, there was always a problem with those who believed they were on the periphery of an area and whose tourism interests were not being looked after. Those involved in tourism looked at the size of some of the tourism organisations – Western Tourism and so on – and believed they were too big to concentrate on particular specialised areas of tourism.County tourism groups were set up in most counties and also did an excellent job. Farmhouse tourism has developed in the last five years, particularly in certain areas where farms were hard pressed. They have now diversified and moved into tourism, introducing pony trekking, fishing and shooting. We have an ideal opportunity to develop this kind of tourism, though local authorities have much work to do to ensure the water quality of our lakes and rivers improves in order that fish life returns. Tourists can then return to enjoy their fishing.There are also great opportunities for shooting tourism. I went to Scotland recently on a shooting trip where shooting is quite a big tourist attraction in the Perth area in particular, where groups are brought to shoot grouse and partridge. While it is not cheap, we must look at developing this sector of the market. There are reasons for the fact that some wildlife we had in the past does not now exist. We should bring in more foreign tourists, not just those interested in shooting, but also other family members who may want to enjoy other tourist attractions.Many of our historic sites need quite a bit of work by Dúchas and the Office of Public Works. It is next to impossible to park a car next to some of our historic sites, let alone buses. If we want to attract tourists, we must provide facilities and ensure when people visit areas, they are welcomed and there is proper parking. While excellent work has been done at some sites, other important sites have practically nothing – there has been no development whatever. When families visit particular regions, one family member may have a specific interest in the area and the rest explore the area. We must ensure they go home to spread the good news in order that others will visit the area.We should compliment hotels which have spent a lot of money on developing their facilities. The Department and other bodies have given substantial grants to aid development in hotels, to many of which great credit is due. Their owners took the initiative and put facilities in place when the numbers visiting Ireland were not as high as they are now. There is now accommodation in most towns and one has no problem getting beds for a busload of tourists in most average sized towns, particularly in the midlands; in the past it was hard for a carload of people to obtain accommodation in a bed and breakfast establishment for the night. We must compliment those who have put money into hotels and ensure they are helped in any way we can, as some of them have had problems over the last 12 months. I spoke recently to people in Galway who said tourism in the area last year was as good as it ever was. There is great credit due to the Department for going out to America and promoting Ireland. Some might say a large amount of money was spent promoting tourism in Ireland, but that is what this is about; we cannot expect people to come here if we do not go out and sell ourselves. That has to be done.I mentioned the development of golfing facilities, which has been excellent, but we must look at our costs. There are people who saw the high numbers of visitors and took the opportunity to rip them off. This must be examined as we have to be competitive with our prices, which unfortunately has not been the case in some areas. The new tourism organisations must state we have to be competitive and look at our costs. If costs are too high in our hotels, they must be altered to ensure tourists enjoy their holidays at a reasonable cost.I thank the Minister and look forward to dealing with this important Bill in detail. There will be questions on various sections which we can raise at a later date. I wish the Minister well with this difficult portfolio as he kickstarts the tourism industry. He comes from County Kerry, the pride of the country, and it will be no bother to him to ensure tourism is developed all over the country by this new body. Every area will get its fair share of development.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the Seanad. It is a legal document transferring the powers of CERT and Bord Fáilte. One problem I have is that the body is to be described as Fáilte Ireland, translated as Tourism Ireland. This does not sound very radical to me; rather it sounds like the debate on the shape of the shamrock on Aer Lingus planes. If the word "Bord" was removed, it might seem odd abroad. There are some pointers in the margin.The Bill deals with the establishment of an authority of 12 members as well as a chairman. I agree with the idea of staggering membership with four members sitting for three years, four for four years and five for five years. I observe that the Minister recently appointed Mr. Páidí Ó Sé to the board of Bord Fáilte. I recommend that the Minister appoint Mr. Michael O'Leary, a constituency colleague of the Leader of the House and chief executive of Ryanair, to the new body. Mr. O'Leary has done more than anyone else to bring tourists into the country. Last week Mr. O'Leary wrote that it took between €300 and €500 for an air ticket to come into this country but less than €30 for a ticket to get out.I recommend that the Minister break the Aer Rianta monopoly by separating Cork and Shannon airports and develop low cost hotels at Dublin Airport.Bord Fáilte Éireann was established in 1955 and tourism reached a high point in 2000. The Celtic tiger economy was healthy, visitor numbers had doubled in ten years to 6 million and employment in tourism had risen by 84% to 138,000 or 10% of the workforce. The old images of cottage Ireland were being replaced by one of a modern, green, people orientated, high quality European destination with the tag line, "Live a different life". Then the problems came. The sheep industry suffered problems in south Armagh, Cooley and Athleague and Osama bin Laden changed matters further on 11 September 2001. The figures for 2001 showed a 5% decrease but those involved in tourism on the ground saw that matters were much worse than that. The figure for United States coach tours fell by 25% in 2001 and may fall by as much as 40% this year. The American tourist spends an average of €806 per person compared to an average British spend of €356.Alarm bells were ringing even before the foot and mouth crisis. Our problem was cost effectiveness. The Irish tourism market was pricing itself out of competitiveness and this has been recognised by the Irish tourism industry itself. We must be competitive if we are to demonstrate that tourists should visit us because we are worth it. It is much easier to bring a person back to Ireland as a repeat tourist than to persuade one to come for the first time.We sold ourselves abroad on the three Ps principle – people, place and pace. Unfortunately the old Ireland of the welcomes is fast disappearing. We are all too busy and many in the front end of the service are not Irish anyway. Young Irish people are not always pleasant servers. It costs nothing to say, "please", "thank you" and "hello" and smile. Mr. Rudi Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, introduced a Smile New York campaign. I wonder how that would go down with taxi drivers in Dublin who do not seem to know how to smile or show any courtesy to tourists and who seem to take tourists for granted. If we take tourists for granted we will lose them for good.I welcome the fact that the Baltimore-Dublin-Washington route will be opened next year. Because holidays are now being booked at the beginnng of the year as well as at the end, advertising must be spread throughout the year. Recognition of the growing role of the Internet and technology booking and advertising is also vital.We must use well known Irish people, such as Pádraig Harrington, Sonia O'Sullivan, Éamon Coghlan, Liam Neeson, Séamas Heaney, U2 and the Chieftains to market Ireland. We must put all hands to the pumps. A successful advertising campaign is being run in the United States featuring the actor Martin Sheen, of the TV programme, "The West Wing".

It has a valued reputation.To ensure growth and consolidation we must decide what section of the tourism market we are in. We are no longer a low cost country and we are not a sun or winter destination. Dublin is a young party city although there are problems in Temple Bar. It looks as if Bord Fáilte will be sponsoring the Irish Open Golf Championship next year. The Ryder Cup will be held in Ireland in 2008 and Irish golf courses have a good reputation. Many featured in a recently published list of top 100 golf courses. Next year we will host the Special Olympics, which will be vitally important for tourism. The European soccer championships in 2008 will be a huge incentive for tourists to visit Ireland. The opening of Croke Park will enable the GAA to show off a magnificent stadium. Last Sunday an Oireachtas team played against a team from the Scottish Parliament in Trinity College. This highlighted the unity of the two countries.

We must promote projects to ensure that the assets of the midlands, particularly the River Shannon, are opened up. Lockey Forest Park, on my own doorstep, is a prime example. More could be spent on the home tourism market if local groups had the facilities.The issues of crime and safety impinge on tourism. The Minister knows all about the policy of zero tolerance, which was promised some years ago. Crime in Ireland will undermine the tourism potential of the country.Litter, the poor provision of health care, bad road signage and traffic gridlock create problems for tourism. We need more indoor facilities and reasonably priced transport. We need hostels for backpackers. In the early 1980s I spent two years travelling around the world as a backpacker. Backpackers will only go where there is value for money, hostels and cheap reliable transport. However, they must be attracted because they are the big tourist spenders of tomorrow.I appeal to the Minister to appoint Mr. Michael O'Leary to the board of the new body. He has done more to bring tourists to this country than any other person, and as he says, "Keep it simple".
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the National Tourism Development Authority Bill, 2002, and I welcome the Minister to the House. It is not long since he was last here to discuss issues relating to tourism. On that occasion we referred to this new tourism development authority. I welcome the fact that the functions of Bord Fáilte and CERT will be transferred to the new body.Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement tourism was designated as an area for cross-Border co-operation and I hope the promotion of tourism on the whole island by the NTDA will be one of the benefits of the Agreement.We have seen the great benefits of the Good Friday Agreement. The forum for reconciliation is meeting today and the House has already congratulated Senator Maurice Hayes on his chairmanship of this body. All the people on this island will benefit from these developments.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I very much welcome the competition in respect of airlines and visitors coming to this country. Obviously, I compliment Ryanair on the work it is doing, as well as Aer Lingus, our national carrier.There have been many complaints about the congestion at Dublin Airport. I welcome the fact that the Minister for Transport has talked about a second terminal, for which many have looked because of the huge volume of traffic passing through the airport.I welcome the fact that other airports have created their own packages to entice tourists to the country. For example, at Horan International Airport at Knock, County Mayo, there has been a big promotion to try get people into the west. There are now promotions of direct flights from Knock to Spain. The advertising in this regard states there is plenty of room to park one's car and that there is no congestion. It is now relatively easy to take flights from the west to Spain.This raises the question of how one gets people into the west. While the promotion by Horan International Airport is very welcome, another issue that should be looked at by the Minister concerns the railway system. I have spoken in the House before about what I call the north-south line, the Sligo-Limerick line, with links to Rosslare. The line has been downgraded on a number of occasions, first by taking away passenger traffic and then freight traffic.During an Adjournment debate last week I stated I was appalled by the disconnection of the signalling system at Athenry, County Galway and the taking up of part of the track. This is sending out the wrong message as regards getting money invested in the railway. Iarnród Éireann has costed the restoration of the service at €100 million. By way of a tourism project, we should get the line upgraded again. A light rail system is certainly needed to get traffic from Tuam into Galway. To get people from the south east to the west, it would make sense to have a fully serviced railway line in place. People arrive at Rosslare and find it difficult to make the journey across to the west. A railway would be a definite answer.I do not begrudge anybody a continental holiday, but some years ago we had a travel tax, which was removed. At a time when the economy is in difficulty we should look at ways of raising money. It might be advisable for the Minister to look at the question of a travel tax in this regard.The BMW region should be promoted more by Bord Fáilte and Ireland West. For too long passengers arriving on chartered flight or coach tours have not travelled outside the mid-west, apart from trips to Dublin. There is, therefore, a strong case to be made for promoting other regions in the country, for example, north Mayo and east Galway. Many tourists go to east Galway to view the architectural heritage, such as Clonfert Cathedral, yet there is very little promotion of angling, forestry and picnic areas. These should be incorporated in the itineraries of the coach tours.St. Patrick's Day has been heavily promoted, especially in Dublin. Similar promotion is occurring elsewhere in the country, which is a welcome development. Senator Moylan referred to the bog trails in west Offaly. It is an example of a different kind of tourism, promoted by Bord na Móna. The railways can be utilised in this.Sports tourism has been in the news recently and I compliment the Minister on his efforts to ensure Ireland co-hosts the European soccer championships for 2008. Perhaps our bid will be more successful than the Scotland-Ireland match last weekend involving Members of the Oireachtas. The holding of the Special Olympics next year will attract thousands of athletes, coaches, trainers and supporters. I hope there will be a sufficient number of volunteers to participate in an event that has caught the public imagination. Athletes from Ecuador will stay in my own town of Mountbellew and volunteers are learning Spanish, which demonstrates their enthusiasm.I hope the proposed new board will be a success. It is good to promote Ireland on an all-island basis and I wish the Minister success.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I welcome the Bill. It is good to see such an emphasis being put on tourism. In view of international competition, tourism must be promoted and it essential that the country be shown in a positive light. However, a recent innovation, one to which I strongly object, shows us in a very bad light. Aer Rianta has introduced a refundable one euro charge for baggage trolleys at Dublin Airport. I was at the airport yesterday morning with American visitors who only had dollars. I had no euro either because I was returning from abroad. Prior to the introduction of the charge it was difficult to get a trolley but now there is no problem because nobody has euro to use them. By the time tourists have changed currency they would have secured their baggage and left the airport.While Aer Rianta is not the responsibility of the Minister, it should be reprimanded for this development. It is the most unwelcome way to bring anyone into the country. There is a conflict in the Government about how near we are to Boston or Berlin. While similar charges apply in American airports, I am not aware of their application in any other European airport. They should be stopped immediately. It is outrageous that older tourists especially may be left to drag their baggage to taxis.With regard to the Bill, several Senators referred to the importance of good pricing. It is now very easy for visitors from countries in the eurozone to make price comparisons and given the parity in value between the dollar and the euro, Americans can do the same. By comparison with countries of which I have most experience, such as France and Italy, prices here for food and accommodation are higher. When I mention this to restaurateurs and hoteliers they say one of their big problems is the cost of insurance. Those involved in these businesses are not overpaid, nor do they appear to be making exorbitant profits. If insurance cover is a big problem I hope the Minister will address it.By comparison with the United Kingdom, services here are much better value. Fortunately, British tourists are easier to attract than those who live further away. However, the Minister should ensure that the promotion of Ireland emphasises that the country is peaceful because there is a misconception that there has been trouble throughout the island, which has not helped the industry. Many Americans consider Europe to be too near the Middle East and, therefore, too much at risk from terrorist activities.Food in the country has attained a high quality and Bord Bia has done good work in stressing the use of Irish ingredients. We owe a great debt of gratitude to those such as Mertyl Allen of Ballymaloo who told us what could be done in this area. Most hotels and restaurants and especially farmhouse accommodation and historic places produce meals of the highest standard.The lack of Irish staff in hotels and restaurants is a cause of concern. Large numbers of staff are immigrants and while they are very good, many cannot speak English and know little or nothing about the district in which they work. Tourists hope to meet locals and find out about the places they visit. While I favour the training of personnel for the hotel industry from Slovakia and other eastern European countries, there is a need to ensure that there are plentiful numbers of Irish staff at the front line.I recently attended a family funeral in County Cork, which follows County Kerry in terms of natural beauty and tourism attractions. All of the family houses being full I stayed in a small hotel where breakfast was prepared and served by one of my cousins. I was surprised to learn that her friend who ran the hotel was short of Irish staff and had asked her to help, given that her training was in what used to be called domestic economy. I hope similar local initiatives occur elsewhere because it helps if breakfast is served by someone with whom tourists can interact.I hope foreign staff are not being exploited in the industry. There is a need to ensure that they are treated in the same way as Irish employees and that there is a good mix of staff at the front line.We complain a Iot about the weather but our spectacular rainfall has given the country some advantages. I have been told that more people come here to visit our gardens than to play golf. I do not know if this is true because it was told to me by a very enthusiastic gardener who also has a craft shop in the middle of a beautiful garden in County Wicklow. We have spectacular gardens throughout the country and they are now open for longer periods during the year. I went to see a very famous garden in Italy last year and if one had visited the same garden here, one would have said it had a few well cut shrubs and nothing else. We have beautiful herbaceous borders all summer and magnificent trees and we need to promote those because they are unique. We should profit from what we have in the way of rainfall rather than complaining about it all the time.Bord Fáilte was excellent at helping people who were organising conferences and I hope that new unit will be helpful in that regard also. I am a member of various international organisations and when the subject of where to hold the next conference comes up, I keep my head down and look at the green vase on the table because everyone wants to come to Ireland and I would be the person who would have to organise it. I realise we do not have big conference centres but we have plenty of space for small conferences which can be more profitable because people come for pre-conference and post-conference tours, and they keep coming back.I was impressed when Senator Feighan talked about backpacking around the world and that we should take care of the backpackers because they are the tourists of the future. They may have visited here in their 20s and decide to come back in the future when they have more money. That is important.The point Senator Kitt made about public transport is important. It is sometimes extraordinarily difficult to get around this country on public transport. I am one of those unfortunates who has got off the Rosslare ferry only to see the train departing in the distance because it does not meet the ferry; it does not go there at all now. Public transport is a problem and I am aware it is being addressed by the Minister for Transport but we have an awful lot to do in that area. Synchronisation of tickets on the buses in Dublin would be a good idea also.An alarming development in the car hire business was brought to my attention the other day by someone who arrived here and tried to hire a car. This American man has a house in County Wexford but he could not hire a car because he was over 70. I do not know if all car hire firms are introducing this regulation but it would be serious if that sort of problem arises. This man's wife managed to hire a car because she was under 70 but if we start to refuse car hire to people over 70, who are big spenders and who, as Professor Des O'Neill of Trinity College Department of Geriatrics told me, have good driving records, it would be a very serious development.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I join with my colleagues on all sides of the House in welcoming the Minister here today and thanking him for being with us. This is the second occasion he has been in the House in a short period of time which demonstrates that the Minister has taken up his new brief with great vigour and enthusiasm and is prepared to drive it at this important time.I welcome the establishment of the national tourism development agency which sets out an important framework for the development of the industry. The setting up of this agency will see the disbandment of Bord Fáilte and CERT; both agencies provided an exceptional quality of service to this State for many years. We talked here today, and in previous debates, about the unprecedented levels of growth in tourism we have experienced in the past ten years and I have no doubt that growth was driven by the enthusiasm, dedication and work of Bord Fáilte and the board of directors. The same can be said about the work of the staff and the board of CERT and the commitment it has shown to this State for many years in terms of the development of the industry. We must congratulate those agencies on that and not forget them with the development of this new agency.This Bill is an important development. We have talked about the crossroads in the industry and we have seen a decline of 10% in the figures for 2001. We are all familiar with the reasons for that decline – foot and mouth disease, the 11 September disaster and the economic downturn throughout the world – but an aspect which is often mentioned but on which there is not enough concentration is the competitive environment in which we now find ourselves. We talk about competition from other countries in terms of their ability to attract tourists and the way we are slipping behind in that regard to some extent. That is something we have to be careful of because it is probably the most important factor. The other factors – foot and mouth disease, 11 September and the downturn in the economy – are ones that other tourist destinations have suffered. We have a role to play in the competitive aspect and the Minister has rightly identified that as the key priority going forward, particularly with his review of the tourism sector and the work he and his Department intend to do in that area.Senator Henry mentioned the element in relation to insurance. I have no doubt that is an important factor and one which is driving the cost base but, nonetheless, there are other pressures which need to be reviewed and I have no doubt that will be done as part of the Minister's review.There are challenges ahead, the most important of which is to return to the growth in the industry. We have seen a fall off in tourist numbers this year, particularly in the west where there has been a drop of approximately 4%, while the east has seen an increase of 25%. That is particularly disturbing at a time when we are examining a spatial strategy, regional development and many other initiatives to try to promote the rural community and maintain people in the west and along the Atlantic corridor. Any measures that can assist in that regard, therefore, would be most welcome.I have talked about the competitive environment. One of the challenges facing us is to maintain our ability to compete with countries like the United Kingdom because visitors from the north western end of Europe might want to visit the area often being referred to as the British Isles. We may be losing out in that regard so we need to review that aspect.Another challenge facing us is to redefine our product and product mix. We have to understand the marketplace and what the markets in these different countries want in terms of tourism projects. We have to look to new markets and perhaps look outside some of the areas we have targeted already. We must examine our facilities and the services we provide because these are vital elements going forward.Senator Kitt referred earlier to the east Galway region which shares some of the same resources we have in east Clare and in the entire Clare region from where I come. Fishing, shooting and forestry trails are vital elements in these areas that have not been tapped into to the extent possible. The River Shannon, which I talked about in a recent debate and on which I will not dwell again, is a vital national resource which has not been exploited to the greatest extent possible.Before the sos Senator Feighan spoke at some length on particular issues and I want to take issue with a number of them. He talked about the Bill not being radical enough. The Bill may not be radical but the implementation of the job of work this board will do and the work of the agency going forward will define the radical nature of what comes forward. I urge Senator Feighan to wait and see what will be in the work programme.There was some discussion about the appointments to the board and mention was made of Páidí Ó Sé. People like him are excellent choices for this type of board. We need people with knowledge and experience who have the image and who understand the position in terms of the west, rural Ireland and the culture associated with those regions. Figures like that will bring so much to the table in terms of defining our tourism strategy. We need people who are not necessarily motivated by money but by the development of the community.I have to take serious issue with Senator Feighan's ill-informed comments about the break-up of Aer Rianta. I wonder what can be achieved by its breakup, about which there has been a lot of talk, but if there is to be balanced regional development, we need to invest in the regions. An airport is a key element of infrastructure in the west where Shannon Airport occupies a unique position. While there is a lot of talk about competition between Dublin and Shannon airports, competition would lead to the destruction of Shannon Airport which must not be seen merely as a profit-generating element but as a gateway to the west and the entire Atlantic corridor from County Kerry to County Donegal.I know it does not fall within his remit, but I urge the Minister to consider this issue because the Departments of Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism work hand in hand in the promotion of tourism in the west. I am concerned that Shannon Airport would never be able to compete with an airport such as Dublin regardless of how it might be resourced. A difficulty would arise in trying to attract tourists to the west. An airport like Dublin could attract tourists from certain areas on a loss leader basis with flights coming in at the behest of east coast interests. This would perpetuate the imbalance of which I spoke and lead to the destruction of tourism in the west unless we are very careful. Those who would suffer are those who live along the Atlantic corridor, not just those who live in Shannon and the rest of County Clare. Shannon Airport is the key to regional development. Other issues of concern to the tourism industry relate to the open skies policy.There are a number of factors over which we have no control and which will prevent Ireland from achieving the same record levels of growth in the future that have been achieved in the ten years up to 2001. Obviously, we have no control over the power of these outside influences which slow down the world economy or the difficulties being experienced by the aviation sector worldwide. There are, however, a number of actions which we can and must take to ensure the tourism sector recovers. We cannot increase the number of tourists coming to this country unless we are prepared to increase access. There has been a discussion of companies such as Ryanair. The airlines and ferry companies are key and vital elements in attracting visitors.I am confident that the persons appointed by the Minister will focus on these elements. I congratulate him on his speedy and timely interaction in the tourism sector and his recognition of the potential decline in numbers. He has taken prompt action to ensure this decline does not continue. The proposed agency and the Minister's constant attention will create a strong and buoyant future for the tourism sector.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I welcome the Minister. Tourism has grown rapidly in the past decade. The benefits of this growth have not been evenly spread, particularly in rural counties outside the main honey pots and Dublin. It is time for the honey to be spread more evenly.There are numerous policy changes and interventions required in the various sections dealing with tourism, particularly the tourism authorities, an issue I have raised many times at regional authority meetings. Tourism growth must be dispersed in a more balanced manner. It is important to give high priority to the support of competitiveness and expansion in the regions and target the development of tourism in rural areas.Over the past decade Dublin has been established as a major tourist destination in Europe and has the fastest rate of tourism growth in Ireland. The fact that the vast majority of overseas visitors enter Ireland via the east coast adds to the imbalance between the east and the rest of the country. Although overall tourist numbers have grown throughout the country, it has been at a much slower rate and very unevenly dispersed, both in terms of volume and value. Tourists mainly go to the long-established honey pots in the western coastal resorts, south Kerry and north west Donegal. One of the main reasons given by tourists for visiting Ireland is the desire for experiences likely to be found in rural parishes and townlands, yet very few visit areas outside the main tourist trail, even then they mostly pass through.Politicians need to examine how tourism development can be more widely dispersed throughout rural Ireland, outside the honey pot destinations. What is needed is a fresh look at the whole issue of the structures in place to develop the product. The Bill goes some way in this direction. We must question whether the regional authority boards are doing a good job or have outlived their usefulness. I have consulted a number of agencies, representative bodies and community leaders and believe it is time for change.Any new regional structure should be in line with the regional authorities or the amalgamation of, say, two regional authorities with a similar product to promote or sell. I suggest the amalgamation of, for example, the midlands and mid-western authorities under the umbrella of a midlands regional tourism board. I come from a midlands county and believe we have been left out of the Midlands-East Tourism board's development plans. The counties in the eastern part of the region are given more consideration. There has been little or no development of the tourism product in County Longford.It is important that the present structure of the board should be re-examined. There is a strong belief among those involved in tourism that there is extensive fragmentation of the sector leading to too many tourism bodies with a lot of little brochures. There is an urgent need for a framework to enable all the bodies to work with one vision and one strategy for tourism development in rural regions.The Bill gives us space to recommend changes to policy and implement mechanisms for the development of tourism. The White Paper – A Strategy for Rural Development in Ireland – stated rural tourism policy must be integrated effectively into national tourism policy, particularly the national marketing effort and a regional approach to economic development. It is important that we act to improve the spatial spread of tourism and review the established tourism board, structures and supports. The setting up of a national board as proposed in the Bill is a good start in the process.In this context, the midlands could be used as the setting for a pilot study of a new approach. The River Shannon with its tributaries and lakes is a wonderful asset which traverses the region. The canals could be developed and there is an abundance of peat bogs which could support a stand-alone tourism facility. Castles and ancient monuments – the traditional rural heritage – are in a state of neglect and should be developed because American tourists find them very interesting. Rural activities such as horse-riding, cycling, fishing, walking and water sports, should be promoted.The Royal Canal has been developed in recent years, although there has been a go-slow in development from Abbeyshrule to Longford and the link up with the Shannon. It is important that it is developed to its full potential by a complete restoration to the Shannon and to develop Longford as a new destination for Shannon based boats. Also, proposals should be brought forward in regard to links with the Grand Canal via Lough Ennell, the River Brosna and the restored Kilbeggan branch.It is important to develop the water infrastructure in the midlands. We should link the Royal Canal at the Boyne aqueduct in Longwood, County Meath, to an extended and restored Boyne navigation and westwards to Ballyconnell and the Erne Waterway. A great job was done ten or 12 years ago on the Erne Waterway and it could be developed and linked up with midlands and the eastern part of the country. There is a lot of food for thought in these proposals and they should be given serious consideration. There is neglect in terms of providing this type of infrastructure in the midland region.If one talks to any tour operator, travel writer or Bord Fáilte overseas executive or carrier executive, one will find they know little or nothing about the midlands. Is it because the present structures have failed us? Rural tourism helps to safeguard and create jobs in rural areas and it is the key factor in social and cultural development. It is also a powerful factor in the rural economy which needs to be promoted and supported. It is important to have leadership and commitment which will get us over the administrative hurdles that make action most difficult. It is important that the Minister should consider the restructuring of the existing boards. The midlands development association, which was abandoned, should be re-established.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well with this Bill. Bord Fáilte has provided a great service to the country since 1955, as has CERT since 1963. On the last occasion the Minister was in the House I mentioned interaction between Government agencies, including the Irish Trade Board and Bord Fáilte, promoting the tourism product and other products in the United States and elsewhere. There should be greater interaction between those agencies and each should know exactly what the others are doing. CERT has done a tremendous job in regard to the provision of catering staff and has produced many fine chefs and people in the catering industry.A number of speakers alluded to our competitiveness in the tourism market and the fact we are pricing ourselves out of the market. I do not know what the Minister is going to do to make us more competitive but we are not competitive in regard to hotel room rates, green fees, food, etc. Years ago we were uncompetitive in regard to transport costs, the price of diesel and petrol, but those prices have come down, yet we remain uncompetitive in the areas I mentioned.We have gone through two bad years following the foot and mouth crisis and 11 September. Those two events had a negative effect on the Irish tourism market and next year every effort must be made to help the tourist board and tourism industry. The Minister stated that the authority will have a number of jobs to do, including product development, marketing of domestic tourism on the island of Ireland, with which I fully agree, research, strategic planning, specialist product marketing, promotions in niche markets, regional marketing and implementation of specific initiatives, such as the tourism sport initiative. I welcome the Minister's initiative in terms of getting people, such as Padraig Harrington, and other great sports people to market the country.Statutory functions of the authority will also include the registration and grading of certain tourist accommodation, co-ordination of activities on the regional tourism authorities and tourism and the environment. I hope there will be no bias towards any region and that each will get its fair share. There was, undoubtedly, a bias towards the south east, the most developed region. The reason was that the most money was pumped into it. I urge the Minister to give all the regions their fair share of marketing and ensure each region is marketed equally.I welcome the setting up of this authority and wish it the best of luck. It is the right approach as we need new initiatives and branding. Will the new authority have a new marketing logo? If so, will it be an expensive outlay? When Aer Lingus developed a new marketing logo, it cost a lot of money and I do not believe it was of any great benefit. In this case, however, a new marketing initiative and logo are important.Section 13 places a lot of responsibility on the Minister who may direct the authority to do something. I hope this will not interfere in the day to day running of the authority. I am not sure I have seen such a section in previous Bills concerning semi-State bodies.I am aghast at section 19 and ask that the Minister look at it again before Committee Stage. In effect, section 19 means that a high ranking official working in the authority could seek election to Dáil Éireann. This is a provision which I have not seen in Bills before the House. I could envisage a situation where a high ranking official could promote the area in which he is seeking election and could provide funds for that region. On election to Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, he could seek leave of absence from the authority but return to it on leaving politics. The Minister must look at this section which is not in keeping with the standards applying to semi-State bodies. I have not seen a provision where a high ranking official could seek election to Dáil Éireann while holding down a top job in the Civil Service or a semi-State company. I urge the Minister to look at section 19 before Committee Stage.I hope when the Bill is enacted and the new board is in place that all the regions will get their fair share of funding. Every region is different and has something to offer tourists. I agree with previous speakers that this country may not be as friendly as it was. There are a number of reasons for that. However, we still have a great product. Fishing is a great sport and tourist attraction. More could be done to develop some of our lakes and rivers. Some fisheries boards are starved of funds to upgrade rivers and lakes. Funds could be used to promote Ireland as a fishing destination and a sporting destination.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I thank Senators for their comments on the Bill and for the strong support they have expressed for it. It is a tightly focused Bill which does not set out a grand strategy for Irish tourism. The forthcoming review of tourism policy will address that.This Bill simply provides for the establiishment of a national tourism development authority which should hopefully bring a new dynamic to developments in the sector. There are many activities, strategies and orientations with which the authority would be concerned. Senators have refered to some of these, and it is not appropriate to spell them all out in legislation. These will be dealt with in the mission statement and corporate plan of the authority, which will be informed by national tourism policy. Some of them may be dealt with in regulations made by the authority and some could, if necessary, be addressed by ministerial direction.It is vital that this legislation be progressed as a matter of urgency. Its early enactment will clearly signal the State's commitment to the new institutional arrangements. We need to ensure that we have the authority in place for the 2003 season. Were we not to do so, it is the view of those most closely involved with driving the implementation process that we could be faced with the danger of organisational drift, lack of focus and uncertainty among staff and industry interests. That would of course be detrimental to the development of the tourism industry and to the credibility of the new authority. I am sure the House shares my concern that the positive momentum which has already been generated should be maintained.Senators have raised a number of points relevant to the legislation, and I would like to deal with some of them. Senator Phelan and others expressed concern about the power of the Minister to issue directions to the authority regarding the delegation of functions and to issue policy directions. On a point of principle, it is important to have that power. Developments can arise which call for such delegation. The emergence of Tourism Ireland from the North-South co-operation process is an example of an important political development which had to be accommodated. The type of body to which the authority can delegate is restricted. With the exception of Tourism Ireland, they are all bodies over which the authority has considerable control. In other words, delegation is kept within the family.As a matter of principle, I consider it essential that the authority conform to overall Government policy, and tourism policy in particular. As Minister, I am responsible for setting overall tourism policy, and I do not believe the authority should be free to ignore or depart from that policy. I do not believe it will, but it is important that I have the power to ensure it does not. This is a standard provision for other State agencies.I fully agree with Senator Phelan about the importance of consulting with the unions and the boards of the two bodies. I have met the unions already. There has been an intensive consultation and preparation process over the past 12 months in order to minimise the possibility of problems, and this has involved senior management of the two bodies. Staff have been continually updated on developments, and that process will continue.Tourism has done well in the Estimates for 2003. It has basically preserved its budget. Within that budget there has been a major increase – which I arranged – of 20% in allocation to the tourism marketing fund.Although it is not germane to this Bill, Senator Phelan raised the issue of disability guides. My Department and Bord Fáilte have been in contact about updating the accommodation side of this matter at least, and I will look at the issue further.Some Senators mentioned the terms of office of directors. A five-year term is not unreasonable in terms of general practice and it does allow for some continuity. There is also provision for rotation in the Bill and a two-term limit. I fully agree with Senator Quinn that we must continually update the nature and quality of our product to meet evolving consumer demand, a point echoed by other Senators. It is a topic we will have to address in the review of tourism policy. I also agree that numbers cannot be the sole focus. I said in my speech that we must focus on yield as well.Senator Norris appears to be under a misapprehension about the North-South issue. Tourism Ireland is the all-island body for marketing; the authority is not. He and other Senators raised concerns about the quality of the visitor experience. I share some of those concerns but the solutions lie in areas outside my legal remit. Nevertheless, I and the new authority will do whatever we can to push things in a positive direction.Senator Fitzgerland and others paid tribute to the great achievements of both Bord Fáilte and CERT. It is important that we put our appreciation of those achievements on the record.Senator McCarthy mentioned the importance of Britain to our tourism prospects. I assure him it has played a central role in the recovery strategy launched by Tourism Ireland this year and that the British market has delivered handsomely. He was also correct in pointing out that the tourism industry must show itself to be a good employer offering good conditions to its employees. The image of the industry as an employer has improved enormously, and CERT has worked very hard with the industry on that aspect in recent years.Senator Tuffy raised the environmental issue and Bord Fáilte's involvement. There are many activities and orientations with which the authority will be involved. Bord Fáilte has a long record of concern in the environmental area. It was probably well ahead of other State development agencies in this regard. The twin pillars of Irish tourism have always been people and place. The physical environment is one of our more fundamental tourism assets. Bord Fáilte's role under the planning acts will transfer to the new tourism authority upon the enactment of the legislation. Bord Fáilte's Tourism Development Plan 2000-2006 and its current product development scheme are infused with a clear environmental orientation. Nevertheless, it is true that the staff resources devoted to the environmental area have declined in recent years due to the priority given to international marketing. That process needs to be reversed. The joint Bord Fáilte-CERT group which laid the ground work for the merger earlier in the year recommended that the new authority have a strong environmental focus.There is no question but that low cost access to this island is critical. In this context, I am working with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and we have been speaking to airlines about this matter. As was correctly pointed out, I am not responsible for Aer Rianta.The quality of the welcome was mentioned by a number of Senators. I agree it is important. We cannot take our visitors for granted and those who depend on tourism for much of their income would be foolish to do so. It is important to recognise the work of CERT in terms of ensuring that the staff at the coalface have as warm a welcome as possible for visitors.Senators Feighan, Kitt and others referred to the less developed areas. In so far as the product is concerned, the new tourism development policy is strongly biased towards the less developed areas. We need to spread the benefits of tourism around the country. There is specific focus in the tourism product development scheme on developing niche products in the least developed tourism areas. I expect the authority to have a strong focus on spreading the benefits of tourism. Bord Fáilte Éireann's Tourism Development Plan 2000-2006 identified the causes and major areas in relation to this.Senator Henry and others mentioned the need to improve and develop facilities and services at Dublin Airport. The authority, as well as I, will keep a sharp eye on all issues which impact on access and arrivals. With regard to the Senator's specific on baggage trolleys and so on, I will ask the Minister concerned to take that up with Aer Rianta.Competitiveness was mentioned by a number of Senators. I will repeat my views on this, which I have set out on a number of occasions. If we lose our competitive edge, we will suffer. Competitiveness remains a central concern and it will be a central concern of the authority. It will be central to the review which, among other things, will be undertaken in respect of the industry. I have said on numerous occasions that it would be easy to ignore problems such as this, to pretend that they do not exist, but if problems exist in the industry, it is necessary to address them. If we do not, we will lose some of our market share. We are trying to increase it, not reduce it.Senators Dooley and others mentioned the need for closer liaison between transport and tourism policy makers. This has been a particular priority of mine and will continue to be so. I note what he had to say about Shannon Airport. It is of immense importance that we not only improve low cost access to this country but that we particularly improve access to it from the United States of America. I had a number of discussions in America regarding this issue. While I welcome the return of the Aer Lingus Washington-Baltimore-Dublin route, it is of pivotal importance that we also attract other airlines. I am confident that we will have some success in this regard in the not too distant future.Senator Bannon and others mentioned the question of regular tourism structures. Once the authority is established and bedded down we will examine the regional structures. I agree that the issue of co-ordination of effort and resources needs to be examined. Many people have made the argument that there is currently too much duplication in the industry. When resources are not as plentiful as they were previously it is necessary to ensure we act with regard to developing and promoting our product in such a way as to maximise the resources available.I thank all the Senators for their comments and support. Senator Paddy Burke spoke of the interaction between agencies promoting Ireland abroad. This is addressed via the foreign earnings committee which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern. I understand he is very much involved in this.With regard to foreign marketing and a new logo, Tourism Ireland has its own logo for foreign marketing and there is no intention to introduce a new one.Over the past year or so, we have been involved in the most radical overhaul of our national tourism agencies in decades. They are embarking upon one of the most fundamental reviews ever to take place in the history of the industry. Over the past 11 years we have seen an investment in Irish tourism in the region of €4.3 billion between the public and private sectors, and this was a worthwhile investment. From small beginnings tourism today is a major player in the economy. It is our second most important industry, directly employing 150,000 people and generating foreign revenue earnings in excess of €4 billion and €1.2 billion in domestic earnings. Tourism is set to become our largest industry in the not too distant future. Therefore, it is appropriate at this time to take stock, consider the product we have developed and decide where we go from here.At the commencement of this new millennium, the industry is at a crossroads. It is crucial we take the right road in terms of improving access, developing our marketing strategy, improving our environment and infrastructure, improving the skills which are so important at the coalface of the industry, making the product even more sophisticated, dealing with the structures and making them fitter and leaner for the marketing battle which lies ahead. Underlying all this is the recognition that the industry has changed worldwide. It is a tough old world. One must hustle for business. One must be in the marketplace and be aggressive in terms of such marketing. One must have a product of the highest quality and one that is competitive. The passage of this legislation will help us to achieve those objectives.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	95	On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, I welcome this opportunity to discuss this important issue in the Seanad. I convey the apologies of the Minister for not being able to be present. He is abroad on Government business and has asked me to stand in for him.Almost every family in Ireland has suffered over the years in that they have been affected by emigration. The question of involuntary emigration has been a major challenge for successive Governments. For many years society was not able to provide employment for all our people and emigration became the only option for many. There were other reasons of a social nature that led many to conclude that they had no alternative but to emigrate. Many of those who left were, unfortunately, inadequately prepared for the challenges of living abroad and consequently suffered greatly. On the other hand, many Irish people achieved much success abroad and contributed greatly to their adopted countries, as well as to Ireland. The remittances sent home by Irish emigrants over the years are well known and testify to their desire to give something back to their native country.Official figures show that, despite increasing levels of prosperity in more recent times, some 20,000 people continue to emigrate each year. This is still a substantial figure. To some extent, the continuing relatively high level of emigration is masked by the even larger numbers of people migrating to this country. Some of these are returned emigrants while others are citizens of other countries coming to work or study here. It should be noted that the 20,000 who emigrate are not leaving in the same circumstances as previous emigrants.With this background, the Government, together with the social partners, agreed on a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to address the special needs of those Irish emigrants abroad who were particularly marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. This was to be achieved by the establishment of a task force under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, set up the task force on policy regarding emigrants in the latter part of last year and it held its first meeting in December 2001. The chairman of the task force was Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon and its members included representatives of the social partners, the voluntary agencies which provide services to Irish emigrants and the Departments most closely involved in this area. To ensure that the views of the Irish overseas were adequately reflected, representatives of Irish agencies in the United States and Great Britain were also included.Its terms of reference asked that it recommend, inter alia, a coherent long-term approach to emigration and meeting the needs of emigrants. In this regard, special consideration was to be given to pre-departure services, services for emigrants overseas and services for returning emigrants. Particular emphasis was also placed on addressing the needs of vulnerable young and elderly emigrants. The task force initiated a public consultation process to ensure that all interested individuals and groups would have the opportunity to contribute to its work. It received a wide range of submissions and met with a number of people to discuss issues relating to its terms of reference. Members of the task force also travelled to Australia, Britain and the United States to meet with voluntary agencies providing services to Irish emigrants in those countries. In this context, I pay tribute to the voluntary agencies, at home and abroad, who provide assistance to emigrants and who play an indispensable role in helping them, either before they leave or while they are abroad.The task force presented its report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 28 August 2002. I wish to congratulate the members of the task force, particularly its chairman, Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon, for producing such a wide ranging and thoughtful report in such a short time. The task force recommended that an integrated strategy be adopted to enable the provision of effective support for emigrants in the future. It argued that, for this to succeed, a partnership approach, involving the statutory authorities and the voluntary sector, in Ireland and overseas, as well as the Irish abroad, is needed. In the introduction to its report, the task force set the issue in context very well when it said:The economic and social developments that have taken place in Ireland in recent years, and the new and inclusive definition of the Irish nation in Article 2 of the Constitution as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, provide a new context in which to view the phenomenon of Irish emigration and present an opportunity to put in place a new approach to meeting the needs of Irish emigrants.At a practical level, the task force report set out a wide range of proposals to help reduce involuntary emigration and to assist Irish emigrants abroad and returning emigrants who required special support. Some of their proposals will require action by Government agencies. These include a new module on independent living in the school curriculum, which will apply to my Department and to the National Council for Curriculum Assessment. Other proposals are for the provision of television and radio services to the Irish abroad and the provision of housing and other supports for returning emigrants. Additional proposals require increased financial support for services provided by voluntary agencies at home and abroad.The task force also recommended that greater recognition be given to those Irish who have emigrated, or who have been born abroad of Irish descent, through measures such as the establishment of an awards scheme and the provision of increased support to Irish community, cultural and sporting activities abroad that help people to maintain and express their Irish identity. The task force said it believed that new structures would be needed both to achieve the policy objectives and to implement the practical measures suggested in its report. It went on to recommend that responsibility for overall policy on emigration be given to the Department of Foreign Affairs and it proposed the establishment of a new agency for the Irish abroad under the aegis of that Department to co-ordinate the provision of services for Irish emigrants and Irish communities abroad. The task force also recommended a significant increase in the level of official funding for emigrant services. Last month, the Government approved a proposal by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to establish an interdepartmental working group to consider the recommendations in the task force report with a view to submitting proposals to the Government at an early date. That committee has met on a number of occasions and is expected to report shortly.It is too early to anticipate what measures the Government may take on foot of the report. It is clear that many of the recommendations will require further consideration and development before they are ready for implementation. It is likely, therefore, that the recommendations will have to be phased over a number of years. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to protecting and supporting the Irish abroad by establishing the task force in the first place. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear that he does not intend that the report should gather dust on a shelf. At the same time, the extent to which the Government will be able to provide additional resources will have to be considered in the context of the overall spending plans for next year.I assure Members of the Seanad that the Government remains committed to the important issue of adequately addressing the needs of our emigrants abroad and particularly the most vulnerable and disadvantaged of our emigrants, both young and old.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new portfolio.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I too welcome the Minister to the House. I thank the Leader for agreeing to put this matter on the Order Paper today. It allows us to have a comprehensive debate following the report of the task force on emigrants which was published last August. It is a very important report and I welcome the fact that the commitment given in the PPF to establish such a body was honoured. Important consultative work has been achieved by the task force over the past year or so under the excellent chairmanship of Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon. We now need to know what will be done with its recommendations.It is fitting that we address this issue in the Seanad, which has a long and proud history of dealing with matters that affect the Irish abroad. Ten years ago the issue of votes for Irish emigrants abroad was first raised in the Seanad. It is important that the first House of the Oireachtas to debate this issue is the Seanad.I am sure the Minister will appreciate that all sides of the House would urge him and his Cabinet colleagues to deliver on some of the recommendations. I welcome the fact that an interdepartmental working group has been established, that it has met and that it will shortly produce its report on how best we can proceed to implement some of the many good recommendations that came out of the task force report. It is significant that the issue is being debated.I thank Paddy O'Hanlon and the members of his task force, many of whom I know. The number of people throughout the world who made contact with the task force is outstanding. The task force visited the United Kingdom, Australia and the US and held hundreds of meetings with bodies that represent the Irish abroad and received countless representations from the public. It is good that there is interest in this issue, including at home, in regard to how Irish emigrants are being treated by us and the plan of campaign that will be implemented in the coming years to ensure their contribution to our society is recognised.As the Minister stated, our view of emigration has changed and that has largely resulted from the success of the economy in recent years. I am 33 and when I was attending school and college, significant numbers of my friends had to leave the country. That is no longer the case because of the opportunities that exist in the economy for people to take up employment in Ireland. Our view of emigration has changed, therefore, because of changing economic circumstances but, as the report correctly highlights, there are people who are not in a position to make those choices as they live in difficult economic circumstances and are forced to leave the State. We must be conscious of these people in particular.The Minister stated approximately 20,000 people leave Ireland every year and it is interesting that a significant cohort of the population still decides to emigrate despite the availability of jobs. These people must be kept to the fore of our minds in terms of developing policy to help them to settle in the countries in which they have chosen to live and to keep them in touch with what is happening in Ireland.As the Minister pointed out, many young people leave the country for one, two or three years to gain new skills and experience or develop language skills and then return home. That is a positive development which should be welcomed. However, we have arrived at a new definition of what the nation is about, which is also a positive development. The notion was that to be Irish, one had to be living in Ireland and it held sway for 70 or 80 years but since a new settlement was negotiated under the Good Friday Agreement, a new understanding has been reached about who are the Irish. The Irish are not only those who are resident in this jurisdiction or in Northern Ireland but also include the diaspora, who have been greatly helped by our past two Presidents. The diaspora still have links to Ireland. They are proud of the country and help it in as many ways as possible. The Government must recognise and develop those links. As John Hume said on countless occasions in the past, if we manage together as a people to develop the goodwill and support for Ireland abroad, there will be tremendous opportunities for the State.The report makes a number of practical and sensible suggestions. It proposes that an awards scheme should be established that would recognise the exceptional service of the Irish abroad, which is an excellent idea. Senator Mooney is present and over the past two days he and I were in Manchester representing the Oireachtas on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. We had the opportunity to meet the officials of many organisations in Britain which represent Irish emigrants. Sterling work is done on a voluntary basis by those people throughout the UK. Many of them look after people who have been marginalised and left to one side in difficult situations.It is important that Ireland recognises the effort and commitment of successful Irish people in Britain who still spend time and money trying to represent those who are less fortunate than themselves. The awards scheme is an excellent proposal that would not cost money and would recognise the contributions of volunteers. I met a number of them in Manchester over the past few days and I was impressed by the work that is being done in the UK. This scheme is worth supporting.The task force makes a clear commitment to the use of the Internet as a communication tool to help Irish people abroad keep in touch with what is happening at home. This is a radical change. Over the past few years, excellent websites have been developed by RTÉ and most national newspapers and there is no reason for emigrants not to know what is going on in Ireland. We must ensure the use of the Internet is promoted. The report suggests the development of a special, corporate website that would deal conclusively with all the issues that affect the Irish aboard. It would not cost a great deal and it is worth supporting.The voluntary organisations that met the members of the task force made a plea to the Government to provide financial support for their work. Investment in this area has increased in recent years but much more needs to be done. Significant work is undertaken with small budgets and I ask the Minister to push for investment in this area at Cabinet meetings. We need to support these voluntary organisations abroad because they do tremendous work.The task force examined an ingenious idea which would help many elderly Irish people living abroad to return home. Deputy Cowley, a Member of the Lower House, has developed an excellent project in County Mayo that provides housing at affordable rates to returning emigrants. The task force has sought the establishment of a pilot scheme in the UK and I call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who has responsibility for this area, to discuss with local authorities whether such a scheme could be undertaken. It is a marvellous idea. If a 60 or 70 year old Irish person is living in London, Manchester or Birmingham, has no friends and has decided to return home, we should do everything in our power to reach out to them and give them the opportunity to return to parts of Ireland that have suffered significant rural depopulation in recent years. The scheme in County Mayo is successful but we must move beyond setting up pilot schemes.The task force also suggested the establishment of a holiday in Ireland scheme to enable many elderly emigrants to return home. This suggestion is worth examining. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, made a similar proposal whereby a cheap fare would be made available so that Irish people could travel to meet loved ones on the continent.There is one proposal, which is central to the report, that would not cost a great deal. It is proposed that one agency should work in tandem with the Department of Foreign Affairs in this area. Progress could be made if one agency dealt with all the Departments of State and took ownership of this project, not only in terms of funding but also in terms of administration. That would be a positive development in the long term. The report recommends that the annual budget of €18 million needs to be raised to approximately €34 million by 2005.The Seanad played a role in this area a number of years ago when it examined the issue of votes for emigrants. The task force also examined this issue but did not reach a conclusion. Every citizen who is living abroad should have an automatic right to vote in the presidential election. Under the Articles of the Constitution relating to the President, his or her role is more than territorial or judicial. It is a role for the nation. The idea is that the President represents the nation abroad. Our last two Presidents have certainly attempted to represent and reflect the diaspora.I ask the Minister at least to consider my proposal. The Irish abroad who are still citizens of Ireland should be entitled to vote in presidential elections because of the significance of the President of Ireland in the Constitution. It is a sensible proposal. Other states have similar means of ensuring their citizens abroad can take part in the franchise. It is worth considering.By learning more about the role of the Irish abroad and reflecting on it we can do huge good in this country in terms of the new multiculturalism that is taking hold. We have much to learn from Irish emigrants and how they managed to fit into new societies and communities. This should be reflected in how we try to provide a good, decent and honourable home for immigrants to this country and create a multiculturalism that is vibrant, democratic and open.

He would have been present for the many previous debates on the issue in the Chamber. The task force has come to no conclusions on the matter, but I must nail my colours to the mast. I would go further than Senator Hayes's noble aspiration of giving the vote to emigrants for presidential elections and state my belief that Irish citizens, like practically all other citizens of the European Union, should have a right to vote in all elections.The famous argument against this proposition is that one would not wish to be waiting for the box of votes from Boston to determine the last seat in Galway West and that the multi seat constituencies and the nature of our proportional representation system mean that votes for emigrants might distort the votes cast on this island. However, I could not help reflecting on the initiative undertaken by the Minister in introducing electronic voting. How could the policy be implemented now that the paper element has been removed?

I also support the Minister's views in that regard.All countries which have introduced voting for citizens of their countries who are non-residents implement a registration process. This can, in a sense, be inhibiting in that it makes people stop and think about whether they really wish to participate. Having registered, they must then physically cast their votes in the various designated centres. The result is that there is no distortion. I accept, however, that Ireland has a small population and a unique electoral system. It is a powerful argument against votes for emigrants and politicians will not vote for it, just as turkeys will not vote for Christmas, and a future Minister for the Environment and Local Government who wishes to introduce this initiative might find himself or herself up against this political reality. The Minister discovered as much on a variety of issues.I welcome the task force report. The volume of work done by the task force is astonishing. The appendix outlines the number of people its members met and the places they visited. It is interesting that there were no elected politicians on these trips abroad. If there had been, would there have been a public outcry about them travelling here, there and everywhere on what would be a legitimate exercise for politicians? I am disappointed there were no representatives of the Oireachtas included and that the initiative behind the task force originated from outside the parliamentary process. It originated in the discussions between the social partners and the Government.This is another example – I regularly get on my soapbox about this issue – of the denial of the mandate held by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas with regard to issues that transcend pay and conditions. The social partnership process has now moved into a range of policy areas where the partners are influencing the Government of the day to such an extent that they can get the Government to agree to an initiative such as this, among many others. It is long past time that the concept of the social partnership process was examined to ensure the elected representatives of both Houses should have some input from the initial stages. They should at least be aware of what is happening rather than being faced with a fait accompli when the agreement made in Government Buildings is brought before the Houses. However, I will not use up my time discussing that issue.I agree with the Minister that there is a focus in the task force report on the changing patterns of emigration from the 1940s through to the present. The Minister correctly pointed out that the 20,000 leaving this country are leaving in far different circumstances from those in which I left. I was an emigrant. I took the infamous mailboat as a seventeen and a half year old innocent abroad, who left the wilds of Leitrim for London where I spent seven years and was involved in a variety of emigrant organisations, but, like many others, I was primarily there to get a job because I could not get one here.The experience enriched me, but that is because I am looking at it from this remove. For my contemporaries who were there, however, it was not an enriching experience. It was a salutary, emotional and sad experience to be away from home. In conversation with my friends and contemporaries they always expressed the aspiration to return home, but they met partners, married and had families and their commitments kept them there. I encountered this in Manchester last weekend in discussions with the emigrants I met. One told me her mother to her dying day always called Monaghan "home" even though she had been in England since the 1940s. Her daughter, who is first generation Irish, also refers to Monaghan as "home," even though she was born and reared in Manchester. That aspect of the report is worthy of being expanded.The results of a survey carried out by a university in England were released in the last two weeks. The university claimed they were surprising, but, as a former emigrant, I was not surprised. The survey found that the sense of identity among first and second generation Irish in Britain was huge. They saw themselves as Irish. There was a strong sense of identity even within the British experience. The same would be true of Irish Americans, but more so in England. That is where I lived and saw it on a daily basis.The perfect example is the sheer determination and commitment Mick McCarthy brought to the job of being Irish captain in his playing days and subsequently as Irish manager. Although it was never stated publicly, except by people for whom I have no respect, Mick McCarthy had the view that there was a suggestion that he was less Irish than the rest of us. To a first generation Irish man or woman that is the ultimate, gratuitous insult. It was an insult to the cultural environment in which Mick McCarthy and others like him had been reared, where their love of Ireland and Irish culture and identity was so strong that it transcended the environment in which they lived. He achieved the ultimate accolade of captaining and managing his country, but the whispering campaign and innuendo that he was less Irish than us were the ultimate insult. I am not surprised that, with many other factors, it may have hastened his departure. We should harness that sense of identity. We have not fully acknowledged this element in the Irish diaspora.This leads to a key area, one in which I have an expertise, communication with the Irish abroad. There is reference in the report to radio and television programmes and how we communicate. Every Minister who has travelled abroad will have been asked, whether in Melbourne, Australia or Savannah, Georgia or San Francisco, "How are things at home?" Home was Ireland, even though they may have been second generation Irish, and they would ask, "How is the old country?"To some degree we have failed in not communicating with our diaspora in the way other countries have. The perfect example of that is the BBC World Service, which is lauded internationally as a radio service par excellence. Its raison d'être from day one was to be a propaganda vehicle for the British way of life. The impartiality for which the BBC is well known eventually became the corporation's raison d'être. English speaking people all over the world, who wish to achieve an unbiased and impartial knowledge of international affairs, will tune into the BBC World Service, whose remit has been broadened considerably.As Senators will be aware, there were discussions many years ago about establishing an Irish short wave radio service. The matter was examined but was not pursued. The recent demise of Tara Television in the United Kingdom proved to be almost a fatal blow to many Irish, particularly the elderly who could access Irish television programmes on a weekly basis. If anything can be done at Cabinet level to restore that service, or create a new one to replace it, it should be. Our ability to communicate through the media is an essential ingredient in our continuing relationship with the Irish abroad.We should facilitate those who wish to return to Ireland. Many local authorities, however, operate a system whereby Irish applicants who are not resident here are placed down the list because of the pressing need to provide such housing for those already resident. In the same way that the social housing initiative was introduced, local authorities should be obliged to set aside some housing for returning emigrants, even in an environment where there is a housing shortage. It is the least we can do for those who wish to return at the end of their working days – and are prepared to pay for it, in so far as they are able – rather than having them living in bed-sits in London, Manchester and Birmingham or in apartments in Boston.A greater emphasis is also required in caring for elderly Irish people living abroad. Increasingly, it is not just the men who left home in the 1940s and 1950s, but also single women now in their 60s and 70s who are living in disadvantaged accommodation and are disconnected from the communities in which they are living. They are now retired, having supported elderly parents by sending remittances home over the years. In the twilight of their days, they should receive some acknowledgment of the contribution they have made. It is not enough to say that support services are provided by various Irish societies and social centres, although they are doing a great job, because the evidence suggests that elderly Irish people are disconnected from the foreign communities in which they live. Consequently, as was stated in the report, there is need for a proper liaison structure between Irish and UK agencies in particular because they are closest and the ones we know best.I agree with Senator Brian Hayes about the awards scheme, which is a wonderful idea. I acknowledge the great role played in this respect by the Irish Post newspaper for the past 25 years. It has an annual awards ceremony which is widely publicised among the Irish in Britain and is seen by many as the social highlight of the year.The holidays in Ireland scheme is a first class recommendation in the report. The Government has a moral imperative to initiate it in order to bring back some of our elderly Irish, from whatever part of the globe they are living, for a short holiday in the old country. It would be a wonderful initiative.The proposals regarding employment and training schemes are less important than preparing returning emigrants for the radical changes that have occurred here over the past 20 years. Many people with young families who returned for the Celtic tiger period are now finding it difficult to readjust because the Ireland they remembered is totally different to the country today. Although I was single at the time, I found it difficult to readjust to coming home after seven years away in the 1970s. I have met many married people who found it difficult to readjust when they returned here after living abroad. In fact, there is more than anecdotal evidence to suggest that an increasing number could not make it work and dcided to return to England or America after only two or three years here. That was because their children could not settle, their accents were different or they faced all sorts of subtle racial abuse. I know "racial" is a terrible word to use when we are talking about our own, but they were seen as being different. Some parents found it difficult to readjust to the social environment and also found it difficult to reconnect because they were not going back to areas from which they had emigrated but to new dormitory towns.I agree with the idea that the Department of Foreign Affairs should have overall responsibility for such immigration matters. I wish to pay tribute to the agencies that have been involved through the Department of Foreign Affairs, particularly DÍON, and its predecessor, the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad, on which I was honoured to serve for five years. At the time, I had severe difficulties with the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who was in charge. I thought he had emasculated the original aims of COWSA, as it was known, but DÍON has proven its worth since 1983. One can see from the detail of the report that it has been doing excellent work with the money provided by the Government.In accepting the contribution that successive Governments have made in increasing the allocation to the Irish abroad, there is a real need for the establishment of an Irish council along the lines of the British Council. I hope the Minister's officials will take note of that suggestion. The British Council operates exclusively to ensure that British excellence is propagated around the globe. A similar body is needed to promote Irish excellence abroad, as well as bringing the Irish diaspora closer. Although we have a wide variety of excellent social, sporting, cultural and industrial activities for the Irish overseas, these need to be better co-ordinated. This proposal has already been made in writing by a number of people. Senator Hayes and I are agreed on it and we are pursuing it through the Department of Foreign Affairs. The interdepartmental committee established by the Minister might be able to examine that proposal, although I accept this is a complex matter and does not concern emigrants alone.At this point I will conclude on the basis of the philosophy adopted by the former British Prime Minister, Harold MacMillan. When he first entered the House of Commons he sought guidance from a senior MP as to how he should approach a debate. He was told, "As a backbencher you are entitled to one good idea, as a Minister you are entitled to two."
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I compliment Senator Hayes and Senator Mooney on their contributions to the debate. In the past, on the Order of Business, Members have clamoured for statements on Irish emigrants, yet when they get the opportunity for such a debate they are not present. Unfortunately, the small number of Senators present is proof of that fact.We can all remember that some of the school friends with whom we studied or played hurling, had no choice but to emigrate. In many cases, entire families moved to London, Birmingham, Manchester or American cities. We should recognise the contribution they made by repatriating part of their earnings to their relatives here.They also contributed hugely to the cities to which they emigrated. Great credit is due to the county associations which were very vibrant and active in the cities concerned, particularly in England, at a time when people emigrated with few contacts but still had to set up homes. In many cases county associations gave the people concerned help in getting work and setting up. That was one plus – they were prepared to take whatever work was available, for which they might have had to queue, but they did it. However, things did not work out for many of them. We have a responsibility in that regard.Many people who emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s are now no longer able to care for themselves and depend on the services of other countries. There is an onus on us to do something for them. I, therefore, welcome the task force. The Minister said there may still be 20,000 people emigrating annually, but the circumstances are different. The people concerned are well-educated, with trades and degrees, and can avail of work almost immediately, which was not the case in the past. The situation is different, but we still need to support the county associations. Many of us, as public representatives, have attended their annual dinners, meeting people who have been gone for many years and of whom many, advancing in years, are looking to come back and want to know if there are homes for them in Ireland. Senator Mooney referred to the social housing mix. While there is a real demand for housing, we should give some of our emigrants a chance to get houses. They should be told they will be considered on an equal footing with people in Ireland for housing here in order that they can come back.Small amounts of money should be made available in order that the people concerned can come home for holidays. In some cases they have never come back to Ireland. Small amounts of money would allow them to come back for holidays which would be of some help to them. The families of some emigrants returned to Ireland and made a huge contribution at a time when posts could not be filled in the country. The families of many who emigrated in the 1950s and 1960s have returned and settled, making a huge contribution to organisations and parishes around the country.I welcome the task force and wish it well, but funding should be made available to ensure it delivers. There is only one way for a task force to implement recommendations, that is, through financial help. If this help has to be given to associations in Britain or America, it must do so. I hope the Department of Foreign Affairs will work hard on this to ensure those who left in difficult times will have a good quality of life in their later years, either in Ireland or the country where they live.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well with his new portfolio. I also welcome this report and congratulate those who travelled to many countries to complete it. As previous speakers said, the various county organisations have done tremendous work with emigrants all over the world.Many Irish families were raised on money sent back during hard times from the 1940s to the 1960s. Counties along the western seaboard are used to emigration – Dublin and some eastern counties would not be as used to it. Tremendous amounts of money were sent back from emigrants in various countries to educate their families and pay for others to emigrate. It is only right, now that Ireland has prospered, to do something for those who were not as lucky as other emigrants and have fallen on hard times. Not everyone who emigrates does well and it is only right to do something for them. As Senator Hayes said, those who look after emigrants who have fallen on hard times should be rewarded. They are doing tremendous work in finding shelter and support for our emigrants. It is about time we had an awards system to reward them.I agree with Senator Mooney on setting up a council, but these things will not come about unless funding is made available. I urge the Minister of State to bring the message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we need a reasonable allocation of funds to look after our emigrants. On the one hand, we must look after those going away, but, on the other, some of those returning must have work, rehabilitation or housing provided for them. This can only be done with funding.I welcome the interdepartmental working group being set up to examine this matter and hope these issues are brought to its attention. I also congratulate Mr. Kevin Burke from Ballyvarry outside Castlebar who has done tremendous work to bring emigrants home from England and sought housing and rehabilitation for them. The interdepartmental working group will have to work closely with local authorities. A certain percentage of the housing stock should be put aside for returned emigrants. That would be one way to look after those who have fallen on hard times.I wish the Minister of State well and welcome the establishment of the interdepartmental working group.

I welcome the report of the task force. I heard the Minister of State begin his deliberations by saying Ireland has suffered more than most countries from emigration. Over the past 50 years we have seen our share of emigration, particularly in the 1950s and 1980s.I was surprised to read in the report that we still have an emigration level of 20,000 per year but I am gratified by the knowledge that the majority of those leave by choice rather than necessity. I am further gratified to think that in the past five years the previous Government played a major part in bringing about an economic situation which allowed people to stay in this country and put a cap on the number of people who had to emigrate.I was also surprised to read in the report that there are 1.2 million Irish born emigrants throughout the world. What if they all decided to return to us? We might find ourselves in a right mess.

The commitment given by the previous Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to helping emigrants who are marginalised and socially excluded has led to the setting up of the task force whose report we are discussing. It is right and proper that we should look at how our emigrants are faring in the countries where they have decided to live. This is laudable and the support the Government has received from all sections of the political divide is commendable.Irish people can be proud of our contribution at all levels to the nations to which we have emigrated. We are always proud to hear Prime Ministers of Australia, Presidents of the United States and political leaders in the United Kingdom giving credit to the contribution of Irish emigrants to their countries. The infrastructures of Australia, Britain and America owe much to the sweat of the brow of Irish emigrants. We are given due credit for that contribution and we should be proud of it.Many of the people who emigrated from our shores have been successful beyond the seas. Most of them have not forgotten their roots in Ireland. As someone who works with a voluntary organisation I can give testament to an individual who left Ireland in the 1950s and who was successful in Boston. When this person had made his own way in America he undertook to give something back to the nation he had left. Although he had left Ireland out of necessity and had got nothing from Ireland, because there was nothing there to give, he did not forget how proud he was to be an Irishman. He set up a fund raising chapter in Boston particularly for people with a disability in this country. As someone who works with disabled people I can give testament to the magnificent work this man did for the agency with which I work. On his death we were delighted to name a wing of our establishment in his honour. That is an example of the work done by people who have emigrated and of their commitment to their own land.If we reflect on the bad old days when emigration was involuntary we can only imagine the pain of mothers and fathers, particularly in rural Ireland where emigration was at its worst, who saw 75% of their children emigrate through no fault of their own. I remember the anguish of my own mother when my eldest brother decided to emigrate to England, her joy on his return and her anguish when he had to go back again. I am delighted we can stand here today and say the majority of those who emigrate do so by choice rather than necessity.The task force believes the Government has a major responsibility in supporting emigrants who need to be assisted in whatever way it can. One of the greatest needs identified in the report by people who provide services to emigrants is better preparation for people going abroad. For people who have to emigrate the three key words are information, information, information. The more comprehensive the information they have before they start on their journeys the better.Since many of the most vulnerable emigrants are between the ages of 15 and 24 years the task force suggests that the starting point for information should be a pre-emigration service in the schools. I agree totally. I cannot imagine what it must be like for a 15 year old emigrant and I hope they are few and far between. The task force recommends that a module of education for independent living in a multi-cultural world be included in the new social, personal and health education programme. When children see this appearing on the curriculum I hope they do not look on it in a pessimistic way and think we are educating them for emigration. I hope that will never be the case again.Many young emigrants are well educated. They emigrate to places like Australia and New Zealand on one year visas to get a rounded view of life before they settle down to life in Ireland. Approximately 10,000 people took advantage of one year visas in Australia and New Zealand in the year 2001-02.I am delighted to see this report being debated in the House and that we have had an opportunity to make a contribution to it. I know it will not gather dust because we are committed to ensuring that those people who emigrate have the full support of the nation behind them.

It is timely coming so soon after the recent publication of the report, which was well received by all sections of the community, particularly those voluntary organisations, both at home and abroad, which make such an important contribution to supporting our emigrants in so many ways. The men and women of these organisations, whose work on behalf of our emigrants, both in assisting them in their preparations before departing and, in particular, providing services for them overseas, have not always received the recognition they deserve. The report of the task force has rightly highlighted the invaluable work all the organisations are doing in this area.I am pleased to note from my colleagues the general welcome expressed today for the initiative taken by the Government together with the social partners to establish the task force in the context of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. A number of very thoughtful points have been made by Members of the House which the officials and Ministers who were present will bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen.It is significant that the report of the task force was based on a wide-ranging process of consultation undertaken to ensure all interested individuals and groups would have the opportunity to contribute to its work. The success of the process is illustrated by the remarkable number of people and organisations who chose to contribute. This contributed greatly to the depth of the analysis in the report and the wide-ranging nature of its recommendations.I join other speakers in congratulating the members of the task force, through its chairman, Paddy O'Hanlon, for their excellent report. The Minister for Education and Science has already indicated in the House that it is too early to anticipate what measures the Government may take on foot of the report and that it is clear that many of its recommendations will require further consideration and development before they are ready for implementation. Nevertheless, I share his hope, as I believe do Members of this House. It will be possible to make a start in implementing some of the recommendations in the coming year.It has been extremely useful to have had this initial debate on the report. I have no doubt that it will stimulate further public discussion on this important topic which has such a profound effect on our history, community life and sense of identity. A number of the contributors referred to the importance of caring for elderly emigrants, including those who wish to return to live in Ireland. There has also been support for an awards scheme to enable recognition to be given to Irish people abroad who have contributed to the development of their adopted countries and Ireland. There has also been support for making more information available to the Irish abroad and a new organisation to support them.Some speakers in this House come from County Donegal where we have a great ethnic connection with various parts of Scotland, England and Wales. So many people have left our shores to earn a living and provide for their families back home. I can think of so many people who have contributed in many ways, right back to the beginning of the last century. I want to be associated with the contributions of speakers of the House, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and Deputy Cowen who has taken such a profound interest in this matter since his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs.Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas arís a chur in iúil duitse, a chathaoirligh, agus do na Seanadóirí a ghlac páirt ins an díospóireacht fíor-thábhachtach seo.

I hope he will not consider me to be repetitive because he was present when I last raised this issue in the House on 6 February 2000. The importance of overseas development aid is a subject dear to my heart and also, I am sure, to his.This country does much good work in this area. On the last occasion I raised the issue in the House I asked the Government to achieve the United Nations target for overseas development aid of 0.7% of GNP. We have now reached 0.4% of GNP, which is well up the scale of givers. A large number of richer countries have yet to achieve that level. I hope this debate will encourage the Minister of State when he seeks increases in aid.When the House last debated this issue I had just returned from a visit to Uganda and Zambia, organised by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. I thanked the organisation for sending me because it was a great help to see things at first hand. The Minister has visited both countries since then and I have had the good fortune to be sponsored by that organisation to visit Ethiopia, another country to which we give special bilateral aid.I am always impressed by the practical value of the involvement of Ireland Aid, both in the bilateral projects and the United Nations agencies it supports, including UNFPA, UNAIDS and UNICEF. The latter is supported at a multilateral level. The value for money they achieve is impressive, as is the reception they receive from local people and the way they deal with them. I am also pleased at their greater co-operation with other countries who give bilateral aid, for example, with Norway in Ethiopia, and with the various NGOs who are trying to establish systems on the ground.The Medical Missionaries of Mary were the first organisation from this country to become involved in safe motherhood. They established splendid hospitals in Africa 50 to 60 years ago, especially in Nigeria, where they showed it was possible to reduce maternal mortality rates if the proper medical systems were in place. Despite the enormous work done by women in developing countries, especially in agriculture, there is little respect for their position or their health. They are very undervalued, although decreasing maternal and infant mortality rates would improve the economy of the countries concerned.Ireland's maternal mortality rates are among the best in the world, but in developing countries a woman has between a one in ten and a one in 20 chance of dying from a condition associated with pregnancy or childbirth. Between 500,000 and 700,000 women die every year in such circumstances, that is, one every minute approximately. In the course of this debate between 100 and 121 women will die, the vast majority of them in the underdeveloped world. Many will be teenagers or older women who already have large families. With the death of these mothers the likelihood of their children under the age of five years surviving is decimated. That is a great tragedy for the countries concerned.The decline in maternal mortality in this country did not happen by chance or because of socio-economic improvements. We managed to diminish puerperal sepsis, an infection associated with childbirth, which is still a very serious cause of death in the developing countries. It can be immediately alleviated with an adequate supply of antibiotics. We need to address that area.Approximately 20% of women die from bleeding. We have been associated with the establishment of safe blood banks and this must continue. It has been very important in the cities in developing countries because the death rates there is half to a third of that in rural areas. We must use our expertise in these areas to show how improvements can be made.High blood pressure is another major cause of death. Our involvement in the training of traditional birth attendants can greatly help. For example, by giving them a stick they can detect women under five feet and seek to have them referred to the nearest hospital. Women can also be given watches to time the length of labour and seek medical help if it goes beyond eight hours. Obstructed labour is an appalling cause of maternal mortality. There are no women in the House tonight apart from the Clerk Assistant and myself but one can imagine that taking three or four days to die in obstructed labour must be one of the most appalling deaths one could think of. Some 8% of women in the developing world die in obstructed labour.We should address issues like that with the expertise we have and, particularly in this area, discourage teenage pregnancy because these girls are not mature. The countries involved tried to raise the age of marriage to 18 but there is a tradition of very early marriage. If a girl marries at 12 and tries to deliver her first child at 14, the results are disastrous. Another group who unfortunately run into a great deal of trouble also are those who have very large families. Complications of pregnancy and the older age of these women can cause many problems.This is an area where we need to support family planning. Many of these women do not have access to family planning clinics and anything we can do through the non-governmental organisations who set them up, and in terms of family planning supplies, will be helpful. Condoms are not very popular in Africa for cultural reasons, but many African women are most enthusiastic about long-term injectable contraceptives, especially in rural areas because they only have to go to a clinic once every three months. I wish they had a better choice of treatment but that appears to be one of the most important to them. It is essential to try to get teenagers to delay their first pregnancy since many of them do not understand, because of the cultural conditions in their country, that the dangers greatly increase at that time.There is a major problem also with unsafe abortion in these countries and their legislation on abortion varies. What we can do, however, is try to ensure that these women who usually die from exsanguination and infection get blood, if that is what they need, and that there is a supply of antibiotics to treat them. Without antibiotics they will die from these dreadful abortions.It is important to remember also that those who work with these women have the added risk of dealing with people at least 20% of whom are HIV positive. Today's newspapers highlight the report from UNAIDS which states that currently there are 42 million people in the world infected with HIV. That is a horrific figure.I have visited clinics in Africa where the workers did not have any rubber gloves, which is not fair. When President Bush took away the $34 million voted by Congress for the UNFPA, I wish he had sent $34 million worth of rubber gloves to Africa because they would have saved many people from putting themselves in danger by working with these infected women and men.Good work is being done on microbicides, which are very simple compounds, far too simple for the pharmaceutical companies to take them up. Some of them appear to be made from seaweed, which I am sure would have enormously impressed our grandmothers who told us about the value of carrageen moss. This country has put money towards research into microbicides which, if used vaginally, appear to block the transmission of the HIV virus. Another area we need to address is the very high level of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis and gonorrhoea.I commend the Minister of State on what he is trying to do and the great effort he has made in visiting these clinics. I do not need to tell him how good they are; he has seen them for himself. He has also seen that we are socially acceptable in these places because we do not go there to tell these people what to do. We try to be as co-operative as possible. I hope the Minister will do the best he can to ensure that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, reaches into his long pocket and provides as much money as he possibly can to continue this excellent work. I thank Senator Quinn in advance for seconding the motion.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I thank Senator Henry for putting down the motion and I have much pleasure in seconding it. Senator Henry concentrated on the area of health, in which she has so much expertise, but I intend to touch on the areas of food and trade with which I am more familiar.The motion contains the words "monetary and otherwise" in terms of aid to developing countries. We often talk about financial aid for these countries without even noticing what we do in the other field which is at least as important, namely, the area of trade.As part of the European Union, Ireland is a participant in the Common Agricultural Policy. We are among its most enthusiastic supporters. Whenever there is the merest whisper of dragging this policy into the real world, there is a deafening chorus of protest across the country.In a debate in this House some weeks ago, I spoke out strongly against this country's refusal, and that of Europe, to reform the CAP. I detailed how this was a short-sighted policy which short-changed the vast bulk of European consumers without providing even a decent living to those who live and work on the land. I was referring to the agricultural community.I also said at that time, and this is what I want to focus on this evening, that there is an even larger number of people who are being short-changed by the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union, namely, the peoples of the developing world. This is happening in two ways. The CAP undermines and works against any help we offer to the people in these countries by way of development aid. On the one hand we keep their produce out of our markets, but on the other hand we undermine the prices for them elsewhere in the world by flooding other markets with subsidised agricultural products that we produce here. We beat our breasts about the need to help these developing countries as long as that help is delivered in the least suitable way in the form of gifts or cash. We give with one hand while using the other to hold them back from trading in the only products in which they can trade. That is not only bad economics, it is a morally rotten way for us to behave.If we were trading fairly we would keep all our aid and the developing world would still be better off.  I am not just talking about Ireland but Europe also. I am taking Ireland as an example of one of the proponents because we appear to be afraid even to question the Common Agricultural Policy. That is an amazing way for a country like Ireland to behave when one takes account our values and traditions. As long as we persist in behaving in this way, we cannot hope, as Europeans, to gain the influence that we seek in the rest of the world.The two great powerhouses of wealth – the United States and Europe – are lined up against the developing world and undermining it by distorting food markets and subsidising farm production. Of the two, however, it is Europe that is by far the worst sinner and it is Europe which deserves the most criticism. It should be up to Ireland to lead the way out of this policy which is economically and morally bankrupt.No one would ever question the regard we have for farmers, agriculture and our rural way of life. If we were to tell our partners in Europe that we have to find a better way of achieving these objectives, would they not listen? If we were to say it is now time to turn our backs on the 20th century and look for a way forward that is right for the 21st century, would they not listen? The answer is perhaps they would or perhaps they would not. At least if we were saying these things we could be proud of what we are doing. Sadly, we cannot be proud of what we are doing.It must dilute whatever pride we feel in the hundreds of millions of euro we dispense each year in the form of financial aid to the developing world. There is at least one argument that the financial aid is given so that we can continue to pursue the penal approach in the way we trade. If such an argument were true – and I am not saying it is – we would be even more deserving of shame.It is good for us to have a debate like this and I am delighted that Senator Henry brought this motion to the House. We should not forget that there are two matters, trade and aid and of those two, trade is by far the most important.Those of us in the food business are approached with requests to handle fair trade products and many of us are delighted to do so. This is only a sop to the demands and requirements that exist. The fair trade products are of very limited number, are produced under the fair trade arrangements of a guaranteed wage and usually originate in Africa. The products tend to be bananas, tea and coffee and one or two other products. It would be much better not to give aid in the form of money to the people in the developing world. It is far better if we ask them to earn the aid. They could then be proud and so could we.I know the Minister of State's heart is in the right place and he has experience of visiting and understanding the situation. It will not be easy to do but it will be a victory for our own well-being. We could stand up and say to Europe and to the rest of the world that we are an agricultural country, we value the rural way of life and we should not demean the work of those many millions of people in the developing world who would be so much better off if they could earn their keep rather than just accept our charity.
#DonLydon	unknown-#DonLydon-party	unknown-#DonLydon-dob	unknown-#DonLydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	112	This is a good motion and I welcome it. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Having read the report I now realise the work being done in this area. This is the second time he has held this brief. He did a good job the first time and I know he will do twice as good a job the second time. He has a formidable task before him.I was amazed at the different areas where we are involved. The Taoiseach made a speech in Johannesburg about two years ago in which he reiterated our commitment to overseas development assistance. At that time he gave a commitment to the achievement by 2002 the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on overseas development assistance and that is to be welcomed. In a recent speech the Minister of State confirmed this commitment and outlined some of the objectives. He has a focused programme of development assistance which is world-class in quality.The Minister said that he intends to address basic needs in the poorest countries on earth and this has in part been done. He outlined areas such as education, health, food security, clean water and sanitation. He pledged to work to achieve good governance and better administrative capacity in our partner countries in order to develop democratic institutions and to promote greater respect for human rights. He also spoke about globalisation and trade liberalisation.Many people support globalisation, as do I to some extent. The danger is that the needs of small nations are sometimes swallowed up by the selfishness of large nations. He spoke about increasing Ireland's aid involvement and helping developing countries to increase their trade capacity. I would like to know what sort of figures the Minister of State has in mind in this respect.The Minister also dealt with the question of HIV/AIDS. This is a major crisis and millions of people in parts of Africa are now suffering. We must address that issue. In 2001 the Taoiseach announced further funding to alleviate this crisis. As Senator Henry noted, it is a pity that the $34 million from the American budget was not used there. I am interested to hear what further plans the Minister of State has in this area.We must address the food crisis. There are crises in Malawi, Zimbabwe and a major crisis in Ethiopia involving about 6 million people. I will listen to the Minister of State's plans with interest. I work with the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God who opened a hospital some years ago in Malawi. I believe the Minister of State may have visited the hospital when he was there. The report speaks of the work done by missionaries but they are not so much missionaries as health care providers.I have a copy of a letter from the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, written to Patrick J. Leahy, chairman of the subcommittee on foreign operations of the committee of appropriations of the United States Senate. The subject of the letter is the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002. The letter states:Like every foreign operations appropriations act since 1985, it provides that "none of the funds made available in this Act .may be made available to any organisation or program which, as determined by the President of the United States, supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."The United States had set aside $34 million for this programme but instead decided to give the funds to the USAID's child survival and health programme fund which I am sure is a very good charitable cause.What I am concerned about is not family planning or the provision of contraceptives or any of these things. I am concerned about forcible abortion or forcible sterilisation. It is a women's rights issue. If what the Secretary of State says is true then it is a serious charge laid at the door of UNFPA. He says that a team led by the former US Ambassador, William A. Brown spent 14 days in China from 13 to 26 May 2002 –for extensive visits to five of the 32 counties supported by UNFPA. The team's mandate was to present factual findings on UNFPA's association or participation with population-planning activities in China.They found no evidence that UNFPA was "knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in the PRC." The team found that notwithstanding some relaxation in the 32 counties in which UNFPA is involved, the population programs of the PRC "retain coercive elements in law and in practice." The team noted a system of extremely high fines and penalties imposed on families that exceed the number of children.The team's finding that China's population practices retain coercive elements in law and in practice is consistent with other information available to the Department, such as materials and briefings supplied by UNFPA, Chinese law, and the State Department's annual human rights reports. The PRC has a longstanding and draconian program of controlling birth rates.In Peru there is some evidence to suggest that under President Fujimori's national population programme in which UNFPA participated there were regimes which resulted in members of the indigenous Indian population undergoing systematic and forced sterilisation. These issues arise from time to time; sometimes they are hyped up and sometimes they are not. I would, however, like the Minister to look into them. If these programmes are being supported, maybe we should look at where we use our aid. I do not suggest we withdraw it entirely but maybe place some strictures on it because a lot of good work is done by these organisations. However, when it comes to women's rights and to forced abortion or sterilisation, we must draw the line.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I commend the Independent Senators on bringing this worthy and timely motion before the House. I disagree, however, with my good friend and colleague, Senator Henry, in relation to our performance as a nation, that is, at Government level. I fully agree with her on the performance of Ireland Aid in relation to the non-governmental organisations but from the point of view of our performance as a nation in terms of monetary input, unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired.As we speak, 38 million people are starving in sub-Saharan Africa and many millions will die because western Governments have turned a blind eye to the appalling situation and have constantly reneged on their promises, collective responsibility and moral obligation to keep fellow human beings alive.From time to time there is a high profile focus on the plight of the starving in Third World countries. I commend, in particular, RTÉ on sending its cameras and reporters to bring home graphically the gruesome realities of the conditions in these famine stricken countries. The problem is that such news flashes are temporary and intermittent. The reality is that they happen mainly in summer time when there is a news drought. They flash on people's consciousness but, unfortunately, they are forgotten again. For the victims, however, it goes on every day, week, month and year.In the six countries of southern Africa, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique, almost 15 million people are threatened with starvation. In Ethiopia and Eritrea, an additional 11 to 15 million people are at risk as we speak. Who will ever forget Ethiopia in 1984? Trocaire is predicting that the current famine in Ethiopia will affect more people than it did in 1984. That speaks for itself. The rains have failed once again. The land is owned by the government which inhibits farmer investment. Farmers are taxed immediately after the harvest when market prices are at their lowest. Up to now people could prop up and supplement their incomes with the sale of coffee but coffee prices are at a 30 year all time low and another human catastrophe is about to unfold. Where does that leave Ireland in terms of its moral responsibility and performance?In September 2000, the Government decided Ireland would meet the UN target for ODA expenditure of 0.7% of GNP by end of 2007. This was a firm and unequivocal commitment given by the Taoiseach at the UN millennium summit. To achieve that goal over a fixed time scale, the figure for 2002 should be 0.45%. However, the Government allocation for ODA has fallen to 0.41%, a massive cut of €31 million. Instead of going forward, we are going back. In spite of all the promises, assertions and commitments by the Taoiseach that the 0.7% target would be met, it cannot and will not be met. Once again we have reneged on a firm commitment.The Estimates for 2003 include a provision of €373 million for international co-operation under Vote 39. This is part of the ODA assistance administered by Ireland Aid. The Estimate is an increase of €33 million over the Ireland Aid figure of €340 million for 2002 but there is no real increase. We are simply replacing the €32 million which was cut from Ireland Aid's budget for 2002 so, in fact, there is no real gain.Last week we debated the Book of Estimates for 2003 and there were cuts right across the board – in education, health, the national development plan and, of course, overseas development aid. Particularly on the capital side, we testified to the savage cuts which will have a huge impact on the economy. Of all the areas to cut, to cut the figure for ODA is nothing short of immoral. It is a disgrace, inhumane and indefensible. However, we are not alone. At the time of their participation in the UN financing and development conference in April 2000 in Monterey, the wealthiest nations had never given less in aid. Total ODA from the 22 donor countries amounted to $53.7 billion in 2000, down 0.4% in real terms since 1999. In the ten years since 1992, aid has declined in real terms by almost 12%. Only five countries meet the UN target of 0.7% and, sadly, Ireland is not among them.I share Trocaire's concern that Ireland is supporting the UK-Spanish proposals to link EU development aid and co-operation with recipient countries' performance in enforcing measures around migration. As Trocaire pointed out, this is totally contrary to Ireland Aid's principles of promoting human rights and issuing tied aid. The Government, therefore, needs to restate immediately its commitment to these principles and to the Refugee Convention of 1951. Again I call on the Government to give a clear and unequivocal commitment this evening to a year by year, staged and staggered timetable – a definite time frame within which to achieve the 0.7% by 2007.At EU level we should strive to ensure the proportion of EU aid spent on the least developed countries reaches a minimum of 0.15% to 0.20% of GNP by the date of the EU-Africa summit in April 2003. As I said, we should not support the withholding or granting of development aid on the basis of developing countries' acceptance of returning asylum seekers or migrants. The Government should work to develop concrete mechanisms at EU level to monitor coherence between development co-operation and other policies. We need to get our policy priorities right. It is too bad that we grant generous tax concessions to the livestock industry while at the same time we cut overseas aid to people who will die as a result.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I compliment Senator Henry and the Independent group on tabling this motion about which we cannot speak enough. It is an issue we must continuously highlight. Unlike the previous speaker, I do not want to play politics with this issue but there are a few points that should be addressed. In the recent Estimates, we sustained our aid budget, notwithstanding, the difficult budgetary circumstances this year. As a Government, we will continue to be one of the leading donors of aid in the world in relation to our GNP which now stands at 0.41%. It is expected that will be sustained in the year ahead.It is no harm to salute the contribution we have made. Ireland is the sixth in the world as a donor ahead of countries such as France, Finland and Britain. Our current level, as well as our commitment, well exceeds the EU target of 0.33% of GNP for each member state's aid budget and agreed in Barcelona last March. Ireland's aid programme in the year ahead has been targeted at €373 million, a 10% increase on the out-turn for this year. We continue to show a significant increase in terms of where we were a few years ago.In the context of the many calls on the public finances, we are giving priority to sustaining overseas aid. We must ensure the real and positive outcomes for the poor in the world, Africa in particular, are safeguarded in the budget. Our focus must be on the benefits for those we aim to help. Ultimately, this will be the measure of success in funding our aid programmes. As a member of the Progressive Democrats, I hope the Minister will bear with me as I salute my colleague, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, who contributed so much to this programme and fought so successfully to bring about in September 2000 the commitment to try to reach the target of 0.7% of GNP in overseas aid.There has been unprecedented growth. Five years ago our contribution was €158 million. It is now €373 million. There has been a major expansion in the last two years, from 0.33% of GNP in 2001 to 0.41% in 2002. It is a bit rich for Senator Higgins to play on emotional issues like this and cross the political divide by trying to attack the Government when the record clearly shows that we are taking this issue seriously. As a nation, we should be proud of our record in this regard. To play politics with the misfortunes of people like these is irresponsible.It is no harm at all to use opportunities like this to remind people of some basic facts, if for no other reason than to ensure we double our efforts to help the people concerned. There are 1.2 billion people living on less than $1 a day, 2.8 billion people living on less than $2 a day and 2.4 billion people who lack the basic sanitation facilities that we all enjoy. Some 11 million children under five die annually in developing countries, mostly from infectious diseases, while over 100 million – including 60% of girls – do not have basic primary school education. These are facilities we enjoy.It is also worth mentioning the plight of AIDS that has hit the modern world. Today 40 million people are infected with HIV, 28 million in Africa. In some countries as many as one in three adults carry the virus. The impact upon future development in the countries concerned will be enormous if we do not tackle the problem. Again, as a country, we have a very good record in being to the forefront of making commitments to research and development and programmes that deal with AIDS-related illness, an area to which this year we have contributed €50 million.The critical issues and principles that govern the development of a country are what we have to address. We have to ensure our aid is well spent. That is the task that faces the Minister of State. We must ensure we put poverty alleviation first, that we address people's basic needs and that we work in partnership with developing countries. We must work in partnership to educate and train people in how they can sustain themselves. We must target children to ensure the countries concerned are safeguarded in the future.We must link this issue to human and civil rights. Post the events of 11 September we should bear in mind that terrorism and its causes often stem from countries that lack basic needs and are underdeveloped. As well as dealing directly with terrorism, we must counter the breeding grounds of terrorism. I salute our NGOs and missionaries who have represented this country so well during the years. Before we ever had serious amounts of aid going to them they were championing the cause and the name of this country. They have played a crucial role in providing aid, fostering public awareness about the crises in the countries concerned and ensuring financial support. Were it not for their leadership role we would not be making the contributions we are making today. They were at the forefront.I wish to refer in particular to the HOPE Foundation, which is run by Edith Wilkins, a long-time friend of mine from our early days in school. Edith is a champion of the cause and this country. She continues to work in Calcutta where she has contracted a serious illness. I am glad the Minister of State's Department has recognised the work she is doing in recent years and hope he will continue to support her.I wish the Minister of State well with his huge responsibilities. It is not just a national but an international responsibility. Long may the advances we have made over the last couple of years continue to be made under the Government. If Senator Higgins was in the House, I would say to him that, since overseas development aid is linked to our economic growth, it is far likelier to improve under the Government than under any other.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	115	On a historical note, if a coalition Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party had not introduced overseas development aid, Fianna Fáil would never have thought of it. It did not believe in it 25 years ago when introduced, it had no interest in it. Let us have no lectures, therefore, from the other side of the House about people's values. Unfortunately, there is no political gain in this issue. Perhaps there is in the slightly semi-detached political atmosphere of the university seats, but in the hard, robust realities of electoral politics one is not going to get much credit for being in favour of expanding overseas development aid. The Government knows it is not going to suffer much politically for cutting back on overseas development aid, which is the reason the adjustments of 10%, which were not cuts, were inflicted on those least able to protect themselves on the entire planet by removing €30 million from our overseas development aid budget. The Government did this because it knew there would be little fuss and that in the long term there would be no major repercussions.This issue is not about politics but morality. Senator Minihan quoted figures that are startlingly true. The scale of inequality on the planet is enormous. The assumption behind so much of what is written about it – that of universal affluence – flies in the face of reality. It is either a collective decision on the part of the western world to ignore something or a deliberate conspiracy on the part of the mass media to avoid dealing with it because of the way the values it suggests challenge the values of large sections of the commercialised media. The reality of this world is that matters are getting worse. On every index they are getting worse.I hope Senator Henry does not take offence at my saying that the fact that this motion on overseas aid, in respect of which I will vote in favour, did not even merit an amendment from the Government suggests it is little too innocuous, given that the Government took €30 million off this ODA budget this year alone. While I have no objection to the motion, we need to adopt a more hard-headed and thick-skinned approach to the issue of ODA because the Government's promise will not be met.The facts are simple. By 2007 our GNP will be around €110 billion to €120 billion, which is a conservative estimate, and 0.7% of that is approximately €800 million. According to the Government's Estimates, the amount at the end of 2003 will be less than half that figure. I am supposed to believe that an extra €425 million will become available in the four year period from 2003 to 2007. That would involve an allocation of €100 million a year for four years. I am expected to believe that the Government will double the allocation in a four year period when the Minister for Finance, and most forecasters, tell us that economic growth will be down to 3% or 4% for the next two or three years.The truth is that this commitment will not be met. However, the great thing about this is that the target year is a year after the next general election will probably be held. Unlike its predecessor, I do not think this Government will be in office for five years. The Government will be able to say that it will spend an extra €300 million the year after the election is over. In that way it will not have broken its promise by the time the election comes around. However, the target figure to be met will be a startlingly large sum.We all know the Minister for Finance does not believe in ODA. We know this because of the heroics the previous Progressive Democrat Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development co-operation had to perform in order to prevent him from savaging that budget. The Progressive Democrats occasionally have a civilising influence on Fianna Fáil. That was one of those occasions when they repelled the natural instincts of the Minister for Finance to cut every budget related to tackling poverty. He did that in regard to social welfare, he will do it now and at every chance he gets. I congratulate the Progressive Democrats on that achievement.We will not reach the ODA target. The figures should be reiterated. I wish to quote some random figures. The cost of providing basic health care and nutrition for all in the world would be less than Europe and the United States spend on pet food. In 1997, 20% of the world's people in the richest countries had 74 times what was held by the poorest 20%. In 1960, the ratio was 30 to 1. Therefore, inequality has more than doubled. Much as I am inclined to do so, I do not blame the Government for that. I blame the attitude of western society, which essentially has pulled up a drawbridge.One of the extraordinary hypocrisies of western society is that it preaches globalisation while resisting it at home. We resist free trade in the goods that matter most to the poor of the world. The Common Agricultural Policy is a classic example, but there are many others.There is a need to address various matters. One of the matters I wish had been addressed is the extraordinary performance of the Leader of this State, the Taoiseach, in South Africa, who, when the Government was cutting overseas development aid, was lecturing the rest of the world about their lack of generosity. Unless the political will changes, the Government is ideologically and politically incapable of taking the decisions that will be necessary to meet the ODA target. It is going through a charade of pretending it will do something, which is manifestly impossible, given its ideology and the figures we have for the end of 2003. It is talking about what it used to do, it is making promises into the future, but the evidence of this year and next year is that it is drifting remorselessly away from the target and quite soon it will, not officially but de facto, abandon it.

This has been a helpful debate. Having been a Minister of State in a previous Government, I believe we should discuss issues such as this more often. I thank the Senators who tabled the motion and those who supported it. I, too, agree with those who said that this is an issue we should not politicise, if possible.It is important to be factual when we discuss this matter. I wish to clarify a point Senator Ryan made about Fianna Fáil having no concerns about this area. The Senator should check the record or talk to some of his colleagues in the Labour Party. If he were to check the facts in relation to discussions that took place prior to the formation of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government at the time Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring led those parties, he would note that historically there was a major emphasis on this area by both parties in those discussions. He would also note that the graph in relation to ODA spending finally took off in the right direction around that time. Senator Mansergh would be able to verify that fact. I was then Minister of State and those are the facts. I want to clear the air on that matter. None of us has a monopoly on concern about this area, but I have been very much encouraged by what I have heard from Senators across party lines. I will deal with some of the issues raised, if I have time later.Issues have been raised regarding money. Senator Minihan put this in context when he said that account must be taken of the large amount of money involved. The budget for this area is very large. The more growth in the economy, the more money will be available for this area. It is as simple as that. I agree with Senator Minihan's point that if other parties were in Government we would not have the same growth rates.I am pleased to respond to this motion, which recognises the value of the Ireland Aid programme and calls on the Minister for Finance to maintain our commitment to it. It is appropriate that we should join forces in supporting the motion. The motion allows me to outline the Government's position on the aid programme and to re-affirm our commitment to it.I am firmly of the view that there is a need to give greater prominence to the scope and quality of our aid programme – as has been referred to by a number of Senators – and to raise awareness of the role which Ireland is playing in seeking to assist the poorest of the poor. That has always been, and will continue to be, our focus. I very much welcome this debate as an important contribution in this regard.Over the past three decades, successive Governments have built upon the modest foundations laid in 1974 with the establishment of the Ireland Aid programme. From modest origins, the programme has grown substantially over the past three decades with increases in funding recorded in every year since 1992. The pace of growth has accelerated in more recent years. The allocation to Vote 39, the Vote for International Co-operation, administered by my Department, has increased from €51 million in 1992 to €177 million in 1998 and next year will reach €373 million. In 2003 we will spend more than three times as much on overseas aid as we did in 1998 or 13 times what we spent in 1992. The total allocation next year is likely to exceed €450 million when contributions from other Departments towards ODA are factored in.I support what Senator Minihan said in regard to our high growth rates and the substantial moneys available. The figures speak for themselves. By any yardstick, we have achieved impressive growth, not just in absolute terms, but also as a proportion of GNP. The internationally accepted approach is to express contributions to development assistance as a proportion of GNP. Official figures from the OECD show that for the period 1990-91 Ireland's aid programme stood at just 0.16% of GNP which placed us firmly in the relegation zone of the league table of OECD member states. We were 21st out of 22 countries. However, in line with the increases in funding I have outlined, we progressed to mid-table by 1996 at 0.30%. This year we expect to reach a figure of 0.41%. Although official figures on other countries' contributions will not be available for some time, estimates suggest that we are now ranked sixth among OECD member states and well above the EU average. This is a record of which Ireland can justifiably be proud, all the more so because it has been achieved against a background of stagnant or falling levels of aid in many other donor countries. I agree with those who have been critical of some of the major powers. Aid levels from a number of wealthy member states, including the USA, Canada and Finland, have fallen over the past decade. With a handful of others however, Ireland has made significant progress towards the UN target of 0.7% of GNP.The allocation for 2003 of €373 million should enable us to maintain the 0.41% commitment. This objective has been achieved in the context of current difficult financial circumstances. There is a temptation, as has happened in other countries, to reduce assistance to external aid when circumstances at home become more difficult. We have all heard the debates about cuts in our school programmes. We can list them in every Department, as they all took major hits. However, we have not made cuts here, rightly so.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Maintaining our contribution as a proportion of GNP in these difficult times is a measure of the Government's clear commitment to increasing the aid programme and achieving the UN target of 0.7% on schedule. This commitment has been confirmed on many previous occasions and is part of the programme for Government. As the motion correctly implies, the value of Ireland's aid should not be viewed purely in monetary terms. It is not enough for us to point to the substantial increases in resources over a given period – we must also be sure our aid makes a real difference to the lives of those most in need, the poorest of the poor in developing countries.The alleviation of poverty is at the heart of the Ireland Aid programme. This is in line with the recommendations of the Ireland Aid review committee, whose report on the future direction of the aid programme was approved by Government last March. This represents the overriding priority of the aid programme. A reduction in poverty requires, first and foremost, a focus on basic needs; basic health care, primary education, basic sanitation and the provision of clean water. These objectives are prominent in our activities in all the programme countries and elsewhere in the aid programme. However, to focus on these key goals alone would not be sufficient to bring about lasting progress and change.We need to focus at the same time within the bilateral programme on areas such as sustainable development, good governance, public sector reform, capacity building and fostering private enterprise. We must also help partner Governments to tackle the growing crisis in HIV-AIDS. The Ireland Aid programme seeks to address all these key issues. To tackle such a wide range of issues risks spreading resources too thinly and diluting the quality and effectiveness of our aid. Accordingly, Ireland Aid concentrates its efforts on a small number of least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa. By narrowing the geographical focus of the programme, we retain the capacity to tackle in a co-ordinated and coherent way the multiple dimensions of poverty and the many obstacles to sustainable development. This multifaceted approach in a limited geographical context enables us to bring about real progress in some of the world's least developed countries and, most importantly, have an impact on the lives of some of the poorest people on earth.The effectiveness and value for money of assistance channelled through multilateral organisations are also key concerns for Ireland Aid. To this end, we liaise regularly with international organisations to ensure funds are disbursed in an effective and efficient manner. The need for value for money has been rightly identified. Ireland has been to the forefront of member states pressing the European Commission to reform the management and delivery of EU assistance. Significant progress has been made, in terms of structural reform and improvements to the financial management of EU assistance, including a marked improvement in EU performance as regards the speed and efficiency of aid delivery.In line with the Ireland Aid review, Ireland will increasingly concentrate voluntary contributions on a limited number of UN agencies, rather than being a small contributor to a large number of agencies. Priority will be given to agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme and UNICEF, whose policy objectives relate closely to our own and which are efficient and reform-minded. This will ensure, in particular, a more concentrated focus of Ireland Aid funding on the overriding programme goal to which I referred, the alleviation of poverty.Through our concentrated focus on both multilateral and bilateral assistance, Ireland Aid has earned an enviable international reputation as a quality aid programme. This quality has been attested to by the OECD's peer review process. The last review, undertaken in 1999, concluded that the focused nature of the programme constitutes one of its major strengths. It found that the programme had a sound policy basis and concluded that Irish Aid, as the programme was then known, was a strong performer in putting a partnership approach into practice, especially in programme countries. The review also made a number of focused recommendations concerning future growth of the programme and how this should he managed. I am satisfied that we have made good progress in these areas and that the next peer review, which will take place in 2003, will again attest to the impact and value of our aid programme.As I have remarked, a key theme referred to by the OECD was partnership. Partnership is a prerequisite for effective aid and a cornerstone of the Ireland Aid programme. It permeates all aspects of the programme. Ireland Aid engages closely with partner Governments in each of the programme countries. We liaise continuously with multilateral donors. We co-ordinate efforts on the ground with other bilateral donors and, in particular, co-operate closely with Irish NGOs and missionaries. I have instituted regular consultations with Irish NGOs and intend to deepen our partnership with them and missionaries on a policy level and in the field.As Senators will be aware, this is my second term as Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights. During the years I have seen at first hand the positive work which is undertaken, both in terms of the long-term development strategies in programme countries and also in relation to more immediate efforts to address emergencies and humanitarian crises worldwide. One of my first actions after taking office was to announce a major programme of humanitarian assistance for southern Africa. I subsequently visited Malawi and Zambia and witnessed at first hand the scale of the food crisis. I will shortly be visiting Ethiopia to examine the worsening situation there. The scale of the challenge in these countries cannot be overstated, nor, I am pleased to say, is it possible to overstate the contribution of Irish NGOs and missionaries on the ground. I have great admiration for their extraordinary commitment and devotion to alleviating the suffering of those less fortunate.I referred to the need to assist developing countries to tackle HIV-AIDS. More then 40 million people are living with this disease, of whom some 27 million live in sub-Saharan Africa, in the world's poorest countries. HlV-AIDS is now the leading cause of death in the region. In Africa 2.2 million people died of AIDS in 2001. This is equivalent to the number of casualties which would result from the crashing of over 4,500 jumbo jets in one year. What was once considered a health challenge has quickly become a fundamental threat to development. Already HIV-AIDS is reversing a generation of development efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. The most startling evidence of this is the plunge in life expectancy. Largely because of HIV-AIDS, life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa has been reduced by almost one third, from about 63 years to 43 years, reversing gains made over the last century. As the spread of HIV-AIDS continues, the full impact of the disease is becoming clear.In Zambia, where I spoke to the education Minister when I visited the country, there are now more teachers dying every year from HIV-AIDS than are being trained in teacher training colleges. This has potentially serious long-term implications for the international effort under way to provide universal primary education for all children by 2015. As men and women fall ill, their ability to participate in the labour force is affected, resulting in a decline in agricultural productivity. The huge food crisis in southern Africa to which I have referred and the emerging crisis in Ethiopia have been greatly exacerbated by the high incidence of HIV-AIDS in these countries. While its origins can be attributed to a number of factors, HIV-AIDS is turning cyclical food shortages into full-scale humanitarian disasters.During my visit to Zambia I witnessed at first hand the appalling consequences which these grim statistics do not fully convey. It is difficult to encapsulate in a few words the scale of the human tragedy which I saw at first hand at an AIDS hospice in northern Zambia. One of the most troubling consequences of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is its impact on children. Between 15% and 35% of babies born to HIV positive mothers will be infected with the disease. Most will die by the age of five. Many others are affected through the loss of one or both parents. There are more than 4 million orphans in the six Ireland Aid programme countries, almost equivalent to the population of Ireland. While in Zambia, I visited an orphanage for children who have lost their parents to the virus. This experience will always remain with me.There is at the same time some basis for optimism. Over the past 20 years many governments, donor and NGOs have invested in programmes to halt the spread of AIDS. In Uganda, for example, strong political leadership, a recognition of the extent of the problem and the adoption of multi-sectoral response have contributed to decreasing the HIV prevalence rate from approximately 14% in the early 1990s to less than 7% last year. Ireland Aid has worked closely with the government, local communities and NGOs to tackle HIV/AIDS in Uganda. While progress to date has been very encouraging, much remains to be done and we will intensify our support over the next three years, providing more than €7 million until 2005.I acknowledge the interest of the Taoiseach in this issue. Many Members will be aware he visited Lesotho two years ago, as a result of which our financial contribution in this area was increased significantly.HIV/AIDS will prove to be the greatest obstacle to reducing poverty and achieving the international development goals. Unless the international community can tackle the crisis quickly and effectively, our efforts to support development in other spheres will be undermined. Accordingly, Ireland Aid will continue to integrate measures to combat HIV/AIDS into all facets of the aid programme. This weekend we will mark World AIDS Day, 1 December, with a number of activities designed to raise awareness of the scale and consequences of the human tragedy caused by HIV/AIDS.In addition to raising awareness of the impact of HIV/AIDS on development, we must also seek to raise awareness generally regarding the Ireland Aid programme. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the growth and quality of our programme and I acknowledge the commitment and strong interest of Senators. There is a need, however, to raise awareness among the public about the extent and nature of Ireland Aid's activities. Not only will this help to foster a sense of public ownership, but it will help to ensure a greater level of scrutiny and accountability concerning the effective use of public funds and will ensure continuing focus on the quality of the programme.In the coming months we will intensify efforts to bring the development work done by Ireland Aid to the attention of the general public. This programme belongs to the people and it is right that they should learn more about the invaluable work being done on their behalf in the developing world.I refer to the issues raised by Members. Senator Henry referred to maternal and infant mortality. This issue was also raised by Senator Lydon, who had different concerns. There was much comment about the UN population fund and it requires clarification. Ireland has supported the UNFPA since 1993 and it is important to provide the background to the need for our continued support for this organisation.It is estimated 500,000 women die in the developing world annually due to pregnancy related causes and 350 million women do not have access to any form of contraception. In the Irish aid programme, the area of sexual and reproductive health is integral to the development of a broad based health service, the creation of equal opportunities for women through the education system and the fight against HIV/AIDS. As one of our important development partners, Ireland Aid is supporting the work of UNFPA to extend assistance to developing countries to help them deal with such development challenges as maternal and infant mortality, HIV/AIDS and reproductive health care.UNFPA extends assistance to developing countries at their request. The fund is committed under its mandate to the principles of voluntarism and all its programmes of assistance throughout the world are based on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent. UNFPA's programmes also have a major focus on the fight against HIV/AIDS, which is one of the greatest challenges facing developing countries and one of the overarching objectives of Ireland's development assistance.The fund is supported by many donors through voluntary contributions and Ireland Aid has been making annual voluntary contributions since 1993. This year Ireland has contributed €1.841 million to UNFPA to support its core resources which are focused primarily on the world's poorest countries. The money provided by Ireland Aid helps to save the lives of thousands of women each year and to prevent hundreds of thousands of unwanted pregnancies. This funding allows UNFPA to make an important contribution to the achievement of the UN millennium development goals, including the goal of reducing the maternal mortality rate by 75% by 2015.The EU is engaged in dialogue with the US regarding its funding withdrawal earlier this year and the background to that decision, to which Senator Lydon referred. A consensus exists among EU member states, reaffirmed recently at Council level, regarding the importance of the role of UNFPA in reaching the millennium development goals in the areas of infant, child and maternal mortality and the EU's firm commitment to continue to support the fund. This fund has a critical role to play in support of the implementation of the key millennium goals through its programme and it should continue to be an important development partner for Ireland Aid.

This is not the case and the US has investigated the fund, which Senator Lydon has accepted.I was a Minister of State in the previous Administration and I attended the population conference in Cairo where agreement was reached regarding the need to deal with the world's population. There was a specific agreement that this funding would have absolutely nothing to do with abortion. There is a great deal of misinformation and a lack of knowledge around this issue.Senator Quinn referred to the trade and development agenda. I was privileged to represent the previous Government as a trade Minister at WTO level and I pursued a development agenda in trying to improve the developing world's access to world trade. This is an important issue and I am glad Members focused on it. The 48 poorest countries in the world are engaged in less than 0.25% of world trade. We cannot debate this issue without dealing with the question of trade and development. Senator Quinn was correct to raise the issue of CAP reform in this context because there is no doubt that, as a Government, we will have to bring our agricultural and development policies into line.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	122	That will happen because the agreement reached at the last major meeting of the WTO in Doha referred to the eventual elimination of subsidies and these policies will have to be brought together sooner rather than later. Agreements were made at Doha, by which we will abide, regarding the CAP but we will have to face up to the merger of development and agricultural policies.However, European Ministers for trade agreed useful measures. For instance, we introduced the everything but arms initiative, which means the 48 poorest countries have duty free access to EU markets for everything but arms. They produce tremendous agricultural goods. However, they do not have trade boards and development agencies. Measures were also introduced at WTO level to support these countries to increase their trade capacity. We can share our experience of generating increased growth over the years.During that period we also provided special assistance in terms of legal advice. The WTO regime and its rules and regulations are extremely complicated. European Union Ministers considered it important to give them legal support. That is being established and will be based in Geneva. Many good things happened in the WTO discussions of which, perhaps, people were not aware. I will bring that experience with me into this ministry. It is important that the trade issue is firmly brought centre stage in the development agenda.I thank Senators for their support and their positive contributions and I look forward to working with them in the months ahead. Some Members have been abroad to see what is happening in these countries. Any Member who gets such an opportunity, through committees and other bodies, should avail of it and make such visits. They have had a profound effect on me. I hope I will be able to assist that process, in both Houses, over the coming years.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I commend my colleague, Senator Henry, for putting down this timely and valuable motion for debate. It is an issue which we have been discussing since I was first elected. This House pushed as hard as possible to ensure Ireland would reach the target of 0.7%, a target set 32 years ago in 1970. Even though we have done extraordinarily well in comparison to the other more niggardly countries of Europe, we have a long way to go and it is taking a pathetically long time to get there.I am glad this Minister has responsibility for this portfolio. I know him of old and the personal experience of going to these countries and seeing the situation on the ground has obviously left an indelible mark on him, as it did on the former President, Mary Robinson, when she visited parts of Africa, and on the Taoiseach, who was extremely moved by what he saw.There is no doubt, however, that with the best will in the world, our contribution is reducing at present. One can mask the figures whatever way one wishes and claim that the amount will be increased in the last year or two of the Government's term but that is always dangerous. I understand the critical budgetary situation but this is an area where there should be no cutbacks. We should continue the staged increase so we will reach the target of 0.7% by 2007. It is not just an economic issue; it is a moral argument. The moral dimension, however, also has political spin-offs. Think of the commanding moral political position it would give us among our European and continental allies should we reach the target in 2007.It is most important that we do everything we can to support this Minister, as we supported his splendid predecessor, Deputy O'Donnell, who was invoked earlier in this debate. She was simply terrific. She put her neck on the block on this issue and more power to her. I have in my hand an invitation I have just received to the Doolin memorial lecture which she will give in the College of Surgeons next Saturday week. Unfortunately, I will be unable to attend but the title of the lecture is instructive, given that she is the immediate predecessor of the current Minister. It is: "The fight against diseases of the poor: the moral imperative for development assistance". That puts the issue in perspective.I am glad the Minister mentioned the group from Galway whose members have been writing to public representatives to say that UNFPA money is being used for abortions. That is absolute rubbish and I am extremely glad the Minister scotched the story. It saves me putting on record the full text of a letter I received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. I wrote to him when I got the letter from Galway, but not in the terms the people in Galway would have appreciated. I sought clarification and I received a clear, forthright and detailed letter from the Minister in which he indicated that he would be making representations to the Americans. They have behaved in a disgraceful manner by cutting funding for UNFPA under the Bush Administration. This is the advice we should be giving to our American friends.I am aware that the Ireland Aid review committee reported that the programme was well focused and was working efficiently in some of the poorest African countries. It said the sectors on which our aid was focused were well chosen. I am sure that is true up to a point. However, the committee also recommends an increased degree of partnership with NGOs. We should continue to look at that. Some people think Mr. John O'Shea of GOAL is extreme but that is how he has got things done. I am a great admirer of his because he gets directly involved in these situations. He takes the Minister's advice by going to see these countries and deals directly with them. He provided me over recent years with horrifying information about the levels of corruption within many of the administrations to which we send money.It is unacceptable that Irish taxpayers' money should be filtered off to satisfy the economic requirements of the tinpot dictators and unworthy regimes in these countries. If it is possible to bypass corrupt regimes which indulge in the business of baksheesh and backhanders, we should look at increasing our commitment to NGOs such as Trócaire, Concern, GOAL and others, all of which have done wonderful work. They can give us value for money. I accept there is a political dimension and it might sometimes be essential that we deal with governments but we should monitor these situations as closely as possible.One of the intractable problems is AIDS. Members of both Houses received briefings on the issue of microbicides in the European Parliament building last Friday. This is an experimental treatment and it is not guaranteed that it could not at some stage have counterproductive effects because one must achieve such a level of containment of the virus that one is not creating a virus that has immunity to other drugs. That is just one warning on the subject of microbicides. However, the treatment does have promise.The other problem is that they are a vaginal cream and one must take into account the customs and culture of the people. Even if it was 100% effective, who can say that it will be acceptable in the sub-Saharan regions by traditional tribal women? We must use lateral thinking on this issue. We must involve local medical practices as well. The NGOs could have a role in this regard. I had a meeting with a remarkable woman today, Dr. Concepta Merry from St. James's Hospital. The type of lateral thinking she spoke about is simply wonderful, using multinational corporations to deliver AIDS treatment directly into areas which are difficult for other groups to access. That is the type of thinking we need to use.I wish to discuss the cut in Vote 39 in the Estimates. Here again, there is a danger that we can get involved in a conjurer's illusion. There is an increase of €33 million in the Ireland Aid expenditure, which was €340 million in 2002. However, this merely replaces the €32 million that was cut from the 2002 budget earlier in the year. It is, in fact, a conjuring trick. We have to watch these sharp accountancy practices.If there is one nip, as opposed to cut, which should be restored, it is the emergency humanitarian aid assistance.

Like other speakers, I compliment Senator Henry on putting down this motion on Ireland's relationship with the developing world. This issue is often left on the sidelines and does not get the attention it rightfully deserves. In the 1990s our economy grew at historic levels. We also saw massive increases in public expenditure, a key element of which was the growth in overseas assistance. This has been pushed on to meet our UN target of 0.7%, to which other speakers referred. Senator Lydon said the Taoiseach restated this at the world summit in Johannesburg last September.The Minister of State and Senator Norris – I nearly called him Minister; he is almost a Minister – spoke about the Irish aid programme and how Ireland Aid has been reviewed. We see this being implemented at the moment. Our level of assistance to Africa has never been this high. Senator Minihan said that within the EU Ireland was the sixth highest contributor; we are possibly the fifth highest but I stand corrected and bow to his greater knowledge. This is a wonderful achievement for a country the size of Ireland; a decade ago ours was one of the poorest countries in the EU.Earlier this year I was in Lesotho, one of Ireland's target countries, in a private capacity. I saw at first hand the wonderful work being done with the assistance of Irish taxpayers' money. Ireland is supporting and leading programmes in health, education and access to clean water and is also helping in the fight against HIV/AIDS. I was amazed that Ireland was leading a fight for as basic a need as clean water but I came away thinking how good a programme Ireland Aid is running. It is money well spent and is a programme we in Ireland can be proud of. It touches the lives of many people and is based on a partnership with local people and local government.We are all aware of the billions of dollars being spent by the international community over the last 30 years on development co-operation, yet the average person in Africa today is less well off than 30 years ago. It is therefore clear the answer is not money; it is about the quality of our input. It is not about bringing solutions from Europe and other parts of the developing world to Africa; it is about helping the poor find solutions to their own problems. That is what Senator Quinn alluded to.There is a growing awareness in the international community that new approaches to development. co-operation are required. Health, education and access to basic services cannot be seen in isolation but must be part of a development package that recognises the importance of governance. For too long the issue of governance in developing countries was ignored; we simply put in the provision of services, often in a vacuum created by corruption, a lack of respect for human rights and the lack of transparency. The very large increases in our budget for development co-operation in the last decade must be welcomed but we now have the opportunity to step back and look at this.When Opposition speakers give out about the reduction in aid they should remember it is only a small reduction. We should use this time for reflection on the whole aid area. I also echo Senator Minihan's comments on Senator Higgins's criticism which is politically cheap and unhelpful. The Opposition will be surprised to hear me say I was pleased to see the Minister of Finance last week challenge the public service in this country to examine its effectiveness when he stated clearly that money alone is not the answer. If this is true in any area it must true with development co-operation and other speakers have spelt this out very clearly.We cannot address health and education in isolation. We must look at the kind of government which is responsible for providing these services. With this in mind I congratulate the Taoiseach for his vision when, for the first time, the Minister of State in the last Government responsible for development co-operation was also given specific responsibility for human rights. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, now has this responsibility which recognises the important linkages between development co-operation and human rights. That is a very important task. We cannot talk about the provision of education and health services in a society where there is no respect for human rights or where Government is not responsible to the needs of the people.I saw this in Lesotho at first hand when Ireland Aid headed support for the electoral process in that country. After years of instability, elections were held in May this year which resulted in a Government elected by and representative of the people. This will be a slow process and there will be setbacks in countries like Lesotho but we should stick with them and encourage them. Unlike Senator Ryan, I feel we can reach the UN target.I wish the Minister of State well. I do not doubt he will continue the great work of his predecessor who got plenty of compliments tonight, and rightly so.

Senators Minihan and Feeney commented on Senator Higgins's contribution. He is not here to defend himself but the charge was that he tried to politicise the issue. Of course, everything we do in the Oireachtas is political to some degree but Senator Higgins simply presented the financial situation being faced by Ireland Aid. He pointed out that the modest increase announced in the Estimates last week was simply making up the €30 million cut made a few months ago – literally within a few weeks of the Government being formed. Senator Minihan's analysis of the current situation was far too comfortable.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Senator Minihan gave a very comfortable analysis of where the Government is going. It was his party colleague, when Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid, who said she had liberated ODA from the annual Estimates wrangle. Unfortunately that liberation was short lived and is now lost as we have returned to uncertainty. We cannot say with any degree of certainty that we are set to reach our goal in 2007. We must address that. I know of the Senator's absolute commitment to ensuring aid increases but let us not congratulate ourselves on a recovery of €30 million from what had been a loss of €30 million some months ago. There is a major political battle ahead to ensure we fulfil our obligations by 2007.We are in the midst of an international war on terrorism, which is being led by the United States, but where is the international war on poverty? Who is leading the international war against AIDS and to bring fair play and justice to the world? Senator Ryan made the valid point that never before has the world been so divided. In the 1950s and 1960s, when there was much less worldwide economic prosperity, the gap between rich and poor was half what it is now.While we, in Ireland, are doing our bit, there does not seem to be an international political will to tackle the huge problems of poverty, famine and AIDS. The attitude of the United States, the greatest democracy in the world, to this problem is very weak. We might look at the record of American presidents in this regard. We are told that Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton were marvellous presidents and both were re-elected by the American people. However, their commitment to this issue was feeble. In my memory the only President of the United States who attempted to tackle this issue head-on was Jimmy Carter who was rejected by the electorate for a second term. The American people obviously did not share his values. It is some consolation that he recently received the Nobel prize for peace. We face a major battle to spread the message internationally that we have a moral obligation to deal with this issue.I support what the Minister of State said about Oireachtas Members taking every opportunity to see the problem at first hand. In 1993 I was part of an observer group at the elections in Malawi. Those elections appeared to mark the start of a new world for the people of that country. The regime of Dr. Banda, who had ruled the country for almost 30 years, had come to an end and there was huge excitement and expectation as to how the introduction of democracy would make things better. Unfortunately, nine years later the country has gone backward rather than forward. Diseases such as AIDs are widespread, there is financial distress and a political situation which almost amounts to civil war. It is disappointing to see the hope disappearing.On my visit to Malawi in 1993 I saw what some of the groups were attempting to do, and with considerable success. However, the moral of the story is that our efforts and the resources we were pouring into the country were not sufficient. We must redouble our commitment to bring our contribution to development aid up to 0.7% of GNP. The scale of the problem is enormous because almost 80% of the world's population are living in some degree of poverty, deprivation and disadvantage.I compliment the voluntary groups, NGOs and particularly the religious for the sterling work they are doing. At a time when religious communities are under enormous scrutiny and pressure and clergy bashing has almost become a national sport, we must recognise the enormous good work that has been done internationally by Irish missionaries in bringing help and hope to communities. This should be recognised.I wish the Minister of State well in his efforts. I know of his commitment to bringing fairness and hope to depressed and disadvantaged communities worldwide. More political will is needed. I hope a message will go out from Seanad Éireann that will nudge the Minister for Finance towards giving the Minister of State's office the sort of money required to continue his good work.

I thank and congratulate Senator Henry and her colleagues on putting forward this important motion in a way in which we can all unite around it rather than divide. I have always believed that overseas development assistance is important to our-self respect as a nation and an important dimension of our foreign policy. It was not irrelevant to our election to the Security Council.At the end of the war Ireland sent aid to devastated countries in Europe, such as Germany and Austria, and this is still remembered. Dr. Garret FitzGerald deserves the credit for founding the bilateral aid programme in the mid-1970s. When we got into economic difficulties in the late 1980s, the question of scrapping it altogether was raised, but, fortunately, it continued, albeit on a minimalist basis. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, is right when he says the turning point came when Mr. Albert Reynolds was Taoiseach. In the Bodenstown speech of October 1992 he signalled a change of direction. At that point our contribution was 0.166% of GNP, above only the United States of America which was at the bottom of the list. In the negotiations with the Labour Party leading to the setting up of the coalition Government both parties were clearly coming from the same direction. Deputy Kitt was the first Minister of State, under the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dick Spring, to revamp and build up the overseas aid programme. He did a very good job and it is greatly to his credit that he sought to return to the job of Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid this time around.I do not wish to deny credit to Deputies Joan Burton or Liz O'Donnell when they were Ministers of State. Despite her best efforts, Deputy Burton was only able to raise the level of aid from 0.25% to 0.31%. During the last Government, with huge growth rates of up to 10%, it was quite difficult to push the aid level up, but it was raised to 0.41%.I do not entirely agree with the view of Senator Ryan that there is no real public support for overseas aid. There are many young people and idealistic people of every age to whom this matters deeply. I was always unhappy when, as a party, we did not seem to be doing enough. Everything we do is inadequate in relation to the huge global problems we face.I helped former Deputy Ray Burke when in Opposition to get an interim target, which we have not yet reached, of 0.45% . I also helped the former Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, in her negotiations with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to try to get a united position. Senator Bradford is absolutely right when he says there are political battles to be fought.There will always be sceptics around. Part of the value of this debate is to help us overcome that scepticism. It is important that we achieve the objectives we have set ourselves as soon as we can. We are now in the upper tier. Instead of being at the bottom, we are above most of the large countries, many of which have no compunction about cutting their aid budgets.I have seen the good work done in Lesotho. In 2002 we were the most significant aid contributor to Lesotho, just ahead of China. I do not know if that is still the case. Similarly, we established an aid office in East Timor which, when visited in 2002, was an absolutely beautiful but devastated country. The Taoiseach was deeply impressed by the aid situation there, to which the Minister of State devoted so much of his speech.I felt Senator Quinn went a little overboard. The Minister of State may not be aware of it, but the Senator crusades against the Common Agricultural Policy at every opportunity. Coming from a farming background, I am entirely in favour of balance between trade and the CAP, but if one scraps the CAP, a lot of disadvantaged people, not just in existing EU countries, but also in the countries about to join, will suffer.The Ireland Aid review, a very valuable document, the guts of which, I am glad to say, were incorporated into the Fianna Fáil manifesto and An Agreed Programme for Government, refers to an Asian country. I was in Sri Lanka in February this year, mainly because a peace process has been started there. A terrible conflict took place in which 60,000 died. It is an island much the same size as Ireland, but with a much larger population. Partly because of the similarity of the political problem, it would greatly benefit from aid. It is economically wrecked and reasonably self-contained because it is an island. I ask the Minister of State to look very closely at it as a possible candidate to which we could extend our aid programme.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I welcome Senator Henry's motion that Seanad Éireann recognises the value of Ireland's aid to developing countries, monetary and otherwise, and calls on the Minister for Finance to maintain our commitment to it. I thank the Minister of State for enlightening the Seanad in many areas. It was a very worthwhile exercise.The treatment of Third World and developing countries historically has proven that we must deal with them in an ethical and proper manner. The lessons of the last century and the problems associated with imperialism and adventurers doing business with the Third World lead me to ask the Minister of State to consider a legally binding code of ethics for business people doing business with the Third World. While we have no reason to suggest that any of them is doing business in an unethical manner, we could be a leading light in this regard for the rest of Europe and perhaps the rest of the developed world.I was disappointed that Senator Ryan questioned our bona fides on development aid. Ireland's aid of 0.16% of a much lower GNP in 1991 reflects the 0.41% of a much higher GNP this year, and is heading in the right direction. I welcome the Minister of State's statement regarding emergency humanitarian aid, which means that money will be available for basic needs such as food, shelter and clean water and that we are keeping these needs to the forefront of our aid programme. It also means that, having reached a certain level, we can continue with self-help, health care and higher-order needs measures, which are also to the forefront of our development aid programme.I thank the many NGOs and Irish missionaries who through the decades and centuries have been a beacon to the rest of the world. I welcome the Minister of State's clarification regarding where our aid is directed, which is very important because it should be sent to the relevant countries for basic necessities and development. It would be sad to think that it would be used for anything other than these.The UN Cairo programme did not promote abortion as its recommendations were to be implemented by each country consistent with national laws, policies, religious and ethical values. I believe this will be continued under the EU directive on aid. I ask the Minister of State to reflect the views of the Irish people at every opportunity in this regard, whether in Europe or at the United Nations, and promote direct help. It should not be a programme that promotes abortion. In this regard, I support my colleague, Senator Lydon.

Not only that, it is true to say it would have the support of the people as a whole. We are very proud of the work being done regarding foreign aid. A sum of €375 million is sizeable and, taken with the work being carried out by missionaries, voluntary bodies and charitable organisations on behalf of the Irish people, makes us all very proud.We welcome the address of the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has the full support of this House. I am sure that, when we reach the goal of 0.7%, Members of the House will be looking for that sum to be increased also.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I cannot tell the Minister of State how pleased I am with his speech and the speeches of all the Senators who contributed on this motion. I was not being foolish in tabling a motion in Private Members' time and used the given wording with two things in mind. First, I am a great believer in the proverb "Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí." That was for the benefit of the Minister of State because it is extremely hard to speak after someone who is close to canonisation. Deputy O'Donnell is, as far as I know, the first woman and lay person to be asked by the Irish Medical Organisation to give the Doolin lecture. Canonisation is in sight when one receives that honour from the Irish medical profession. The second reason for the wording of the motion is that I did want to get all Senators to support it, particularly Government Senators, because I will not be at the Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats deliberations. I want Senators to remember what they said tonight at those deliberations.I did use the word "maintain" carefully because there has been funny arithmetic between last year and this year. I am certainly anxious about the figure of €30 million which no longer seems to pertain to this year but to next year. I will leave it to the Minister of State to find out.I had been reassured about emergency humanitarian aid. I really was very proud of this country when I saw the situation in Ethiopia concerning the world food bank. There is not starvation in the whole of Ethiopia, there is plenty of food in some parts. What have we done? We bought sorghum and beans in a place where there was plenty and brought them to Tigre, where they are now ready for the famine. Forgive me for saying this, but the United States sent in wheat, which is not eaten in the area. They would not mill it. The area in question has no mills for wheat, nor can it be done by hand. Therefore, we should never belittle our efforts because they are good, not just in monetary terms, but also because thought is going into them.I am glad the issue of the UNFPA arose because we were all taught that one should not bear false witness. That is fine if applied to people, but one has to be careful in applying it to organisations. I am sure Senator Lydon will realise that I am the last person in the world who would be coercing women to do anything, not to mind something so grim as abortion or sterilisation.I am pleased Senator Hanafin referred to the Cairo conference, which the Minister of State and I attended. The then Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State proposed to the European Union that while abortion could never be considered a family planning method, the dire consequences of unsafe abortion had to be addressed. That is the reason I raised the importance of ensuring adequate supplies of antibiotics. In the course of this debate between 25 and 30 women will have died due to unsafe abortion, which is probably a conservative estimate. We have persevered with this view and are now on the executive of the UNFPA where we have huge moral responsibility. I am sure the Department is weary of replying to all our questions. Deputy Gay Mitchell recently submitted one which, once again, deals with the reaffirmation of the position of the UNFPA.The position of China is difficult. It is a very big country with a draconian policy in this area. I have spoken to some Chinese people involved in family planning, including the vice-chairman of the standing committee of the National People's Congress of China, the state family planning commissioner and a member of the country's family planning association. In addition to visits by Americans, three Members of Parliament at Westminster have visited, led by Christine McCafferty. They met an Irish nun who had been 40 years in China. She said the UNFPA did nothing but good, sometimes in trying circumstances. The delegation's report will be placed on the Internet at the end of this week. The website address is www.appg/popdevrh.org.uk.Senator Quinn rightly said trade would be much better than aid. However, it is necessary to consider the level of support for the Common Agricultural Policy and the situation regarding globalisation, which is good abroad but bad at home. These issues will be with us for a long time.I wish the Minister of State the best of luck. He will make Senators across all parties very angry if he does not succeed in maintaining aid at its current levels. Deputy O'Donnell used to say she had to sit on the aid nest like a hen. I will not try to devise a masculine simile, but I am sure the Minister of State will do his best. I thank Senators for their support.

A few weeks ago students in Ramelton, County Donegal, protested at bus overcrowding. They considered that a basic human right had been removed from them. Their protest involved them walking in the rain from Ramelton to and from two schools in Milford. In this instance students decided that their educational entitlements were not respected and they decided to protest. There are few avenues open to them to have their concerns addressed in County Donegal and as they considered they were getting nowhere, they decided to protest.While this may be a parochial issue, it impacts on the rest of the country. It can often arise that an extra 20 or 30 students may need to use the school bus service. This has insurance and safety implications. While I am disappointed the Minister for Transport is not present, I have no doubt the Minister of State will be a competent replacement.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I am here in the absence of the Minister for Education and Science. The Senator will be aware that the mother of the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, has died. Her funeral is today.I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the position regarding school transport at Milford post-primary schools. The school transport scheme was established to cater for children in rural areas who, if living a long distance from school, might otherwise have difficulty in maintaining regular school attendance. Approximately 131,000 primary and post-primary students use the scheme on a regular basis.Safety on school transport is of paramount importance to the Department of Education and Science and Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of the Department, sometimes with its own buses and at others through a management agency. Bus Éireann is responsible for ensuring the scheme is operated in the most efficient and cost effective manner having regard to legislation governing the safety and condition of vehicles. It has extensive knowledge and experience of all relevant legislation governing public transport vehicles, such as safety regulations, road worthiness regulations and regulations relating specifically to the school transport scheme. There is one regime and one set of regulations under which the scheme is operated.This protest relates to the loading on the school bus service. It has been alleged that the bus is overcrowded. However, this is not the case. Since one agency, Bus Éireann, manages the scheme, the same standards apply throughout the country. This means that standards deemed suitable in one area ought to apply in another.The permitted loading on all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the road traffic regulations, construction equipment and use of vehicles, as laid down by the Department. Under public service vehicle regulations, the licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats. Great care is taken to ensure loading does not exceed the maximum legal carrying capacity.It should also be noted that, given the loading sequence on any route, in most cases vehicles would have their full complement of passengers only for perhaps the last 15 minutes of their morning journey and the first 15 minutes of the homeward journey, after which the loading should thin out and would not be a problem. Absenteeism and non-utilisation of tickets contribute to a further reduction in the numbers carried.There is no recorded case of an accident being attributed to the three for two seating arrangement or of that arrangement exacerbating the effects of an accident. Moreover, the use of this seating arrangement is quite common on school transport in other countries. The safety aspects of school transport, including the seating arrangement, is being examined by the school transport section of the Department of Education and Science, together with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.In line with the commitment in The Road to Safety – The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, a consultation paper which set out a wide range of options for enhancing school bus safety was published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government earlier this year. Following an extended consultation period, a large number of responses were received. These are now being reviewed with a view to identifying a range of specific proposals for implementation. I apologise again for the Minister's absence.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I thank the Minister of State for his response. We are aware that there is a three person per two seat ratio but perhaps we can review the whole issue because we are talking about young adults of 17, 18 and 19 years of age. On this particular bus there is an average of ten to 15 students standing because two people on the seat will not move to make room for a third person. Perhaps this can be the start of the review process. I thank the Minister of State again for his reply.

My own son was about 19 when he did the leaving certificate so I accept that these children are of that age but there ought to be an equal number of 13 year olds or whatever. It is possible, however, that the mix in that area, depending on who is travelling on the bus for the longer journey, might be slightly different but I will convey this case to the Minister.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for accepting this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to hear it.It has been a welcome development that in recent years the Government sought to reduce the tax burden on both the individual and on business. It has and will continue to provide an incentive for companies to develop and expand as well as providing individuals with an incentive to participate in the labour force. However, there is one area of business taxation that has been forgotten. It is an area where businesses have experienced increases over the past ten years averaging almost twice the rate of inflation. This area is commercial rates.Commercial rates are one of the four main ways in which local government is funded, the others being income on goods and services, grants and subsidies and the local government fund. The whole issue of commercial rates takes on increasing importance following the recent publication of the pre-budget Estimates in which the allocation to the fund is €420 million. This represents a marginal increase in the fund for 2003 and in real terms, when inflation is taken into account, it could well be a reduction. Meanwhile, I understand that the local authority pay bill has increased by well in excess of 12% in 2002 alone and when benchmarking is taken into consideration, it is certain that the increase in the bill for 2003 will also be significant. I am sure the Minister of State is also aware that for 2003, in contrast to 2002, there are no specific allocations to local authorities to finance the salaries of elected members.Taking these figures into account, will the Minister of State not agree that many local authorities will find themselves with deficits next year and many may be tempted to significantly increase their take from commercial rates to make up for any deficits in their budgets, particularly since the cap on increasing commercial rates has been removed? Further increases in commercial rates would have the effect of countering many of the gains businesses have made from tax cuts in many areas in recent years, which have been instrumental in the success of our economy over the past ten years.I am sure the Minister of State is aware that many small and medium sized businesses, particularly those in rural Ireland, are already struggling with rising costs such as insurance and wages. Will he not agree that in the current climate, a rise in commercial rates could have serious implications for these hard pressed businesses and, for some, could be the last straw? Many small and medium sized enterprises, particularly in rural Ireland, are currently operating on very slim margins but they all have to pay their commercial rates bill regardless of whether they are in profit.In light of this, would the Minister of State consider reviewing the allocation provided in the pre-budget Estimates for the local government fund with a view to increasing the allocation to reflect the rising costs local authorities face in the execution of their functions? If the Minister did that, local authorities would not be tempted to significantly increase their take from commercial rates to balance their books. It is essential that the allocation include appropriate remuneration for local authority elected members, who give so generously of their time, and for their sterling commitment to the effective representation of their constituents.Those in the business community must pay their way and I am certain they do not object to paying. I am aware also that the private sector is only too aware of the changed economic circumstances in which we now find ourselves but since the abolition of domestic rates in 1978 and rates on agricultural land in 1984, business is the only sector that pays rates on its property to local authorities.The total collected in commercial rates in 1984 was €182 million. That figure has risen to €746 million today. In other words, since becoming the sole contributing sector in 1984, the total take from the business community by local authorities has increased in excess of 400%. I am sure the Minister of State who, in the past, has proven himself to be pro-enterprise and understanding of the pressures under which small businesses throughout urban and especially rural Ireland operate, would consider that this level of increase is both excessive and unsustainable, particularly in the current economic climate when many firms are struggling with rising costs.Business must also pay for water, disposal of commercial waste, charges linked to planning permission, the provision of parking and connection to water and sewerage schemes. These charges have increased almost exponentially.There is a limit to the amount that any one sector of society should be expected to contribute. While we all understand that we are living in much tougher times when we all have to tighten our belts in the global economic downturn, perhaps the Minister would reconsider the decision to allocate little or no increase in the local government fund and ensure that local government is adequately funded so that struggling small and medium sized businesses, particularly in rural Ireland, will not have to bear the brunt of further rises in costs through increased commercial rates.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-27 00:00:00	Prelude	141	This is the first time, since taking up my position in the Custom House, that I have had to deal with the issue of local government funding in the House, and I welcome the opportunity to do so.I was a member of Dublin City Council for about 17 years and I fully share Senator MacSharry's concern that local authorities must be properly resourced to carry out the wide range of functions entrusted to them. It goes without saying that without resources, little can be achieved. It goes without saying also that if resources were unlimited, local government could justifiably and effectively spend significantly more in improving the range, depth and quality of the services they provide to the public. However, as every Member of this House will be only too aware, resources have always been and will always be limited. Hard choices, therefore, will always have to be made.That said, the track record of this Government in contributing resources to local government stands up to the closest scrutiny. This year, some €593 million has been allocated to local authorities from the local government fund in general purpose grants. That is an increase of 75% in five years and an increase of 10% over the 2001 baseline allocations. This House should acknowledge the scale of this achievement and the extent to which it has contributed to putting local government on a sound financial footing, perhaps for the first time in very many years.I should also mention that in addition to general purpose grants, the introduction of the local government fund by this Government has seen grants for non-national roads increase by over 100% since 1997. That does not mean that we can stand still. The Minister is finalising proposals for the 2003 local government fund general purpose grant allocations and these will be notified to authorities in the next couple of weeks. These allocations will take account of the potential cost increases facing local authorities next year, increases which Senator MacSharry has highlighted.All options are being examined to ensure that an appropriate level of general purpose grant can be made available to each authority from the local government fund next year. At the same time, it must be understood that important as these grants are, they contribute to only about one fifth of local authorities' current income. In drawing up their budgets for the coming year, local authorities must look to all potential income sources to ensure that their income matches their expenditure.In framing its Abridged Estimates the Government took many hard decisions and it did not take these lightly. It took them in full knowledge of the need to consolidate the public finances by bringing expenditure growth under control. It is right also that in managing their affairs and framing their budgets for 2003, local authorities should have regard to the particular requirement at this time for sound and responsible financial management and should take appropriate decisions to balance their expenditure against income from central and local resources.As the Senator mentioned, the cap for the year has been removed and it is up to the local authorities at their Estimates meetings in the coming weeks to do the best they can in matching their revenue sources with their expenditure. While the grant from the central Exchequer may not be what many local authorities would like, they will have to do the best they can. I accept the point that the cap has been removed and some local authorities may increase the commercial rate by more than they would have in another year. Hopefully they will not see that just as the easy option or the easy way out. It will probably be set higher than the rate of inflation and now that the cap is removed I hope they will not lose the run of themselves but I do not believe they will.
