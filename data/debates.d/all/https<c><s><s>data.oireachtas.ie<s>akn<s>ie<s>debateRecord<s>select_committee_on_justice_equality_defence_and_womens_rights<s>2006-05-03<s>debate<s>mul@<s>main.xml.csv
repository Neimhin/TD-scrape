In the inserted section 15(1)(b), to delete “person” and substitute “person,”.This section deals with the updating of penalties for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life. The issues we are discussing apply to a number of the earlier updated penalties in relation to other aspects to do with firearms. I am in favour of increasing penalties for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and otherwise. However, I question whether the proposed penalties should be minimum or mandatory on the basis that, given the exceptional and specific circumstances specified in subsection (5), such penalties can and very often do end up neither minimum nor mandatory.I have had an opportunity to study the note the Minister circulated since our last discussion. Amendment No. 11 to the amendment relates to what I will refer to as the get-out clause contained in subsection (5) and proposes that it should not apply where a person has been convicted of a second or subsequent offence under this section. I have listened to the Minister's comments on the need for such a clause. I can envisage a situation where, on conviction for a first offence, a person could make a reasonable case for not being subjected to the mandatory minimum penalty and where a judge would feel such was inappropriate. I wonder what is the record to date in that regard. Under the Drugs Act, it was considered appropriate to apply the clause in only 4% or 5% of cases. As the Minister mentioned, it is now used in approximately 20% of cases. Taking that record into account, we should provide that on conviction for a second offence the get-out clause should not apply.In his circulated notes the Minister refers to the constitutional imperative that judges have discretion to consider not only the offence but also the individual's circumstances. He has stated that the effect of my amendment would be to remove such discretion from the courts in circumstances where a person is found guilty of a second or subsequent offence under the section. He has also said that, given the constitutional requirement that the Judiciary not be tied to carry out an action which is manifestly unjust, he does not consider the amendment appropriate. I would like to put forward the following point for serious consideration. Is there a constitutional imperative to provide for judicial discretion? I do not believe that is the case. We have in place provisions relating to a number of offences to which judicial discretion does not apply, including murder. In a case where a person is convicted of murder, the judge has no choice other than to impose a life sentence. One might say there are many options open to the parole board and Minister at a later stage but the sentence to be handed down in such cases is life imprisonment.Under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, a person convicted of drink driving is subject to a mandatory penalty of disqualification from driving, something which can have very serious consequences. There is no judicial discretion where a person is convicted for driving while over a certain limit. We are not required to legislate for judicial discretion. If there is not a constitutional imperative to legislate for judicial discretion, surely we are not being fair and just to anybody involved in one serious offence. The same applies in regard to a number of other sections. Surely we would be adopting a fair, reasonable and just approach which is constitutionally sound if in regard to the very serious charge of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life we were to provide that there be judicial discretion in the form of a get-out clause where a person is convicted of a first offence but that the Legislature may decide if the offence so warrants that the clause should not be applied in the case of a second offence. That is my case. I will not labour the point further.I am not a constitutional expert, although I have studied the Constitution from many angles during the years as a politician, lawyer and the first Chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Such a provision would be constitutionally sound and send a clear message from the Oireachtas. I, therefore, ask the Minister to give due consideration to amendment No. 11 to the amendment. All of the other amendments in my name to the amendment are of a technical nature and I put them forward for consideration by the Minister and Parliamentary Counsel.

If I were given the green light by the Attorney General, it would be my intention to accept such an amendment on Report Stage. In other words, I will consider whether what the Deputy is suggesting is constitutionally permissible, namely, that the get-out clause can be revoked in a case where a person is convicted of a second or subsequent offence on the basis that on being convicted of the first offence he or she received a clear warning of the consequences of reoffending. If all the constitutional angles can be accommodated in such an approach, I am sympathetic to it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I would like to deal with a number of related issues. I am sympathetic to the intent encompassed by the amendment as proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe and I am pleased the Minister is addressing it. Subsections (3) and (6) of amendment No. 118 provide that the court, in imposing sentence on a person for an offence under this section, "may, in particular," have regard to certain circumstances. Would a possible way of addressing this matter be to substitute "shall" for "may"? Subsection (6)(a) deals with a person who has a previous conviction for an offence under the Firearms Act. It is important that we provide that it be mandatory for the courts to have regard to certain circumstances. This would go some way towards capturing the point made by Deputy O’Keeffe who put the case more succinctly and seeks to address the matter on two levels by also providing for a significant mandatory penalty clause. I support his amendment.An issue we discussed on the last occasion and which I am putting back on the agenda is that rightly instanced by the Minister on that occasion, namely, the existence of a person with a reservoir of important information in uncovering more serious crimes and bringing to book more serious criminals. I would not like us to reach a situation where such an avenue would be entirely closed off and there would be no material benefit to an individual accused of having blown the whistle on another. Whether such a person sings like a canary or watches a spot on the wall, the consequences are the same. We must provide for flexibility to ensure there is leverage for the Garda in cross-examination and ultimately the courts in sentencing.

Having listened to the Minister's comments on amendment No. 11 to the amendment, I am heartened that he is minded to accept it on Report Stage, subject to further consultation with the Attorney General. For this reason, I propose not to move the amendment and instead resubmit it on Report Stage.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On the subject of amendment No. 11 to the amendment, we need to be careful in this regard because Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal to apply mandatory sentences to those who commit second or subsequent offences would apply to persons convicted of a second offence while serving a sentence. We should provide that the second strike rule would apply only if a person is convicted of a further offence following release from prison. For many years in the North those who reoffended after release served the outstanding part of their previous sentence before the sentence for the second offence commenced. While I have not done an analysis to determine the effectiveness of this approach or its implications for the State, other mechanisms are available to ensure the punishment for a second offence is greater than for a first offence.On my amendments to the amendment, the Minister correctly summarised their effect. Amendment No. 6 to the amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (4) of the new section proposed by the Minister in amendment No. 118 and would, if accepted, remove the mandatory minimum sentence provisions. As the Minister indicated, the minimum sentence is not mandatory in all circumstances because a degree of judicial discretion is provided for when deciding whether to impose a minimum sentence.I agree the courts and society must take a strong view on drugs and firearms offences, the two areas in which the Minister proposes to introduce mandatory minimum sentences. While I accept his proposal does not eliminate judicial discretion, it severely circumscribes the sentencing powers of the Judiciary. For this reason, I have no problem with increasing the maximum sentences available for these offences. We must, however, exercise care when legislating for changes in sentencing policy. This requires that we first examine whether the introduction of mandatory sentences in other jurisdictions had the desired effect. Members would favour the introduction of mandatory sentences if they were certain such measures would have the desired effect but the evidence from other jurisdictions suggests otherwise. In the United States, in particular, gun crime and the prison population have continuously increased since the introduction of mandatory sentences. This approach did not discourage the possession and use of illegal firearms or reduce the number of deaths caused by firearms.How do we address this problem? My preference is that judges, in deciding on these cases, will continue to have discretion to take account of all the circumstances of the case, while also having discretion to impose a maximum sentence, which the Bill increases for some offences. Amendment No. 10 to the amendment would balance the increase in maximum sentences by providing that the judge must take various factors into account, namely, "the circumstances in which the offence occurred including any aggravating and mitigating factors, extent of violent behaviour, character, age, previous criminal record, family circumstances, expressions of remorse, whether alternatives to custody would be a more appropriate sentence or part thereof and the imperative to protect the public from harm".Deputies could cite cases in which the offender deserved a second chance. The proposal in subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment would condemn anybody involved in gun crime to a mandatory sentence, with all the implications such a decision would have for the sentenced offender. Having been placed in prison, those who are not members of a gang will join one and probably use drugs if they have not done so previously. Moreover, they will be educated further in the ways of the underworld, particularly if another of the Minister's proposals is accepted, namely, the provision to remove the possibility of pre-release or temporary release for persons serving sentences under this section.Most decisions to give prisoners temporary release or commute parts of their sentence are taken following consideration of the prisoner's circumstances. For instance, an offender may have tried to make amends for his or her crimes while in jail or the authorities may wish to encourage him or her to avail of training to ensure a degree of stability in his or her family life on release to prevent families being punished. The prospect of early or temporary release is an incentive to prisoners to behave while in prison, learn from their experiences and benefit themselves and society. The purpose of prison, in addition to punishment, is to try to significantly diminish or eliminate the likelihood of reoffending. Training is offered to prisoners, both inside and outside the prison service to ensure a degree of stability when they emerge from jail. The introduction of mandatory sentences, by removing the possibility of prisoners being given temporary release to attend courses or funerals or become more involved in the life of their children as they grow up, also removes an important incentive.Under the Constitution, judges are responsible for the administration of justice, including the determination of punishment. We should refrain from restricting a judge's ability to determine this based on circumstances. As legislators, we set the parameters within which the Judiciary should work. We should not be overly prescriptive. If we go down this road, we could have minimum sentences for every crime, of which I am not in favour. I favour a maximum sentence, allowing the Judiciary to take into account the circumstances of a case and suspend part or all of a sentence. If one is in breach of the terms of the suspension, one should serve the complete sentence, if needs be. This allows the judge discretion.Mandatory sentences are popular. In the past, with regard to drugs offences, I called on the Judiciary to implement such sentences. One is seen to be hard on drug barons and mules but while they may be popular, these measures are not effective in most jurisdictions. Perhaps we should have examined their effect in more detail before we reached this stage. There are alternatives which we should consider.

I accept that each view is held in good faith and intellectually respectable.It is not sensationalist to state firearms are more readily available than ever before. They are being used in a vicious manner on a scale the people have not seen before, although every firearms death is vicious and in the days of the Troubles firearms were used in an awful way. Most find it hard to grasp the existence of a new class in their twenties who watch violent videos all day, some of which I have seen. Knocking off an opponent is seen in a morally neutral way and there is a voyeuristic, pornographic interest in the casual nature in which characters who get in their way are killed. I do not know if the people concerned spend their days snorting cocaine while watching such videos. The viciousness with which they kill those who are seen as obstacles to their activities is difficult to comprehend. One wonders if the people concerned see themselves as rich magnates living off their ill-gotten gains in sunny climes in their 40s. Do they think beyond next week? Do they consider the moral implications of what they do or is there any moral dimension to their character? No one can sleep easy after engaging in such depraved behaviour.The public wants us to take a strong stance against the use of firearms. It wants it to be made clear to everyone in the criminal justice process, including gardaí, the Judiciary, politicians, offenders and other members of the public, that if Ireland allows the taking of life to become commonplace, it will be very difficult to undo the damage caused to our social fabric. We live in a republican democracy and there is nothing wrong with Ministers or Members of the Oireachtas publicly stating the substance of public opinion. The Judiciary can disregard what politicians say if they do not agree with it but sentencing policy must take into account public opinion as well as other factors.I must steer a line between micro-managing the outcome of criminal cases which is not a function of the Executive or the Legislature and setting a legal framework in which maximum sentences have not appeared to work in the past. When the mandatory minimum sentence for drug offences was introduced, it was imposed in 5% of cases. That this figure has increased to 20% is not a coincidence. The public dissatisfaction, as expressed by public representatives, has a part to play in this. I do not wish to have sentencing policy determined by public clamour, competitive anger or the media. Editors have claimed that they are more in touch with public opinion than public representatives, suggesting the purchase of newspapers gives a mandate to pursue a particular editorial line. I doubt that proposition but in a republican democracy one can state every Member of Dáil Éireann has been elected to exercise a particular function and has a mandate for a particular term of office.Given the connection between drugs and firearms, it is reasonable to link the sentencing policy for each crime. It would be strange if mandatory minimum sentences applied to possession of substantial quantities of drugs but no such advice was given to the Judiciary through a sentencing policy laid down in statute in respect of the use of firearms which are so closely connected to the drugs phenomenon in modern society. There is a sort of a symmetry in that regard. Deputy Ó Snodaigh suggested that we examine American data to see whether such policies are effective. However, I do not believe that any state in America takes such a sensitive approach to the issue.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That is the first matter.Even regarding felonies, the "three strikes and you are out" system is crude. Three instances of shoplifting can constitute three felonies, meaning that the perpetrator is put away for life in some penitentiary. We are not engaging in that sort of thing. I say to Deputy Ó Snodaigh that considering American data may not be a very good way to examine the effectiveness of sentencing policies laid down in statute. We are not following the American line by telling a judge that there is no issue if it is a person's third felony offence and that he or she must simply go to jail for life.I am obliged to obey and uphold the Constitution. If I thought that there was no constitutional dimension to this, I would further tighten the loophole and, possibly, judges' discretion. However, I must be conscious of the fact that an Article 26 reference on such a provision or a challenge at a later stage is not improbable. I do not wish the entire section, or the entire Bill, to be knocked on the head as a result of excessive zeal that crosses a line on my part. That is why I must carefully heed the Attorney General's advice on each step. Regarding Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment, for example, while expressing personal appetite for its principles, I must urge caution and consult the Attorney General to benefit from his considered view of whether it is a permissible provision and whether its enactment would be safe. I cannot adopt a constitutionally unsafe proposition, even if it involved a 50-50 issue. If the Attorney General counsels not to proceed, I cannot do so. That is how the system works.We are taking a step in the right direction. What causes me concern is whether the minimums for which we are providing are too low. It might be argued that they are not exactly dissuasive and cannot have much deterrent effect. In many cases, they may not be regarded as very stern. In these provisions, however, we are trying to bring about change. These are not merely political window-dressing and if those minimum sentences are in place and adhered to, subject to constitutional requirements, the general public, the Judiciary and the criminal justice system will benefit from their enunciation in law.I sympathise with the position of judges. They are asked in our system to judge the fate of other citizens on an individual basis. They make life-changing decisions on behalf of others, listen to pleas in mitigation, examine the person whom they are about to jail and their job is clearly difficult. It is not gross interference with their function for the Legislature to clarify what was intended by a criminal justice statute and what it believes should be the norm regarding those convicted of specific offences. It must at least be some consolation to them to ask whether one is wrong and whether it should be two or 12 years. It is at least of some use to them to see that the Legislature has set seven years as the minimum before they examine aggravating circumstances and the question of exceptional circumstances that might justify departing from it in some cases. It is of assistance to a judge to see that in statute form. If I were a judge, I would not regard it as invading my judicial independence but as something that made my job easier by removing doubt as to whether one is conforming with the spirit of the law in imposing a given sentence.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I know that we are anxious to move on. I agree with the case articulated by the Minister. I am strongly of the view that we have reached the time when the Legislature must speak loudly in respect of anyone who goes out with a weapon to menace the public in any shape or form, particularly if such a weapon is used in the commission of a criminal act.I wish to make two points, the first being that the Minister did not address my suggestion to the effect that if there are constitutional difficulties with the amendment tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, it might be of some help to change the word "may" to "shall" so that the section reads "shall have regard" for previous convictions in sentencing so that we move away from mandatory sentencing in those two subsections. That would go some way towards capturing the principle enunciated by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.My other point is that we must do more than signal in the abstract or, as the Minister said, comfort judges with a difficult job. Among the biggest issues facing us in the criminal justice system is the need to ensure public confidence in judicial action. There is often very good reason for the variation in sentencing that we have seen in some cases but because there is no explanation, public confidence is eroded. To lay down clear guidelines as ballpark figures will restore public confidence in the Judiciary by making clear that the tariff for similar offences should be commensurate. That tariff is laid down by the Oireachtas when it shapes the law and applied by the courts, with the constitutional right that the Judiciary has to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis. There is certainly an argument for consistency that is important in this context.

The killings that occurred last year in particular highlighted that the Drimnagh gang had been running around murdering people for several years. There were also unrelated deaths in Inchicore and several in Ballyfermot. The Minister is right that life is cheap to such people. For some, ten years will not serve as a deterrent; I do not know what would have that effect. For some, the threat of a sentence is similar to being in a film because it makes them big men. They will go to jail and pose there, pursuing their vendettas. The cycle is not broken and although, according to the Minister, Operation Anvil was a success regarding the quantity of weapons recovered, its failure in my area showed that the criminals could not care less. When it was in train, three execution-style killings were carried out by a particular gang and these were responded to by another gang.The young people to whom I refer can be on cocaine, heroin or alcohol. Most of the gang members are between the ages of 18 and 30, though there are older people in the background who are stirring matters up. Some of these individuals are well known and have been exposed by the media. However, they are not being caught and they will not be apprehended merely because we are changing the law. A greater level of resources must be provided for the Garda drugs squad because all of this activity is linked to drug dealing. Weapons are being brought in as part of drug shipments. This is demonstrated by the fact that every single shipment the Garda has, thankfully, captured has had weapons associated with it. If we are to tackle the availability of guns, we must focus on drug shipments and determine what more we can do to destroy the drug empires which have been built up. That is also how to tackle minions who run around in bullet-proof vests and who are tooled up to the hilt.The attitude of the Garda is sometimes regrettable. An incident occurred in my area involving a parent who had been bringing children to a football match and who complained to the Garda after a man stood in front of his car and waved a gun at it. In that instance, the Garda said the complainant should not worry because the man was coked up and would have forgotten about it in the morning. A month later, the man in question did the same thing. Not only do we need to tell the Judiciary that it must act on such incidents, we must ensure that the Garda has the resources to respond more quickly and effectively to gun crime and the possession of illegal firearms.The reason I am speaking at length is that these are the same arguments I will make on mandatory sentencing for drugs related offences. I might as well put the arguments in the open at this point. I am concerned that we will end up throwing away the key for possession of firearms or significant quantities of drugs, though the threshold on the quantity of drugs set out in legislation is low. The prison population will grow and fill the prison the Minister has planned for Thornton Hall. While we should not refrain from convicting people simply because of the size of the prison population, we cannot implement these changes without providing more money for prisons and post-release systems to provide stability and support for ex-prisoners. Without further investment, the likelihood is that those with negative prison experiences will end up on drugs or in gangs, thereby confirming the positions in which they already find themselves. If we are to adopt mandatory sentencing, we must also ensure that training, rehabilitation and support of which prisoners can avail will be provided. If a person does not want to do so, we cannot force him or her to use the services to which I refer. However, a package must be provided.The commutation of sentences and the system of temporary releases must also be examined. One might be able to provide that the option to commute a sentence or provide temporary release will be unavailable in respect of prisoners who have served less than half their sentences. If, however, they are ruled out completely, there is little incentive for inmates to be good prisoners and avoid membership of gangs or learning the tricks of the trade. The Minister is correct. While it is rare that I would look to the USA for justice policies, I did not have any other examples to hand.

I would never encourage another state to follow the prison policies of the USA, where the system has become crazy since the introduction of mandatory sentencing. The prison population in the USA has increased by 1,000% over ten years, which is not a route we should follow. That is not to say that if people wish to continue to carry out certain activities, we should not imprison them. Some states in the USA, of which Michigan is one, have, however, repealed mandatory sentencing because it has not been effective. While there have been financial reasons for repeal, it has also been motivated by the fact that mandatory sentencing had no effect on the problem it was intended to tackle.I ask the Minister to reconsider the clause on temporary releases. I understand what the body is intended to achieve and if I am unsuccessful in my amendments, I wish him well with the policy and hope it has the desired effect. However, I do not think it will. I hope the Minister will adopt a different mechanism and will choose not to proceed with such a prescriptive measure.

While it is important that justice is done on a case-by-case basis because no two cases are exactly the same, the point must be made that the Oireachtas, which represents the people, is entitled to send a very strong message to the Judiciary that it considers these offences to be of the most serious type and wishes corresponding punishments to be imposed on those who disobey the law.

If I am told that it is permissible, I will consider including the words "shall have due regard to" to ensure that the legislation avoids micro-managing judges' activities to too great an extent. A judge will be able to state whether something is an overriding consideration.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"42.—The following section is inserted after section 15 of the Principal Act:"15A.—(1) An appeal may be made to the District Court by a person aggrieved by any of the following decisions made by an issuing person:(a) to refuse to grant a firearms training certificate under section 2A of this Act;(b) to refuse to grant or renew a firearm certificate under section 3 of this Act;(c) to refuse to grant or renew an authorisation for a rifle or pistol club or shooting range under section 4A of this Act;(d) to revoke a firearm certificate under section 5 of this Act;(e) to refuse to register a person, or to renew a registration, in the register of firearms dealers under section 9 of this Act;(f) to grant or renew an authorisation under section 10 of this Act;(g) to remove the name of a person from the register of firearms dealers under section 11 of this Act;(h) to refuse to grant a licence under section 10A of this Act;(i) to refuse to grant an authorisation under section 16(1) of this Act;(j) to refuse to grant a licence for the import of firearms or ammunition or a prohibited weapon under section 17 of this Act or to vary such a licence or conditions named in it;(k) to refuse to renew a firearm certificate under section 9 of the Firearms Act 1964; or(l) to refuse to grant a firearm certificate, or to revoke such a certificate, under section 2 of the Firearms (Firearm Certificate for Non-Residents) Act 2000.(2) An appeal shall be made within 30 days of receipt of notice of the decision concerned.(3) On the appeal the Court may—(a) confirm the decision,(b) adjourn the proceedings and direct the issuing person to reconsider the decision in the light of the appeal proceedings, or(c) allow the appeal.(4) Where the appeal is allowed, the issuing person shall give effect to the Court's decision.(5) The jurisdiction conferred on the District Court by this section shall be exercised by the judge of that Court assigned to the district in which the appellant resides or carries on business.".".This amendment proposes inserting a new section 15A into the Firearms Act 1925. It provides for the first time an appeals mechanism whereby decisions on the granting of licences and authorisations under the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 may be made to the District Court. Under existing law, any person aggrieved by a decision could proceed only by way of judicial review of the decision before the High Court, which has happened on several occasions. The procedure is costly and time-consuming for all parties concerned. It is also inappropriate in most cases for the High Court jurisdiction.In consultation with the various shooting organisations, the lack of a proper appeals procedure was raised and I undertook to review the position. Consequently, I propose to provide a statutory right of appeal to the District Court against the decision of a person issuing firearms under firearms legislation. Decisions that can be appealed include, among other things, refusing to grant a renewal of a firearms certificate or revoking a firearms certificate and the appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision of the issuing person.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I strongly support the new appeals system. I posed a question on some of the matters covered by this amendment, namely, the issue of ranges and so on. I do not know whether the Minister has had time to consider these since I raised them.I also mentioned to the Chairman that because I came late to this debate, I did not have the benefit of being addressed directly by the shooting lobby. That has been rectified in the interim. Several issues were raised by those to whom I spoke who requested me to put them to the Minister, particularly in the context of the regulation of shooting as a sport. This discussion of the appeals mechanism for the refusal of firearms training certificates in the Minister's amendment may be the only opportunity I will have to pose those questions.Did the Minister consider the definition of ranges since I raised the matter at our previous meeting? People are concerned that it is necessary to have a licensed range and the penalty for shooting at an unauthorised range, namely a fine of up to €25,000 and jail for up to seven years, is severe. People legitimately involved in sport shooting want to ensure that they do not inadvertently run foul of this. The Minister said that he would revisit this matter.Under the new section 4A to the principal Act, newcomers to shooting will be able to train only at shooting ranges. If one is not competent, however, one is not permitted to shoot at such a range. This seems to be a catch 22 situation. How does one become competent if one can shoot only at a range and only if one is competent to do so?Provision is made under the new section 4B for the appointment of firearms range inspectors. Such an inspector will be permitted to enter any premises without warrant when he or she suspects that target shooting is taking place. This is regarded as an extraordinarily wide-ranging power to give to any individual who is not obliged to be a member of the Garda Síochána, although the section encompasses gardaí and customs officials. Some would argue that it is a search warrant on the cheap if one wants to enter a premises without a warrant.I hope the Minister will forgive me for using the umbrella of this amendment to raise these points.

It does not state within what timeframe the court must hear the appeal. Perhaps it will be heard at the earliest possible opportunity. If so, it may be necessary to insert a phrase to the effect that "on the appeal the court at the earliest possible opportunity may confirm the decision", or whatever.

For example, people cannot be allowed to carry out target practice next to a public road or a golf course where passers-by might be hit by ricochets, etc. I appreciate that a farmer who wants to keep his eye in with his shotgun can put up a tin can somewhere on his property and shoot at it. However, if someone establishes a place where he regularly fires lethal weapons——

One is not talking about moving into people's homes. One is talking about going on to land. Unless people have turned the inside of their houses into a range, which I think is unlikely, one is talking about going on to another's land. Practicality suggests that if a member of the inspectorate suspects an unauthorised range, he or she should be able to check it out rather than having to go to the District Court and invoke the powers of a judge to do so. One is not talking about a dwelling of a citizen. It is a question of what is reasonable and practicable. If the local sergeant hears shooting in the local quarry in the early hours of the morning, the idea that he or she should raise the District Court judge from his or her slumbers before going down to see if it is being used as a range is tilting the scales too much against practicality.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"43.—Section 17 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (4):"(4A) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (4) of this section, a licence for importing a firearm, ammunition or prohibited weapon may not be granted unless—(a) the applicant has a good reason for importing it,(b) granting the licence would not prejudice public safety or security, and(c) if the application relates to a restricted firearm or restricted ammunition, the applicant(i) if a registered firearms dealer, possesses an authorisation under section 10 of this Act, or(ii) in any other case, is the holder of a restricted firearm certificate in respect of the firearm or ammunition concerned, which is in force.(4B) An applicant for a licence under this section shall supply in writing any further information that the Minister may require in the performance of his or her functions under this section.(4C) The reason for refusing an application for a licence under this section or for its renewal shall be communicated in writing to the applicant.".".Section 17 of the firearms Act provides for restrictions on the import of firearms and ammunition. It provides that no person can import a firearm or ammunition without a licence granted by the Minister. Under the law as it stands a licence to import firearms and ammunition can be granted by the Minister, if he or she thinks fit to do so, to any registered firearms dealer or to any person who holds or could hold a firearms certificate for the firearm and ammunition, if any, in respect of which the licence was sought. There is no specific requirement in law for the Minister when deciding on whether to grant such an importation licence to have regard to such matters as public safety and security or the purpose for which a firearm is to be imported. As a consequence a number of decisions to refuse importation licences have been challenged and are currently before the courts.Amendment No. 120 inserts a number of new subsections into section 17 to address this issue. Specifically the amendment provides that the Minister shall not grant an importation licence unless the applicant has a good reason for importing it, granting the licence would not prejudice public safety or security or if the firearm is a restricted firearm, either the person is a firearms dealer or holds a firearm certificate for the firearm in question. This new provision will eliminate any uncertainty regarding the law governing importation of firearms. This comes down to the perpetual conundrums as to whether the Minister has too broad a discretion, with unstated constraints on the discretion but falls foul of the court based jurisprudence as regards what is or is not a permissible delegation of legislative functions. At present the Minister has virtually a free hand and, whereas I like having a free hand, the problem is that when I would be brought to court and asked how a particular provision is justifiable, or if the Minister has been given too free a hand by the Legislature, I do not want a challenge of that kind to succeed. There are cases pending before the courts and the remarks I have just made are not to be interpreted as conceding that I think there is anything wrong with what I am doing at the moment. I want to be sure there is no such challenge in the future.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"44.—The following section is substituted for section 25 of the Principal Act:"25.—Any person who commits an offence under this Act in respect of which no other punishment is provided is liable in respect of each such offence—(a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.”.”.Amendment No. 121 provides general penalties under the firearms Acts and Deputy O'Keeffe's amendments are effectively stylistic. My amendment substitutes a new section for section 25 of the Firearms Act 1925. Section 25 is a catch-all provision that provides that where no specific fine or penalty is provided for an offence under the Act, then the penalties provided for under section 25 shall apply. The maximum fines under this section are now being increased from £50 to €5,000 on summary conviction and from £100 to €20,000 on conviction on indictment. The maximum prison sentences are being increased from six months to 12 months on summary conviction and from two years to five years on conviction on indictment. The Deputies will note that five years means the offences become arrestable offences and the provisions of the 1984 Criminal Justice Act in relation to detention applies to them.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"45.—The following section is inserted after section 25 of the Principal Act:"25A.—(1) The Minister may by order appoint a specified period during which a person may surrender at any Garda station any of the following weapons:(a) a firearm;(b) a flick-knife;(c) a weapon of offence.(2) When surrendering a weapon during the specified period, the person—(a) shall give his or her name and address to a member of the Garda Síochána at the Garda Síochána station concerned, and(b} shall be informed by the member that the weapon and any thing in which it was surrendered may be forensically examined or tested.(3) Proceedings for an offence shall not be instituted against any person who surrenders a weapon under this section if—(a) in the case of a firearm, the offence consists only in the possession, carrying and use (other than in the commission of another offence) of the firearm without being the holder of a firearm certificate, in contravention of section 2 of this Act, or(b) in the case of a flick-knife or other weapon of offence, the offence is an offence under section 9(4) or 10(1)(b) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990.(4) Any surrendered weapon or any substance or thing found on or in it or on or in any thing in which it was surrendered may be subjected to forensic examination or testing for the purpose of—(a) determining whether any such weapon, substance or thing is in a safe and stable condition, or(b) discovering information concerning an offence other than an offence referred to in subsection (3) of this section.(5) In any proceedings, a surrendered weapon and any substance or thing referred to in subsection (4) of this section is admissible in evidence.(6) A surrendered weapon may be disposed of in a manner deemed appropriate by the Commissioner.(7) In this section—"firearm" includes ammunition;"flick-knife" has the meaning given to it in section 9(9) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990;"weapon of offence" has the meaning given to it in section 10(2) of the said Act of 1990.".".This amendment inserts a new section 25A to the principal Act, which provides a legal basis for the introduction of an amnesty during which persons holding illegal firearms may surrender them to the Garda Síochána before new fines and penalties and mandatory minimum sentences which I am also proposing are introduced. During the amnesty period, persons who surrender firearms will not be prosecuted for the simple illegal possession of the weapons. However, surrendered weapons will be, where appropriate, forensically tested and where they are found to have been used in a crime the weapon and forensic evidence will be admissible in any proceedings subsequently brought. It does not wipe the slate clean in respect of any offence that has been committed with the weapon.Subsection (1) of the new section provides that the Minister can, by order, declare a period during which guns and other offensive weapons can be handed in at Garda stations. It provides that firearms and offensive weapons may be handed into any Garda station. Subsection (2) provides that any person surrendering a weapon during the amnesty period must give his or her name and address to the Garda Síochána and must be informed by the gardaí that the firearm in question may be forensically tested.Subsection (3) provides that no proceedings can be brought against a person for having a firearm without a firearm certificate or being in possession of a flick-knife or other offensive weapon where the act constituting the offence is part of the process of surrender. Subsection (4) provides that the firearms and offensive weapons surrendered may be forensically tested. Subsection (5) provides that where firearms or offensive weapons have been used in the commission of an offence, the firearm or weapon and the forensic evidence gathered may be used in evidence in subsequent proceedings.Deputy O'Keeffe is proposing 17 amendments to the amendment. Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 to 13, inclusive, and 15 to 17, inclusive, to the amendment are drafting amendments which are stylistic. Amendment No. 3 to the amendment proposes to insert the words "... where the Minister has laid the proposal for such a period before the Houses of the Oireachtas and gained approval thereof". In this regard, I direct the Deputy's attention to amendment No. 127 in my name which inserts a new section in the Firearms Act which provides for the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It provides for each order and regulation to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling it is passed by either House within 21 days, the order or regulation shall be annulled. Consequently, the Deputy's amendment is not strictly necessary.Amendment No. 14 to the amendment proposes an amendment to subsection (4), which subsection provides that any surrendered weapon may be subjected to forensic examination or testing for the purpose of determining whether it is in a safe condition and, more importantly, discovering information on whether it was used in connection with or in the commission of an offence. The Deputy is proposing in addition that it be forensically tested for any purpose deemed necessary or appropriate by a garda not below the rank of superintendent. I am unclear at this stage as to the purpose, other than those already provided for in my amendment, a surrendered weapon might be forensically tested by the Garda. As I have outlined, my amendment allows for the testing of surrendered weapons for the purpose of determining whether they have been used in connection with or in the commission of a crime. Where the weapon has been so used, both it and the forensic evidence gathered may be used in evidence in subsequent proceedings. I am satisfied that my amendment, as it stands, adequately addresses the issue and, subject to what I hear, I think the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary.

In the inserted section 25A(1), to delete "by order" and substitute ", by order,".Most of Deputy O'Keeffe's amendments to the amendment are technical in nature. Amendment No. 6 to the amendment seeks to provide that a member of the Garda Síochána may ask for proof of identity. That is in the context of a person not telling the truth. As I accept what the Minister says on amendment No. 3 to the amendment, I will withdraw it. In regard to forensic testing for any other purpose deemed necessary, Deputy O'Keeffe wanted as much power as possible to be given to the Garda and argues that there should be no restrictions on that power.

I accept this. I have explained to the committee that this is not designed with the expectation that hardened criminals will have a rush of blood to the head and rush down to the local Garda station brandishing their weapons, although if they wanted to do this, I would be very happy. I have no doubt that there are people who have, or know the whereabouts of, weapons, for whom it would be counterproductive to introduce a mandatory minimum sentence in that they might be afraid to reveal information to the Garda for fear of attracting that sentence at a later stage. I want to allow such persons to clear the decks without prejudicing any criminal investigations into prior serious offences.Between now and Report Stage I will consider the question of looking for proof of identity. I do not know exactly what it would amount to because if somebody gives his or her name and address to a member of the Garda——

It could be that a man of straw has been sent in. The question I must ask myself is whether, if a weapon is surrendered and it is tested and found to have been used in a crime, it is better that it is in the possession of the Garda Síochána than that a garda should say he or she cannot take the weapon because he or she is not satisfied as to the veracity of the name and address of the person surrendering it. That is a question I will have to examine between now and Report Stage.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I have a brief technical question. I accept this is a useful but not hugely significant measure which may result in a few knives being handed in. I do not expect the weaponry used in serious crimes around this city to be surrendered. On the definition of "weapon of offence" in section (10)(2) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, is it broad enough to capture everything that might have become a weapon of offence since? I presume it is a catch-all phrase.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Like Deputy Howlin and others, I do not know what the major benefits of this will be or how much weaponry will be surrendered. Most of the weapons this will capture will be surrendered to the Garda in any case. It might manage to attract some dangerous weaponry which would be lethal if it fell into the wrong hands or could be used in the commission of a crime. Although this measure provides for a specific period of one month or six months which will be sold as a type of amnesty, we will need to encourage people thereafter, if they come across such weaponry, to continue to surrender it to the Garda. I know of cases where builders renovating houses have come across weapons and left them where they had found them because touching or moving them would have left them open to the possibility of being charged with the offence of being in possession of a weapon. People should telephone the Garda station in advance to inform the Garda that they intend going there to surrender a weapon. This will ensure they will not be charged with an offence under Operation Anvil and end up serving a sentence if, by chance, they are stopped by a garda while on the way to the station. Where the Garda is not satisfied as to the identity of the person surrendering a weapon, the greater good should be taken into account and the weapon taken out of circulation.As a society, we need to examine how we can take out of circulation the weaponry in the hands of criminal gangs. I understand this is not an open amnesty, but we need to incentivise people to surrender weapons to ensure they are taken out of circulation without prejudicing investigations, society or those who have access to weapons. Criminal gangs have access to a huge amount of weaponry and are continuing to build up their arsenals. This can be attested to by the weaponry used by them in recent months, for example, small machine pistols, and the fact that they are being selective in the weapons they are bringing into the country. Such weapons have had a devastating effect — a number of people have been killed in Dublin in the past year. I agree the legislation should contain a clause that would allow for forensic examination of weapons, but people are aware they could be liable to prosecution if it is shown the weapon they are surrendering has been used before.I am aware of cases involving young teenagers who found weaponry dumped by criminal gangs and who, rather than handing them over to the Garda Síochána, kept them believing they were involved in a big adventure or big men. While they would not have been responsible for the crimes in which those weapons had been previously used, if they had handed them up, they could have been held liable if they were not able to account for where, when and how they had come across them.As a society, we will need at some stage to look at the broader issue of a gun amnesty in terms of whether the greater good would be served if all weaponry was handed up and clause 4 were suspended. I am not suggesting that is what I wish to happen. However, it is an issue we need to debate. During such a debate we could look at how effective gun amnesties have been in other countries. The gun amnesty in Dunblane in Scotland, while effective in terms of the number of knives and old shotguns handed up, did not manage to attract anything substantial in the way of other weaponry. While it had an effect in that weapons were no longer left lying around in small farmhouses or attics, it did not have the effect many believed it would have.

Air guns are guns in which air is compressed by a spring behind the projectile. A definition is being inserted to provide that there must be at least one joule of pressure — I am not too sure what this means — behind the projectile at the muzzle. Theoretically, paintball guns are pellet guns, as are potato pellet guns. One has to distinguish between weapons which can cause significant damage and those which cannot. I do not know if Chairman played with potato pellet guns in his youth, I did.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"46.—The following section is inserted in the Principal Act after section 25A:"25B.—(1) The Commissioner may by notice in writing require any person lawfully possessing a firearm to produce it at such time and place as may be specified in the notice for the purpose of having ballistic or other tests carried out on it and of establishing and recording its distinctive characteristics.(2) A person who, without reasonable excuse, does not comply with such a notice is guilty of an offence under this Act.".".This amendment allows a new section 25B to be inserted in the Firearms Act 1925. The new section will allow the Commissioner to require any person in possession of a legally held firearm to produce it for the purpose of ballistic testing. The intention is to aid the Garda in tracing firearms used in crime. For example, if a .38 revolver is used in committing a crime, it could be of assistance to the Garda to say that in a particular area all persons who own such a weapon are required to produce them in order that the Garda can eliminate them from its search. The new section provides that a person who fails, without a reasonable excuse, to comply will be guilty of an offence.

The new section provides that the Commissioner may delegate any of his functions to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent. This is a standard provision. The purpose of the new section is to ensure the Commissioner will not be required to spend his time working out where he stands on every restricted firearms issue.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"48.—The following section is inserted in the Principal Act after section 25C:"25D.—(1) Where—(a) an offence under this Act is committed by a body corporate, and(b) it is proved to have been committed with the consent, connivance or approval of, or to have been attributable to any neglect on the part of, a person who—(i) was a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate, or(ii) was a person purporting to act in any such capacity, that person, as well as the body corporate, is guilty of an offence and liable to be proceeded against and punished as if the person were guilty of the first-mentioned offence.(2) Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its members, subsection (1) of this section applies in relation to the acts and defaults of a member in connection with the member's functions of management as if the member were a director or manager of the body corporate.(3) The foregoing provisions apply, with the necessary modifications, where the offence was committed by an unincorporated body.".".The amendment proposes to insert a new section 25D in the 1925 Act. It is a standard provision governing liability of officers of bodies corporate under the Act such as the owners of shooting ranges, officers of shooting clubs and registered firearms dealers which happen to be a limited liability company.

In the inserted section 25D(1), to delete "is guilty" and substitute "shall be guilty".I accept the Minister's assurance that the amendment introduces a standard provision. Having recently received the Law Reform Commission's report on corporate killing, I understood we were opening up a completely new area as regards corporate responsibility. I was about to suggest, therefore, that if this were the case, we would have to widen the whole debate into the area of corporate responsibility for various offences. What offences are covered?

If a company which owns a range commits an offence, for example, in allowing under age children to use it without training certificates, the new section provides that if it is proven that this offence was done with the consent, connivance or approval of an individual person who has a management role in the company, or through his or her neglect, this person, as well as the company, will be liable to be convicted. It cannot, therefore, be argued that one can only prosecute a company.

Does this mean that in the event of a breach of paperwork in the registration of a range where the members make up the management committee, every member of the range is guilty of an offence?

I refer to a low level club of 15 members who do not have the resources to pay a full-time manager. They may commit a technical breach of the law by allowing someone to shoot who should not be allowed or doing the paperwork inadequately and failing to register. Even though all the members of the club were not present when the person concerned was allowed to shoot, they are all guilty of a criminal offence and subject to seven years in jail.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"49.—The following section is substituted for section 27 of the Principal Act:"27.—(1) The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed or to be the subject of regulations or for the purpose of enabling any of its provisions to have full effect.(2) The regulations may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary for the purposes of the regulations.(3) Regulations prescribing fees shall be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance.".".This amendment substitutes a new section for section 27 of the Firearms Act 1925. It is a standard provision in modern form giving a general regulatory power. The old statutes tended to be somewhat broad in the discretion provided for Ministers. This section provides a modern regulation-making power for the Minister. It also provides that where fees are involved, the approval of the Minister for Finance must be sought.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	177	In my all too short period in the Executive, I noted that civil servants favoured inserting a clause to the effect that the Minister could do anything else he or she had not yet thought of doing by statute law. The section states, "The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed or to be the subject of regulations or for the purpose of enabling any of its provisions to have full effect." This allows the Minister to do anything and everything. Am I interpreting this incorrectly?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	178	It is not as broad as the Deputy might think. It relates to what is prescribed, to be prescribed or the subject of regulations. The section does not permit me to decide a particular provision shall not have effect in certain circumstances. The power is narrow. The section seeks to give effect to the Legislature's intention. It will be narrowly construed as giving the Minister power to make a regulation for the purpose of enabling any of its provisions to have full effect, in addition to the other cases for the making of regulations prescribed or to be prescribed or to be the subject of regulations. It does not apply to anything the Minister thinks up. It allows actions the Minister may wish to take for the purpose of ensuring the Legislature's intentions are met. It is an enabling provision, rather than allowing the Minister to disapply the Bill in any way.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	179	It is part of a general tendency to leave matters to regulations which are generally never seen, even though they are supposed to be laid before the Dáil. They may appear on the back page of the Order Page among 100 other matters. In some ways it is a back door to legislation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I sympathise with the Deputy's point. In theory, one could set up a committee of the House to meet once per week and examine every regulation made. There would be no volunteers rushing in to sit on the committee and the press would not cover a single sitting.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	181	When I first came here as a Member of the Seanad, there was a committee on secondary legislation.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	183	We do the same now regarding the large volume of legislation coming to us in the form of regulations from the European Union, although the Minister may not be aware of it. There is a sub-committee that sifts it and decides what is standard, what is important and what should be scrutinised, afterwards parcelling it out to the working committees of the Houses in order that they can examine it in detail.It is always easier to be totally opposed to secondary legislation when sitting on this side of the House and to be persuaded of its effectiveness and efficiency when on the other. We have not yet reached the next amendment, but there are two ways secondary legislation can be brought into effect by regulation, the first being to require positive affirmation and the other to allow something to enter into force unless one annuls it. The lesser category is the one applied. Civil servants love it since it needs someone to spot the issue. On the other hand, if one requires positive affirmation, one must explain the issue. I make these general points.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The Deputy's summation of attitudes on the two sides of the House is probably correct. However, I make this additional point. I have been surprised since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at how few regulations I make. Among those I have made, I have spent more time on rules of court than anything else. I am struck by the fact that in a Department with 23,000 people under its broad umbrella, one spends half one's life making regulations.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	185	It is simply the environment; there are much more active jobs.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Yes. There is an extensive body of jurisprudence. This is not an exact statement, but the general drift of what the courts upheld was that the power to delegate legislation must be within explicit or implicit parameters set by the legislation. Regarding non-Executive powers, one cannot generally delegate very broad discretion that turns the Minister into a mini-Legislature. Otherwise, someone looking at the Act under which he or she functions would not have any idea what would be decided or any clue as to the general policy being followed.The interesting aspect is that, as I understand it, the rubric of laying a regulation either before the Houses for their approval in advance or for their negative clearance is not constitutionally necessary. In other words, it is perfectly permissible for this House to enable Ministers to make regulations that need not be tabled for the Houses' approval, either by negative clearance or positive approval. That is a strange aspect. However, as I recollect from my time as Attorney General, the jurisprudence seemed to state that in certain cases, once the delegated power to make regulations is granted, bringing back the proposed legislation to the House is not a necessary constitutional arrangement.

Therefore, one must be very careful when it comes to secondary legislation. However, the truth is that most European societies could not function if the Legislature did not delegate functions.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"50.—The following section is inserted after section 27 of the Principal Act:"27A.—An order or regulation under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling it is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after it has been laid before it, the order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under it.".".
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	196	We have had the discussion, but perhaps I might ask why the predisposition is always to take the easier route when one is making regulations, particularly now that we have a committee shadowing each Department. There should be a bias towards requiring positive affirmation of regulations in order that someone would have to come in and explain them rather than throw them into the Oireachtas Library in the hope no one will notice and that they will become law by default.

However, let us also consider the other side. Oireachtas time is so precious that if I had to get positive clearance for a large number of regulations——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I hope I can say this without offending the Minister, since I genuinely mean it. From my several years' experience as spokesman on justice matters in the last Dáil, it seems there is a tendency, particularly in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to view this place as a rubber stamp, circulating amendments late. As it does not apply only to the current incumbent, I can only assume it is a departmental rather than a ministerial issue.Through the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, we are in the process of recruiting additional research staff to the Houses and support staff to the committees. It will take time and will probably be the next Dáil before it is done. On the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, all secondary legislation is sent to a consultant who is employed by the committee. That person does the sifting and produces a very short report for committee members stating what is worth considering. One could do a good job of work that would ensure robust secondary legislation rather than, as often happens now, very narrow primary legislation. I am not making that case in this instance.

They are of much more substance and would have generated much more debate than the primary legislation. I make that as a general point.

One of the biggest complaints in the referendum was that there was a lack of scrutiny of what was coming from the European Union. As a consequence, changes were made. There is now the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, on which I served for a time. Notice is given, the issues are sifted and those issues that merit further consideration are isolated. I hope that in time something similar might apply generally, or that at least notice of regulations might be given to the relevant committee in order that they might be sifted. I agree with the Minister that there is real pressure on everyone's time and hope important issues will be identified for consideration by committees. I would certainly like to see that change made.

I spend half my life looking at files to send scrutiny notes to the Oireachtas in respect of European developments. In fact, I spend a great deal more time on that work than making regulations under any Act. I am happy to do so because I believe strongly that member state parliaments should not act as mere rubber stamps in respect of European activities. There is a strong dynamic behind European legislation compared to domestic secondary legislation. I make relatively few statutory instruments compared to other Ministers. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, for example, must necessarily spend half his time tweaking regulations.

The amendment also changes the name of the "Minister" to the "Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform".

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"52.—The following section is substituted for section 9 of the Firearms Act of 1964:"9.—(1) The Commissioner may from time to time renew a firearm certificate granted by him or her.(2) The superintendent of the district where the holder of such a certificate resides may from time to time renew such a certificate.(3) The superintendent of a district where the holder of a firearm certificate resides may from time to time renew a firearm certificate which has been granted by a superintendent.(4) An inspector or sergeant of the Garda Síochána in the district where the holder of a firearm certificate issued by a superintendent resides may from time to time renew the certificate.(5) A superintendent, or other member of the Garda Síochána, who is authorised under this section to renew a firearm certificate ("an authorised member") may refuse to renew it, or vary any conditions to which it is subject under section 4(2)(g) of the Principal Act, only if prior sanction to do so in the particular case has been given by the Commissioner or superintendent, as the case may be.(6) An application for renewal of a firearm certificate——(a) shall be in the prescribed form,(b) shall be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any), and(c) may be made within one month before the expiration of the certificate.(7) A renewal of a firearm certificate shall be in the prescribed form.(8) Before renewing a firearm certificate, an authorised member shall be of opinion that the conditions to which it is subject have been complied with and will continue to be complied with during the period for which the certificate is renewed.(9) On the renewal of a firearm certificate, an authorised member may, subject to subsection (6) of this section, vary any conditions to which the certificate is subject under section 4(2)(g)of the Principal Act, if of opinion that such a variation is necessary in the interests of public safety or security.”.”.This amendment seeks to substitute a new section for section 9 of the Firearms Act 1964 which provides for the renewal of firearm certificates. Under the law as it stands, superintendents are the only persons who may grant such certificates. As earlier amendments provided for the granting of firearm certificates by the Commissioner or, for restricted firearms, a designated person, it has been necessary to make substantial amendments to the provisions relating to the renewal of firearm certificates. Rather than stick in a series of referential amendments, it is suggested the entire section should be restated in an amended form.

I do not know how he or she would put it. I have never noted any incapacity on the part of the Garda to think up circumlocutory language which would convey a message to the average person. It should be noted that there will be an appeals procedure and that it will not be necessary for applicants to go to the High Court where they feel reasons for refusal are unclear. An applicant will be able to attend the District Court where it will be open to the judge to say if the person concerned is bonkers.

While I intended initially to ask for the power to renew to be restricted to superintendents, the number of firearms involved indicates that it may be more practical to empower officers at inspector grade. Renewal of a certificate should not be granted by an officer below that rank.My other amendment is more technical and addresses section 8 which refers, in the context of renewal of a firearm certificate, to "the authorised member" rather than "an authorised member", which I recommend. It is specific to the person renewing the licence.

Do we want to require an experienced sergeant or long-standing garda in his 40s or 50s who is dealing with a firearm certificate renewal application to have to send a file to a superintendent or inspector? Where an ordinary farmer who is 100% decent is making an application to renew a firearm certificate, should we create a mound of paperwork and require two separate decisions, with consequent delays? One of my ambitions is to create circumstances in which the renewals system could be outsourced, subject to very tight Garda supervision. In rural areas a substantial amount of paperwork would be generated if we were to provide for a two-layer decision process. A file would be required for each firearm and each renewal application and it would have to be passed from a local Garda sergeant to the district inspector and back again. I would like to avoid all that paperwork if I can as it would consume a great deal of time. If one divides the 210,000 applications by——

Section 13, as it stands, provides for the sale of firearms by auctioneers. However, in so far as restricted firearms are concerned, provision is being made that auctioneers can only deal in such firearms if they have obtained specific authorisation under section 10 of the 1925 Act.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"62.—Section 4 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 is amended in subsection (1)—(a) by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraph (b):"(b) an air gun (including an air rifle and air pistol) with a muzzle energy greater than one joule and any other weapon incorporating a barrel from which any projectile can be discharged with such a muzzle energy;”,(b) in paragraph (g)—(i) by the deletion of "for the purposes of this definition" and the insertion of "without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing",(ii) by the deletion of "(e).” in subparagraph (ii) and the insertion of “(e),and”, and(iii) the insertion of the following subparagraph:"(iii) any object—(I) manufactured for use as a component in connection with the operation of a firearm, and(II) without which it could not function as originally designed;"and(c) by the insertion after paragraph (g) of the following paragraph:"(h) a device which enables a firearm to be used as a starting gun or blank firing gun.”.”.We have already discussed this amendment somewhat. It is a technical amendment to provide for the extension of the definition of a component part of a firearm contained in section 4 (1)(g) to include any part manufactured for use as a component in any of the loading, cocking, discharging, ejection or emission mechanisms of a firearm. It also provides that only air guns with a muzzle velocity of one joule are to be treated as firearms for the purposes of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 — potato guns, paintball guns and the like are not in the frame. It also extends the definition of a firearm to include starting guns and blank firing guns, the latter being relevant in that there is an argument as to whether they are imitation firearms. It covers the issue of whether a starting piston is an imitation firearm. It is probably not in one view.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"63.—The following section is inserted after section 8 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990:"8A.—Each provision of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 specified in Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice Act 2006 is amended in the manner specified in the third and fourth columns opposite the mention of that provision in the first column of that Schedule.”.”.This is a provision to amend the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 in the manner specified in the Schedule to this Bill. For completeness I will go through the penalties. Penalties for breaches of the register for firearms are being increased from £50 to €3,000 and from £25 to €1,500. The following penalties are also being increased: failure to comply with one's obligations in terms of the inspection of a stock of firearms, from £10 to €1,000 or six months; imprisonment, or both; impeding the search for a seizure of firearms, from £20 to €1,000 or six months' imprisonment, or both; impeding the powers of members of the Garda Síochána, from £10 to €1,000; possession or sale of silencers, from €1,000 and five years' imprisonment to €5,000 and seven years' imprisonment; reckless discharge of firearms, from €1,000 and five years' imprisonment to €5,000 and seven years' imprisonment on indictment; possession of knives, from £1,000 to €5,000 in both cases; trespass with a knife, from £1,000 to €5,000; production of an article capable of inflicting serious injury, from £1,000 to €5,000; prohibition of the manufacture of offensive weapons, from €1,000 and five years' imprisonment to €5,000 and seven years' imprisonment. The penalty under the Firearms (Firearm Certificates for Non-Residents) Act 2000 in terms of prohibition of false information and alteration of firearms certificates is being increased from £1,000 to €2,500 on indictment and from £10,000 to €20,000. These are in line with the general increases in penalties provided for in other statutes.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"PART 6AMENDMENT OF EXPLOSIVES ACT 187567.—The following section is substituted for section 80 of the Explosives Act 1875:"80.—(1) Any person who in any place—(a) ignites a firework or causes it to be ignited, or(b) throws, directs or propels an ignited firework at or towards a person or property,is guilty of an offence.(2) Any person—(a) who possesses a firework with intent to sell or otherwise to supply it to another, and(b) who does not hold a licence under this Act to import it,is guilty of an offence.(3) In any proceedings for an offence under subsection (2) it is not necessary for the prosecution to negative by evidence the existence of a licence to import the firework concerned, and accordingly the onus of proving the existence of any such licence is on the defendant.(4) A member of the Garda Síochána who, with reasonable cause, suspects that a person possesses a firework in contravention of subsection (2) may—(a) request that the person give his or her name and address and that the information given by the person in response to the request be verified,(b) if not satisfied that the information so given is correct, request that the person accompany the member to a Garda Síochána station for the purpose of verifying the information,(c) without warrant—(i) search the person and, if the member considers it necessary for that purpose, detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary to make the search,(ii) enter and search any vehicle, vessel or aircraft in which the member suspects that a firework may be found, and(iii) seize and detain anything found in the course of the search which the member reasonably believes to be evidence of, or relating to, an offence under this section.(5) This section is without prejudice to any power to detain or search a person or to seize or detain property which may be exercised by a member of the Garda Síochána under any other enactment.(6) A member of the Garda Síochána who suspects, with reasonable cause, that a person has committed an offence under this section may arrest the person without warrant.(7) If a judge of the District Court is satisfied by information on oath of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence under this section is to be found in any place, the judge may issue a warrant for the search of that place and any persons found at that place.(8) The search warrant shall be expressed, and shall operate, to authorise a named member of the Garda Síochána, accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána or other persons as the member thinks necessary—(a) to enter the place named in the warrant at any time or times within one week of the date of issue of the warrant, on production if so requested of the warrant and if necessary by the use of reasonable force,(b) to search it and any persons found at the place, and(c) to seize anything found at the place, or anything found in the possession of any person present there at the time of the search that that member reasonably believes to be evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence under this section.(9) A member of the Garda Síochána acting under the authority of a search warrant under this section may—(a) require any person present at the place where the search is being carried out to give to the member his or her name and address, and(b) arrest without warrant any person who—(i) obstructs or attempts to obstruct the member in the carrying out of his or her duties,(ii) fails to comply with a requirement under paragraph (a), or(iii) gives a name or address which the member has reasonable cause for believing is false or misleading.(10) A person who—(a) does not give his or her name and address when requested to do so under subsection (4)(a) of this section or gives a name and address that is false or misleading, or(b) does not comply with a request under subsection (4)(b) of this section,is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.(11) A person who—(a) obstructs or attempts to obstruct a member of the Garda Síochána acting under the authority of a search warrant under this section,(b) does not comply with a requirement under subsection (9)(a) of this section, or(c) gives a false or misleading name or address to such a memberis guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both.(12) A person guilty of an offence under this section (except subsection (10) or (11)) is liable—(a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.(13) A court by which a person is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) or (2) may order anything shown to the satisfaction of the court to relate to the offence to be forfeited and either destroyed or dealt with in such other manner as the court thinks fit.(14) In this section—"banger" means a non-metallic case containing black powder, the principal purpose of which is to make a noise when ignited or initiated;"black powder" means a powder consisting of a mixture of charcoal and sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate, with or without sulphur;"firework"—(a) means a device containing pyrotechnic material which, when functioning, burns or explodes to produce a visual or aural effect or movement or a gas, either separately or in any combination, as a direct form of entertainment, but(b) does not include—(i) a low hazard firework (except a banger), or(ii) a firework imported under licence in accordance with section 40(9) of this Act;"low hazard firework" means a firework which presents a low hazard and is designed for indoor use;"place" includes a dwelling and a vehicle, ship or aircraft;"pyrotechnic material" means a substance or mixture of substances designed, when ignited, to produce an aural or visual effect or a gas either separately or in any combination.".".This amendment substitutes a new section for section 80 of the Explosives Act 1875 and deals with fireworks. The area of fireworks is slightly fraught because everyone has his or her own theory in this regard. It is similar to the price of drink; people have strong views, one way or another, on the subject. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform took the courageous and manly step of finding out what the public thought by way of an opinion survey. In general terms, the result should come as no surprise. Other than party poppers and very light fireworks, people are not in favour of them being used other than as part of a fireworks display. They do not like bangers being thrown around at Hallowe'en. A sizeable majority was opposed to the legalisation of bangers. A range of issues is involved, including: people afraid of their dogs being affected; a general quality of life issue; elderly people being scared by them; and children being injured by them.Although strong views were expressed in correspondence to me to the effect that the State has no business taking this kind of action, that in the UK fireworks are a major aspect of their celebration of Guy Fawkes night and that, in Ireland, the position is much the same as regards Hallowe'en, curiously the great majority of people are conservative and want the law to remain roughly as it stands. They also want it to be accommodated in the European Union's regulations and directives in respect of the classification of fireworks and they want decent penalties imposed in respect of those who are caught. While, theoretically, gardaí are meant to stop bangers and rockets being sold on the streets, the penalties are so desultory that it would cost more to issue the District Court summons than could be recovered by way of fines. To some extent, the law has become marooned by the passage of 120 years since this matter was last considered.The new section makes it an offence to ignite a firework, to cause it to be ignited in any place, or to throw, direct or propel an ignited firework at or towards a person or property. For the first time it makes it an offence to possess a firework with the intent to sell or supply it to another without being licensed to do so under the 1875 Act. The experience most of us had — those of us who were schoolboys in Dublin at any rate — of going to the fruit sellers and of materials being produced from the pockets of aprons, etc., will be a thing of the past. Such activities will be illegal from now on.The new section 80(7) and (8) will give the Garda the right to search premises and seek illegally held fireworks, which are those held other than under a licence. Penalties will be increased, with a fine of €2,500 or six months' imprisonment, or both, or on conviction of indictment a fine of €10,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both. At present, container loads of fireworks can be moved with only desultory penalties applying.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe tabled 26 amendments to my amendment. Amendments Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, and 12 to 25, inclusive, to my amendment are drafting in nature. His amendment No. 11 to my amendment proposes an amendment to the new section 80(8), which governs search warrants by the District Court. The new section 80(7) provides that a judge of the District Court may provide a search warrant on the oath of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant. The new section 80(8) provides that a warrant granted under section 80(7) shall authorise a member of the Garda Síochána:(a) to enter the place named in the warrant at any time or times within one week of the date of issue of the warrant, on production if so requested of the warrant and if necessary by the use of reasonable force,(b) to search it and any persons found at the place, and(c) to seize anything found at the place, or anything found in the possession of any person present there at the time of the search that that member reasonably believes to be evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence under this section.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment to my amendment would provide that warrants issued under this new section should be provided in accordance with section 5 of the Bill, which provides for search warrants in cases of arrestable offences. Where offences are created by statute, it has become the practice to provide for a power of search in respect of the offence in the relevant statute. In addition, section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, which is amended by section 5 of the Bill, provides for the issuing by a judge of the District Court of a warrant authorising a garda to search a place for evidence of the commission of certain serious offences that are indictable offences involving death or serious bodily injury to a person, false imprisonment, rape and certain other sexual offences. Provisions allowing for search warrants to be issued by members of the Garda Síochána are also contained in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.Section 5 extends the offences covered by section 10 to include all arrestable offences under section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1997. When dealing with that provision we engaged in a lengthy discussion about superintendents issuing warrants. I have undertaken to reconsider elements of that provision. I will also reconsider this section to ensure that it is compatible with the provision.We are inserting a new section into the 1875 Act. Whereas Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment to my amendment would apply a different provision, I wanted to ensure that someone consulting the new section would find the warrant provision rather then being obliged to engage in the complex process of rooting around in a different Act in order to find it. I accept the Deputy's general proposition that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and that a similar warrant-giving power should be provided.Amendment No. 26 to my amendment provides for a new definition of "place". We have agreed that we will reconsider that issue in a broader context and that will also apply to this section.

I ask the Minister to consider the two amendments he highlighted to determine whether they would improve the Bill. As we can return to them on Report Stage, I will not press them now.It is time some sense was brought to bear in respect of the overall issue of fireworks. The law, which dates from 1875, is in total disrepute. It has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance and contains totally derisory penalties. It is appropriate that we should come to a decision on what to do regarding fireworks generally. I take the point that most of the complaints I receive at Hallowe'en come from those who are badly disrupted in their everyday lives by the activities of those dealing with fireworks. Some of the fireworks available seem to be of a poor standard, which is inevitable when they are either sold under the table in Moore Street or brought across the Border.I understand that European regulations make provision in respect of three categories. Generally, my feeling is that we have to have a law that is workable and acceptable, and it is mostly acceptable to people that in general fireworks should not be generally available and, when they are, they should be under control. The one area in which I feel that there is a case for relaxation on fireworks is when a community group is genuinely trying to put on a display for a local community, which is carefully organised and in which all due precautions have been taken. I would like to be assured that such groups can get the necessary approvals.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I am anxious, as this is an area about which the law has not been clear. We were conditioned by events in the North of the island in the 1970s to see an explosive as a dangerous thing to have around the place, with very good reason. That conditioned us to be very restrictive in how fireworks were used. I come from a county where, at the traditional opening of our annual opera festival, there is a significant fireworks display, conducted by one of the most respected firework operators in the country, Mr. Casey Whelan. He will not mind me mentioning his name; he operates a company across the land. For the 50th anniversary, he worked in conjunction with Group F, the firework company that conducted the fireworks display at the millennium in Paris, around the Eiffel Tower.There are a number of events that people like to celebrate with fireworks, and when I look out from my window on New Year's Eve and on a variety of other occasions, I can see fireworks being launched from people's back yards. There should be an ability for communities to organise such events. In Britain, Guy Fawkes night is characterised by numerous injuries, especially to children, because there is an irresponsible abundance of fireworks and people mix alcohol and let off fireworks at street parties, which can be very dangerous.I would like the Minister to go through the section. As I see it, it is an offence for someone to let off a firework that is encompassed by this section unless it is licensed. The exclusion is of "a firework imported under licence in accordance with section 40(9) of this Act". I presume that is a reference to section 40(9) of the 1875 Act, which I presume did not deal with importation into Ireland, as we were part of the United Kingdom.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Yes. It is the exclusion clause, which says that one is not guilty of an offence if, under subsection 14(b)(i) it is a “low hazard firework” or, under subsection 14(b)(ii), it is “a firework imported under licence in accordance with section 40(9) of this Act”. What conditions are laid down in the 1875 Act under section 40? The Minister said that he was anxious that a responsible community person would be facilitated by the Garda to do that.On storage, there used to be a requirement that fireworks were stored either in a military barracks or in a Garda barracks. Is that still the situation with storage? What is the situation with the transport of fireworks? How is the community person to get hold of them?

I am in favour of the section, but if no shops sell fireworks, someone will have to buy them illegally and then go to the Garda station to get a licence to ignite illegal fireworks.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	340	As I understand the situation, subsection (1) of the new section makes it an offence to ignite a firework or to cause it to be ignited or to throw or direct it towards any person or property. Subsection (14)(a) defines “firework”, but it excludes low hazard fireworks, except for bangers, or “a firework imported under licence in accordance with section 40(9) of this Act”. Therefore, it is not an offence to ignite a firework that is imported under licence.
