#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Given the day it is, the Government has the full support of the Fine Gael Party regarding the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I have said on many previous occasions that we may have differences regarding other issues. However, this is an important day and perhaps the Tánaiste might give the House an update on what is happening.Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach a question regarding people over 70 who are in long-stay public beds and the advice offered by the Attorney General to the Government, which has been in its possession for some six weeks. The Tánaiste is aware that it was the Government's intention to introduce a Bill before Christmas. That will not happen until the new year. The Taoiseach said the regulations governing this issue date from 1976. They do not, however, deal with the persons to whom I refer. The question is whether the legal advice offered by the Attorney General indicated that the taking of payments from the over 70s in long-stay public beds is illegal. Newspapers report that there is a liability of up to €400 million. Perhaps the Tánaiste would clarify the position.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank Deputy Kenny for his good wishes to the Government and all the parties in the effort to find a resolution of the current vacuum in the peace process and for the offer of support from the Fine Gael Party. I very much appreciate that. The Deputy asked for an update. It would be wrong to assume that the only outstanding issue is that of photographic verification. It is also important to acknowledge that the Government supported others in their quest to have photographs published. We have seen many photographs published of dreadful atrocities and many videos used for propaganda purposes. Humiliation works both ways.Regarding people over 70 in long-stay public beds, I have made it clear to Deputy Kenny that a couple of weeks ago I sought the advice of the Attorney General who said it would be legally safer to have primary legislation in this area than to rely on regulations. Legislation is being drafted. I hoped to introduce it in the House before Christmas, but I hope it will be with the Government either next week or immediately after Christmas and brought through the House after Christmas. It would be wrong to assume that what happened was the fault of anyone. Any moneys taken were taken in good faith. The Attorney General is simply saying that if we are going to take a contribution towards board and lodgings from people in public institutions then, in order to be safe and secure, we should introduce primary legislation. That is what we intend to do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Tánaiste for her remarks on the issues I raised. Does she mean that the payments taken from those over 70 over the past number of years will be repaid retrospectively if the advice of the Attorney General is that they were taken illegally, through nobody's specific fault? If that is the case, will the primary legislation introduced in the new year make provision for retrospective payments, as did the IFSRA findings regarding the AIB and its customers? Will the patients in question, or their next of kin in some cases, be compensated in respect of payments made under the regulation?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	3	One cannot compare the two situations. Any moneys taken were taken in good faith and the Attorney General has advised that this is not an issue. What he is saying is that in order to be certain as we go forward we need primary legislation. Clearly if such an issue arose between the time we became aware of the difficulties, in other words, from when we got the Attorney General's advice, and the time new legislation is enacted, we would have to deal with that. However, that has not yet arisen. I am awaiting legal advice on that matter, but I hope to be able to publish the proposal very quickly and will make it available to the Opposition as quickly as I can.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I join Deputy Kenny in wishing the Taoiseach well in today's endeavours. I confess that I am a little taken aback by the Tánaiste's remark that it should not be assumed that all that remains at issue is the question of photographic verification of decommissioning. I was under that impression, given that the Taoiseach said at Question Time yesterday that there was one outstanding issue and all the media reports are to the same effect. I am not quite sure that I understand the Tánaiste's remark. However, the Labour Party wishes the Government success in its important endeavours.I want to ask a question regarding the 200,000 people who now face the prospect of increased drugs bills and increased accident and emergency charges on 1 January while still having to pay €40 or more to visit a doctor. This comes about because the changes announced in the budget are to be implemented on 1 January, whereas the yellow-pack medical card, the doctor only medical card, may require primary legislation or other administrative changes which the Government is not yet ready to bring before the House.I draw the attention of the Tánaiste to the drugs refund threshold spiral in recent years. On 1 June 1997, it was €38; on 1 June 2002, it was €53; on 1 December 2004 or from 1 January 2005, it will be €85. That is an increase of €47 per month or 123% since 1997. The accident and emergency charge increased from €15 in 1997 to €31 in June 2002 and will increase to €55 on 1 January 2005. That is an increase of 261% in that period. Of course, the cost of VHI has increased by 100% since 1997 and will rise again by approximately 5% following the increase of 25% in the cost of private beds. All of those increases will go ahead on 1 January next. People will have to pay to visit a doctor because the Tánaiste's legislation will not be before the House. Will the Tánaiste respond on this and state whether, at a minimum, she will postpone the implementation of the charges until such time as the yellow pack cards are legislated for?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Some 1.2 million people do not or will not have to pay any drug charges. The increase is €7 per month, whereas in the United Kingdom the charge is £6.20 sterling per prescription, which is approximately €10. Some 30% of those who visit a doctor never acquire a prescription. Therefore, in making choices for next year, the Government decided to extend the doctor only card to as many low income families as possible, particularly those with children.This does not require primary legislation, only the signing of a statutory instrument, which I intend to do immediately. Obviously, we must advertise and seek applications. It is normal, when one is extending a service on a different basis, that this would take a number of weeks into the following year. It will probably be the end of February or the beginning of March before people begin to receive the doctor only cards.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Given that the Tánaiste now admits that the doctor only card will not be introduced until the end of February or the beginning of March and having regard to the fact that we waited 18 months for the Bill on the restructuring of the health services, it is obvious the Tánaiste should not implement the increases on 1 January. It is well for her to talk about the increase being only €7 and so on, but I detailed the figures. There has been rapid escalation since 1997 in costs associated with visits to accident and emergency units, the drugs refund threshold and VHI. However, the Tánaiste intends that where people on very low incomes do not qualify for a free visit to the doctor, they will also be charged increases on the drugs refund threshold, including in the event of them having to visit accident and emergency. The simple solution is that until such time as the legislation goes through the House, the new increases ought not to be implemented.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I do not accept that. As I stated, the current position is that 1.2 million people, a considerable number, will pay no drugs bill. The doctor only card will be of great benefit to low income families with children who want reassurance from a doctor and want the opportunity to visit a doctor without having to worry about the cost. Charges have increased but the taxpayers' investment in health care has increased by an even greater margin, to over €11 billion next year, which is threefold the amount available seven years ago.

In the UK, one must pay £6.20 sterling, approximately €10, for each prescription.

They are from the 8,000 post office workers who have been left with no choice but to strike for basic justice and workers' rights. How does the Tánaiste justify standing over a situation where workers on very modest incomes have been denied any wage increases whatsoever under Sustaining Progress, the so-called partnership deal?Five weeks ago, on Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach agreed with me that there was an important social element to the An Post service and no more so than in regional towns, villages and remote country areas where the post office is part of the social fabric of life. Despite this, there is a proposal to privatise approximately 100 sub-post offices. The Government outrageously put its hands in the pockets of ordinary post office workers and, even more scandalously, in the pockets of post office pensioners to subsidise and finance this service. Why is the Government prepared to allow this to happen? Why is An Post management, which has no credibility due to the way it has dealt with its workers and broken agreements, given carte blanche to walk all over the rights of post office workers, to break agreements with impunity and treat workers in a way that gives the lie to any concept of so-called partnership?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The workers have not fully exhausted the industrial relations machinery of the State. Some 10,000 staff work in the postal service. In the past, agreements have been made but productivity has not been forthcoming. In the past couple of years, the postal service has lost €90 million. Last year, the volume of mail dropped by approximately 7%. We are moving to a situation in which by 2009, as Deputy Joe Higgins is aware, there will be full liberalisation in this area. The reality is that the company cannot pay if it is not able to do so. All social partnership agreements provide an out for companies that do not have the ability to pay, which is the position in regard to An Post.

That can be contrasted with the following. A handful of rich parasites from the highest paid echelons of business, the medical profession and the legal profession recently bought land in Stillorgan for €31 million. Only four years later, they sold it for an obscene profit of €53 million. Their contribution to society is that working people will slave for 30 years to pay mortgages on the houses that will be built on the land to make this profit, which puts these bastions of the establishment, in my view, on the same level as heroin pushers who we usually regard as anti-social scum.

It is not the case that no investment has been made in the postal service. Some €12.7 million was invested in computerisation just over one year ago. The Government remains committed to a successful postal service but that requires everybody to implement agreements reached and to use whatever industrial relations machinery is available to resolve difficulties of the kind the Deputy mentioned.

This is a long-standing series dating back to 1931.The introduction of competition in the supply of electricity has made the measurement of total output in the sector more complex than before. The latest figures available are from July 2003. The CSO is currently in active discussions with the relevant data providers and hopes to be able to resume publication of monthly figures on electricity generation before the end of 2004. This will include a full monthly series from July 2003 onwards and the figures will be published on the CSO website.

Does he regret this information is no longer available in this form? The information should be available on a station by station output basis not only for economic reasons but for sound environmental reasons. We generate electricity in different ways. We use coal, gas, peat and, in a small but, hopefully, increasing way, we use renewable sources, such as wind. If we are to measure the cost of producing electricity, we need——

I am trying to get the Minister of State's opinion on the fact the statistics have been available on a station by station output basis, but we have no statistics on the environmental impact and cost of electricity generation per station and, with the onset of competition, per company. What measures does the Minister of State intend to put in place to ensure such information is available in the future?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	55	Following the introduction of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Commission for Energy Regulation issued more than 40 electricity generation licences. This has made the measurement of electricity generation more complex but, as I said, it is being resolved. We are trying to establish the total amount going onto the network.As part of its overall strategy to develop greater use of statistics in policy making, the CSO is preparing a report on data needs in the areas of economic and environmental statistics. This follows on similar work it did on social statistics. The CSO report on this project will identify data needs in regard to a wide range of topics, including energy and electricity, and will also examine the potential of administrative data sources to meet some of the information needs. The report should be available from the CSO earlier next year.

Is he aware there is an inexplicable situation in respect of CSO figures in that since July 2003, information on generating station output has not been available? My colleague, Deputy Boyle, quite rightly asked that such information be more detailed, not stopped altogether, given the importance of knowing how we are managing in terms of efficiency, future fuel security and our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. That relates to price as well. Is the Minister of State aware there is approximately 70% efficiency in a number of ESB generating stations?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Is the Minister of State concerned that for some inexplicable reason, the CSO ceased to publish figures on electricity generating station output in July 2003 and that we are now in a vacuum? Policy cannot be properly planned in a vacuum. What is the Minister of State going to do to ensure the figures are not only produced but are diversified so we have an idea of the output of each generating station, including wind and other sources?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Liberalisation and the fact there are 40 electricity generating licences has made this complex. As I said, the ESB is addressing this, so let us see what it produces. I agree we need the maximum amount of information. In the monthly and annual industrial statistics, the CSO compiles other statistics, for example, value of output, turnover and employment on the overall electricity, gas and water sector. The statistics include the monthly index numbers on production and turnover and annual figures on output and costs on industrial production. The CSO is aware of the issues and problems raised by the Deputies which are being dealt with. Let us see what it produces. This has come about because of changes in the electricity market.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I asked a question specifically about the CSO, not the ESB. I asked why the CSO no longer publishes figures for electricity generating station output. The Minister of State replied that the ESB is addressing this matter. Is the CSO going to publish the figures? If it cannot get figures from the ESB for reasons best known to that company, there should be a heading stating "no figures forthcoming". Currently we do not even have such a heading. We have ceased to produce figures on electricity generating station output since July 2003. That seems to be a decision of the CSO. As the Minister of State responsible for the CSO, will it redress that omission?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The CSO is addressing this omission and will publish the figures shortly.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.The latest relevant statistics from the CSO, with a breakdown of visitors by area of residence, relate to the period 1 January to 30 September 2004. Information on visitors from the USA is combined with the numbers from Canada. There were 781,000 overseas visits to Ireland by residents of the USA and Canada in the first nine months of this year compared with a figure of 719,000 in the same period last year. This represents an increase of 8.6%. There were 2.841 million overseas visits to Ireland by residents of Great Britain in the first nine months of 2004 compared with 2.878 million in the same period of 2003. This represents a fall of 1.3% in travel from Great Britain.Overall, there were 5.147 million overseas visits to Ireland between January and September this year. This compares with 5.009 million overseas visits in the first nine months of 2003, an increase of 138,000 or 2.8% in the number of inbound visitors.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The Chair is reluctant to intervene but this is purely a statistical question to the Minister of State. Questions on the tourism industry are for the line Minister, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I realise that. I was just making an observation. In regard to the method of collecting data, surely the Minister of State agrees that the interval between the collection of data and their publication is too long. This information is critical to the tourism industry as it is a barometer for it at a particular time. I am sure the Minister of State will agree the publication of this material takes far too long to enable the industry and the agencies, both Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland, to respond. Will the Minister of State give the House an assurance that he will examine the interval between the collection and publication of such material? Will he also indicate what is the current interval? If I asked the Minister of State about the regional spread of visitors coming here, he would not be able to provide the statistics because there is no regional breakdown on the numbers of people coming into Ireland. There is no way in which we can compare regional performance without those figures. In certain parts of the country people may say they did not see a tourist this year but there is no way to confirm or deny whether that is so. In providing future statistics, will the Minister of State also be able to include regional spread? From the point of view of spatial planning and regionalisation generally, surely it is important for the Government to know where tourists are going. It is obvious that they are staying in Dublin and the eastern region generally but, from the point of view of spatial strategy, it is important to know why tourists are going to certain areas and not others. If certain destinations are doing well, we should have the relevant statistics and the reasons why.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I agree with the Deputy that the more up-to-date information we have the better. I am furnishing the House with figures from 1 January to 30 September 2004. We went through these figures recently in the House and, from memory, the most recent figures became available on the same day. I will convey the Deputy's views to the Central Statistics Office on the need for updated information. On the last occasion, we had an extensive debate on this matter in the House and discussed the issue of regional considerations. I think we covered them quite adequately at the time.Surveys are carried out at the main ports and airports. The CSO is examining the issue of regional focus and is considering looking at regional airports, including Kerry Airport. Following the last debate, I spoke to representatives of the CSO and they are aware of the comments that have been made in the House. They will do their best to follow up on the points that have been raised.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	67	As regards the tourism balance of payments, does the Minister of State have statistics to show what Irish people going out of the country spent, as opposed to what was spent by those coming into the country? In September, for example, Irish people leaving the country spent €97 million more in foreign destinations than tourists coming into the country spent here. Therefore, there is a deficit in the tourism balance of payments, which should surely give rise to concern. I would like the Minister of State to provide statistics for the year to date on outward expenditure versus spending here in Ireland.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I have some of the data here but I will forward to the Deputy any material I do not have to hand. My file contains a table showing the number of overseas visitors to Ireland and their expenditure here. The figures relate to the first nine months of 2002, 2003 and 2004, classified by areas of residence. It contains a breakdown on Great Britain, other Europe, USA and others. The total from January to September 2002 is 4,779,000, while for the same period in 2003 it was 5,009,000.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Is that the expenditure?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Yes, that is the total expenditure by overseas visitors.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	72	My apologies, that is the number of visits. I am reading from the wrong chart. The totals are €2.43 billion, €2.5 billion and €2.55 billion. I will be glad to convey those figures to the Deputy in writing. The information is there, however.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Do the USA figures include the illegal transportation of American troops through Shannon for the criminal war in Iraq? Will the Minister of State tell us what the total would be if these troop numbers were included? If they are not included, will he tell us what is the omitted figure?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	74	My first answer will nullify the other answers. These people are not included.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I do not know. The Deputy will have to direct his question elsewhere. I do not have the answer.

Will the Minister of State seek to include them in the figures in order to give a truer picture of the reality of transport through Shannon?
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	83	It would boost the Minister of State's figures.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I answered this question on the last occasion. They are not included as far as the CSO is concerned.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	85	They do not exist.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	87	What about the prisoners being brought to Guantanamo Bay?

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	89	What sort of detail is compiled on visitors coming into the country? Does it include their reasons for coming here, rather than any other destination? Do visitors believe that this country provides value for money? We should have these statistics. The opinions of tourists leaving the country should be polled so we can design and develop information campaigns targeting visitors. We should know why visitors come to a particular location here. Is it because of the type of advertising that is run abroad? Is that type of information currently being collated and, if not, does the CSO have any plans to collate it?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The categories under which these questions are posed include business, visits to friends or relatives, holidays, leisure and recreation. There is another category for "other reasons". We had a lengthy discussion the last time this matter was raised and the CSO is examining some of the suggestions that were made then.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The Minister of State referred to the amount of money being spent by tourists travelling from the USA and the UK. Can he say whether the figure is more or less than the amount being spent by Irish people abroad? According to one newspaper report, some 16% of disposable income is being spent abroad. In that context, is a balance being struck or are tourists here spending more than Irish people on foreign holidays?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	92	That matter is not included in the two questions under discussion.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Minister of State raised it in terms of money being spent.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	94	That matter is not included as regards this particular question but I recall informing the House on the last occasion that the figures for people travelling abroad have increased dramatically. I will be glad to obtain figures for the Deputy on the numbers travelling abroad. We touched on that matter on the last occasion we debated the issue.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Are Irish people living abroad who return to visit their families or to attend weddings or funerals, as well as students coming to study here, included in the figures provided by the Minister of State?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	96	People omitted from these figures include those going on business trips to London or Brussels, for example, or those travelling to football matches in the UK or other places. People coming here from abroad to visit relatives and so on will be included. I will check the position regarding students and return to the Deputy.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	97	My point is that we are not getting many visitors from the UK. Some 50% or more consist of Irish people coming back to visit.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Deputy is moving onto another issue.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	99	It is an important point.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I wish to ask a version of the question posed earlier by Deputy Deenihan regarding the availability of statistics for visitors to different regions of Ireland. Are there corresponding statistics to indicate from which regions in different countries, such as the US and UK, visitors come? The majority of US citizens do not hold a passport so visitors from that country are obviously concentrated in particular areas. In addition, there are variations in wealth in different regions of the UK. Information in this regard would be helpful in terms of marketing the country abroad and of identifying the type of tourist we attract. Does the CSO collaborate with other statistical organisations in the US and the UK to look for that type of detailed information? Do we correlate our information with that available from these other organisations?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I presume such collaboration is in place but will verify that for Deputy Boyle. It is important that such information be obtained by the CSO. The latter carries out professional work on a daily basis, undertaken in various ports and airports. It is practical to ask a visitor from the US, for example, in which region of that country he or she resides. I will convey the Deputy's suggestions to the CSO and pass on any relevant information to him.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Since 1997, the Government has established two Information Society Commissions, each of which was created to act as an independent advisory body to Government on matters relating to the information society. The current commission was set up in November 2001 and is due to end its term of office on 31 December 2004. A sum of €347,961 has been spent in respect of the Information Society Commission so far this year. The figures for the previous years are as follows: 2003, €600,456; 2002, €514,954; 2001, €305,638; 2000, €635,726; 1999, €661,645; 1998, €647,832; and 1997, €195,122.During its term of office, the commission has published a number of influential reports on a range of topics and conducted a number of policy seminars. As it comes to the end of its remit, I take this opportunity to thank the members for their hard work, commitment and freely-given expertise over the last three years.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Will the Government appoint another commission? If so, when will the appointment take place? Does the Government believe that the work of the commission has represented good value for money? How many reports has the Government received and has it acted on those reports?
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The commission will report to me shortly. We have not made a decision as to what the follow-up to the commission should be. Such a decision would be premature because I wish to hear what the commission members have to say. The commission, which included representatives from the social partners, experts and so on, has done tremendous work on a voluntary basis. I reiterate my previous assertion that my plan for the next two years is to consider new connections, examine the commission report and consider the best approach.Technology is a fast-moving and agile area and there is a number of aspects to consider. One is the need to promote innovation. We have spoken about creating an island of ingenuity and our objective must be to develop a unique competitive advantage for Ireland. We have already shown our excellence as a knowledge society and must continue to create an environment for innovation. Our job in the Department of the Taoiseach is to plan and develop strategy in this area.Another objective is to concentrate on usage rather than just technology. A stronger focus should be given to meaningful use and content. We must also ensure that our policies are inclusive. In this context, I highlight the needs of elderly people whose independence can be preserved through access to technology. In addition, I have had the privilege of working with organisations for persons with disabilities since my appointment, including Enable Ireland and the National Disability Authority. Much good work is ongoing in this regard. Another element of our policy is to encourage community involvement. As Deputy Stanton is aware, the Mo Bhaile project is progressing well. Our aim is to facilitate local authorities in involving communities in e-Government.Another area worthy of examination by the Oireachtas is the issue of e-democracy. The websites of the Scottish and British Parliaments indicate the good work done in those jurisdictions in establishing a connection between public administration and citizens through information technology. We can do much work in this area. Improved access to information is the lifeblood of democracy. This is an issue I will explore in conjunction with the Whips. Enough reports have been produced to allow us to move forward with a good agenda.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The Minister of State says that competitiveness is important. How can he expect a higher usage of broadband services when Ireland has the highest charges in Europe? The Information Society Commission recently published a report, 21st Century Infrastructure, which stated that Ireland was "seriously lagging behind our competitors in Europe in relation to penetration". Broadband penetration is one fifth of the average penetration in other European countries. If penetration were on a par, we would have 300,000 more users. I ask the Minister of State, who has direct responsibility for information technology, what steps his Department is taking to implement the recommendations in the commission's report.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	106	It might be more appropriate for Deputy Allen to address his question to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The Minister of State has direct responsibility in the area of broadband uptake.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The Department of the Taoiseach is responsible for co-ordinating the continued development of the information society, promoting and implementing the Government action plan on new connections and ensuring that information society issues are appropriately prioritised across all Departments. I represent Ireland at European and other international fora in this area. However, the issues raised by Deputy Allen are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, but I say on his behalf that the Government has taken a proactive approach to the roll-out of broadband.As the commission acknowledged in its statement, there have been significant policy developments in regard to broadband, including the completion of the pathfinder phase of the metropolitan area network, MAN, project, a commitment to extending the provision of open access infrastructure to all population centres in excess of 1,500, the development of a group broadband scheme to promote the aggregation of local broadband, and a series of policy directions from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ComReg which focus on the delivery of competitive broadband pricing.We acknowledge there is much work to be done in this area and I will be working closely with the Minister to achieve our objectives. Deputy Allen is correct that the infrastructure must be in place to allow Ireland to continue to move forward as a competitive knowledge economy.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Does the Minister acknowledge that Ireland has lacked direction completely in the area of e-Government? When his predecessor, Minister Hanafin, left her post, many people in the electronic and information technology industries made clear the need for a more dynamic approach across all sectors of Government. This is the challenge facing the Minister of State. Unlike Britain, for example, we have no e-envoy to directly co-ordinate the delivery of electronic services. What programme of action is the Minister of State prepared to take with regard to that important part of his portfolio? I remind the Minister of State that, initially, we were not even sure he was the e-Minister. The Taoiseach, apparently, forgot he had one.Has the Minister of State any views on the open source operating systems in Departments? Many jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere are moving to open source systems but the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, appears to have decided that it is Microsoft or nothing.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I do not accept that we have not seen progress on e-Government. I recently attended the launch of the Irish e-Government awards. The rate at which people are dealing with Government on-line is truly phenomenal. The figures speak for themselves. A total of 157,000 self-employed people, 53%, made returns on-line to the Revenue Commissioners last month. Up to the end of October, more than 370,000 transactions had taken place on the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government motor tax website, involving the payment of more than €81 million. Since its launch in 2000, Revenue on-line services now handle more than 53% of income tax returns on-line. Customers have access to their own Revenue account using the customer information service. On a single day in November, there were more than 40,000 on-line inquiries. Much progress has been made.I will consult colleagues with regard to my ideas for e-democracy in the Oireachtas. I hope to do that over the coming weeks. We have begun the process of e-Cabinet, using technology to take much of the paper out of our own procedures within Government.I will revert to Deputy Broughan on his question on Microsoft and where that matter is at present.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	112	One of the reasons for maintaining and renewing the remit of the Information Society Commission would be to have an independent stand-alone agency to help foster the idea of e-Government. Last week, for example, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government website was down for several days. There are variations between Department as to when they release information, either in printed and electronic form. Yesterday, for example, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government released leaflets but did not put the same leaflets on the Department's website.Not keeping this control within the Government itself would be a good idea. There is a need for an independent stand-alone outside agency to make sure standards are laid down and maintained. As things stand — this is not a reflection on the Minister of State's office — there are significant variations between Departments.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The Deputy makes a valid point. I will not make a final decision on this matter until I have heard from the commission. I will hear its recommendations shortly. The suggestion that we should have an independent forum overseeing the introduction of e-Government is valid.I want to be inclusive in every sense in dealing with this agenda over the coming two years. One of the first things I want to do is work with colleagues in the Oireachtas on how we conduct our business and connect with our public as Members of the Oireachtas.I maintain an open mind as to how we proceed from here. I do not yet have a definitive view on it. Some things obviously need to be done. I think we all agree that the policies in the coming months and years should be inclusive. I mention, in particular, dealing with the elderly and the disabled and trying to ensure that as many people as possible can use technology. Technology should be used for the right reasons and not simply for the sake of using it. We can be practical about this.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Is the Minister going to appoint another commission? What is his intention?The community application of information technology initiative, CAIT, was successful but was not maintained. The commission has recommended that a successor to that initiative be appointed. Has the Government any plans in that area?Would the Government consider putting Internet access into rural post offices? There are rural areas where people find it difficult to get access to the Internet.

I will be doing that in consultation with my colleagues. Much research has been done, information gathered and reports made. It would not be proper to set up another commission just for the sake of doing so.I agree with Deputy Stanton that we must involve rural communities in information technology. I am particularly impressed with the Mo Bhaile project involving local authorities reaching out to their local communities. That is being done on a pilot basis and could be extended.Much good work is being done and I pay tribute to the commission. It would be wrong of me to outline precisely the follow-up to the commission a few days before it reports. I will make an announcement when we are sure of the way forward. This is a fast moving and agile area. We should be flexible in how we proceed.

We already have much information. For example, we know from the mid-term Indecon review that only 69% investment has been made in roads in the BMW region while there has been 134% investment in roads in the south and east regions. We know that 20 million people use Cork and Dublin airports, which are totally congested and access is at an ass and cart pace. On the other hand, this year's projected passenger numbers for Knock Airport are 400,000. Would it not make more sense to give the €40 million which Knock Airport needs to bring it onto a par with Cork and Dublin airports and allow it to be competitive so we can keep our children locally?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	149	It was with sadness that I learned of the death of the former Senator and Deputy John F. Conlan last week. John Francis Conlan was born in Ballybay in May 1928. Both his father, Peter, and his uncle, also called John Francis, played no small part in the struggle for independence. Both were interned in Ballykinlar Camp in County Down for a period, being released at the time of the truce in July 1921. The Conlan family suffered a great deal at that time as the late Deputy's uncle, John Francis, was killed tragically in a shoot-out on the Main Street in Ballybay during the Civil War.John F. Conlan's political roots went back even further than the War of Independence. His family roots were steeped in the political tradition of John Redmond, John Dillon and the Irish Parliamentary Party. He was long associated with the Ancient Order of Hibernians and with the tradition of Dillon.Having completed his education at St. Macartan's College in Monaghan, John F. Conlan went into the family business in Ballybay. In 1950, aged 22, he was elected to Ballybay Town Commissioners and thus began a life of public service which spanned the next 49 years. He was elected to Monaghan County Council in June 1955 and served there until his retirement in June 1999. He was twice Cathaoirleach of the County Council, in 1974-75 and 1997-98, and served as Chairman of Ballybay Town Commissioners for more than 20 years. He was also a member of County Monaghan VEC and the North Eastern Health Board as well as the Border Regional Authority.In 1965 John F. Conlan was elected to Seanad Éireann on the industrial and commercial panel. He was also election agent and Monaghan representative of the late Deputy James Dillon, who represented the constituency of Monaghan at that time. In 1969, along with the late Deputy Billy Fox, he was elected to Dáil Éireann for Monaghan, which by then also included parts of counties Louth and Meath. He was to remain a member of this House until February 1987.He was known in the media as "the quiet man" of Dáil Éireann. However, that image belied a great record of service and a high level of work. He had a prodigious output of constituency correspondence and used the parliamentary question system to the full to represent his constituents. When he spoke in the Houses of the Oireachtas or at the county council, people listened because when he thought it worthwhile to speak on a subject, it had to be important.He was rightly proud of his achievements such as the building of Ballybay College, a vocational school, in 1966 and securing leaving certificate status for it in the 1980s. He was proud also of the advances in road development and housing, and had a particular interest in health and agriculture. He was a Deputy in a Border constituency during a difficult period in our history and he never shied away from his duty as a Member of this House to see to it that the law of the land was respected and upheld in every manner and by every means.John F. Conlan's political philosophy was sound and very straightforward. He saw politics as a means of serving the people. Politics was the living out of the democratic will of the people, in his case the people of Monaghan and Cavan. He was not one for the sound bite or the high political drama. He was a quiet gentleman who represented his people faithfully and well. He was a man of the utmost integrity and honesty. He was not in politics for financial gain. As the monsignor in Ballybay said at his funeral: "John Francis did not make a fortune from politics, he made his riches in the good works he did for other people".As well as a politician, John Francis Conlan was a great community person. He was secretary of the Ballybay Pearse Brothers GAA club in the 1950s and spearheaded the development of Pearse Park in Ballybay, for many years one of the foremost venues in Ulster. He was registrar of Monaghan county board from 1955 until 1970 and was a proud Ulsterman who never forgot his Ulster heritage.In the words of another Monaghan man, the Inniskeen poet Patrick Kavanagh:I have lived in important places, timesWhen great events were decided,These words could have been written about John Francis Conlan. There were many great events in the life of John Francis Conlan, political, family, community, GAA, but to him there was only one important place — Monaghan, and Ballybay. He served it and its people well.Today we can learn from that legacy and his record of service and, above all, from his straightforward and dignified sense of patriotism. I knew John F. Conlan well for many years and he was always someone who gave good personal advice, was the essence of courtesy and, in this House, had particular friends in Dick Barry from Cork, the late Paddy Reilly from Cavan and the late Dinny Farrelly from Kilmainham Wood. We sympathise with John F.'s wife Lily, his son Seán, who is in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery, and his daughter Marie-Therese. John F. Conlan could only be described as being as fine a Christian gentleman as one could ever have the opportunity to meet. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	150	On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Taoiseach and on my own behalf, I extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of John Francis Conlan, with whom I served.John Conlan was born in Ballybay, County Monaghan in May 1928 and educated in St. Macartan's College in Monaghan. He was elected to Monaghan County Council in 1955, served in Seanad Éireann from 1965 to 1969 and was a Dáil Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan from 1969 until 1987. His career as a public representative spanned 49 years and was characterised by his integrity and undiminished commitment to his local community.John F. Conlan was for many years closely associated with the late James Dillon, whose interests he represented locally in County Monaghan while Mr. Dillon worked on national issues. That long association with James Dillon places John F. Conlan is a tradition of constitutional nationalism in this country that stretches back to the beginning of the 19th century.In public life, the late Deputy Conlan was a quiet man who did not seek the headlines. In both this House and County Monaghan he was a very popular man who is both fondly remembered and genuinely mourned. I join with Deputy Kenny and the Members of the House in extending our sympathy to his wife Lily and two children, Seán and Marie-Therese. I extend the sympathies of the Fianna Fáil Party to his family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

Conlan.I did not know John F. Conlan personally but I know of his reputation as a respected, courteous and quietly effective Member of this House and as a diligent worker on behalf of his constituents over a very long period, both in terms of his membership of local government and of the Seanad and Dáil.

He was quiet but effective, a real gentleman in every sense of the word. He was a public representative for 44 years, from 1955 until 1999, an incredible track record. I know from what Deputy Kenny has said and from those who knew the late Deputy better than me that he was a man who never forgot his roots and always put the interests of the people of Cavan-Monaghan first. May he rest in peace.

Conlan and particularly to his wife Lily, his son Seán, daughter Marie-Therese and all his family.I did not know John F. Conlan because his long years of service in this House preceded the Green Party's presence so I take from others the wide affection and respect in which he is held and know that for someone to have served 49 years indicates an amazing strength of character and enormous dedication to public service. It is clear from those who did know him well that he was a person who put his community, his people and the people of Cavan-Monaghan first in all his dealings and for that he leaves behind an important legacy.

I wish also to extend our sympathy to Deputy Kenny and his colleagues in Fine Gael, both in the House and back home in County Monaghan.I had the honour and privilege of serving with John Francis for 14 of his 44 years on Monaghan County Council. Without hesitation, I can say that all of the tributes paid were borne out by the reality of sharing political life with John Francis. He never allowed the political differences of our respective party positions to interfere in personal friendship and the warmth that clearly existed between him and so many of the elected representatives of all opinion in our county. Whether in business or in public life, John Francis was always a decent and dignified man. He deservedly had the respect of all opinion, not only in his native Ballybay and throughout County Monaghan but throughout the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, as exemplified at his requiem mass and funeral on Sunday afternoon in Ballybay, at which all elected opinion was represented.I extend also my sympathy to Deputy Crawford and Fine Gael in County Monaghan for they have lost a dear and true friend.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I wish to join with the other speakers in paying tribute to the late John F. Conlan.As has been said, John F. Conlan served in elected office from 1950 until 1999. He served with great dignity and commitment as a town commissioner, county councillor, Member of Seanad Éireann, Member of Dáil Éireann and as Cathaoirleach of Monaghan County Council. Quite rightly, he was held in great respect by people of all political persuasions throughout Counties Monaghan and Cavan. He earned that respect by his gentle and sincere approach as a public representative. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil organisation in Cavan-Monaghan, I extend to John F.'s widow Lily, daughter Marie-Therese, son Seán and the extended family my sincere sympathy. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	156	It is a sad privilege for me to convey my sympathy to the Conlan family on the death of John Francis Conlan. John Francis was born in Ballybay and was committed to that town and its people all during his life. He started his political career as organiser and adviser to the late Deputy James Dillon, former representative of Monaghan and leader of Fine Gael. Today we would call such a person a programme manager and pay him a generous salary. However, in the 1950s and 1960s this work was done voluntarily. There were no computers, no mobile phones. John Francis Conlan did it in an extremely well-organised way of letter writing, for which he was famous. As already stated by my party leader, John Francis served as an elected representative from 1950 to 1999, almost 50 years, as town commissioner, county councillor, Senator and Deputy. He served his town, county and constituency with honesty, dedication and sincere commitment. Not as vocal as some, whatever he promised he delivered.I worked with John F. Conlan on Monaghan County Council. There is no doubt that colleagues and management listened and took account when he spoke and, if possible, acted on it. When John Francis spoke he had something worthwhile to say, he did not speak for the sake of saying something. So many people can and do pay tribute to what he did for them, their families or organisations without seeking any limelight. John Francis will be missed by his Fine Gael friends and colleagues, by all those who knew him and met during his work, but his death will be felt most by his wife Lily, son Seán, daughter Marie-Therese, sister Kathleen Carraher and the Prunty family. To them and the wider family circle I convey the sympathy of Fine Gael in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and, of course, my own.I pray that our God will comfort and sustain them at this time. No doubt John Francis is looking down on us this morning with a slight smile but what has been said is nothing more than he deserves for his honesty, commitment and service to his town, county and country.

John Francis served at Oireachtas level for 22 years and a total of 49 years in public life. He operated at the highest standard in public life. While John F. had left politics in 1999, before I entered public life, I did have the pleasure of serving with him on the North Eastern Health Board. I found him to be a quiet man who was worth listening to and what he had to say one listened to at health board level. He was a genuine and sincere individual and an absolute gentleman. He shared a great passion for the GAA and had a great interest in Ballybay Pearse Brothers GAA club and also in Monaghan county board where he served as registrar for many years. I knew John F. in general life and found him to be a great community man and my memory of him is that he was a polite, quiet, honest gentleman. I offer my sympathy to the Conlan family, his wife, Lily, son Seán, and daughter Marie-Therese. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a ainm dílis.

Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 13a, motion re membership of committee, without debate, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 3, conclusion of Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2004 agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	161	It is not agreed. I do not want the Government Whip to get the idea that because he has done this a second day in a row we will let him get away with it. I register my opposition to the guillotine principle but I do not wish to unduly delay the proceedings of the House.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Is a policy being established that a guillotine will apply unless otherwise indicated? I thought there was a reluctance to bring in a guillotine if one was to take as sincere the words expressed from the Government side but in practice it appears there is a tendency to apply a guillotine and that should be objected to. Has a Government a particular position on the guillotine and, if so, why are they so regular?

This has to indicate that the practice of the guillotine application is neither appropriate nor acceptable on such an important Bill as the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill. It is imperative that every Member who wishes to participate should have the opportunity to do so. It is not a judgment on whether sufficient time is being allowed, it is that a guillotine applies and if further Deputies are offering they are excluded. That is wrong. Accordingly I record my absolute opposition to the guillotine.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	164	The Government would only put a time limit in exceptional circumstances, so there is no change of policy. The purpose of the Social Welfare Bill is to give effect to the budget announcements in the area of social welfare that were announced last week by the Minister for Social Welfare. It is in everybody's interest that the Bill be passed as quickly as possible but, certainly, there is no change in the practice in regard to limiting time for debate on Second Stage.

While I am on my feet, I raised the matter previously concerning the fact that Members of the House who were the subject of some surveillance from personnel were not informed by the authorities. I am aware that the former leader of the Tánaiste's party wrote twice to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but got no response. Perhaps the Tánaiste will deal with that issue.

If the two Governments are unsuccessful today — I hope that will not be the case — does she agree that it is important that the correct reasons for the breakdown or obstruction of the settlement are made public? The impression of the Irish people is that a photograph is standing between them and a comprehensive settlement. If some parties are not minded to reach a comprehensive settlement for other reasons, it is important that Irish citizens should be made aware of that.

It was a matter of enormous frustration and regret that yesterday Deputy Joe Higgins and I were denied the opportunity to put our questions we had tabled on the matter in the House. It is appropriate that we have an inclusive debate of the type that is all too infrequent in this House, unfortunately. It would be useful to hear certain views if we are to make progress in implementing the Good Friday Agreement. I strongly support the call for such a debate and I hope it will take place.Will the strategic national infrastructure Bill be published in its current form? Given the view expressed by a Minister — that anywhere other than County Wicklow is fine for incineration — will the legislation be amended so that the parts of it relating to incinerators do not apply to that county?

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to introduce the Social Welfare Bill 2004, which is the first of two Bills which will implement the €874 million social welfare package that was announced last week's budget. The package represents an increase of €244 million, or almost 40%, on the 2004 package of €630 million. It brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2005 to over €12.25 billion, which constitutes an increase of €1 billion, or almost9%, on the allocation for 2004. That it is the highest ever level of social welfare expenditure is an indication of the Government's priority, which is to protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients, as well as a clear demonstration of its commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities, their carers, children, the elderly, widowed persons, the unemployed, those who are parenting alone and disadvantaged people. It continues the Government's substantial annual increases in social welfare expenditure, which has increased by almost 60% in the last four years. The current level of such expenditure is twice that in 1997.The budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is over €12 billion, is the largest spending allocation of any Department. I wish to elaborate on what that means in real terms. For every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2005, almost €1 will be spent on social welfare payments. An estimated 970,000 people are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year. When one takes dependants into account, almost 1.5 million people, or two out of every five people in the State, will benefit from the payments. The increases of €12 and €14 in weekly social welfare payments are three to four times greater than the expected rate of inflation in 2005. The increases range from over 7% to over 10%, compared to next year's expected rate of inflation of 2.5%.Ireland has changed dramatically for the better since the Government took office. The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.9 million and the rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.4%.The number of low-paid workers removed from the tax net has increased and in 2005 all those on the minimum wage will be taken out of the income tax net entirely. Social welfare spending has more than doubled, from €5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected €12.25 billion in 2005. Over the past decade, while gross average industrial earnings have increased by 71%, social welfare payments have increased by between 87% and 95%, and by even more for larger families. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented. New social welfare benefits, such as farm assist, carer's benefit, the widowed parent grant and the respite care grant, have been introduced and enhanced.All the real improvements in social welfare in recent years have led to a significant reduction in consistent poverty. According to the ESRI, the overall level of consistent poverty in 1998 was 8.2%. This was reduced by over a third, to 5.2%, by 2001, the latest year for which figures are available.I could spend a long time quoting many more facts and figures that confirm the pivotal role the Department of Social and Family Affairs plays in the lives of so many people and the great strides that have been made in a few years. However, the Department of Social Affairs is concerned with more than statistics. The payments and benefits it provides are a weekly lifeline for many who are struggling to make ends meet. More often than not, the Department is the last safety net for those descending towards poverty, marginalisation and economic and social distress. However, the Department is more than an efficient and effective administrative structure for processing and delivering State entitlements. Above all else, it is about people. It must be people-centered. The response of my Department must always be to shape the welfare system to meet individual needs and not to be guided only by rules and regulations that may sometimes blur the real purpose. Put simply, this means that one size welfare does not fit all.The Department of Social and Family Affairs, while representing a valuable source of payments, entitlements and supports, must be viewed in a broader context. It is about the welfare and the overall well-being of those who are caught in the daily struggle to make ends meet, including the children at risk of poverty, the carers who look after those unable to care for themselves, the elderly, the unemployed and the many others to whom we must reach out and support. My Department must constantly monitor the pulse of our changing society and broaden and evolve to respond to changes. As I said before in this House, the economic surge during the Celtic tiger era did not raise all boats. Some got left behind. We are now enjoying a new wave of economic growth. This time around, the rising tide must, above all else, lift those who were left behind on the previous occasion.Before outlining the contents of this Bill, let me address a few of the welfare areas that were targeted specifically in the budget. I set out to recognise and support in a special way the contribution carers make in society. Carers provide a valued and a valuable service. Everyone in this House, and in society in general, knows of the commitments and sacrifices involved. The package of measures that I agreed with the Minister for Finance commits additional spending of close to €40 million to enhance supports for carers and to allow more carers qualify for entitlements. In all, there are eight separate increases or improvements for carers under this year's budget. The carer's allowance and the carer's benefit are increased by €14 per week and the annual respite care grant has been increased from €850 to €1,000. Almost 33,000 full-time carers are expected to receive the special grant of €1,000 next year. Furthermore, significantly, the respite care grant has been extended to include all carers who are providing full-time care, subject to employment-related conditions. This is one of the most significant developments in recognition of carers since the carer's allowance scheme was first introduced. It will result in an additional 9,200 full-time carers receiving the grant for the first time. The grant will also be payable in respect of each person receiving care.My purpose in making this provision is to recognise and acknowledge the particular challenges faced by carers who are caring for several people. The carer's package also expands the income limits for the carer's allowance so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify by increasing the weekly means test income disregards by €20 to €270 for a single person and by €40 to €540 for a couple. This means a couple with two children can earn up to €30,700 and receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while the same couple can earn up to €49,200 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance, free travel, the household benefits package of free schemes and the respite care grant. These improvements will result in an additional 1,000 new carers qualifying for payment and 2,400 existing carers, who are currently in receipt of a reduced payment, receiving an increase in their weekly carer's allowance payment. I am committed, through these measures, to the cause of carers.The most recent budget, with previous initiatives, went some distance in responding to the specific needs of carers. There is genuinely a lot more to do in this area and I will continue to press ahead with that work.Let us consider what the Opposition has called "cuts", which it says were introduced last year by my predecessor.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Savage cuts.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	214	When I took on the job of Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I indicated that if any hardship was proven, I would take appropriate remedial action. Some of the 30 or so groups involved in making pre-budget submissions told me that several measures needed easement. With that in mind and following detailed examination, I decided to ease nine of the measures at this time, while instructing that those remaining should be subjected to a continuing active review. To remove any lingering doubts, I want to make it very clear that significant improvements have been made in the following ways. The weekly income threshold for half-rate child dependant allowance in respect of certain benefits has been increased from €300 to €350. The back to education allowance has been improved by increasing the grants from €254 to €400, while the qualifying period has been reduced from 15 months to 12 months.As an employment incentive, I have arranged that the one-parent family payment will continue to include a half-rate transitional payment for six months when employment paying over €293 per week is gained. Major changes have also been made in the area of rent supplement. The six-month rule has been removed and amending criteria applied so that people with a short-term income need will not be disadvantaged. This applies to cases of illness or unemployment, together with those who are assessed by a local authority as having a housing need, the elderly, homeless people and those who are disabled.Previously, rent supplement was not paid to those who refused two offers of local authority accommodation. I have raised this to three offers, which I believe to be reasonable, to strengthen the leadership role of local authorities in dealing with long-term housing needs. To that end, I will discuss with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, how best to ensure housing assessments are carried out in a speedier fashion for all applicants for rent supplement. I increased the income disregard from €50 to €60 per week for the payment of rent supplement, and I have decided not to increase the minimum contribution of claimants from its present value of €13 per week. I have asked the social partners to examine the non-payment of rent supplement where either member of a couple is in full-time employment.The money advice and budgeting service is a significant contributor to anti-poverty measures and I have recognised this by providing special funding of €700,000, in addition to the normal funding, to develop additional services. This fully restores the previous level of funding.The purpose of the crèche supplement is to provide short-term emergency support where, for example, a parent needs to avail of a medical appointment. This is an important facility by which parents can avail of community crèches. I have ensured that existing recipients continue to receive it and that new cases, referred by health sector personal social services professionals, will receive payment. In addition, I will consult the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, and Education and Science on the future handling of emergency crèche needs.Correct diet is important for many people who have particular medical needs and I have, therefore, restored payment of the diet supplement, with immediate effect. The Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute is completing a study of the cost of appropriate diets over and above normal food costs. My Department has commissioned this study and I will examine it over the coming weeks to determine whether further amendments are required. This will also be subject to discussions with the Minister for Health and Children.The remaining measures will continue to be under review, during which they will be continuously monitored to ensure no disadvantage is caused. They include graduated rates of payment, the increase in paid contributions for entitlement to certain social insurance benefits and the period over which multiple claims can be linked. It is a sad fact of life that more often than not the most vulnerable in society are children. This budget set out to improve entitlements and supports targeted at directly benefiting children and families. There has been some questioning of the policy of not increasing the child dependant allowances on the grounds that these payments are made only to recipients of social welfare and, consequently, are targeted directly at those most at risk of poverty.The Government's policy is to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme. After this budget, child benefit will account for over 66% of child income support, while in 1994 it constituted only less than 30%. There are sound reasons for this policy. Child benefit is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents, and it does not contribute to poverty traps, whereas the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities. As a near universal payment, child benefit is not taxable, is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits and is payable to the primary carer, usually the mother. When account is taken of these aspects of payment, child benefit is more effective than child dependant allowance as a child income support mechanism. The combined child income support, that is child benefit and child dependant allowance, for those on social welfare payments will be at 33% of the lowest social welfare rate in 2005.As part of the Sustaining Progress special initiative on ending child poverty, the National Economic and Social Council has been asked to undertake an in-depth examination of child income support arrangements with a view to considering the possibility of a second tier child-related payment targeted at low income families. This would replace family income supplement and child dependant allowances, and perhaps the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, and would have a neutral impact on employment incentives. I am particularly interested in studying the findings of that National Economic and Social Council report as it may offer a new emphasis and a new direction in the fight we all want to win against child poverty.The objectives of the 2005 social welfare package are to: provide significantly enhanced supports to carers; increase and maintain the value of all rates of payment in real terms with a €12 minimum increase in all weekly social welfare payments; provide a substantial increase of €14 per week to those on lower payments; continue to address the Sustaining Progress and An Agreed Programme for Government commitments to increase the State pension to €200 by 2007; increase the real value of all qualified adult rates of payment and ensure that they do not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate; and continue to make significant progress in our programme of increases in the level of child benefit.My priority in this budget package is to make significant progress in delivering on the social welfare commitments contained in the programme for Government, Sustaining Progress and the national anti-poverty strategy. Resources will be targeted on helping those most in need not alone to raise their standard of living but also to ensure that everyone is a valued citizen who can make his or her individual contribution to society regardless of his or her circumstances.The main provisions of the Bill are as follows. Sections 2 and 3 reaffirm the Government's commitment to supporting pensioners and, together with the Schedules to the Bill, provide for an increase of €12 per week in the personal rates of old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, and retirement and invalidity pensions. This measure will bring the rate of the old age contributory pension to €179.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to €166 per week. On the basis of projected annual inflation of 2.5% in 2005, these increases represent a substantial real increase.There is also an increase of €12 for those in receipt of widow's-widower's contributory and non-contributory pensions bringing the maximum personal weekly rates for those pensioners aged 66 years and over to €179.30 and €166 respectively. Widows in receipt of those pensions aged under 66 years will benefit from a €14 increase, bringing their weekly pensions to €154.30 and €148.80 respectively. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate payments.The Government is committed to increasing the level of qualified adult allowance for pensioner spouses in the coming years to the full old age non-contributory pension rate to benefit, in the main, women in the home who do not qualify for the contributory pension in their own right. Section 2 provides for increases in the social insurance-based payments and for increases in respect of qualified adults. The qualified adult payments applicable to old age contributory and retirement pensions are increased by €9.30 per week, where the qualified adult is aged 66 years or over, and €8 per week, where he or she is aged under 66 years. Qualified adult payments in respect of invalidity pension are increased by €9.30 where the qualified adult is over 66 years of age and by €10 where aged under 66. The combined increases in personal and qualified adult rates will mean that a couple in receipt of a full old age contributory pension with qualified adult allowance rate, aged over 66, will receive a substantial increase of €21.30 per week.In addition to providing for the increases in social assistance payments, section 3 contains the rates increases for qualified adults on such payments. An increase of €7.90 per week is provided for qualified adults of old age non-contributory pension recipients and blind pension recipients over 66 years of age. An increase of €9.30 per week is provided for all other qualified adult rates. Proportionate increases will be applied where persons are in receipt of reduced rate qualified adult allowance payments.I am also conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in our society, particularly those who are unemployed or disadvantaged, those who are ill and those who provide caring support for the elderly and the ill. Accordingly, I am providing for a weekly increase of €14 in the personal rates of those payments. This will bring all the lowest weekly personal rates of payment to €148.80, including unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, one-parent family payment, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist. As a result of the €14 increase, the rate of carer's allowance will reach €153.60 per week while the new carer's benefit rate will be €163.70 per week.The social welfare budget increases included in this Bill will become payable from the first pay-day in January 2005. People receiving short-term payments, such as unemployment benefit or assistance, farm assist and supplementary welfare allowance, will receive their increases immediately in the first week in January. In addition, 160,000 customers who receive long-term payments by means of electronic payment through a post office or a bank will receive their increases on the first pay-day in January. The payable order book is the payment mechanism for 220,000 persons who are, predominantly, recipients of widow's-widower's, one-parent family payment, invalidity pension and carer's allowance. The production of new order books will entail a minimal delay and the new books will be issued to all customers in mid-February 2005. These customers will receive a lump sum arrears payment of six weeks in their first payable order of the new book and the weekly increase will be included in their weekly payable orders thereafter.A further 260,000 customers, mainly recipients of old age and retirement pensions and disability allowance, who also receive payments via the payable order book, will receive their new order books in April. To minimise inconvenience, they will, however, receive a special payment in mid-February comprising six weeks arrears of the budget increase and seven weeks advance payment. For example, a couple on old age non-contributory pension and aged over 66 years of age will receive a lump sum payment of €312 in mid-February. This will cover the increase from the first pay-day in January and include an advance of the increase to the book renewal date in April. Thereafter, the increase will be incorporated into the normal weekly payment.Section 4 of the Bill provides an increase of €39 in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement, expanding the thresholds from €446 in the case of a family with one child to €623 in the case of a family with eight or more children. This will result in a weekly increase of €23.40 with effect from January 2005 for most eligible families.Sections 5 and 6 provide for changes in PRSI. The earnings ceiling for employees' social insurance contributions and the income ceiling for the payment of optional contributions is being increased by €2,020 from €42,160 to €44,180 per year with effect from 1 January 2005. Section 7 provides for an increase in the percentage of reckonable weekly earnings referred to in calculating the rate of payment under the maternity benefit scheme. This provision increases the rate from 70% to 75% and goes half-way towards fulfilling the commitment under Sustaining Progress to raise this limit to 80% of average weekly earnings over the life of that agreement. The measure will benefit the majority of recipients and will take effect from January 2005.I will propose an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to ensure that the similarities in the application and administration of the maternity benefit and adoptive benefit schemes are maintained.The proposed amendment will, therefore, provide that the increase in the percentage of reckonable weekly earnings from 70% to 75% under the maternity benefit scheme that I have already outlined will also apply to the adoptive benefit scheme from January next.Section 8 provides for an increase of €44 per week in the health contribution threshold bringing the weekly income under which no contribution is payable from €365 per week or €18,512 per year to €400 per week or €20,800 per year. This measure, which will take effect from January next, is expected to benefit 95,000 income earners.This Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, builds on the progress of social inclusion measures adopted by the Government over recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate. Molaim an Bille don Teach.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	215	It is difficult to know where to start, since the Minister's speech is unusual. He dresses up improvements, and it is more a case of three steps back than one step forward. It is supposed to be an improvement. He uses new words, speaking of "ease" and "easement". In some briefings that I have seen, he writes of amendments to the savage 16 cuts of last year. One could say that we now have a caring and sharing Government, but we will have to see. It is hard not to be cynical about the desperation that we detect following the battering that the Government received at the local and European elections. People did not like what happened last year, and they had their say, giving notice to the Government to put its house in order quickly. However, it is too late for the Government. People are now waiting for the general election to trounce Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for the unspeakable way in which they have treated those on low incomes in particular, especially last year.The Government keeps saying that large amounts of money are available and that we are flush with cash. If so, where was the need for all the cutbacks, and why have they not been totally reversed this year? They went down to Inchydoney in my county, something about which people keep telling us. They realised — although not fully, it seems — that they had been wrong to make those petty savings at the expense of the most vulnerable. They saved approximately €55.5 million or 5% of the total social welfare budget for 2004.The Government sat around and agreed several vicious cutbacks that affected the most vulnerable in society, in the main those who could not fight back. I heard today that some Members involved in social partnership who did not agree with the Government last year were told to leave. It had come down from the Department of the Taoiseach that they were not wanted there, since they were giving the wrong message to the Government about some of the cutbacks and the way that homeless people in particular were being treated. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, is faced with a great challenge. He has consistently said that he will do his best and work very hard. He is very experienced and has been around for a long time. Fine Gael will back him in any efforts that he makes to help the most vulnerable, but we will not tolerate anything less.In today's speech there was a great deal of waffle, including words such as "easement", which does not fool anyone. We know what it means — partial easement — and that is trying to fool people. At the time of the cutbacks last year the Government referred to them as "adjustments", another euphemism. In his speech, the Minister says that the Opposition called them cuts, but that is what they were. Let us use English. They were cutbacks rather than simple adjustments.He also said that they were necessary to keep the public finances healthy. The poorest of the poor had to suffer so that the rich might benefit and the Government could buy all those electronic voting machines. It is amazing that the €55 million it saved by hitting the poorest of the poor last year was almost exactly equal to the amount that it squandered on those machines, which lie unused somewhere, and which may never be used.We must accept — and the Fine Gael Party is the first to do so — that the public finances must be kept in order. The Government has a poor record in that regard, having squandered money when there was plenty. One must question the political choices made at the expense of the people. I mentioned the voting machines, and Punchestown has been raised by many. There are also all the spin doctors and reports that the Government has commissioned over recent years. Many of the reports lie unread on shelves and nothing has happened. Ministers have many advisers. In this democracy, we are on the Opposition benches trying to debate with the Government how best to manage the country. We have fewer resources, but the Government can simply write blank cheques to its personal friends, bringing them in as advisers, spin doctors and so on. It is not good enough, and people are waiting, having become sick of this carry-on.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, is extremely disingenuous to suggest that last year's cutbacks have been reversed. That has not happened, since there has been no change to over a third of the so-called "savage 16", while the rest have merely been tinkered with. The Minister created a great deal of hope with words such as "reversed" and "rescinded". Now he is muddying the waters, and his promises have been reduced to "amendments" and "easements". It is very unclear in some cases what the outcome of the Minister's tinkering will be. As matters stand, people will still suffer as a result of those cutbacks — not easements. The Minister must issue a clear statement explaining what exactly is occurring with each of those measures and fully outline the timeframe for the implementation of the amendments that he proposes, which is very unclear. What the Minister produced on the night of the budget seemed like something concocted in a hurry. There were not many items, and I wish to go through some.The Minister has mentioned the back to education allowance. The qualifying period was increased from six months to 15 months for the third level option. His amendment brings that back down to 12 months. That is not a reversal since people will still have to wait 12 months before they can get involved. Surely the Minister agrees that we must try to help people back into education. No reason that I could accept was given for that cut. The scheme was very good, and people who had been out of work for six months qualified to return to education to better themselves. The Minister spoke of that, yet now they must wait 12 months. Why did the Minister not reverse the cuts and restore the six-month qualifying period? He could have done it, so what stopped him? It was an easement.I welcome the education allowance being increased by 58% to €400, since the cost is real. However, the Minister could have reversed the other cut. There are people in my constituency and others who say to their representatives that they would like to return to education but cannot. They had made plans to return to college to try to better themselves but could not because of the cut. I will press the Minister very hard to re-examine whether he might restore the six-month period. Twelve months is a very long time to wait.When the cut was introduced, expert advice was given saying that anything longer than six months was retrogressive. If the Minister wishes to reconsider the matter, he will have that information before him. Expert advice said that the qualifying period could be no longer than six months. On Wednesday, 19 November 2003, the then Minister of State at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Deputy O'Dea, said before the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that he had not had a chance to study the changes but would speak to the Minister about them. He stated that, if the qualifying period had been extended to 15 months, he would certainly not like to see it extended any further. He said that experts had arrived at the six-month period after extensive consultation and a great deal of deliberation. It was he who had first introduced the scheme.The other matter was the discontinuation of transitional half-rate payments for lone parents where the recipient takes up employment with earnings above the upper threshold of €293 per week. That was amended, and one-parent family recipients are now to receive a transitional half-rate payment for six months where income exceeds €293 per week. That is welcome, but one wonders once again how much was saved. It must have been very little. The rationale for the cut was not given. Before the cutback, the period was 12 months. As far as I can figure out, at that time there were only 580 claimants. Six months after the introduction of the cut, 120 people had been removed from the scheme. Perhaps the Minister might inform us on Committee Stage what the figure is now. In 2004, the minimum contribution that all recipients of supplementary welfare allowance, rent or mortgage supplement were required to make towards their accommodation was increased by €1 per week to €13. There has been no further increase in that contribution. I note this measure is to be kept under ongoing review. What does the Minister mean by the term "ongoing review"? Social welfare recipients are already paying top-ups to landlords. A family in receipt of the lowest social welfare payment must pay a contribution towards their rent and a top up payment, which can take quite a chunk out of their weekly income.Supplementary welfare allowance is not payable to people in full-time employment. In future, if one of a couple is in full-time employment, both will be excluded from claiming rent-mortgage supplement. This measure has been referred for review to the social partners. This cut will hit people who are unemployed. It is a swingeing cut into which no real thought has been put. There is no change in that regard. Threshold stated that the rule where people could not receive rent supplement if one's spouse was working over 30 hours per week discouraged people from looking for work, especially low paid work. One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement is that the tenant must be in need of accommodation and unable to provide for it from his or her resources. For the most part, health boards decide whether an applicant for rent supplement is in need of accommodation without reference to the local authority. In future claimants for rent supplement will be referred to the local authority for an assessment of housing need in a more systematic manner. The Minister amended this measure subject to consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This measure was mainly needed to ensure that rent supplements are paid in appropriate circumstances. What does the Minister's so-called amendment mean? What has changed? Some of the people administering these schemes are confused. The Minister should set out in plain English what exactly is meant by this change. A clear guide on this measure is required. Many people depend on these schemes. If the Minister's officials, namely, the experts who are administering these schemes do not understand them, how can the Minister expect recipients of benefits under the schemes to understand them? We need clarity in terms of where people stand in respect of each scheme. We need the position set out in plain English rather than in glossy words such as "easement" and "amendment" used by the Minister.Health boards will be given the power to refuse rent supplements in cases where the applicant has not already been renting for a period of six months, with provisions for exceptions in regard to people who are homeless or where there are other compelling reasons. This measure has been amended, but again the position is ambiguous. Some voluntary groups are of the view that this change will mean that an individual will have to prove some form of renting, although not necessarily for six months. This amendment does not cover one parent families, people living at home with parents who want to move out of home or people who find themselves dealing with a crisis pregnancy and a major row breaks out at home.Homelessness is still a major issue. Perhaps the Minister will take up a challenge to work with his Government colleagues and other Members to try to eliminate homelessness once and for all. I do not mean addressing the problem by putting people into hostels, which is what is currently happening. People are being put into hostels and left there when what they need are houses — a place of their own. That is what the Government must provide for people who are homeless.Rent supplement will no longer be paid to people who refuse offers of local authority accommodation or to people who leave local authority accommodation without reasonable cause. This change is welcome. The Government has recognised that this was a mean cut at the time. It was unfair and showed that the Government was out of touch at that time. People are afraid to move into certain areas and have genuine concerns about anti-social behaviour. The amendment to this measure has given some leeway in that social welfare recipients can still receive rent supplement unless a third offer of local authority accommodation is refused.A supplement given to recipients of social welfare allowances who have been supported by MABS in brokering a deal with creditors was discontinued last year. That change played into the hands of moneylenders, plenty of whom are still operating. Special funding of €700,000 will be allocated to MABS to develop additional and innovative services to directly tackle over-indebtedness and the financial and emotional stress it causes families. I would like the Minister to outline on Committee Stage how that funding will be administered and implemented because that is not clear. What does he mean by the additional and innovative services to be provided by such funding? A relatively small number of people, some 370, who are among the most vulnerable, availed of this payment prior to the cutback. This action affected a small number of people and saved a small amount of money, but it created major hardship for those people and drove more people into the hands of moneylenders and loan sharks who are still in operation.The crèche supplement was discontinued. While the Minister's change to this measure is welcome, it has made the crèche supplement more difficult to avail of than previously. It is unclear what is involved. The continuation of funding for existing crèche supplement recipients and their community crèches is positive. There will also be funding of new cases referred by health sector personal social services professionals. The Minister needs to outline exactly what criteria govern the scheme. What are the guidelines for eligibility? We need to see those because we want to be able to debate them. My fear is that they could be restrictive, but I hope they are not. The Minister has not made those clear.We were told last year that the diet supplement was outdated and was being phased out. However, now it is being restored and a new revised report is being prepared on it. We do not know when that report will be published or how long after its publication the Minister will take to act on its recommendations. The Minister should restore the supplement at the level it was at, wait for the publication of the report and then act on it. Why should people have to suffer in the meantime? I believe the Minister would agree that makes sense. However, we are another report away from action being taken on this measure, which is long-fingering the process. The fear among the people in question is that it could result in a reduction or restriction in the payment of the diet supplement.Last year we learned that the entitlement to half-rate child dependant allowance in respect of unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims would be discontinued where the claimant's spouse-partner has weekly income in excess of €300. There is a change to this measure in that there is an increase in the income threshold for entitlement to half-rate child dependant allowance with unemployment benefit, disability benefit, injury benefit and health and safety benefit by €50 to €350 a week. We were told that by June of this year, six months after the introduction of this cutback, the number of people receiving such a payment was reduced by 17,000 from 63,000 to 46,000. In his press release on budget day, the Minister said the amendment would benefit approximately 4,600 families. That is a 30% reversal in that respect and the figure could be much worse given that the latest available figures for this cutback are only for the first six months of the year. Will the Minister provide up to date figures on this measure? How many people have been affected by it? What was the effect of it and what will the effect of it be in the future? I am sure the Minister will accept the easements proposed are vague and difficult to understand. He needs to do much more to clarify them.Another cutback was an increase in the current weekly earnings threshold for the purposes of payment of reduced rates of disability benefit and unemployment benefit. It was argued that the measure was a serious disincentive to employment. There is no change in this measure, which will be kept under review. When is a person entitled to a half rate payment of disability benefit or unemployment benefit? This measure does not directly affect the rate of benefit payable but it may cause entitlement to be exhausted earlier. Widows and widowers were affected by this measure last year, but that was amended after must pressure.It was proposed to increase the underlying number of paid contributions required from 39 since first entering insurance to 52 for entitlement to disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit. This measure is designed to more closely relate the contribution conditions for those benefits to the level and duration of the benefits being provided. There is no change to that measure, which will continue to be reviewed.I could refer to a number of other measures, but I wish to deal with an issue arising in respect of child benefit. While we welcome the increase provided, in the 2001 budget the then Government promised to spend €1.27 billion on child benefit over three years. The then Government delivered on that promise in 2002 which was an election year, but it broke that promise in 2003 and promised to deliver on that commitment in 2004 and 2005. In 2004 child benefit was increased by less than half what was required to keep pace with the commitments made in Sustaining Progress, leaving a gap of €18.30 and €20.10 to be filled. Yet again the target date for meeting Government promises has been pushed back, bringing it closer to the general election. Is it the intention to give a huge increase in child benefit at that time? That is my guess, and that is what people have become used to. However, I will not accept those shenanigans and use of people's money to buy votes.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was not increased, and that surprises me. The take-up of this allowance is low. More needs to be done to ensure that people are aware of it and can avail of it. The Minister is being very strict regarding the deadline — if people do not apply by a certain date they cannot get it. Perhaps the Minister will examine that aspect.The family income supplement is good, but it could be better, and it is still not getting to the people who need it. That is a big issue. The Department is running an advertisement of carer's benefit on radio. The advertisement mostly states what a caring Department the Minister is running, given how much money it pays out. There is a small bit in the middle to the effect that people might be entitled to certain benefits. Perhaps the Minister will examine the content of that advertisement and change it so that it spends more time giving information and less time praising the Department. That might be more beneficial. It is necessary to inform people of their entitlements, particularly to family income supplement.I am interested in what the Minister intends to do to bring together in one payment the clothing and footwear allowance, the FIS and the dependant allowances in the form of a second child-related payment targeted at low income families. That is an interesting idea. It is one that Fine Gael has also advocated and one that would be less difficult to administer, provided people were aware of their entitlements. I await the Minister's proposals in that area.The increase in carer's respite is welcome. Much was expected regarding carers. A person in receipt of an old age pension who suddenly has to care for a dependent spouse or child does not get anything extra for doing that. If they are in receipt of a carer's allowance and become eligible to claim a pension, they lose the other allowance. However, the amount of extra work they do and the amount of money they thereby save the State is enormous. There was an expectation that they would be entitled to even half the carer's allowance, although I argue they should get much more than that. That has not happened.I welcome the removal of the anomaly whereby a person caring for more than two people could not receive a grant in respect of each care recipient. It is time that was addressed.Will the Minister clarify the extension of the respite care grant for carers who would not qualify for the carer's allowance. In the budget fact sheet it is stated that the respite care grant will be extended to all carers providing full-time care to an older person or a person with disability, regardless of means and subject to certain employment-related conditions. What are these employment-related conditions? Does this mean that all full-time carers will be given the respite care grant? I would welcome clarification of that from the Minister on Committee Stage.I welcome the disability package. There was no mention of a personal advocacy service for persons with disability, which was announced in July and September this year. A press release issued on 27 September, two days before the Government reshuffle, suggested the new personal advocacy service would be put in place after the Comhairle Bill was introduced into the Oireachtas in October. Following the publication of the national disability strategy the previous Minister met the Chairman of Comhairle to discuss the implementation of the personal advocacy service. This gave the impression that the service would be up and running once the Bill was passed. However, I recently learned that this might not happen until 2008. I would like clarification of this from the Minister.There was no mention of a cost of disability payment. I am sure the Minister realises that if somebody has a disability the cost of living goes up. The person cannot go to the local large supermarket to shop but may have to shop in smaller shops nearby, which increases costs.I mentioned previously that beneficiaries of community employment schemes would be entitled to family income supplement if they were working in the labour force. The Minister promised to examine this issue when I raised it by way of parliamentary question, but he has not done so. People whose income is from community employment schemes are not entitled to a top-up, even though if they were in the labour force they would be so entitled. I again ask the Minister to examine this issue.The removal of those on the minimum wage from the tax net has at long last happened. However, it has been suggested that people on the minimum wage may find themselves being taxed again later this year when there is an increase in the minimum wage. We welcome the increase, but if someone is on the minimum wage they should have that amount to live on and nothing should be deducted from it.Many groups wanted an increase in the child dependant allowance but that has not been given. The Minister stated that such an increase could act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities. However, research has indicated that is not the case. There is disappointment that the Minister did not increase the allowance. Although he did not mention it on Second Stage, the Minister often refers to consistent poverty. He must surely be aware that this definition of poverty is outdated and that all across Europe and even in the agencies in Ireland poverty is defined in terms of relative income poverty. Neither has the Minister mentioned the new phenomenon of the working poor that is emerging in Ireland. What does the Government intend to do to assist such people given that 35% of children who experience poverty now come from families that are in employment and where people are working they are often cut off from many supports and benefits administered by the Department? This is something the Government must address very soon because people are experiencing serious hardship.The cuts implemented last year have not been rescinded. People who were affected last year are still affected. The Minister put a spin on this when he spoke about easement today and about amendments on the night of the budget. However, the cuts are still in operation and people are suffering as a result. The Minister must do better. At the moment I would give him three out of ten for delivering on a reversal of those cuts. The other improvements are welcome. However, we must bear in mind the people who are most vulnerable, the people who have no voice and who have no one to fight for them. These are the people the Government targeted last year to save €55.5 million. He has done precious little this year to reverse that. He could have done a lot more.The Minister has been only a short time in office and has promised much. In fairness, the jury is still out. However, he was in the Cabinet when these cuts were introduced. We still have the same circus on the other side of the House but the clowns have been moved around. We must wait to see whether the Minister can do better than he has up to now. At this stage it is probably too late to do better, given that Committee Stage is to be taken tomorrow. He could burn the midnight oil and produce amendments to the Bill tomorrow. Some aspects are governed by regulation and the Minister could, perhaps, examine those to see whether it would be possible to introduce regulations later this year or early next year to address some of the cuts that were introduced last year.The Minister might also give consideration to some of the other suggestions I made today. The problem of homelessness is a major issue and must be addressed. Single men in particular who become homeless find it very difficult to cope. They need assistance and a leg-up to get back on their feet and find a place of their own. That is not too much to ask. The local authorities and health boards must be engaged with to ensure this happens.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	216	This is clearly an opportunist election budget focused on trying to undo the damage done to the Government parties by the succession of budgets of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy. I welcome the increases in social welfare and pensions and the care package for the disabled. However, these measures are in line with what has been set out in Sustaining Progress and were advised by the Combat Poverty Agency, in particular in regard to increasing personal rates by a minimum of €12, increasing the qualified adult rate by €9, which was not achieved in some areas, and reforming the means test and income disregards.With regard to the money advice and budgeting service, the level of spin has caused many to accept the situation. Some commentators appear to have forgotten the essential principle that the best way out of poverty is through employment and removing the obstacles to getting into employment. As I will illustrate, the budget did nothing for lone parent families. The smoke and mirrors and spin will not conceal the fact that the budget tried to give the impression that all is well at the castle. Nothing could be further from the truth. While most of the cuts were last year visited upon the marginalised and those who could ill afford to bear them, I was the subject of abuse from Fianna Fáil backbenchers and Ministers who stated the cuts were not taking place. It took me 72 hours to sieve out the fact that there were 16 savage cuts, although it was stated that this was nonsense. The former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, stated that I was engaging in sensationalism and that the cuts would have no impact. However, I brought the various community and voluntary organisations to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, which I chair, where they pointed out the impact of the cuts. Despite this, it was still stated there were no cuts.The former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, would not give the former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, the €58 million she wanted. She should have fought a harder battle and the Labour Party indicated it would support her in that. She did not fight, however, as I anticipated and expected her to for the people she represented.The former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, was the author of the dirty dozen cuts, so, by implication, he became the grandfather of the savage 16 cuts. I was not surprised because they were in line with the ideology on which the former Minister articulated his economic philosophy. It was the ideological bent of the Government, which then went to Inchydoney to be converted. Fr. Healy might think he has changed Government policy and he was delighted to be in a position to welcome a budget for the first time in 19 years. However, he did not delve into the interior of the budget to assess the insidious nature of some of the measures which will impact on the very poor and which will not facilitate the transition from unemployment, which is the best way out of poverty, for many, including lone parent families who require assistance with child care costs to alleviate their burdens and facilitate their progress into work.After so many budgets favouring the rich, horses and greyhounds, it was obviously impossible for the new Minister to put right all the damage in one year, which I accept. However, this is especially the case as the only source for increasing social expenditure arises from the buoyancy of the economy, which is not predicted by the Department of Finance unless it has its figures very wrong. Improvements in the equity of the tax system to ensure that millionaires make an appropriate contribution to society are put on the long finger with talk of a review of tax breaks and with some progress possibly to be made in next year's budget. With such a light-hearted conversion to socialism this year, we have every right to ask how long this will last. If general economic circumstances are less favourable next year, will the Government revert to its normal approach and let the most vulnerable once again bear the full burden of any shortcomings on revenue, which was the case in 2003 when the Estimates were announced?We must examine the context of the budget and social welfare changes if we are to determine the true situation. With regard to relative income poverty, 22% of the population live below the 60% median, an increase from 16% in 1994. The depth of relative poverty has increased, a higher proportion of people live in long-term poverty and Irish performance in this regard is among the worst in the EU. To ensure that those in low-paid employment are looked after, we must focus on the facts. Employee households account for 17% of the poor and 35% of poor children are in working households. These are the issues. There is a higher poverty risk for welfare recipients of between 40% and 50%. Welfare increases have lagged behind income growth, although this was once referred to as the only way to ensure the poor would not fall further into the poverty trap.Ireland, one of the most prosperous countries in the world, has the highest relative income poverty rates in the European Union and has held this position of shame throughout the 1990s. The EU joint report on social inclusion, published in 2004, stated that during the period of the Celtic tiger, with high economic growth and falling unemployment, poverty in Ireland rose, with 21% of people in poverty in 2001 compared with the EU average of 15%. The comparison between Ireland and the other EU member states in terms of our payment for social protection is a shocking indictment of the commitment we have to alleviating poverty and, in particular, ensuring that the deprived and marginalised get help when they need it most.In 2001, Ireland spent less than 15% of its gross domestic product on social protection while the other 14 member states of the EU, as it then was, spent 20% of GDP. No amount of spin doctoring by the Government can conceal this reality, although Inchydoney man might try some tricks to indicate that the Government is ameliorating the situation. The Government is partial to using a different measure of poverty, consistent poverty, developed by the ESRI in 1987 to characterise the predicament of the disadvantaged. Members may have guessed the point, namely, that consistent poverty has been reducing in Ireland. The Minister made the point again this morning, as does every Minister at every possible opportunity. However, if one were to ask how consistent poverty is faring in other EU member states, nobody knows. Why? It is because this measure is peculiar to Ireland and does not allow for inconvenient international comparisons. Enough has been said. As used to be written, QED.The savage 16 cuts can be divided into three groups. The first two groups are payments enabling and supporting progression to work for lone parents and to education for all adults. What has happened? The cuts have been tinkered with at the margins. Why was the qualifying period increased from six months to 15? It was stated that there was some abuse but no evidence of this was presented. Instead, the claim was just trotted out. One should not deny support to those in need. If a few people abuse the system, they should be dealt with but the entire system should not be cut off. No evidence was presented for the claims which were simply trotted out when convenient. While it is stated that the system has now been eased or amended or otherwise, the English language is precise. The system was emasculated. However, the Government, in trying to draw back from the river of destruction, has brought the qualifying period back to 12 months. What about people like the young girl about whom I spoke in this House going back to third level education? The best way out of poverty is through education and work and by providing for this country by becoming a teacher or whatever. However, this girl will not qualify. Let us call a spade a spade. Nothing has been done. Like that girl, everything is in the doldrums.The transitional half rate for lone parents is to be discontinued where a recipient of one-parent family payment takes up employment and where earnings are in excess of the upper threshold of €293 per week. People used to get it for 12 months, but now they will get it for six months. They say half a loaf of bread is better than no bread where I come from, but let us be clear about a few things. I was told I was being alarmist and sensationalist about these cuts and that they did not mean anything. I wanted to know who they would affect and if we had the statistics to indicate how many people would be affected. Fair play to the Minister in that he came into the House and told the truth. He was not able to answer those questions, yet his predecessor said they would have no major global effect even though we said they would have. We were right.If the Government was working in line with Sustaining Progress, all those policy changes and instruments used to effect policy changes would be poverty proofed. The Government did not do that or if it did, it was done incorrectly because the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Minister would not be here today saying he is amending or easing those cuts if they did not have the impact we predicted and set out in clear and concise fashion. We were right and the Government and all those around it were wrong. We must give ourselves a small pat on the back, not that we deserve it, for trying to ensure the poor were not forgotten in the rush to ensure the rich were always insulated when cuts had to be made. I am proud of the role the Labour Party played. We led the charge and others joined in. We were right from the beginning, from November 2003, and we launched a campaign in December 2003, although not too many people were behind us in leading the charge to ensure those cuts would be reversed.The big problem is the €293 — the cut off point — which has not been touched since 1997. I think it was my colleague, Proinsias de Rossa, who introduced this in 1997 and it was innovative at the time. At that time the regulation allowed lone parents to work and earn up to €146.50 per week without losing any of their allowance and it later allowed them to earn up to €293. However, that figure has not been increased in the past seven years despite repeated requests from OPEN, the One Parent Exchange and Network, seeking to have the amount of income increased, which can be earned before the State payment is lost. If the amount was index linked, it would be €350 or €360. This is an insidious cut. As we have pointed out over the years, we are not fools.In 2000 the Irish Congress of Trade Unions pointed out that child care costs had doubled between 1997 and 2000. It can be safely assumed that like a balloon, once they have gone up, they will never come down. Child care costs have obviously more than doubled again between 2000 and 2004. The effect of these developments is that lone parents wishing to work are in an impossible position. They lose all their State payments when they go above the limit — well before they earn enough to cover Ireland's extremely high child care costs and before they address their own living expenses. This is a situation into which some of the great organisations evaluating this budget have not looked.One lone parent with two children stated: "I got paid on Thursday, did a big shop, looked out for special offers and bought the basics but there is usually nothing left by Wednesday — maybe some mince in the freezer or sausages or soup and bread." These are real stories and are not made up. Those who are very rich and who do well out of this Government, and who will continue to do so, might not know much about that, but I have never forgotten from where I have come.Let us look at the eight supplementary cuts. There have been no clear-cut reversals. Two of the cuts are subject to further consultation.Crèche and diet supplements are a little bit better, but are narrow in focus. The rent supplement change is limited to those who have lost employment through illness or disability. Let us look at the six month criterion to ensure that people who have a short term income need, such as people who have become ill or unemployed, are assessed by local authorities as having a housing need are not disadvantaged. The best way to deal with this is to ensure adequate housing is provided for those people. We have always said that. However, as Deputy Stanton said, not enough money is being provided. There is no clear-cut reversal of those eight cuts. Some of them have not been touched, while others have been tinkered with to give the illusion of a reversal.Let us look at the six benefit payment cuts that are weakening the PRSI system. One cut had been amended before the budget, one has been slightly improved, although the principle of the cut remains intact, and there have been no changes to the other four, nor has there been any explanation to justify why there is no intention to change them. The entitlement to half rate child dependent allowance in respect of unemployment and disability benefit had been discontinued where the claimant's spouse or partner's grossly weekly income is in excess of €300, but it has been increased to €350. That is not a reversal but a slight improvement. The current weekly income threshold for the purpose of payment of reduced rates of disability and unemployment benefit is being increased from €88.88 to €150 per week.Entitlements will be discontinued for new claimants to half rate of payment of disability and unemployment benefits where the recipient is already in receipt of the widow's or widower's pension or one parent family payments. That was amended due to pressure from the National Widow's Association of Ireland and Joe Duffy on the national airwaves. There has been an increase from 39 to 52 in the number of paid social insurance contributions for entitlement to disability, unemployment and health and safety benefit. There has been no change. There has been an increase from 13 to 26 weeks in regard to the period where claims for unemployment and disability benefits were linked. The maximum duration of unemployment benefit will be reduced from 390 to 212 days. This reminds me of the three card trick where one always thinks one is winning but no matter how well one watches the cards, one never picks the queen. There is nothing in the proposed measures in that they only tinker around the edges.The Minister was not in a position to find the €50 million needed to reverse those cuts. No amount of Inchydoney spin or any other sort of spin doctoring will disguise the fact the Minister could not get the €50 million to reverse the social welfare cuts. The former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, is gone but his ghost lives on here. It would have been an awful insult to what he stood for if the Minister had succeeded in getting that money.Let us look at some of the other cuts. There is nothing under direct provision for asylum seekers. There has been no change in that since 2000. There is nothing on child care in the Social Welfare Bill, which I pointed out in regard to one-parent families. The number of one-parent families is not small. There were 150,634 lone parent households listed in the 2002 census. Lone mothers accounted for 85% of that total. Some 79,915 lone parent families were in receipt of State support. These are unvarnished, public statistics. However, census statistics and figures do not reveal how vulnerable lone parents are or how their predicament in a prosperous country is getting worse rather than better. Therefore, there is nothing for them in terms of child care and nothing either in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. A recent Labour Party study showed that it can cost up to €1,000 to send children to secondary school in September. The €80 primary school allowance is paltry, as is the €150 allowance for secondary school, which is designed to meet the cost of school books, uniforms and other school equipment. One would not get a pair of decent runners for that price, however, so let us be clear that nothing has been provided in those areas.In addition, nothing has been provided in the child dependant allowance, although I appreciate that the Minister has indicated he is examining that matter. It is part of the MABS proposal which has also been raised by the Combat Poverty Agency. I can see the Minister's approach to the matter, which may be broadly termed a child benefit supplement, amalgamating the family income supplement and the child dependant allowance. That is a sensible way to proceed in dealing with child poverty. We cannot disguise the fact that it is a major issue.The argument made by independent commentators in favour of the child dependant allowance is that it is much more targeted. Surely the Department of Social and Family Affairs could devise some system to prevent people from losing out on secondary benefits. Most of the departmental officials are very diligent. I thank the Minister for his help yesterday when we received an excellent briefing on the Social Welfare Bill. His staff were very co-operative and I deeply appreciate that. Some of the officials are beginning to know us well. They know more about our idiosyncrasies than we do ourselves.Since 1994, there has been no change in the threshold for secondary benefits, which now stands at €317. Because the threshold has not altered for ten years, there is downward pressure, which means that more and more people are flowing out of the system because they do not qualify. Those areas must be examined, otherwise people will end up with less and less.The income eligibility limit for medical cards should ensure that people in receipt of increases, such as invalidity or other allowances, are not denied medical cards. The eligibility limits, including income criteria, should be raised to ensure that all those who receive an increase will not lose their medical cards.I refer to the MABS service and the crèche supplement. We were promised by the Minister's predecessor that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would look after this matter. The Department of Social and Family Affairs probably thought that nothing had been done because the matter was fobbed off to another Department. The crèche supplement is critical in the context of facilitating people's participation in the workforce and ensuring they get such opportunities. The situation is similar with regard to the dietary supplement. An average loaf of bread may cost approximately €1.60 but a gluten-free loaf for someone who is a coeliac can cost €4.60 or €4.80. The supplement was important for such people, particularly those on low incomes who want to live normal lives yet require help due to the additional demands on their income caused by medical problems.The €700,000 supplement provided under the MABS service is a pure cop-out and it has not been reversed. MABS does not provide money but it provides important advice. However, the financial safety provided for thousands of people in debt has now gone. Some such people were in the grip of moneylenders and may have found that, following an assessment of their household income and expenditure, they were €25 or €30 short. That money was provided by community welfare officers. The sum of €700,000 is nothing — it concerns the examination of methods to avoid poverty, but MABS cannot solve the poverty issue. It is trying to help people to deal with their income shortfalls and has been doing so successfully. I compliment the representatives of MABS in that regard. They appeared before the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs and gave a wonderful presentation of their work. They were seeking improvements in the system, however.The Combat Poverty Agency suggested that MABS should provide SSIAs as part of its service for indebted households. In other words, if people are encouraged to accept a scheme under the MABS criteria whereby they can save €100 per year, why does the State not give them an additional €400 in the same way as well-off people receive money through SSIAs? Why can those who are most in need not be helped by such an innovative scheme, as proposed by the Combat Poverty Agency? It is incumbent upon the Minister to consider the advice of an independent agency that was established to advise the Government.The Society of St. Vincent de Paul spends €32 million annually to deal with poverty by providing food, clothing, furniture, fuel and cash. The society's expenditure is up 7.5% on last year.Before concluding I must speak about my favourite topic of carers, to which I have devoted much time. As chairperson of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I am appalled by the Minister's failure to deliver anything of significance to carers. I have received a news release from the Carers Association which is disgusted with the Government's failure to deliver on its pledge to support them. The association's news release states:It is vital that the needs of all family carers are recognised and that the necessary support structure be put in place through the development of an all-inclusive national strategy. The Government must formally recognise the extensive contribution made by family carers. A national strategy will contribute to improving the lot of a very vulnerable sector of society, ease pressure on the health service and, for minimal investment, lead to actual savings in the health budget.Hear, hear to that. The joint committee did a lot of work on this matter and produced a unanimous report. No consultants were involved, it was produced by Deputies and Senators. According to the statistics, 148,800 people are classified as carers, although the Minister is working on the basis that there are just 50,000 full-time carers. I have been informed by the association in Clare, Caring for Carers Ireland, that there are approximately 300,000 carers. That is because many people have not classified themselves as carers, even though they may work through the night to look after their infirm relatives. It is the human, compassionate and familial thing to do and all they want is recognition from the State for their efforts.For €220 million we could abolish all the form filling for the means test, which creates a barrier to people receiving a carer's allowance. The work of those carers is saving the State over €2 billion, so on a cost-benefit analysis they provide a nine to one return. The Government has been remiss by failing carers in this way. If the State paid them an allowance it would be but formal recognition of their contribution. The Minister has missed an opportunity to do so.I am glad to see the respite care grant has been extended but, while I acknowledge that increase, how will the Minister evaluate the 9,000 people concerned? The Minister thinks there are 48,000 carers, of which 14,000 or 15,000 are working while another 10,000 are working ten or 12 hours per week in the home. I know what the Minister is trying to do but it is the wrong way to go about it.The report by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended that half the rate of social welfare should apply for widows or widowers working as carers. Such carers should be entitled to receive a dual application of social welfare payments. The current system is artificial and should be abolished.When one contrasts the treatment of carers with that of high income earners, some of whom do not contribute tax revenue, it is clear that the Taoiseach's professed socialism is totally spurious. I hope the Minister will re-examine the position of carers who deserve no less.

This response outlined that, in 2001 the Government approved an extensive programme of civilianisation to be introduced on a phased basis over several years, which includes the posts to which the Deputy referred. The programme provided for the civilianisation of these posts in the short, medium and long term, the transfer of the finance function from Garda district clerks to civilian staff, and the transfer of civilian staff from the Department to the Garda Síochána as civil servants of the State. In addition, of the 1,024 clerical, administrative and services posts filled by civilians in the Garda Síochána, some 112 are district finance officer positions occupied by staff officers.The transfer of further civilian staff of the Department to the Garda Síochána is provided for in the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, which is before the Seanad, while the transfer of the finance function is almost complete. However, the next phase of the civilianisation programme, including the civilianisation of the posts to which the Deputy referred, must be rolled out within the confines of the Government decision of 4 December 2002 which placed a cap on numbers across the Civil Service and public service. As a matter of priority, the Department is undertaking a review with both the Department of Finance and Garda management as to how it will proceed further with Garda civilianisation in the context of the overall constraints of Civil Service and public service numbers.The Government has increased the strength of the Garda Síochána from fewer than 10,800 in 1997 to 11,750 by June 2002. We have since increased the strength of the force to a historical high of more than 12,200. As the Deputy knows, the Government has approved the Minister's proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with the commitment in this regard in An Agreed Programme for Government. On behalf of the Minister, I assure the House again that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties and will deal directly with front line, operational, high-visibility policing. In each of the next three years, there will be an intake of almost 1,100 new recruits. The advertisement campaign for this first tranche of 1,100 recruits was launched on Thursday, 25 November 2004. The 496 positions to which the Deputy referred have not yet been civilianised for the reasons I have outlined.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I am glad to have this honest response from the Minister of State. We hear continuously about the shortage of gardaí on patrol. We also hear repeated promises from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Reform, Deputy McDowell, regarding his commitment to provide extra gardaí. However, we have 496 gardaí sitting behind desks despite the promise made by this Government more than four years ago that they would be replaced by civilian staff and freed up for patrol duties. Not one of those gardaí is on the street. What explanation or excuse has the Government for treating the public and the Garda Síochána so disgracefully in this regard?More than four years ago, the Government accepted a report in which it was laid down and agreed that the concept behind the introduction of civilianisation was to allow for the relevant jobs to be done at a more economic cost and to free up gardaí for work more suited to their training and development while simultaneously increasing the operational capacity of the force. In the interim, resources have been wasted. A person can be trained to work behind a desk in a matter of weeks but it takes two years to train a garda.It is an absolute indictment of the Government that four years after that decision was trumpeted — before an election, of course — not a single one of those desk jobs has been filled by a civilian.Will the Government give a commitment which would allow those gardaí onto the streets now? I do not want to hear waffle about having gardaí on the streets in 2009. I am sick of hearing that from the Minister of State. I want gardaí on the streets by Christmas. It can be done if this decision is implemented. There are 500 extra gardaí waiting to go out on the streets if the Government and the Minister do as they committed to under the civilianisation programme.

Progress on this issue must take place within that framework.It is not true to insinuate that little progress has been made in this area. In 2001, the Government approved an extensive programme of civilianisation which will be introduced on a phased basis over a number of years. For example, the transfer of the finance function from Garda district clerks to civilians and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer are now almost complete following an internal competition. A total of 112 clerical officers throughout the Garda Síochána have been promoted to district finance officers at staff officer level. This has freed up Garda resources allowing gardaí to concentrate on policing matters. Some progress has been made on civilianisation. Nevertheless, the Government decision to cap civil and public service numbers had an effect on progress in this area in recent years.

I am stating absolutely baldly that no progress has been made.

Other transfers of civilian staff of the Department to the Garda Síochána are provided for in the Garda Síochána Bill currently before Seanad Éireann. The transfer of the finance function has been completed.In fairness to Deputy O'Keeffe, I suggested that he was insinuating that little progress has been made but if he is saying it baldly and flatly I am happy to accept that. The next phase of the civilianisation programme, relating to the posts identified by the Deputy, will have to be rolled out within the confines of the Government decision of December 2002, which places an overall cap on numbers across the civil and public service.

The two men who died paid the ultimate price in the service of their fellow citizens. Their sudden and untimely deaths are an example of the dangers each member of the Garda Síochána can face in the discharge of his or her daily duties. We should never forget this.Deputy Costello has raised questions relating to comments made in the High Curt by Mr. Justice Johnson about the vehicles involved. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a requirement to include airbags as standard has been part of the technical specifications for the supply of Garda vehicles since 2000. The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that it is difficult to estimate the exact number of those vehicles purchased before 2000 that have no airbags or side impact protection as some manufacturers were supplying these items prior to their being specified by An Garda Síochána. The vast majority of these are not front line emergency vehicles but utility vehicles such as vans and the like.Significant investment has taken place in the Garda fleet over the last few years. This has resulted in an increase in the size of the fleet from 1,898 vehicles at the end of 1997 to 2,076 vehicles at present. In addition, the Garda is currently arranging the purchase of a further 382 motor vehicles. Approximately 60 of these have already been received and are currently being fitted out. Other vehicles are arriving on a daily basis. This investment in new vehicles will maximise the safety of members of the Garda Síochána and members of the public in the variety of uses of Garda vehicles. Furthermore it will minimise maintenance costs and improve the re-sale value of Garda vehicles.The issue of safety is always uppermost in the Garda authorities' deliberations on the purchase of vehicles for the Garda fleet. Considerable research has been conducted by the Garda Síochána into the use of various types of vehicles in police forces worldwide and the Minister has been informed that there is little difference in general vehicle policy throughout police forces no matter what part of the world they operate in.There have been substantial improvements to vehicles, both in their design and construction, in recent years and in the level of equipment fitted to vehicles to bring them to operational standards. The conspicuity of Garda vehicles has been greatly improved both in quality and design. The technical specifications for the supply of vehicles for the Garda fleet have been rewritten to incorporate the highest possible safety standards for the particular class of vehicle. In particular, vehicles are specified with safety features such as ABS braking, driver and passenger airbags, power steering, central locking, electric windows, anti-shatter film to all glass which minimises the injury risk to occupants from shattered glass in the event of a collision and increased conspicuity. These items are specified for all vehicles and can contribute greatly to increased safety. The European new car assessment program, ENCAP, scores are carefully monitored for any tender competition to purchase vehicles. All vehicles purchased in future will be required to have a minimum of four stars in the ENCAP system.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseAs the Deputy is aware, the Select Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights met earlier this year to debate the 2004 Estimates for the Justice group of Votes and the issue of safety of Garda cars was raised. At that time the Minister informed the committee that the issue of safety of Garda cars was more complicated than one might think. The Minister further informed the committee that the Garda Commissioner had established a working group, which includes members of the GRA and AGSI, to examine the whole question of safety of Garda vehicles.The Minister has recently again written to the Commissioner on the matter and he has been informed that the working group is now due to report to the Commissioner before Christmas. It was previously to have reported by the end of August. The Minister has indicated that he will revert further to the select committee when those findings are available to him.

Of course, we offer them our condolences. In the last four years, eight gardaí were killed in vehicles in the line of duty. The judge in the recent case criticised the level of safety in those vehicles. This is what Mr. Justice Johnson said:It is not acceptable that young men who risk their lives every day to protect the ordinary citizens of this country should not be given the best equipment and training. We at least owe that to them.We will all agree with that. At its annual conference in April of this year, the Garda Representative Association made a very strong statement, which does not coincide with that made by the Minister of State. The GRA president, Mr. Dermot O'Donnell, said, "Garda cars currently in use——

He said Garda cars were no different from family saloon cars, apart from their livery. That does not suggest that protective measures, such as airbags, side impact systems and roll over protection mechanisms, have been installed.What is the situation in the Garda fleet of cars? Young men's lives are being put at risk. Ramming and joyriding is widespread, particularly in cities. In the last two years, €6 million was paid out in personal injury claims to gardaí who were injured in motor vehicle accidents.How is it that gardaí who are on the street at the most difficult hours, very often at night, and in difficult situations do not have proper protection mechanisms in their cars? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform showed a saving of €19.9 million in his Department's Estimates. Much of this saving was on equipment and machinery. Why was that money not spent on ensuring that gardaí could do their duty on behalf of the citizens in a safe and secure fashion?

At the time the Minister informed the committee that the issue of the safety of Garda cars was more complicated than one might think and that the Commissioner had established a working group, including members of the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors to consider the safety of Garda vehicles. The Minister again recently wrote to the Commissioner on the matter and was informed that the working group is due to report to the Commissioner before Christmas; previously it had been due to report by the end of August. The Minister has indicated that he will revert to the select committee when those findings are available.Deputy Costello very fairly asked about the condition of the Garda fleet regarding safety issues. While the Minister is responsible for providing money for investment in the Garda fleet, it is a matter for Garda management to decide upon the allocation of the vehicles. The need to allocate additional vehicles or reallocate vehicles is assessed by the Garda authorities on an ongoing basis. Factors such as population, crime and area are taken into consideration in the process of assessing vehicle allocation or the need for extra transport. As I outlined to the Deputy, the decision to include airbags as a safety device was made in 2000. The current profile of the Garda fleet is as follows——

The Commissioner is awaiting a report on this matter before Christmas. I had planned to give the profile of the Garda fleet to assist the Deputy. As of 30 November the fleet comprised 1,473 cars — including the ministerial fleet, 223 vans, 235 motorcycles, 88 four-by-four vehicles and 57 other vehicles. The average age of the fleet is approximately 2.9 years with 43.1% less than two years old and a further 30.6% are between two and four years old.

Coroners are engaged by relevant local authorities, which are responsible for all matters relating to the engagement and financing of the coroners' activities. Local hospital consultant pathologists in the main, provide post mortem services to the coroner, using the facilities of their local hospital, but outside of their hospital contract. The responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relates to the enactment of any necessary legislative provisions, the provision of legal advice and assistance, where required, and other operational issues.Currently, it is a matter for each coroner to make local arrangements with a pathologist for any post mortem examinations required. Following consideration of these arrangements, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has held discussions with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association with a view to effecting improvements in the provision of this service to coroners. Arising from these discussions, the Minister hopes to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future. In the interim period, the Department has made arrangements for the provision of post mortem services at weekends for counties Cavan and Monaghan.On a general point, Department officials are currently working on a new Bill to provide for a comprehensive reform of the coroner's service. The Minister proposes to publish this Bill by the end of March 2005.

I tabled the question, as Counties Cavan and Monaghan do not have a weekend post mortem service. In the event of a sudden death the body is brought to a hospital and becomes the possession of the coroner. More often than not these involve sudden and unexpected deaths of young people perhaps as a result of a car accident or suicide. I have received numerous representations on Friday evenings from parents seeking a post mortem examination to be carried out on their child. Particularly on a bank-holiday weekend, the stock answer they receive is that the post mortem examination will be performed on a Tuesday morning and the body would lie in a cold mortuary, as the family would describe it. They are thus unable to bring the body home to help with the grieving process. In all counties including Cavan and Monaghan we should have a seven-day-a-week post mortem service.

This is why the Minister took action on two fronts. First, he made arrangements to ensure a service at weekends in the Cavan-Monaghan area. Second, he has engaged with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association with a view to effecting improvements in the provision of services in each coroner's area. No problems with post mortem services at weekends in other parts of the country have been drawn to the attention of the Minister. He has engaged with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association with a view to ensuring improvements are made in each coroner's area.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot assist the Deputy in identifying the exact physical configuration of where the service will be provided in the Cavan-Monaghan area.

The Exchequer and the European Union Structural Funds fund the programme as part of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan. Initially €317 million of Exchequer and EU Structural Funds was made available to the programme over the life of the national development plan. The Government increased this to more than €436 million through an additional package of Exchequer funding and through interdepartmental transfers. In recognition of the many achievements of the programme up to December 2003, its funding was recently increased to €449.3 million following transfers of EU and Exchequer funding, based on recommendations made in the mid-term evaluations of the national development plan and its constituent operational programmes.The Government's commitment to the development of the child care sector has been reaffirmed by the Minister for Finance in last week's budget. The multi-annual capital envelopes announced that day include the injection of a further €90 million in capital funding into the programme over the five years from 2005 to 2009. This will mean an increase of €50 million in the availability of capital under the first phase of the programme, bringing the total funding for the programme to €499.3 million while the remaining tranche of additional capital funding will be spent under the next phase.The total funding committed under the programme up to the end of November 2004 is more than €266.8 million. Over 2,280 grants have been awarded to child care providers and community groups which will, when fully drawn down, lead to the creation of 31,973 new child care places and support 28,442 existing places.Since the inception of the programme, every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and to support capital developments in the private child care sector. Over 750 projects which have a strong focus on disadvantage have received staffing grant assistance. The programme makes staffing grant assistance available for a period of years, usually three years, to enable them to move towards self-sustainability which would normally be achieved when the service is operating at capacity and has introduced an fair and equitable fee structure.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseIn a number of services, the levels of disadvantage among parents are such that the families would be unable to pay economic fees and therefore a limited number of services are likely to require ongoing State support towards their staffing costs. My Department is reviewing the arrangements for the ongoing support of such services in very disadvantaged areas and plans to introduce new arrangements to support those very disadvantaged services which have already received three or more years of grant assistance, with effect from 1 September 2005.The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 is making significant amounts of public funding, including EU funding, available to child care groups. It is essential that the financial management of such funding meets the highest standards and as a result it has been necessary to put rigorous procedures in place to oversee this function. This can result in the decommitment of funding grants and the recoupment of grants in extreme cases.I am not aware of any significant closure of services as referred to by the Deputy. Each grant beneficiary has signed a contract with ADM Limited on behalf of my Department to maintain a service for a specific period of years, which varies with the size of the grant received. Again, a breach of this contract can lead to the recoupment of funding.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I do not dispute that a substantial sum is being made available for capital programmes. The problem is that when the facility is made available, the voluntary groups that are trying to run it find it difficult. In small towns and villages sums of up to €100,000 must be raised each year to top up the grants given by the Department. The staffing grants are totally inadequate and the entire programme is collapsing as a result. There is no point having fine buildings if the crèche facilities do not open and do not work on a guaranteed permanent basis. Will the Minister of State review the entire process because the current system is not working?Large centres are not getting crèches because community groups are not willing to take on the amount of voluntary work involved. There are large towns with no planned crèches and small villages with substantial crèche facilities because community and voluntary groups work harder in those villages. A review of the entire process is necessary. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is in breach of many European directives because one of the ways to encourage people back to work is to ensure there are proper crèche facilities in all communities.

This can normally be achieved when the service is operating at capacity and with a fair and equitable fee structure. The Department is reviewing the arrangements for the ongoing support of such services in very disadvantaged areas and plans to introduce new arrangements to support very disadvantages areas which have received three years or more of staffing grant assistance with effect from 1 September 2005. All groups that have received three or more years of staffing grant assistance or which will have received three or more years of staffing grant assistance before 31 August 2005 will receive their current level of staffing grant assistance until 31 August 2005 when the new arrangements to benefit the most disadvantaged services will be introduced.The Deputy referred to closures but from the perusal of files by ADM Limited, it is not aware of any group funded by the programme in Cork that is possibly closing or has closed other than that in Millstreet.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	252	The Government places a very high priority on putting in place measures aimed at tackling crimes of domestic violence and other crimes of violence against women. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, one of five Departments with responsibility in this area, is responsible for legislative initiatives; preventative measures that can be put in place, such as intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence; awareness raising measures aimed at changing society's attitude to domestic violence; and identifying and developing necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice systems.Moreover, the Department co-ordinates the work of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which is chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey. The national steering committee is comprised of representatives of the Departments with responsibility for this issue, the non-governmental organisations working on this issue, the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the probation and welfare service, health boards and the medical and legal professions.The number of incidents of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault reported to the Garda in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available, show a significant reduction when compared to the recorded incidents of these crimes in 2002. For example, in 2002 there were 10,248 reported incidents of domestic violence. In 92% of the cases, the complainant was female. In 2003, this fell to 8,452 or a reduction of 17.5% and in 93% of cases, the complainant was female. In the case of reported incidents of the heinous crime of rape, there was a reduction of 25.5% between 2002 and 2003. In the case of reported incidents of sexual assault, the number in 2002 was 1,626 and by 2003, this fell to 1,449. These reductions are a very welcome development but the Minister cautions against forming conclusive views on the basis of one year's figures.Provisional Garda figures for the period January to September of this year show a similar picture for sexual assault. These figures indicate a decrease of 25% compared to reported incidents in the same period in 2003.Rape, however, gives cause for concern. Provisional figures indicate that an additional 31 cases of rape were reported to the Garda between January and September 2004 compared to the same period in 2003.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on behalf of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, has conducted a number of awareness raising campaigns around the various aspects of violence against women in recent years. Recent awareness campaigns have included a poster campaign on domestic violence which was conducted in 2003 and a campaign in 2002 aimed at highlighting the dangers of drug assisted rape. This involved the development of a series of posters which were displayed in pubs, clubs and third level colleges around the country. Follow-up campaigns were undertaken in third level colleges in 2003 and 2004. In addition, the Department has provided funding to a number of rape crisis centres to deliver an awareness programme in schools in their locality.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe Department, in conjunction with the committee, is developing a national television and radio advertising campaign on domestic violence which will be conducted jointly with Northern Ireland in the new year.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has recently provided joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research, entitled The Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases, is being carried out by the department of law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and Rape Crisis Network Ireland. This research should provide a greater understanding of why some victims choose not to report cases to the Garda, what can be done about under-reporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing.The Garda Síochána has never been better resourced or equipped — this year its budget exceeds €1 billion and next year it will further increase to over €1.1 billion. The Garda Síochána thoroughly investigates all complaints of rape and ensures that victims are dealt with in a professional manner. It also monitors all incidents of domestic violence on a daily basis. Designated inspectors are allocated to each Garda division to ensure that the Garda domestic violence policy is implemented. This policy is currently being reviewed.In addition, all gardaí receive training on the investigation of cases of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. This training is provided by experienced Garda personnel assisted by other professionals, such as psychologists, doctors, social workers and experts from the various non-governmental organisations.There is close co-operation by the Garda Síochána with other organisations involved in this area, including non-governmental organisations. The Garda Síochána continues to make efforts to combat incidents of rape through education, increased awareness and enforcement of the relevant legislation. Recording systems for all domestic violence incidents are being integrated into the PULSE computer system and all of this will improve the overall monitoring of domestic violence cases.

Women's Aid has stated that there has been no increase in the funding for its services since 2002 and it was not happy with the recent budget. It was unable to deal with 52% of the increase in the number of calls it received last year. There were 15,717 calls to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre last year, a huge number, but no additional funding has been provided since 2002.Women's Aid protested outside the Dáil last week against domestic violence, highlighting that 107 women have been murdered in the past 108 months, 80% by someone known and 50% by a partner. The protest will continue until International Women's Day on 10 December.The Minister of State was selective with his figures. Sexual assault increased in the first nine months of 2004 by 40% and unlawful carnal knowledge increased by 173%, figures given by the Minister. There were 8,452 incidents of domestic violence in 2003 — 90% of the offenders were men — and 1,700 women and 2,889 children were accommodated in refuges for women escaping from the home because of violence. There were 1,083 who could not find a place in a refuge and because of the savage 16 cuts by the Department of Social and Family Affairs they were not entitled to get accommodation. I hope the Minister of State can assure the House that the nefarious cut has been rescinded because these are women and children who could not get into refuges due to the lack of accommodation and they could not apply for landlord accommodation as they had to be homeless for a period of six months. Will the Minister of State give an undertaking that funding will be granted over and above what has been provided to date? Women's Aid has stated that there has been no increase in funding since 2002. Is that accurate? Will the seven-day national free phone helpline that Women's Aid employs be adequately funded to deal with queries rather than being unable to deal with 52% of queries due to lack of resources?

It has established perpetrator programmes, sponsored research on issues of domestic violence and other forms of violence against women and conducts awareness campaigns. The Department provides a secretariat to the national steering committee. The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the provision of health and social services for the victims of violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault, through the relevant health boards. In the main, these services are provided by non-governmental organisations such as Women's Aid, the Rape Crisis Centre and the women's refuges. Funding for these bodies is not the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but that of his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children.Equally the whole question of rent supplement is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. There are distinct responsibilities in regard to this matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware of the need to reduce the incidence of this crime and has put specific measures in place to prevent or reduce the number of incidents of domestic violence.In recent years the Department has supported the establishment of a number of intervention programmes for perpetrators. These include Move Ireland, which operates 11 programmes nationally, the south-east domestic violence intervention project, which operates four programmes in the region, the national domestic violence intervention agency which operates on a pilot basis in the Dún Laoghaire and Bray District Court areas. The Department has arranged for all these programmes to be independently evaluated. It is hoped this evaluation will identify best practice for the operation of programmes for perpetrators and will lead to further improvements. The Department has arranged for a number of awareness raising campaigns on domestic violence with the national steering committee on violence against women. A television and radio advertising campaign is being developed and will be conducted jointly with Northern Ireland in the new year. I am glad to report some progress——

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The provisions relating to the establishment of the proposed Garda Síochána inspectorate have been published by way of official amendments to the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, Committee Stage of which commenced in the Seanad yesterday and continued today. The proposal to establish the inspectorate is being brought forward in light of the recently published report of the Morris tribunal and the questions arising from it relating to the need for measures to improve democratic accountability for the actions of the Garda Síochána.The main functions of the inspectorate will be to ensure that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Reform of the day will have independent objective information available to him or her in regard to the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána. The inspectorate will look at thematic policy issues with standards, practice and performance benchmarked to comparable international policing experiences. The key objectives will be to ensure and promote efficiency and effectiveness in the Garda Síochána and to provide advice to the Minister.The inspectorate will be able to conduct inspections and inquiries in two types of circumstances. The first will be as directed by the Minister, the second will be following consultations with the Minister. This latter provision is designed to allow the inspectorate on its own initiative to identify a particular area or areas which it feels should be examined and, following discussions on the point with the Minister, the Minister can agree that an inspection as recommended by the inspectorate should take place.There should be no confusion between the role of the inspectorate as outlined and that of the ombudsman commission. The primary function of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will be to investigate complaints by members of the public against members of the Garda Síochána and it will replace the existing Garda Síochána Complaints Board, established under the Garda Síochána Complaints Act 1986. The commission will have comprehensive powers of investigation to deal with complaints and it will have ultimate control and oversight of all complaints processed in accordance with the provisions of the Bill. It will also have the power to investigate of its own motion, without a complaint having to be made, any case involving the Garda Síochána where death or serious harm to a person has occurred, or where it is desirable in the public interest, any matter that appears to it to indicate that a member of the Garda Síochána may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	262	When I tabled the question no amendments had been published. I am pleased the Minister has got the legislation back in the Seanad given that it had been lying on the shelf for many months since its introduction in the Seanad. My concern is that the inspectorate is likely to be the eyes and ears of the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, in many ways, will take away from the role of the ombudsman. The ombudsman is an independent body. Can we take it that the new inspectorate proposed by the Minister will be an independent body along the same lines as the ombudsman commission or will one set of reporting go directly to the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and another through the ombudsman's office and, if so, how will the two integrate?I accept the Morris tribunal found a huge gap in reporting in regard to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am concerned that the body will report only to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will be a creature of the Minister and that Department and that we will not get full and proper reporting from it.

As I outlined in my reply, there should be no confusion between the role of the inspectorate, as envisaged in the amendment, and the role of the proposed ombudsman commission, which will stand within the four corners relating to its establishment. The ombudsman's primary function will be to deal with public complaints. It will have comprehensive powers to deal with such complaints, thereby ensuring that public confidence in the Garda Síochána is fostered and maintained. The legislation envisages that the inspectorate will be an entirely different office. It is not being designed to operate as some class of rottweiler to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is being established because a tribunal of inquiry, which has examined the matter, has suggested that it should be established.

It is clear that while the ombudsman will be independent, he or she will require ministerial sanction for certain actions.

I am worried that the establishment of the inspectorate, in the manner which is proposed, will increase the Minister's political control over the Garda. I know the amendment tabled by the Minister in the Seanad envisages a modest role for the Oireachtas, but I have suggested that the inspectorate should report to a security committee or a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I propose that the Oireachtas should have more control over the inspectorate, rather than it being directly controlled by the Minister. Does the Minister of State accept that the public is worried and public representatives are concerned about the present formulation of the proposal? My suggestion, that the Oireachtas should have a greater role, is one way of obviating such concerns.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Two issues arise from Deputy O'Keeffe's comments, the first of which relates to the legislation itself. It is clear that it would be more satisfactory to discuss these issues in the context of the legislation that will come before the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	268	We will have an opportunity to do so.

I share Deputy O'Keeffe's concerns in that regard. It is important that we ensure that the office is not the subject of any such doubt. The Deputy's second point was that the Oireachtas should be involved in the inspectorate in some way. The amendment tabled by the Minister in the Seanad contains an element that will ensure that the inspectorate will be accountable to the Oireachtas in some way.

The Minister is the political head of the Department. The set of checks and balances that has been carefully put in place must be observed. As a politician, the Minister will be publicly accountable to the House for the operations of the inspectorate. He will be able to ask it to investigate a particular matter. It is not clear to me that the involvement of the Houses would add to that.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is aware of the report in question. It is important to point out that it is unclear whether the figures in the report were compiled according to the strict legal definition of the offence of burglary, as is the case with the Garda figures, whether other household crimes were included, whether the figures relate to the company's clients only or whether the report takes account of the increase in the company's client base. While the report states that there has been an increase of 11.5% in the cost of burglaries to residential households, it claims that burglaries have decreased by 17.8% compared to the same 12 month period last year. It is important to clarify that the figures in question are not directly comparable to the statistics which the Garda publishes.The Garda supports and fosters a number of crime prevention measures which have direct value for householders. Like other community based schemes, the neighbourhood watch scheme which was established in 1985 by the Garda enlists the voluntary help of the community in co-operation with the Garda. Some 2,300 neighbourhood watch schemes, involving over 350,000 households, are in operation throughout the country. The scheme is organised by the community relations section of the Garda. The community alert programme, which is part funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in partnership with Muintir na Tíre, is an example of a similar partnership of relevance to rural communities. The programme, which consists of over 1,110 schemes and covers almost 250,000 homes, has particular reference to the security of older persons.The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that community gardaí are working in designated areas. Such gardaí meet representatives of local communities with a view to preventing and reducing the incidence of burglaries and anti-social behaviour. Policing plans in all areas are predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, and the maintenance of an environment that is conducive to improving the quality of life of residents. The strategy is and will continue to be central to the delivery of an effective policing service.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe House is aware that the National Crime Council has recommended the establishment of a national crime prevention model, including the recruitment of a dedicated crime prevention representative, and a sub-committee dedicated to tackling crime prevention, within city and county development boards. The council has also recommended that the implementation of the model should commence with a pilot scheme in three city and county development boards.The Garda Síochána Bill 2004, which was published by the Minister on 17 February last, includes provision for the establishment of joint policing committees by local authorities and the Garda Commissioner. It allows for the issuing of guidelines by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, about the establishment and maintenance of the committees. The guidelines may include provision for the establishment of committees within the framework of city and county development boards and for their funding.It is important that citizens should realise that the Garda Síochána is not and cannot be solely responsible for law enforcement in this jurisdiction. It relies on the ongoing and active support of the public to enable it to be at its most effective in its duties. Such support may involve the provision of information to the Garda by members of the public, or more general co-operation by members of the public with the Garda. All members of society have an active part to play in the fight against crime and a duty to do so.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The figures contained in the Eircom PhoneWatch report do not coincide with the figures published by the Garda Síochána. The Garda's reports contain the relevant figures for crimes which are reported to it. The figures published by Eircom PhoneWatch are more valuable and accurate because they are comparable to the figures contained in a household survey. The CSO's household survey, which was published earlier this year, showed that one in every 30 households has been burgled, that €58 million is taken every year, that Dublin is by far the most burgled area in Ireland and that goods and property worth approximately €3,600 are taken from homes during each burglary. Is there a case for asking the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to conduct a proper household survey on a regular basis so that we can acquire accurate figures for the number of burglaries which take place? Is it true that an inordinate proportion of the burglaries which are taking place at present is not reported? We do not get details of many of the goods which are stolen. Such crimes create a climate of fear among the residential population of the country.

People do not have to report burglaries if they do not want to do so.

We have quoted figures which are reported and figures which are unreported. It is a simple fact that there are 10,000 additional crimes per year, or an extra 200 crimes per week, compared to 1997 or 1998, when the current Government took office for the first time. I do not think the Government has acknowledged that people are afraid in their homes. People used to leave the door open many years ago, but seven years ago they started to leave the key in the door. Now they bring the key to bed with them to ensure that it is not left anywhere near the door. We are not facing the fact that people are afraid that their houses will be burgled. New initiatives and schemes are needed to tackle these problems.

The number of gardaí who carry arms on duty at any particular time is an operational matter for the Commissioner.The Minister has made it clear that he believes the traditional unarmed character of the Garda Síochána has always been one of its key strengths in maintaining its public reputation as an approachable force that polices by consent and not by fear. Any reasonable member of the public would want to see that tradition continued.Instruction governing the use of firearms and practical and tactical training is provided for each firearm on issue to the Garda Síochána. Members of the force must achieve the required score in qualifying shots and display the necessary skills and standards to meet the aims and objectives for each firearms course. There is also an ongoing annual recertification programme, which includes refresher training.The position on the use of firearms by members of the Garda Síochána is that members who successfully complete the relevant firearms training course are issued with a certificate of competency regarding the firearm in question. To carry a firearm on duty, a member's chief superintendent must issue him or her with a firearm authorisation card. Responsibility for the use of a firearm rests with the individual garda in accordance with the instructions.Whenever a firearm is produced or used in the course of duty, the officer in question is obliged submit immediately thereafter a report detailing the circumstances involved to the station that covers the area where the incident occurred or, if that station is closed, the district headquarters, and to the member's own station on his return.The Commissioner appointed a working group within the Garda Síochána, chaired by an assistant commissioner, to examine issues relating to the use of firearms in the force with particular reference to training. The Minister understands that some issues raised by this group are the subject of ongoing study. He will consider the outcome of this study in due course in consultation with the Commissioner.

Have any of the water cannons that were introduced during the EU Presidency been purchased by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for use?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	300	As I stated, the determination of the number of gardaí who carry arms while on duty at any given time is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner. The Minister and his Department do not comment on this.The decision on whether to introduce less-than-lethal weapons was made on the basis of a general Garda review of these types of devices carried out by the Garda authorities. The review was conducted by a working group on less-than-lethal weapons under the chairmanship of the assistant commissioner at the crime and security branch. The terms of reference included the examination of current practices and procedures for all circumstances; examination of the procedures in place in other jurisdictions; the gathering of information available on non-lethal methods currently available and the evaluation of same with regard to use by the Garda Síochána; making recommendations on all the implications for the Garda Síochána of making such non-lethal methods available for use by members of the force; and consideration of legislative changes that may be necessary. The working group attended international conferences on the subject, visited various agencies in Europe and the US and attended a number of live firearm demonstrations. The information gleaned from these visits is to be combined with that gleaned from additional test material before a final decision is made on the recommendation.

This policy has served us so well. However, I accept that some members of the force should be armed.I am given to understand that the training facilities available for the use of firearms leave much to be desired. A by-product of the closure of many of military posts is that less space is available for firing ranges and other training facilities. Does the Minister of State agree that those gardaí who carry arms require regular access to training facilities? If not, it is not wise to allow them to carry arms.

A reply has issued to the authority acknowledging receipt of the submission and indicating that the issues raised in it are under consideration.As the Deputy will be aware, I introduced the Disability Bill in this House on 4 November and I hope that Second Stage will be scheduled for continuation next week. More recently, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights held hearings on the Disability Bill with over 30 interest groups including the Equality Authority. The views of the authority are being examined in the context of further consideration of the Bill for Committee and subsequent Stages before this House.

That is not my intention.

Therefore, I do not accept that one should be compared with the other or one should try to emulate what has been achieved in the other.

#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I wish to share time with Deputies Connolly, Boyle and Crowe. I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Bill and, in doing so, will briefly refer to the budget as a whole. As an Opposition Member I may be expected to oppose. However I regard that approach to national policies to be too simplistic and a flag of convenience for a lazy Opposition. Credit should be given when it is due, as in the case of this budget.The question is who deserves the credit. It is due to the people who voted in the last local and European elections and told the Government parties that the days of voting for the old order, irrespective of policies and of delivery of services, is gone. The people have indicated what they want the Government to do and are prepared to use the only method open to them — the ballot box — to get that message across. The budget provisions make it clear that the Government has received that message. The most heartening aspect of the budget is the provision for disability services.The most heart-rending comment I heard when canvassing for the previous general election was the isolation and betrayal felt by people with disabilities and their guardians and carers. That feeling has festered and mushroomed for a long time under successive Governments. It is an indictment of the country that a Government that likes to present itself as caring would allow that situation continue for so long. It also crystallises the warped sense of priorities pursued in the name of the people by Governments over time. It is not necessary to declare oneself a socialist to have due regard for people who are less well off, to ensure that the weakest are protected and those regarded as having a weak voice are heard at the Cabinet table when decisions on the allocation of scarce resources are made. The people being deprived of their fair share in society are not interested in what label the Taoiseach or any Minister wishes to wear from one day to the next. Their only concern is that the people charged with running the country would treat everyone as equal and ensure that those who have most need are looked after.The lack of attention to child care in this budget is regrettable. The cost of child care places a great burden on working parents and is so great that for many it has become unaffordable. This budget does not give the required prominence to the issue which is one the Government needs to address as a priority. Carers provide a vital service to society in a loving, humane manner and save the Exchequer millions of euro each year. The Government needs to recognise this vital work in a more determined way. This is an urgent matter. The budget provisions bestow some increased allowances for carers and additional carers are taken into account.In the Taoiseach's pre-socialist days, the savage 16 social welfare cuts were introduced on the watch of the then presumably capitalist Taoiseach. I compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on having brought about a relaxation of those measures which clearly indicates his commitment to those who are less well off. I also congratulate the Minister on his recent appointment. On balance, the social welfare measures he has succeeded in incorporating into the budget are welcome, and they will to varying degrees, help improve people's lot. The Minister has shown himself prepared to listen to various views, having consulted the different interest groups to establish their views, and although there are many issues to attend to, his first few weeks in the Department have been positive.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	324	In contrast to my rather caustic references to the Social Welfare Bill last year, I concede that this year's Bill represents a modicum of ground regained after the previous cutbacks and stealth cuts. The Social Welfare Bill normally gives effect to the social welfare changes announced in the budget statement, which are usually calculated to ease the pain of those most deprived socially.How does it succeed in its task of bridging the poverty gap between the most disadvantaged and privileged in the community? One yardstick by which to measure the ongoing, cumulative effects of successive budgets on the lives of the poor, is the annual figures released by charitable and caring agencies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. In the past three years, despite a booming economy, calls to the society have quadrupled, and it has been required to spend €600,000 each week to relieve poverty and social exclusion. Its spending of more than €31 million snuffs out the Celtic tiger's cough.In far too many cases, those who felt it necessary to contact the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for help were not social welfare recipients but employees in lower-paid jobs. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul nowadays caters for people in low-paid jobs rather than the down-and-outs. Their low level of income renders them ineligible for any social welfare benefits. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance and medical cards are denied them. They are expected to shoulder the burden of a series of increases in the cost of living, since they qualify for nothing.I am pleased with the increases in social welfare benefits, which have received a greater welcome this year than previously. The increases of approximately 9% are considerably ahead of the rate of inflation, which should, in normal circumstances, represent a real improvement in living standards. However, the circumstances of the low-paid workers had fallen so far behind in recent years owing to the absolute torrent of stealth taxes and price increases that they were constantly playing catch-up and never quite getting there. Several price increases are in the pipeline and will consume a major proportion of the 9% improvement in payments to social welfare recipients. Electricity, telephone and transport price rises and accident and emergency charges will all have to be met from the budget increases.All those increases tend to leave the rate of inflation trailing far behind in their wake. Unfortunately, many people, especially at this time of year, are compelled to resort to the dubious services of money lenders. Money advice bureaux, or MABS, are most worthy of Government subvention, since they have traditionally performed a very valuable social service in providing positive advice to help rescue the most vulnerable from the clutches of money lenders. I welcomed the opening of a MABS office last week in Main Street, Castleblaney, which I attended. It is no longer seen as any shame to attend their offices for advice. People fall into poverty traps, and I encourage them to use the MABS, which provides a fantastic service.Last year we all bemoaned what have become known as the "savage 16" social welfare cuts that hit the weakest in society. I am happy to acknowledge that the Minister's modifications represent a slight row-back on nine of those cuts. It took courage, and it is a step in the right direction. The three-month reduction, from 15 months to 12, in qualifying periods certainly does not amount to a rescinding and barely eases the burden that families are required to carry. The main thrust of the cutbacks remains — the real cuts in relief schemes for the vulnerable. I would dearly love to be able to congratulate the Minister on removing them altogether. It was in the wake of last year's budget that most of those cuts were introduced, and there is no reason in the next few months, further adjustments could not be made to them. It happened last year, and I would certainly like to see it happen again.I welcome the respite grant increase, which will improve the position of almost 10,000 carers. A conservative estimate of carers' numbers is approximately 145,000, most of whom will not receive a penny from this year's budget provisions. I also welcome the removal of those on the minimum wage from the income tax net. Unfortunately, in 2005, when the next Sustaining Progress increase kicks in, they will swim right back into it. The income tax take continues to increase each year, showing that people moving out of and back into the tax net is a cosmetic exercise. Unemployment benefit has gone up by €14 per week, something that I also welcome. As Father Seán Healy has pointed out, there would have to be a crescendo of further increases in the next two years of €17 or €20 weekly to meet anti-poverty norms. It is also significant that it is the first time that Father Healy has acknowledged or welcomed a budget.For many parents with child care costs of more than €200 per week, there is no incentive for one partner to work. The budget has made some progress in giving such people a helping hand, and the Minister deserves some plaudits. However, I remind him that there is considerably more to do in the next two budgets if he is to aspire to the lofty aims contained in the joint programme for Government.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Before the Government drowns in a sea of self-congratulation, we must put this budget in the context of the preceding seven. The Combat Poverty Agency has conducted an analysis of all eight budgets, showing that the first five introduced by this Government were unashamedly in favour of the better-off in society. The sixth was neutral, and the seventh only marginally favoured the less well-off. The eighth budget introduced by this Government begins at last to claw back some of the damage caused by the Government when it comes to meeting the needs of the less well-off in society. The levels of increase only go so far towards meeting the commitments the Government entered into in Sustaining Progress. While welcome, the €14 increase in the lowest rates of social welfare benefit will necessitate the Government indulging in similar increases in the next two budgets to meet its commitment of giving social welfare recipients levels of income that are 30% of the average industrial wage, or 50% of average household incomes. Currently, the lowest and most common level of social welfare benefit is €148.80 per week, or IR£115 in old money. For one third of our population, that is what they must live on each week.There is therefore no smugness or sense of complacency to draw from these figures. The Government must catch up after the previous seven years in which it increased the distance for those people to reach even the average of most citizens today. We need a more honest debate about what social welfare is and what it is achieving for many citizens. The smoke and mirrors exercise in which the Government engaged is really frightening, and while the Minister himself is a somewhat late convert to the idea of social justice, we can only wish him well and accept what he says about his intentions.However, even in counteracting the damage done — the effects of the savage 16 cuts of November 2000 — an analysis would show that the Government is still being dishonest with those who depend on social welfare payments. There has been one full row-back on foot of a wide-ranging public campaign after the rightful opprobrium attached to the cut in the half-rate payment for widows. The Government entered into that commitment well before the budgetary process. If we go through the remaining 15 cuts, we see that many have not been changed at all, some are being amended slightly, and none has been restored to how it was before November 2003. That indicates the Government's real commitment.Let us take a few examples. There was a six-month qualifying factor for the back to education allowance. In November 2003, the Government changed that to 15 months. Now it is going back to 12 months, which is hardly much of a change. The transitional half-rate payment for lone parents was discontinued where earnings are in excess of €293 per week. In 2005, this measure is to be amended whereby recipients will receive the transitional half-rate payment for six months.In 2004, there was an increase in the threshold of the contribution recipients of supplementary rent allowance are expected to pay, in respect of which there has been no change. Supplementary welfare allowance is not payable to people in full-time employment. If one of a couple is in full-time employment, both are excluded form claiming rent or mortgage supplement. This measure has been referred to the social partners, but no change is proposed to it.The Government has partially recognised a group of people on the minimum income level in the budgetary process by removing them from the tax net. They constitute a new poor in our society, given the level of payment they receive and their outgoings in terms of cost of living plus an addition in terms of low levels of taxation, which undermines their basic level of pay. One need only reflect on the highest proportion in terms of what they contribute to the Exchequer as against those who have far higher incomes. We know from Revenue figures that people with an income in excess of €1 million avoid paying tax because of the existence of tax reliefs. The Government has missed an opportunity in this legislation to be creative and institute real reform. The increase in allowances coupled with removing wage earners from the tax net could have provided an opportunity to marry the social welfare and taxation systems.The Green Party has talked about the introduction of refundable tax credits, which would mean that those on the lowest income who receive a tax credit and do not take full advantage of it should be paid directly the amount of which they are not making use. Such tax credits would be easy to administer, particularly given that the alternative in terms of the Government's social welfare policy is the family income supplement. The Government has made great play of saying that its initiative in respect of family income supplement will introduce an extra 14,000 people into this net. However, that is nonsense. At present, barely 12,500 receive family income supplement. That number represents only 30% of those who are entitled to receive family income supplement. In reality, more than 40,000 should be receiving it. However, those people choose not to because of the existence of the bureaucracy that surrounds that payment and the social stigma attached to it. If the Government was to be more creative, it could introduce a new system of refundable tax credits that could address a worker's pay and entitlement at source and subsequently change what needs to be done in terms of tax payments.I will return to what the Government has not done to address the savage 16 pay cuts. The MABS supplement is not to be restored in its previous form. Additional money is to be given to the money advice and budgeting service, but as of yet we do not know how that money will be used or whether the proposed allocation is sufficient to meet existing needs.I am glad the Minister has joined us. The real gap in the legislation is in regard to provision for children, but I am not sure if it is one the Minister is prepared to close in the second Social Welfare Bill that we will discuss in the new year. We have a constitutional commitment to treat all children equally. The Government entered into specific commitments to child benefit payments, namely, that a payment rate was meant to be reached as of last year. That rate will not be reached this year. There is a vague promise that it might be reached next year. Taking account of the range of payments for supports for children, this is a disappointing budget and Bill. Child development allowances remain frozen for the 11th year in succession. The crèche supplement seems to have been brought in by a surreptitious back door method where the avenues open to people are more limited than they were in the past. People seem to have to jump through higher hoops to justify receiving a payment which, in the past, was necessary for lone parent mothers on low incomes to help them get into the workforce. If the Minister examines this area, he must accept that the Government has a great deal of work to do to make up its commitment to child care provision.I wish to refer to disability benefit payments for which the Minister has only partial responsibility. While this area represents this year's decentralisation in terms of the Minister for Finance's Department, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs needs to acknowledge that there are several areas in respect of which the Government has failed to say anything and failed to meet the needs of many involved in the disability movement. There has been no cost of disability payment or move towards a full-time care assistant programme which the Centre for Independent Living has requested. Having regard to the recommendations of the 1994 report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, there are many recommendations that have yet to be addressed, acted upon and given the necessary resources. Therefore, the Government must fail to take pride in that despite much of the resources that have been provided and promised over the next few years that there is much more to do in this area.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I will start by saying what a difference a day makes, not only budget day on 1 December, but election day on 11 June. As the Taoiseach admitted while the count wore on, Fianna Fáil lost seats right across the Twenty-six Counties and the party suffered its worst results since the 1920s — many of the political pundits talked in terms of Fianna Fáil having lost the election and Sinn Féin having won it.Since then, Fianna Fáil has embarked on a major soul-searching or PR exercise, depending on one's point of view, to rebrand itself and persuade people that the past seven years of budgets were an aberration and that the normal post-Inchydoney service can be resumed. The former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, has been sacrificed on the altar of political expediency and some of the more "let the market sort it out" Ministers have also been moved. However, while it might be a public relations exercise, it is one that has benefited in real and significant terms hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Their reward, it appears, for voting out Fianna Fáil councillors and MEPs was increased welfare support for them and their families.I welcome many aspects of the budget. Although it is not the U-turn I sought, it is certainly a step in the right direction. I draw attention to the increase in the minimum rate of unemployment assistance by €14 per week. It is substantially in excess of inflation and is welcome, if much belated, recognition by the Government that job creation alone is not the means to end poverty. The increase announced by the Minister will bring the minimum rate to €148.80. The Government committed itself under NAPS and again in Sustaining Progress to achieving a target of €150 a week by 2007. In his statement on 1 December, the Minister said the Government was on target to achieve this figure, but what exactly is the target? CORI estimates that by 2007 the equivalent of the 2002 figure of €150 will be €185.80, 30% of average industrial earnings. Is the definition of the target accepted by the Minister? If so, can we expect even larger increases in minimum employment assistance in the next two budget to close the gap?I would appreciate if the Minister would clarify exactly what figure we are talking about, by what formula he develops this figure and what constitutes the rate of €150 per week in 2002 terms for 2007? The worry is that rather than adjusting for inflation or for increased average earnings in this State, the figure of €150, unadjusted in any way, will be the projected target for 2007.The increases in child benefit to €141.60 will leave the Government well short of its target of €150 by 2005. It is worth reminding the House that this target for 2005 was only set when the Government broke its pledge to achieve that target by 2003. The figure of €150 for the lowest rate of child benefit has been twice promised and twice broken. Will there be an adjustment during this year? This limited increase in child benefit pales next to the Government's blanket refusal since 1994 to increase the child dependant allowance. The value of this allowance was reduced by approximately 30% in the ten years the Government refused to increase it. The explanation given by the Minister's predecessor for not increasing an allowance specifically targeted at alleviating the suffering of the children of some of the poorest households in Ireland was that any increases would be a disincentive to employment. Is this still the position of the Government and of the Minister opposite? If so, will he explain to the House how increases in unemployment assistance are not a disincentive to work while increases in the child dependant allowance are?Since this Government came to power in 1997 it has set about widening the gap between rich and poor with a determination and a commitment that would be inspiring to see if it was directed towards ending means-testing in respect of the carer's allowance or eliminating child poverty. This budget, described as a give-away budget by the media, continues the well-worn path of deepening and sustaining inequalities. As outlined by the new favourite Government economics analyst, Fr. Seán Healy:Budget 2005 has widened the rich-poor gap by €30.93 per week. The disposable income of single people who are long-term unemployed and those on €50,000 a year has widened by €16.93 a week (€883 a year) . . . The impact of this Budget on the take-home income of couples has been almost as striking. Couples who are long-term unemployed are €23.30 a week better off while a couple on €50,000 are €40.17 a week (i.e. €2,096 a year) better off ... The cumulative impact of the last seven budgets by this Government (since 1997) is to have widened the rich/poor gap by €310.93 a week (€16,224 a year).In his press statement of 1 December, the Minister said that closing the gap between those on lower incomes and those on higher incomes was a priority. Since this budget has widened that gap by €30.93 a week it is difficult to see how the Government's actions could be considered prioritisation.As a republican party Sinn Féin is committed to radical reform of our taxation system. The Government has made much of its reductions in tax payments over recent budgets but has ignored the reality that a slew of indirect taxes is damaging working families. Between stealth taxes and indirect taxes, the Government has caused 60% of the increase in the consumer price index in the past three years.I want to deal with one of those taxes in particular because of the fury it has aroused particularly in this city. According to a Combat Poverty Agency report published in November 2003, "Waste collection charges exclusively based on the ‘polluter pays' principle are inevitably regressive, posing a major burden for low-income households, especially those with children and other dependants." Between 1997 and 2003 waste collection charges grew by 223% over six years, far in excess of the rate of inflation. We have also seen increases in excess of 70% in the Dublin City area and 20% in Fingal.According to recent research from Trinity College 25% of patients with a specific medical problem do not attend a doctor for reasons of cost. The figure rises to 40% in the 20 to 29 age group. Increased charges in respect of rent, ESB, bus fares, food, medicines, license fees, hospital charges, all hit the worst off in our society hardest and the Government increases spending and claims there is no more money to increase it any further for the less well off. Some claim there is no alternative to the low-tax, low-spend, devil take the disadvantaged, laissez-faire system of economics in Ireland. It is this point that needs to be driven home and has been ignored in the coverage of this budget. There is an increase of almost 9% in social welfare expenditure. It is the largest amount ever spent on social welfare in the history of the State. I genuinely welcome that. However, we are now a richer society, one of the richest in Europe. We have new millionaires every day. Alongside that, we have increasingly more people living on credit and getting more and more into debt.I accept at face value what the Minister says. He met 30 lobby groups and made a commitment to roll up his sleeves and fight on behalf of the less well-off people in society. I welcome that. The Minister has a difficult job ahead of him. There is much to be done. Clearly the Minister has started to go in the right direction. We support certain changes that help the less well-off. Some of the measures in this budget certainly do that, but there is a weakness in the budget in the area of social housing, and people on social welfare are caught in a trap regarding accommodation. The Minister and others in the House know that.

I welcome the Minister to the House. I compliment him on his involvement in the budget.Fianna Fáil, the republican party, is committed to the needs of pensioners and has implemented the largest series of pensions increases in our history. It believes in delivering good pensions today and making sure they can still be afforded when today's workers retire. It is giving a clear commitment to achieving a basic social welfare pension of at least €200 per week by 2007. It is committed to protecting the National Pension Reserve Fund that it established to provide for long-term pension needs. When this Bill is enacted, the old age contributory pension will have been raised by more than 80% since 1997, and the old age non-contributory pension will be up by 93% as a result of the provisions of budget 2005 and this Bill.At the same time the Government has made major improvements in the area of non-cash benefits such as free telephone rental and electricity allowances, which are an important element of the support we provide for older people. By establishing the national pensions reserve fund, the Government has made sure that Ireland will be able to keep paying decent pensions even when the population ages significantly. It will continue to increase pensions ahead of the cost of living and ensure that pensioners keep up with the general income levels in the economy.The Government is committed to the continuing development of our pensions system to ensure that people can enjoy a happy and secure retirement. We have fewer older people on pensions than the rest of the EU. This is one of the reasons our level of social spending makes up a smaller proportion of our national income. However, Ireland could easily face the same problems as the EU. Our baby boom generation will reach retirement age in the 2030s and 2040s. This may well be combined with increases in life expectancy and a declining birth rate.Currently public service and social welfare pensions cost the Exchequer approximately 5% of GNP. Maintaining the present level of provision is expected to cost approximately 8% of GNP in 2026 and approximately 12.5% of GNP in 2056. There will, therefore, be a significant rise in the cost of pensions borne by the economy towards the middle of the century.A recent study of population projections published by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs showed that in 2001 there were approximately 430,000 people of pension age in Ireland and that this is estimated to rise to 673,000 in 2021 and to 1.2 million in 2056. At the end of May 2004, there were 202,710 people receiving an old age contributory or retirement pension and 85,877 receiving an old age non-contributory pension. An actuarial review of the social insurance fund projected that the number of recipients of old age contributory and retirement pensions will increase to 255,000 by 2011 and 321,000 by 2016.The increase will to some extent be balanced by a reduction in the number of people receiving an old age non-contributory pension. The numbers receiving this pension have declined by more than 20% in the past ten years which reflects the improved social insurance cover and increased labour force participation, particularly among women.The decline in the birth rate is relatively recent and this, coupled with the effects of high emigration for much of the period up to the 1990s, has resulted in Ireland having the lowest proportion of older people in the EU with 11.2% aged 65 and over compared with the current EU average of 16.1%. Ageing, therefore, presents the same challenge to Ireland in meeting growing pension costs as to other countries except that we have a longer period to prepare for its full impact. The population projections suggest that no special measures are immediately required. However, the Government is making preparations through the national pensions reserve fund to part-fund State pension costs from 2025.Pensions have been an important issue at EU level in recent years, which is not surprising given that challenges facing pension systems are more immediate for other member states. The EU has assessed national pension systems under the agreed objectives of adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation. In this regard, a joint European Commission and Council report published in 2003 considered that Ireland had made good progress in ensuring financial sustainability and adequacy of its pensions system. The report concluded our system appears to be, in broad terms, financially sustainable despite projected major increases in future pensions expenditure. This situation will be kept under review by the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and the Government.In April 2001 the Government established the national pensions reserve fund as a mechanism to ease the increased pension costs which the Exchequer will face. The fund involves setting aside funds, investing them and drawing them down in future when growth rates may be slower and the dependency burden increased. The fund will ease the Exchequer burden arising from our additional pension commitments to avoid sudden rises over short periods and to reduce this burden to a significantly lower level than it would otherwise be. The Government is committed by legislation to making a statutory payment of 1% of gross national product to the fund each year, which was €1.1 billion in 2003. In addition, the Government kick-started the fund by allocating €6.5 billion to it on its establishment. Already, some €10.5 billion has been set aside for long-term pension and social welfare costs by investment in the fund, which is growing.The fund was a new departure in the management of the public finances and introduces a new strategic, long-term element into budgetary planning. Its establishment shows that the Government recognises the importance of the pensions issue and has put in place a practical mechanism to deal with it. This is a remarkable provision for a Government that is forever being accused of only having its eye on the next election.I recently attended a meeting in London at which pensions were discussed. Ireland was lauded by all states represented for its initiative in setting aside 1% of GNP for the national pensions reserve fund. It was stated that we were the first EU country to do so.

The short-term attitude comes from those who want us to use the 1% of GNP being set aside for future pensions to fund badly-needed infrastructure projects now. I say to them that the key to our stewardship of the Government finances is that we are delivering both major increases in infrastructure spending and provision for pensions. I reject the idea that the fund should be raided every time there is a new project because this is the surest way of undermining our finances in the future. Short-term policies like this were exactly what got us into so much trouble in the 1980s when the politics of spend today and worry tomorrow caused mass unemployment and emigration.

This is a sensible level of expenditure because to borrow or spend more could risk inflationary pressures and put undue stress on capacity. The people can be sure that with Fianna Fáil in office, pensioners will be looked after today and in the future.
#DanWallace	unknown-#DanWallace-party	unknown-#DanWallace-dob	unknown-#DanWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on bringing forward his first Social Welfare Bill, which was welcomed throughout the community. I look forward to the two further Social Welfare Bills he will bring before the House in the coming years.Last week's budget was important for many in the State across all sectors of life and the changes outlined in taxation measures will benefit many. However, those who have most to gain from this innovative budget are those dependent on the State for income because a substantial increase in the rates of welfare entitlements will improve the quality of life for the most vulnerable in society.It is important to acknowledge that the reason we have so much scope to offer meaningful and telling increases in rates of payment is because of the strong performance of the economy. Commitments were made by the Government that the gains made by the State would be redistributed to ensure that all sectors of the community would benefit from the growing prosperity of our country. It is easy to take these increases for granted and be dismissive of them, as some Opposition Members have been. However, 1.5 million people will benefit directly from these entitlements weekly. They cater for those in a variety of different circumstances, and adults, children, pensioners, the unemployed and people with disabilities, both temporary and long-term, will all receive increased payments. However, the most important aspect of the recent announcement is that the average increase is over 8%, which far exceeds the rate of inflation.As legislators, we have all been lobbied by the many and various organisations which work to alleviate hardship among the less well off in society. The increases in the past six budgets are an acknowledgement of the role of these organisations in articulating the needs of their clients and ensuring ongoing improvements in the rates of payment to ensure the continuation of the aim of working towards narrowing the gap between rich and poor in society.When we consider the specifics, we can see the impact of the changes. I particularly welcome the increase of €12 per week to pensions, resulting in new rates of between €166 and €179 per week for pensioners. It is vital that we, as a society, continue to acknowledge the role played by our elderly citizens in building our society. When times were difficult and when we did not enjoy the prosperity that now exists, the foundations for this prosperity were laid by those who are now elderly working throughout the country in a variety of different sectors. They are entitled to everything they receive and it is only fitting that we should continue to work towards the commitment to raise their pensions to €200 per week before the end of the Government's period in office. I am glad we are on target to do so and that this commitment was made last week by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and also by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.Another sector of our community that continues to do Trojan work and is equally deserving of significant improvement in recognition of their contribution is carers. I am pleased that the budget recognises the important role of carers in our society. In particular, that it extends the availability of the respite care grant and increases it to €1,000 is an acknowledgement of this outstanding contribution.In homes throughout the country, people care for family members, the elderly and people with disabilities in a compassionate way. They do so in a way the State could never hope to match and they need our support for the difficult yet worthwhile work which benefits society. The extension of the respite grant is a beginning in acknowledging this work and I welcome that the Minister intends to carry out an in-house review of the carer's payment in an effort to further improve the situation. This is a priority of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, of which I am a member.Undoubtedly, the aspect of the budget which received widespread approval and was long awaited was the commitment to improve services for people with disabilities. Obviously, many of those improvements within the €900 million package over the next couple of years will be interlinked with social welfare measures to improve the situation for people with disabilities. I am aware that the Minister is very conscious of his responsibility in this area and I know that whatever changes are required to ensure a more equitable system will be introduced.One of the key supports offered to people on social welfare is the rent supplement which is payable under the supplementary welfare scheme. This area has received much comment in recent months. I agree with the Minister that the solution for many people is long-term social housing and every encouragement needs to be given to ensure people, who are currently on rent supplement on a long-term basis, can access social housing through local authorities. However, it is fair to say that hardship was experienced by people because of the six month rule. I welcome the fact that the Minister has acknowledged that some changes are needed in this area and has agreed to address that point.One area which had been creating much anxiety among social welfare recipients in recent months was that SSIA savings would impact on the value of pensions. I am pleased the Minister has agreed to increase the means test disregard in respect of savings from €12,694 to €20,000. This is a significant measure as it means people can now continue to save and avail of the full maturity value of their SSIA without being concerned about the impact on their benefits. This measure will provide peace of mind for people who have had the foresight to commit resources to savings to ensure they have a nest egg to cater for future eventualities. It would have been very unfair to have penalised people for making an effort to save money from their own limited resources and I am glad the Minister has acknowledged this fact and expanded the threshold.In regard to the family income supplement, I appeal to the Minister to give more attention to making people aware of their entitlement. I congratulate the Department which is excellent in regard to making people aware of their entitlements. However, this is one area which has caused concern. There are many people who could avail of family income supplement if they were made aware of it, so I make a special appeal to the Minister in this regard.This is a particularly good budget for people on social welfare because it acknowledges the importance of providing regular increases in benefit for people who are dependent on the State for their income. In any budget, there are competing demands for resources and different sectors of the community have different priorities. Those who will always have a great claim on support are those who are most vulnerable in our society and I am glad that in this budget the Government has acknowledged the claim of those people and responded to their needs by providing real and telling increases. There is no doubt that these measures will make a significant impact on poverty and will directly benefit the lives of many people. I am pleased to support them. There are many other aspects of the Social Welfare Bill to which I would like to refer but time constraints do not allow me to do so. Again, I congratulate the Minister.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I am delighted to speak on the Social Welfare Bill. I am glad the people spoke very loudly at the June local elections when they said to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that they had done a job on the poor and looked after the rich. What was done in this budget was a response to the local elections. There were generous increases in social welfare. Why would there not be since last year when there was a threat of a downturn in the economy, the first people to be targeted were the weak and the poor? When the previous Minister needed to save money, we saw the savage 16 cuts. The people were sick and tired of the super rich having tax breaks and the poor being crucified on a weekly basis by stealth taxes. The people spoke at the local elections and the Minister responded.A promise was made by the previous Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, in 2003 to the women of this country. He told them that over a three year period, there would be major increases in child benefit. Even with the increases this year, that promise has not been honoured by the Government. I know the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech that next year and the one after, he would look at it. However, when one makes a promise, it should be honoured. That is one promise which has been broken.I was pleased to see the €14 increase in social welfare because people living on social welfare were experiencing difficulties. In the past year, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other charitable organisations and health boards have seen many people looking for help and support. For the first time in many years, they found that people were finding it more difficult to live on social welfare payments. It was the first time in many years that both the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and health boards were put under pressure as people were not able to live on what they were getting simply because of stealth taxes.I do not know how inflation is calculated, but the people who do so are a bit like the spin doctors in Fianna Fáil in that they can spin it out. I suspect they get a basket, put 100 items into it, including three holidays per year and two cars per household, and then calculate inflation. Listening to people who shop on a regular basis, there is no doubt that food and other costs show rip-off Ireland at its best. We were told the greatest thing to happen to this country was electricity regulation and we appointed a regulator, yet on three different occasions last year, the ESB got an increase which affected the poor.I want the Minister to write to county councils to tell them they can only take a percentage of the increases he has given people. There is no point in the Minister giving people a €14 increase if the county councils take €7 or €8 from them. That defeats the purpose of the increase. I ask the Minister to ensure people are protected against that.There was spin in the past few weeks about medical cards. I welcome the change because it is the one issue I have raised continually in my constituency and in this House. There is no point giving people an increase of €14 in social welfare if the social welfare officer tells them they are over the income limit. Such people must be protected.There are three rates of child dependant allowance. While I know the Minister is only new in the job, previous Ministers in the past ten years have failed in regard to the three rates. All children are equal and there should not be three different rates of €21.60, €19.30 and €16.80. None of these rates has changed in the past ten years, yet every report from the State agencies on poverty states that the best way to tackle poverty is to give money by way of the child benefit or the child dependant allowance because it is targeted at children, is given to the mother and is spent on the family. This matter should be addressed.This year I thought the €16.80 rate would have been increased to €19.30 and that next year, all the rates would be the same following an increase. The rates have not increased in ten years which is wrong and should be addressed. When the Minister is undertaking a review in his Department, I ask him to look at those rates. I know the Department will find excuses as to why it should not be done. It is wrong that there are three rates and that we discriminate against families and children.An issue I have raised every year which most aggravates people who pay their dues, PRSI and stamps and who are on short-term payments is their failure to get the Christmas bonus.If a man or a woman works seasonally, for nine or ten months of the year, he or she will not receive a Christmas bonus even though he or she contributes to the social insurance fund. The long-term unemployed get the bonus, however. I have sought that bonus for seasonal workers for a long time. If some people are on short-term or seasonal work, through no fault of their own, it is wrong and mean not to qualify them for the Christmas bonus. The Minister should examine the matter, particularly as the social insurance fund is currently in credit. There has never been as much money in the fund as there is now. It is the people's money; they have contributed to it so we should look after them by giving them the Christmas bonus.I am delighted the Government has given a commitment to increase the old age pension. Those who preceded us helped to establish this State. They worked in difficult times on low incomes and did their best to raise their families. They expect to be looked after when they reach pensionable age. We will be judged on how we looked after the elderly because we will be expecting the younger generation to look after us in time. If we do not care for the elderly who made major sacrifices for this State, how can we expect younger people to look after us in years to come?I was delighted the Minister gave pensioners an extra €12 but I was disappointed they did not receive €14, as others did. Why did the Minister keep back €2 from the pensioners while other payments were increased by €14? There should have been an increase of €14 across the board and I am disappointed that did not happen. Pensioners were delighted with the increase but they are confused because others got a €14 rise.I have listened to the Government's spin on the amount of money paid out in pensions. A great deal of money is paid out in pensions but when I tabled a question on this matter in September I was amazed to discover that €170 million in State pensions is being paid to people outside the country. These people are entitled to every penny of it because they have paid their contributions to the State over the years. Spin doctors have been spelling out how much is spent on social welfare but €170 million must be deducted from that because it is going abroad.On the other hand, returned emigrants are treated in the meanest fashion by the social welfare system. People who have worked abroad may be on a contributory pension from England or America when they retire here. If they do not have a full pension, they may apply to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the remainder. However, the way their sterling pension exchange rate is calculated is outrageous. It is a great deal less than one would obtain from a bank, so the Minister should examine the matter. The system of calculation aggravates people who have worked abroad, many of whom left Ireland when there was no work for them here. They were forced to leave the country and make a living overseas. Having returned home, they may now have three-quarters of a pension and will depend on the State to make up the remainder. However, when social welfare officials examine the situation they calculate the sterling-euro exchange rate in favour of the State, not the pensioner.Although the euro has been a strong currency in recent times, when sterling was weak the Government did not throw money at returned emigrants living on British pensions. The current method of calculating the pension top-up upsets people who worked abroad and now live on foreign pensions. It is wrong to penalise them in this way.I want the Minister to clarify the situation regarding the respite grant for carers. I was glad to see the €14 increase for carers but while there are approximately 170,000 carers, only 22,000 receive the allowance. Some 19,000 get the full allowance, 3,000 get a partial payment and the remainder do not receive anything. In his reply, the Minister might explain what he means by the respite grant. Those in receipt of a full or partial carer's allowance will get a respite grant. However, the Minister says that a further 9,000 will get a respite grant. Does that apply where the State says a person is in need of full-time care but because of means will not receive any payment from the Government? In what way does it work? This is a difficult issue to handle. For example, how do people know if they are eligible for a respite grant? They may not have made an application because they thought their spouse's income would put them over the eligibility threshold. How will they be assessed? Will there be a special application process for such people who are looking after their loved ones? How will the Minister proceed in this regard? He may respond to this point when he is winding up the debate because I am interested to see how the system will work. I am glad, however, that some carers will get the respite grant because, at least, it is a step towards recognising the excellent job they do.Carers are the forgotten people. They look after their loved ones but receive no financial help despite saving the State a fortune. The matter has not yet been sorted out, although the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children is talking about bringing the necessary legislation before the House. I hope the elderly will be protected. Under no circumstances should any legislation come before the House that would prevent that from happening. It is clear that if a person is in need of full-time care and has a medical card, the State is legally obliged to look after him or her. I do not want to see any change in that situation.There is a change of attitude in the country. People have told me that when their loved ones go into a hospital or nursing home the first thing they are asked to fill out is a subvention form. That is putting pressure on the elderly. Some people accept treatment or have their loved ones treated in the private sector but others feel they are being forced into it. Such pressure is wrong and should be resisted. I hope no party in the House — I include the Fianna Fáil backbenchers in this — will allow a Bill to come before us that does not protect the elderly. It would be a sad situation if that happened.Previous speakers have referred to those on low incomes who avail of the family income supplement. Over the years, Fine Gael has asked for this supplement to be dealt with through the taxation code. If somebody is entitled to the FIS they should be notified by the Revenue Commissioners, rather than having to apply for it through the social welfare system. In that way, such people would receive a top-up to increase their income to the requisite level. The problem, however, is that many people do not know about the family income supplement. In addition, they are embarrassed to seek it because they feel that since they are working they do not want to be in receipt of a social welfare payment.Deputy Dennehy should not smile at my remarks because that is the way it is. People have pride and independence when they are working so they do not want to receive a social welfare payment. Those on low incomes should at least be told that the FIS is available. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has failed to sell the family income supplement to those who are eligible for it. The record shows that the FIS should be taken up by thousands more people but is not, because they are unaware of it or do not fully understand their entitlements. Obviously, they have not received the necessary information about the family income supplement.I am glad the Minister has reconsidered the so-called savage 16 welfare cuts. I have repeatedly raised the issue of the restrictions in the back to education scheme. Deputy Stanton observed earlier that the objective of this scheme was to assist people in escaping the social welfare trap and attaining a better future through education. Under last year's cuts, the timeframe for this scheme was changed from six to 15 months. The Minister has brought it back to 12 months but that is not enough. There should be no restriction in accessing this scheme. It is unacceptable that there should be obstacles in the way of a person on social welfare for five or six months who wishes to improve his or her situation through education.This scheme is of benefit to the State. A person who secures an education and subsequently a job will contribute to the State. Will the Minister reconsider this issue? He might take the opportunity on Committee Stage to reset the provisions of the scheme to include a timeframe of six rather than 12 months. The latter is not reasonable because it allows people to get into a rut. A report published many years ago confirmed the benefits of allowing social welfare recipients to return to education as quickly as possible. This is something the Minister must consider. The increase from six to 12 months has a significant negative impact.The change to the rent supplement scheme was another of the savage 16 cuts that caused many difficulties. I am glad this cutback has been revoked and am interested to learn the new guidelines for its implementation. I also welcome the Minister's decision in regard to the crèche supplement, an issue I have raised on many occasions. The Bill proves that the Minister has done well in his negotiations with the Minister for Finance. I welcome that he targeted resources at those who needed them most. However, these provisions represent only the beginning of what is required. They relate to the welfare of people who have fallen behind over recent years.There is one other group I must mention on pain of reprimand from my mother. Upon assuming his new departmental responsibilities, the Minister stated that his priority was the welfare of widows. However, the latter continue to be the forgotten people in this State and have been let down once again in the budget. The Minister must do something to improve the welfare of widows who constitute the one section of society that has been neglected in successive budgets. I have seen the hardship experienced by widows, young women especially, who have lost the entire household income. Widows should be entitled to avail of free schemes, including those relating to travel, telephone and rent.The priority for next year's budget must be the extension of all such free schemes to widows, regardless of age. I was looking forward to such a provision in this year's budget but was disappointed in my expectation that the Minister would be the first to look after the welfare of widows. I am depending on him to do so next year. I do not want the widows of Ireland to put a curse on the Minister.

In previous years at budget time, there have been references to Budget Choices, the policy briefing document from CORI which outlines its analysis of the current year's budget. It is notable that this document has not been produced this year. Every critical comment regarding the budget has referred to the observations of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.

For the past four years, Opposition Members have pointed to the annual reports from CORI and highlighted various sections. I am delighted with this budget, as I am sure are almost all Members. I have already observed that the shutters were pulled down on last Wednesday's budget debate at 8 p.m. This is an unprecedented and welcome development.Deputy Boyle quoted from the Combat Poverty Agency's report this year rather than that of CORI which he has been used to reference. I am unsure as to what such terms as "smugness" and "smoke and mirrors" refer but this type of parliamentary language does nothing to facilitate a discussion of the difficulties experienced by people. I am unhappy with Deputy Boyle's contribution in this regard.An issue referred to by Deputy Ring was also raised by Deputy Rabbitte, the leader of the Labour party, yesterday. This is the issue of pensions for people who made contributions prior to 1953 and who had to leave Ireland, an issue with which I have been involved for many years. I am annoyed by the comments of Deputies Ring and Rabbitte because for years there was a refusal by any Minister to accept that such people should be in receipt of benefits. They were not entitled to such as an automatic right, as claimed by Deputy Rabbitte yesterday.This raises questions as to the consistency and sincerity of he Opposition. Both Fine Gael and Labour Deputies have complained and wept crocodile tears in this Chamber for those people abroad. However, in the past six months, these same Members have questioned in the Committee of Public Accounts the amount of money spent on such benefits. Deputy Ring has given slightly inaccurate figures in this matter. The sum for 2004 is not €170 million but €130.2 million.

Another incorrect figure was that relating to the amount of money leaving the country. Some 67% is sent abroad while the remaining 33% is allocated to old age pensioners in this country.I have been aggrieved by this issue for many years. However, my first concern was for Irish pensioners who were receiving inadequate support. This was, therefore, a significant decision. Opposition Members should raise the issue with their party leaders or party representatives on the Committee of Public Accounts and stop criticising the measure in the House. This is money well spent, as outlined clearly by Deputy Ring. It is given to those who need it. This year's figure of €130.2 million represents an increased allocation from last year's €117.4 million. Of that, some 52% goes to the UK, 8% to the US, 4% to Canada, 2% to Australia and the remainder to Argentina and other areas. The recipients of this allocation are people who worked in Ireland and were forced to emigrate. I had to do the same but was fortunate to be able to return.A gesture such as this should not be manipulated for political purposes, as has been done in the Committee of Public Accounts in an attempt to denigrate the Minister.

#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	345	The number of people receiving that benefit is 28,277. There is a level of hypocrisy about this issue. Deputy Rabbitte claimed yesterday that it was a right of these people to receive such a benefit. It was not a right. The Labour Minister for Finance in the so-called rainbow coalition refused to recognise pre-1953 contributions that did not include a contribution for pension. This was the argument in regard to this issue for years.Deputy Ring was scathing in his contention that people would not be willing to apply for family income supplement.That is ludicrous. I agree that a number of people are not aware of the payment. I send a newsletter to my constituents four times a year and I always include information about their right to FIS. This payment arose from the belief among social welfare recipients that it was not worth their while working because they were better off staying at home and drawing unemployment benefit or allowance. The payment has been raised to €39 per week. That might not mean much to Deputy Ring or people like him but it is a substantial amount for a person on a low income. It is a marvellous scheme. Its principal drawback is that people are not aware of it but we continue to try to overcome that. Fianna Fáil public representatives are, of course, in touch with more of the less well-off people than others so we are getting the message across to as many of them as possible.When the special savings incentive scheme was introduced the Minister for Finance was accused of catering for millionaires and it was said that wealthy people would cream money from the poor. Lo and behold, the Opposition is now concerned that participants in the scheme might lose their medical cards. We have gone from one extreme to the other.

The Minister has raised the amount of write-off. He has moved quickly in anticipation of a problem, as a good Minister should, and has dealt with it. I welcome that.As a former chairman of a health board, my priority is the needs of people with disabilities and of carers. I am glad about what the Minister has done in regard to the respite grant. I understood Deputy Ring to say he did not know what it was. I will explain it to him if he wishes. The grant has been raised to €1,000 and 10,000 additional carers will be catered for. We must continue to drive on that issue. It is reckoned that there are 150,000 carers but I believe that count was done four or five years ago. I suggest the number has gone up since then. Because of the demographic make-up of the population it is certain that the number will continue to rise. We must identify carers as a priority and continue to work for them. There is always a danger that a carer will become a patient and a client of the State. In many cases one elderly person is looking after another.The Minister has a huge commitment in this area and I urge him to keep up that good work. I am not surprised by his interest in social welfare. I have worked with him in other areas and I have seen his commitment. He has a track record of being elected by a large vote and one does not get that kind of support without a huge commitment to people. I say, "Well done and keep up the good work". I wish the Minister well and I commend the Bill to the House.

He has served his community extremely well. I am loath to say that the people at the end of my constituency which used to be represented by the Minister will miss him, but I will look after them to the best of my ability. I also have contact with the Minister in my role as secretary of the Fianna Fáil social and family affairs policy group and as a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. I have seen the Minister at work over the past ten weeks, getting to grips with his brief effectively and quickly. Members on both sides of the House have been impressed by the fact that he listens to what we say to him and is very responsive. If one cuts through the spin to which Deputy Ring constantly refers — there seems to be more spin on the Opposition side than on the Government benches — one sees that the Minister is delivering. Last week, the Evening Herald, which could never be accused of being a supporter of Fianna Fáil, listed the achievements of the Minister and commented, “All in all, a good budget”. Opposition spinning impresses no one.

Despite the progress, issues remain to be dealt with, particularly with regard to carers. Carers do a great job. On the work of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, which is under the able chairmanship of Deputy Penrose, the Minister knows we have a particular policy in that regard. We are happy with the progress made and with the announcement made in the budget and confirmed since. We must support the Minister in doing even more for carers.In Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and Brittas, the areas I represent, people are talking to me about the need for the Government to support child care initiatives. I hope the Minister will continue to do that — I know he will.I support my colleague, Deputy Dennehy. I am also a returned emigrant and I am glad I came home. My grandfather and father before me were both forced to emigrate. I understand the issue Deputy Dennehy has highlighted and I am supportive of it. I am a keen supporter of the concept of looking after the Irish abroad and those who come home in their later years. During last night's debate on overseas development aid I referred to the question of returned missionaries and their social welfare entitlements. We must help people who have served the country in various ways.The budget aims to eradicate poverty, remove inequality and encourage social inclusion. It is important that we support those aims. Like my predecessor, Chris Flood, I have been keen to support social inclusion policies in my work in Dublin South-West, particularly in the Tallaght end of my constituency. The Minister has always been supportive of that work. On a number of recent occasions we raised social inclusion issues arising from the west Tallaght report and it is important that we continue to do that.I do not normally become involved in fighting other political parties toe to toe, but I would like to make some comments on Sinn Féin policies. I have been watching television, as other colleagues have, and I am happy with progress in Northern Ireland and am sorry the recent efforts have not gone all the way. The Taoiseach has done a tremendous job in this regard. I criticise Sinn Féin's tax and spend policies, which I have heard people in my constituency describe as dangerous and misguided.The party's members are obviously not listening to what the Minister said in his budget announcement. The Bill provides for a €12 increase in pensions and a €14 increase in benefits to come into force on 1 January. I note that Sinn Féin's stated objective in this regard is to see Irish social spending increase to reach "at least the EU average". While this is clearly well intentioned, it is a fundamentally misguided objective. For many reasons, such as low unemployment and our young population, we have no cause to increase social spending to such a high proportion of our national income.Social welfare expenditure has doubled in the past seven years at a time when unemployment has halved in all constituencies. Benefits, pensions and assistance have all increased at a rate significantly ahead of inflation and have kept up with earnings. To increase social welfare expenditure to 27% of gross domestic product, which is the European average, would mean an increase in spending of at least €12 billion. I have heard people say this is madness, and it is. It would mean having to more than double income tax. Sinn Féin will protest that it has no intention of raising income taxes and would hike taxes on capital and corporations. If that were to happen, obviously capital and corporations would simply leave the country, leaving no alternative but to tax incomes, which would have plummeted. This would be the reality of Sinn Féin's ghetto economics and everyone would lose. The country would be bankrupt. The spectre of emigration would return. It would be a national nightmare.The Government led by Fianna Fáil with our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats has made great progress on social inclusion. We have halved unemployment, doubled expenditure and taken hundreds of thousands of the lower paid out of the tax net. We have introduced the minimum wage and this year's budget exempts those earning the minimum wage from payment of any income tax. Fianna Fáil has delivered real progress with our low tax social partnership model. I do not claim that the agenda is complete; we have more work to do. However, I believe our policies will move us forward and will afford opportunities to all.To give some credit to Sinn Féin, I heard its spokesperson say on the national airwaves this was one budget with two more to go, as is the case. Clearly the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is following his programme in that regard. Earlier I said it was important to understand what the Minister is trying to achieve. He certainly has my strong support as well as that of my colleagues. The Minister can wipe away all the hype, forget the spin and should understand he is on the right track. I hope he keeps going that way and I wish him every success in that regard. I commend the Bill to the House.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	357	This is my first time to speak when the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is in the Chamber and I congratulate him on his appointment. I welcome that increases have been made in many areas of social welfare. However, with such a booming economy, we would expect that at least. Those in need should be looked after. I appreciate the Government's change of heart. Inchydoney is a very nice place to have such a change of heart. Many of those who will benefit from the budget will never have a chance to go there. Fianna Fáil rethought its strategy and those on minimum social welfare benefit received an increase.These people should enjoy it when they get it. If last year is anything to go by, through no fault of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs but through the failure of other Ministers to get proper budgets for local authorities, other charges will very quickly take the shine off the €14 increase. Having spoken to two county managers recently, I am aware of the pressure they are experiencing. They will be looking for increased charges for services, including waste collection and rent. The Government must seriously consider the level of increases permitted in rents for elderly people and those on low incomes. There is no point in granting increases in social welfare only to allow them be taken back very quickly in service charges, rent etc.I obviously welcome the proposals to address the area of disability, on which I have frequently spoken since being elected to this House 12 years ago. We need to ensure that those with a handicap either since birth or through accident receive every possible assistance the State can afford. We will watch progress on those proposals with interest and those on this side of the House will hold the Government accountable to ensure the announcements become real benefits for those with disabilities.I welcome the appointment of the Minister to this portfolio. While I had considerable time for his predecessor in many ways, I never understood how she allowed herself to be forced into a corner whereby she had to implement the 16 cuts in last year's budget. While one of those affecting widows and widowers was rectified, many others were not. The Minister has tinkered with some of these areas and he has made some improvements. Some changes need clarification and are subject to further discussion. I wish to mention two critical areas.The Minister has gone half way towards rectifying the damage done to the back to education allowance. Many people can get themselves out of economic and social difficulty by returning to education. I recently attended a MIFET graduation in Monaghan town where it was fantastic to see the number of people who went back to education and got on the ladder towards a job. While the Minister has taken the first step towards rectifying the damage done by that cut, he should consider further action.The dietary allowance, which represents a small amount in budgetary terms, has also been amended. Such cuts affecting the most vulnerable are unfair. Those in need of the dietary allowance often also have other problems and need considerable help owing to their sickness. When last year's cut, which saved the Exchequer €55 million, is compared with the mess over electronic voting which cost €55 million, it shows how unjustified it was.As a member until recently of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I spent a considerable amount of time dealing with carers. The committee compiled a report emphasising vital changes in support from Government that needed to be made to assist the elderly and disabled. We have seen some changes, which I welcome. The annual respite care grant has been increased from €835 to €1,000 and will also be given to others. The Minister claimed it has been given to all carers.Will the Minister tell us how he came up with the figure that 9,000 extra people will benefit? If he has been told there are only 9,000 people in addition to those who are already in receipt of carer's allowance, something is badly wrong with those who are putting the figures together. There are many more who deserve support. There are many old age pensioners who are caring for a partner or even a parent or other older relative. Because they get the old age pension, they get no carer's allowance. Once they reach 66, they are taken off carer's allowance. They will now get the respite grant, a change I welcome, but they are entitled to more than a one-off payment of €1,000.I have come across cases where a wife is looking after her in-laws and her husband is in low-paid work so she can get the carer's allowance. In one case the spouse died of cancer and in an accident in another case. The moment the spouses died, the wives were put back on to the contributory widow's pension and lost the carer's allowance. The Committee on Social and Family Affairs suggested that the least that could be done would be to give the widow or widower half of the carer's allowance. This would not create a precedent because if there are two people in a house, there is an entitlement to half of a carer's allowance for the second person. This would not cost very much but for these people it is essential.I have problems with the way the Department of Social and Family Affairs treats small farmers in terms of the means test. Even those who live on the land beside their parents are caught by the ten hours of work rule. That was not taken into account when means tests for carers were first developed — it may have been in the book but it was not put into practice. It is now being abused by social welfare officers. If they can find any excuse, they will not pay.Child care was ignored in the budget, an issue that will return to haunt the Government.I came across a case last week where a man was injured outside work and is not entitled to compensation. He is in receipt of disability benefit. If he was on disability allowance or invalidity allowance, his teenage daughter would be entitled to a top-up of her college grant. The disability benefit is the man's only income but because it is a benefit for which he paid his taxes, working 35 years in the one job, rather than an allowance, he gets no help towards his daughter's college fees. That is wrong and it should be examined. It is a travesty of justice that someone who worked all his life, paid tax and PRSI finds that he is not entitled to assistance for his daughter when someone who is on an allowance would get it. I will write to the Minister about this because it is unjust.I welcome the increases but will reserve judgment on them until I see how they turn out.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	358	No one will condemn the increases in social welfare payments in this Bill — we all welcome them — but it is our duty as Opposition to point out the opportunities that could be lost in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill.The initial reaction to the budget was the gratitude of those people on low pay who are now exempt from tax, but many high earners and millionaires are still exempt from tax. It is our job to point out what could be done with that money if those people were brought into the tax net. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children gave the impression the day after the budget that the Government had closed these loopholes but nothing could be further from the truth. The Minister for Finance gave these people the good news that they will not be touched for another year at least, giving them plenty of time to find other means to avoid tax liabilities. The previous Minister for Finance in his last budget extended the deadline for many of those tax shelter schemes and the new Minister has, despite what the Tánaiste said, given a clear indication that the deadlines will extend beyond 2006, when they were due to expire.The Minister was presented with the best opportunity ever to make provision for those in need in the budget. How much more could he have done if these people had been brought into the tax net on this occasion rather than saying it will happen some time after 2006? Many tax exemption schemes in forestry, stallions, greyhounds, creative arts, urban and rural renewal, car parks and student accommodation that were to end on 31 December 2004 have been extended to 31 July 2006. So much for the hype since the budget.The social welfare aspects of the budget did not even attract criticism from CORI and Fr. Healy. It is amazing what a little flattery can do. Some of the savage 16 cuts have been reversed and we welcome that — the Minister for Social and Family Affairs can take credit for that. How much more could have been done, however, if the Government had not wasted such a shocking amount of taxpayers' money, even in the past year? It was sheer arrogance to proceed with the €50 million expenditure on electronic voting in spite of all the warnings we gave to the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the Committee on the Environment and Local Government. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, put his head down and continued with that crazy idea, spent €50 million of taxpayers' money and we must now pay to store these machines which were not used.What about the millions of euro spent on spin doctors and public relations to make the Government look good? What about the millions of euro spent commissioning reports that did not lead to action? The Government has commissioned over 1,000 reports.What did the Minister do for the most vulnerable and dedicated section of our community, the carers? There are at least 170 more carers coming into the system every day because people are afraid to go into institutional care or hospitals.People prefer to be cared for at home. There is more pressure on family members to remain at home and care for an elderly person. I hope that if I or anybody belonging to me gets into such a situation the same would prevail in my case. I do not want to end my days in institutional care. I would prefer to be cared for, as most people would, in my own home.Only 23,500 carers are in receipt of carer's allowance. This means that approximately 120,000 carers are not in receipt of carer's allowance. The Minister has said carers not in receipt of carer's allowance will get the respite grant. There are two aspects I ask the Minister to spell out because my interpretation is different from that put on it by the media and, perhaps, the Minister. Will those who did not qualify for carer's allowance because of the means test, and had not applied, be eligible for the respite grant? More importantly, will those in receipt of unemployment assistance who are full-time carers be eligible for the respite grant? My interpretation of what the Minister said, and I listened carefully to his budget speech, was that only those acting as full-time carers would be eligible for the respite grant. I do not know whether a person in receipt of social welfare, who is acting as a full-timer carer but has to be available for work if called, would be eligible for the respite care grant. Perhaps, in his reply, the Minister will clarify that issue.I shall deal with one aspect of the carer's allowance which I have put to former Ministers for Social and Family Affairs, namely, Deputies Woods, Dermot Ahern and Coughlan, and to the commission which deals with carer's allowance and I have raised it at every possible opportunity. Deputy Crawford referred to it but not in the manner I will approach it. I am approaching it from practical experience in my work. A woman is caring full-time for her husband's relative, who is bed-ridden and incontinent, in her home. She is caring because she wants to keep that person in her home. Suddenly that woman, whose husband was a small farmer, becomes a widow. While she will qualify for the widow's pension she will lose the carer's allowance, despite the fact that she continues to be a full-time carer.  She has to employ somebody to do the meagre farm work because she cannot leave the house unless somebody takes her place and she loses the carer's allowance. That is the most cruel aspect of the carer's allowance. There are not many cases where a full-time carer becomes a widow and continues to be a full time carer. I ask the Minister, as a compassionate Minister and the fourth I have asked, to deal with this matter. I am aware she will get the respite grant because she is a full-time carer but if that is all she gets it is a cruel decision. I ask the Minister to investigate that anomaly.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Social Welfare Bill. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on the manner in which he has approached the Social Welfare Estimate and the Social Welfare Bill. He has hit the ground running. What he has done and what he proposes to do will make a huge difference to the lives of many. I was taken by some of the remarks in his opening contribution on the nature of social welfare and the dependence many have on it, such as the weak, the marginalised and the poor. Undoubtedly Ireland is quite a wealthy society. It is a test of our mission how we deal with them each year by way of targeted social welfare payments.Since becoming a Member I have always concentrated on efforts for the young, the old, the most frail and the disabled. In this budget a package of measures has been put together which is coherent and caring and will make a difference to the lives of a large number of people. Thankfully, not as many as previously depend on social welfare payments for the unemployed, but they are in constituencies such as mine. There are those who are in and out of fairly casual, poorly paid work. It is important that we have a social welfare system that is people centred, as the Minister said earlier, so that these people are enabled to progress into employment. I have no doubt, despite what many say, the principal aspiration of the vast majority is to get out of unemployment and into employment. The satisfaction that gives, by way of a regular guaranteed income, changes dramatically the lives of many.In his contribution the Minister said we must avoid a situation where one size fits all. I agree with him. His office and previous holders of the office and the officials who work for him are an example of a caring, professional, efficient Civil Service. The Minister and I had the opportunity last week to speak with some of the officials in the regional social welfare office in Finglas. One could not but feel a sense of pride for the way they deliver their work. There is no suggestion of being dogmatic, of attempting to catch people out or to deprive people of their entitlements. If anything, the reverse is the case.The national anti-poverty strategy, which is embraced by all parties, underpins Sustaining Progress and previous agreements and is at the core of how we tackle the elimination of poverty. We must try to eliminate child poverty as much as possible and we are well on the way to doing that. I do not think Fr. Seán Healy expects to be quoted here all the time but he has been, and rightly in many cases, a severe critic of the attitude of Governments. However, the Governments with which I have been associated since becoming a Member of this House in 1997 have shown an enlightened and caring approach. I will not throw out plaudits unduly to this side or criticisms unduly to the other side but the facts speak for themselves. When others had an opportunity of providing a caring system they did not crown themselves in glory so far as generosity was concerned.The Minister said we need to constantly monitor the pulse of our changing society and broaden and evolve to respond to changes. That is what the Minister and the Government have achieved in the budget and will also achieve by the implementation of the Bill. Undoubtedly the rising tide has not lifted all boats. Some, thankfully not as many as there were, are stuck in the mud and need to be lifted by a series of targeted measures and some of the measures in the budget will make a difference.When the Minister visited Coláiste Íde in Finglas last week, he presented certificates to a group of severely disabled people who have the potential to be among the most marginalised people in our society. However, I found that they were among the most positive people I have ever met. The social welfare system has given them an opportunity to engage with education. Virtually all of them are confined to wheelchairs, some of them are blind and others were seriously injured in horrific road accidents. They can use laptop computers provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to participate, in their own homes, in a programme of wireless education provided by the VEC. Their quality of life has improved dramatically as a result. Many years ago, I taught the sons of a man who attends the college. Although he has a very debilitating disease, he is helped in life by being given an education. That is made possible by technology, which is provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs with the help of officials in Mellowes Road and the VEC in Ballsbridge.Measures such as the back to education scheme are helping to move the goalposts slightly. Many of the most enlightened measures which have been introduced, mainly by the current Government, relate to second chance education. Such measures have made a huge difference. Many women who started off by taking budget management courses which were funded by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have moved through the system, some as far as university level. The measures I have mentioned can make a real difference.I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the level of support for the Family Support Agency. It is expected that the Government will assist the long-term unemployed and provide child benefit, but the support being given to the agency is just as good an example of a focused measure. The family resource centre programme is being allocated an additional €2 million. I have seen at first hand that the programmes organised by family resource centres have transformed many communities. The lives of people in communities in partnership, RAPID and CLÁR areas have been completely changed. The family mediation service is being given funding of €900,000 to assist it in its expansion programme. It is important that the Government supports such a service at a time when relationships and marriages are breaking down to an increasing extent, unfortunately.I happen to know many of those who work for the money advice and budgeting service, which is a truly magnificent body. It is probable that the people in question, who were largely responsible for getting the service up and running, will never be satisfied that they have enough money to support all the work the service needs to do. The service has stabilised many families which were unable to pay ESB bills or rent and could not afford the essentials of life. Its work has transformed the lives of many members of such families.Many people would argue that it is to be expected that I have such great admiration for the work of Comhairle, which organises a fine network of community and citizen information centres and provides objective support and advice, which is critically important. Many people who are afraid to inquire about their entitlements prefer to approach public representatives such as Deputies and Senators. We should encourage such people to locate information in a non-threatening environment, such as that provided at community information centres.Deputy McCormack spoke about the problems of carers. We need to recognise that it is a developing area. I will discuss child care later in my speech, if I have enough time. It is not long since we knew very little about the nature of caring. We still do not know enough about how to tackle the matter. The budget and the special measures introduced by the Minister will ensure that those who provide caring services in the home, usually under difficult circumstances, will find it easier to work with those for whom they care. It is never easy to care for somebody who is suffering from a seriously debilitating disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, which can affect elderly people, or Parkinson's disease, which can affect younger people. Extremely good opportunities are given in this budget to those who provide such assistance.I have often been slightly critical of the social welfare code, not because I think it is a bad code but because it has "growed" like Topsy. I would compare it to the construction of multiple extensions to a house, few of them without planning permission. Perhaps we will have to consider, in the not too distant future, dismantling the system to consider how to deliver a properly integrated system. That may be necessary for a variety of reasons, not least of which is the looming pensions issue which will result from our ageing population.Many Deputies have spoken about the various adjustments which had to be made to last year's Estimate. While some of their criticisms were valid, certain comments were wholly irresponsible. I compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on the way he has quickly addressed certain causes of great difficulty to social welfare recipients. I have referred to the back to education allowance. The Minister made a good adjustment to the allowance by reducing the qualifying period from 15 to 12 months and raising the grant from €254 to €400. Without exception, those involved in returning to education, with whom I often deal, as Deputies are aware, have welcomed the adjustment the Minister has made. I welcome the merited adjustment made by the Minister to the one-parent transitional payment.Although I think people are entitled to receive rent supplement, I am slightly ambivalent about the scheme as a whole because I think the Department of Social and Family Affairs has bailed out the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for too long. It is time to knock some heads together in this regard to try to bring some coherence to the assessment of housing need and the development of housing policy. There is no better person to do so than the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan. I approve of the adjustment that has been made to the rent supplement scheme.I spent a great deal of time working on thecrèche supplement payment over the past year because I was concerned that it had an adverse impact. I am aware that the Minister, who listened carefully to the details of a number of case studies I presented to him, engaged with the social partners as part of the Sustaining Progress process. Some of his most senior officials took the opportunity to visit a number of areas, which I cited as being worthy of examination, to observe the impact of the crèche supplement payment. I am delighted with the Minister's decision to restore the previous system because I think it will make a huge difference. Some of the providers of nurseries have been writing to the Minister to thank him for that initiative and to congratulate him thereon. At least one provider has invited the Minister to attend a Christmas party next week. I do not know whether he will be able to accept the invitation to the party at Our Lady's Nursery in Ballymun but, if so, he will receive a very warm welcome.Let us consider the issue of child care. The Government has rightly concentrated support for children on the very generous increases in child benefit. However, we must now consider whether we should re-examine the provision of child care. Child care and early childhood education are being delivered in a largely incoherent way, bearing in mind that, where they are being delivered, the results are very good. We are well aware of the Early Start educational programme. Montessori schools and the National Day Nursery Association provide services. Services are also delivered through the very extensive equality measures of the Government's national development plan. Slightly more than €500,000 is being invested in supporting the supply of services. Undoubtedly, there is great improvement in this regard but we will ultimately have to address this area quite fundamentally in the course of the coming year.Deputies Penrose, English and I happen to be members of a working group of the National Economic and Social Forum which is examining early childhood education and child care. We hope the group will be in a position to report to the main council in April 2005 and that the Government will consider positively the range of options put forward by the council to see if it can put in place a package to deliver first-rate, high-quality child care. We must recognise that child care and the support of those with disabilities will not come cheap but it is incumbent on us to ensure that our youngest and most frail are generously supported. All the evidence suggests that young people who have had the benefit of high-quality child care and early education do far better, not just in education but generally in later life.I compliment the Minister on his ingenuity regarding the assessment of capital. There was considerable concern that one's having a special savings incentive account would have an adverse impact on one's social welfare entitlements. In this regard, the Minister's raising of the ceiling to €20,000 is important and will make a significant difference. It will put at rest the minds of many people who were worried about the fate of the nest-eggs they had saved for a rainy day, such as their having to live in a nursing home or on a reduced income.I will conclude with my annual whinge. I know the Minister does not agree with my position on the child dependant allowance issue. I know all the arguments that have been made by the Minister and his predecessors in this regard and they do not differ very much from each other. However, I would love if we could have another review of the child dependant allowance, possibly in the coming year.I happened to have the privilege of being in the House of Commons three weeks ago for Prime Minister's question time. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, stated he was very proud to tell the House that free television licences were being extended to those over 75 years of age in the United Kingdom. There was a time when the shoe was on the other foot such that the entitlements in the United Kingdom were far superior to ours, but Irish society, harsh as some might say it is, is now very largely caring and enlightened in the way it has managed to provide targeted supports for those who need them most.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the Social Welfare Bill 2004. I look forward to debating the relevant issues with the Minister at meetings of the Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs.I broadly welcome the increase of €14 per week in weekly social welfare payments and the increase of €12 per week for pensioners. These increases are the very minimum that people could have expected to receive given the favourable financial position of the Government. Tax receipts of €1.7 billion are above expectations and borrowing is expected to be €1.6 billion lower than the figure originally predicted.It should be remembered that this is the third year in a row in which the increase in child benefit is below the level required to meet commitments made prior to the general election of 2002. It is also very significant that there have been no increases in the child dependant allowance. This allowance is a significant, targeted anti-poverty payment that should play an important role in combating poverty, especially child poverty. The Minister obviously does not view it in this light.Ireland may well be a rich country, if not one of the richest in Europe, but we must ask if it is an inclusive country. To test for this, we must consider the manner in which we include the most vulnerable in our society. It is a cause of great concern that a significant minority still does not have the basic necessities, such as a warm overcoat and a meal with meat, chicken or fish at least every second day. The increase in relative poverty and the widening gap between those on low incomes and higher earners reflects the policies of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in recent years.Some 22% of our population, or almost 800,000 people, are receiving below 60% of the median income and experience basic deprivation. The increase of €14 per week is not likely to change the lifestyle of a person living on €148.80 per week who has no immediate prospect of getting a job or securing a local authority house. This is due to the failure of the Government to prioritise social and affordable housing.Having listened to the Fianna Fáil Deputies in the House and having read some of the right-wing economists in the media, I note that they are not living in the real world. The increase of €14 per week, welcome as it is, represents an increase of only €2 per day. Various local authorities have already drawn up new scales for payment for differential rents for 2005. I was on the phone to one authority this morning and was informed that there will be an immediate rent increase of €1.60. This will affect those who are to receive the increase of €14 per week. At the same time they must endure a continuous range of stealth taxes, including increases for fuel and the ESB. That will leave very little to purchase extra bread, a half pound of butter, a packet of cheese or even a half dozen eggs. I priced those items in the supermarket this morning and they came to almost €7.Many people expected an increase in the living alone allowance. The rate of €7.70 per week has not been increased since 1996. Various reports have shown that most of the older people at risk of poverty are women living alone. This payment affords the State the opportunity to target resources at these vulnerable people. The Minister's failure to do so is contrary to the recommendations of the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, and is regrettable. Groups such as the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and Age Action Ireland have highlighted the fact that the extra allowance for people aged 80 and over has also not been increased since 1996. This payment recognised the additional needs pensioners in this category have and I am appalled that once again the Government has failed to increase this payment.I made numerous representations to the Minister's predecessor, the Minister Deputy Coughlan, and to his Department regarding free travel passes, particularly for older people in Dublin, Cork and Limerick who have hospital appointments and are obliged to leave home prior to 10 a.m. These restrictions cause difficulties and are a bone of contention for older persons and the various organisations which represent them. Having listened to the excuses and read the reports emanating from CIE and the Department of Social and Family Affairs it should be possible to have this matter resolved and I call on the Minister to reactivate his efforts on this issue.I welcomed the €12 per week increase for pensioners. It should be noted, however, that the programme for Government promised to increase the basic rate to at least €200 per week by 2007. This is one commitment that must be met. There will always be anomalies in respect of pensions unless and until pensions are linked to what working people earn, which is most fairly assessed as the gross average industrial earnings. The Pensions Board report on the national pensions policy initiative in 1998 recommended that the minimum retirement income for State social welfare pensions should be 34% of gross average industrial earnings. Six years later there is still a considerable way to go. That is a target to which we in the Labour Party are committed. We will vigorously pursue the Minister on this issue and if that commitment is not met before the Labour Party returns to Government after the next general election we will implement it.In its pre-budget submission Age Action Ireland referred to the commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a personal pension entitlement for pensioners' spouses to receive the qualified adult allowance, set at the level of a full non-contributory pension. I strongly support the recommendations that the qualified adult allowance rates be increased over the next three years to equal the full non-contributory pension.The Minister has failed to deal with carers. He has met them but they are particularly disappointed with the Social Welfare Bill and I do not blame them. We have raised this issue regularly over the past five years and thought there would be a specific commitment this year on it. In some ways this Bill is a con trick. The media has been sold the perception that the infamous 16 cuts which were so detrimental to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the local elections have been redressed. They have only been modified in certain ways and we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to tease this out further. While we broadly welcome certain elements in the Bill, we have grave difficulty with several areas, particularly the savage cuts, which are not being remedied, and a lack of real support for carers.
#BreedaMoynihanCronin	unknown-#BreedaMoynihanCronin-party	unknown-#BreedaMoynihanCronin-dob	unknown-#BreedaMoynihanCronin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I welcome increases in payments because any increase for recipients of social welfare is welcome. I studied the Bill over the weekend and found that it is not all good news. One frightening fact I discovered, of which no doubt the Minister is aware, is that following the social welfare increases in this Bill, a married person under 66 on invalidity pension will receive €154.30 and their dependant will receive €110.10, giving them a total weekly income of €264.30. When the new medical card income thresholds are introduced, the threshold for this married couple will be €222.00, putting them €42.30 over the limit. In effect, this will result in this couple losing their medical card.In most cases where a person is in receipt of a social assistance payment he or she would retain a medical card, even if the social welfare rate exceeded the threshold for the medical card, at the discretion of the community welfare officer. For those on benefits, however, who have paid their contributions, I am advised by a community welfare officer that there is no guarantee that the couple I outlined will retain a medical card. An elderly couple on an invalidity pension will not qualify on income grounds for a medical card when the new social welfare increases take effect. They should not have to rely on the discretion of a community welfare officer because as we all know that discretion is being curtailed every day. The Minister should look at that and ask the Minister for Health and Children to deal with it in the income guidelines for a medical card.There is a further deficit in the social welfare system as it pertains to people coming off community employment schemes. Up to now they could proceed to receive full unemployment assistance on leaving the scheme. However, under the recent provision for community employment workers, on leaving the scheme they must apply for unemployment benefit. Given the structure of these graduated payments, a person coming off a scheme can qualify only for the basic rate of unemployment benefit of €105.60 per week. What is more, that person will not get a Christmas bonus and will not be eligible for the fuel allowance.Were that community employment worker to remain on the dole, he would receive €134.80, over €30 more than he would get coming off a community employment scheme, and he would retain benefits such as the Christmas bonus and the fuel allowance. There is little incentive for people in long-term unemployment to take up a place on community employment schemes because they would be better off, financially, staying on the dole. The Department of Social and Family Affairs does not advise people on disability benefit who may be eligible for the invalidity pension that they are so eligible. The disability benefit is a short-term payment which does not allow access to the fuel allowance, the Christmas bonus, living alone allowance or the household benefits package. Like everyone else, I have several constituents who have been on disability benefit for a long time and should have been on an invalidity pension. They must be on it for a year, but people do not understand that they are entitled to an invalidity pension. The disability benefit is a short-term payment which does not allow access to the fuel allowance, the Christmas bonus, the living alone allowance or the household benefits package. They are losing out on all that.The invalidity pension, as a long-term social welfare payment, allows receipt of the fuel allowance, the Christmas bonus, the living alone allowance and the household benefits package, but in my experience, which I imagine is replicated on all sides of the House, the Department is making very little effort to encourage those eligible to move from disability benefit to invalidity pension. I make the fair and reasonable request that the Minister take it up with his officials in the section dealing with disability. It would be fairly easy using computer systems to ascertain who has been on disability benefit for more than a year. It would mean a great deal to those people, and I hope that the Minister will be positive in his reply.I also want to raise an issue that I raise during the debate on every Social Welfare Bill and budget and which I will continue to raise until something is done about it, namely, the manner in which the Department of Social and Family Affairs assesses a person's capital assets for social welfare eligibility. When a social welfare applicant is assessed, the interest he or she accrues on any savings or capital in a bank account is taken into account. However, the guidelines for that assessment are a joke. For example, a person with €40,000 in savings in a bank account, which is not much in this day and age, is assessed as having a weekly means of €37.63. A person with €50,000 in savings is assessed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs as earning €77.67 from that money every week.Perhaps the Minister might tell me of a financial institution in this country which allows a person to deposit €50,000 and receive an income of €77 per week. That is 8%, and we all know that not even Ansbacher would give 8% for €50,000. Why does the Department continue to assess people with paltry savings at 8% when they currently receive 2%, a figure that has remained constant for some time? It would be simple for recipients to give their bank account number and provide a statement of interest on which they could be assessed. That would be very fair. What I seek is not unreasonable. Will the Minister examine that issue? He would make a name for himself, since the current assessment is 6% above what people are getting. It deprives many people of social welfare income. That sort of money in the bank is not very much, especially if one is faced with entering a nursing home at a cost of €600 or €700 a week. It would not last long.It is disappointing to note that nothing significant has been done for carers. The Labour Party will vote against the Second Stage of this Bill, not because of the increases but for two reasons in particular. Nothing specific was done for carers. We introduced a Carers' Bill in Private Members' time recently which received verbal support from all sides of the House although Government Deputies obviously had to vote against it. Everyone agreed with what was said in that Bill, namely, that the means test should be deleted from the carer's allowance. My colleague, Deputy Seán Ryan, also referred to it. There was no row-back on the savage 16 cuts, which were tinkered with.For that reason and those which I have mentioned, we will vote against the Bill. On a positive note, I hope that the Minister will consider the two reasonable requests that I have made to him.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on his new portfolio, this being my first chance in the Chamber to wish him well. I also wish my county colleague and former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, well in her role in the Department of Agriculture and Food.When one considers the amount of money passing through the Department and the number of people dependent on the decisions made and success achieved when various Ministers go to the Department of Finance, one sees that this is one of the most important Departments. For that reason, the success over several years in increasing funding allocations must be acknowledged and welcomed. It is incredible that there is almost unanimous support for this budget. It is impossible to please everyone, and if we think that we are doing so, we are deluding ourselves. However, people in so many quarters have found such hearty praise for this budget and, in that context, for the Social Welfare Bill, that it is disingenuous for people to try to pick holes in an extremely good package.I always find it very easy to relate to my first day in the House, partly because the said Minister got kicked out that day on an issue regarding Luas, which he has now delivered, just as he is now delivering his social welfare budget from this side of the House. Deputy Seán Ryan complained about €2 a day being given, but in the budget at that time, child benefit was increased by 25p a week. When one considers the allocations being made to different sections of the community which deserve it, there is no doubt and one must acknowledge that there has been great success and forward movement, not discounting inflation.Some people have claimed that the real reason this budget was so good was the local election results and people being told the Government was not delivering. In my area, with Francis Conaghan, Rena Donaghy, Denis McGonagle and Marion McDonald, we increased the number of our council seats by one and retained Rose Cullen, Joseph Doherty and Dermot McLaughlin in our urban council. People in my area recognise that this Government and its predecessor have been delivering on social welfare as much as on every other aspect. While they recognise that there are still issues to be addressed, including in social welfare, they trust and accept that this Administration has their best interests at heart and will deliver. It will not deliver to everyone at once, which is impossible because money is finite, but to all over its term of office. We were derided the first time that the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, introduced a budget but, as he progressed to his fifth, the laughter rapidly decreased.Some people will be happier than others, but no one can begrudge the details of the Social Welfare Bill and the budget in general which have brought radical improvements in funding for the delivery of services, especially to those with disabilities, something connected with recent Government legislation. There have been improvements in taxation policy, specifically the tax reliefs for the elderly, the disabled and the widowed, which are extremely important. The fact that 650,000 income earners on the minimum wage have been removed from the income tax net ensures, or helps to ensure, that people will be more inspired or encouraged to move into employment where it is available rather than those on lower incomes looking to the family income supplement which has been greatly improved in this budget. They may no longer have to depend on unemployment supports.Coming from an area where there is high unemployment, I welcome the supports for those who are not in employment. However, ultimately, I would be much happier if we had no need for unemployment supports and if people currently in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit were working.Given that this Bill presents the opportunity to talk about social welfare matters, it would be remiss of me not to encourage the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to expedite and move forward the decentralisation process to Buncrana, to which staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs are due to transfer. Given the great strides people in the Department are making in Letterkenny and other locations, in time people will realise that we have a great natural resource in terms of people, environment and location. We have a treasure in Donegal, which we are afraid too many people might discover, but we will whisper about it at present and encourage those in the Department of Social and Family Affairs to reconsider the location and to visit the area to check out the resources available. We often use the opportunity to speak on the area to moan and call ourselves peripheral but we only do that in an effort to ensure that people do not abuse the wonderful area of Inishowen and other places in Donegal. I ask the Minister to move forward the process. The site selection process is almost at completion stage. I ask him to take a personal interest, as his predecessor did, in expediting this mission.It goes without saying that the increases in this social welfare package are larger than in the past. A social welfare package of €874 million was announced in the budget. This represents a €244 million or 40% increase on the 2004 package. We welcomed the package of €630 million last year and thought that we were doing well, but it is staggering to have a package this year that represents an additional €244 million on the 2004 package and an expenditure of €12.25 billion. It is worth making the point and for people to realise that the Government is focusing on improving the standard of living of people with disabilities, carers, children, the elderly, widows, widowers, the unemployed, lone parents and other disadvantaged people.Every year we have seen an increase in the social welfare expenditure, but there has been a 60% increase in such expenditure in the past four years and a doubling of what was spent in 1997. When one has been a Member of the House for a number of years and been present for the introduction of a number of budgets, one realises the number of decisions that have to be taken to ensure such expenditure is targeted at those who really need it.The Minister mentioned a fascinating statistic, namely, that for every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2005, €1 will go in social welfare entitlements. Some 970,000 people will claim weekly social welfare payments next year, which will benefit some 1.5 million people, if one includes dependants. It is a challenge to please all the people, but this package will please a large percentage people, given that 1.5 million will benefit from increases of between 7% and 10%, which is three to four times ahead of the expected rate of inflation for the coming year. Such increases are significant.There is much talk about the savage cuts with which the Minister has moved to deal. He said he was moving towards keeping the whole process under review. It is important for the Department to bear in mind that life does not stand still and that the Minister has a sense of what is happening. If I was critical of any of the cuts, I would have an issue with the back to education allowance. Reducing the qualifying period from 15 months to 12 months is an important step, but it should be reviewed in terms of reducing it further, possibly to the level it was at. That is my genuine view having met a number of people who could return to education, having acquired their positions, yet the financial implications of the move means they often have to, as is proverbially said, go back on the dole for a year. That money is wasted because those recipients are taking it from the State in any event and could be participating in education and obtaining their qualifications, but all they are doing is biding time until they eventually qualify. If the reason for this measure is that it would encourage the recipients to move into employment, there might be an argument for it. However, the people with whom I have been dealing have had a clear vision of where they want to go and the need for the qualifications to which they are aspiring. To begrudge such qualification for the allowance to them for a year is not positive. However, the reduction in the qualifying period from 15 to 12 months is an important step, but the Minister might monitor it and further reduce the qualifying period.There has been much talk of nothing having been done to provide for carers. One of the important developments in social welfare since I was elected to the House was the introduction of the respite care grant introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. It offers carers an opportunity to have a necessary option or alternative in terms of support for full-time care. I am glad that the Bill provides for an increase in the grant by €165 to €1,000. The introduction of this grant was innovative. It is worthy of recognition in terms of an increase in this Bill. I welcome the change whereby the limit of payments of respite care grant to only two recipients will be abolished. The condition requiring recipients of carer's benefit to be in employment in the three months prior to the commencement of full-time caring is important. Another change is that the Minister has opened the scheme to allow an additional 9,200 full-time carers to qualify for the grant for the first time. Some 33,000 people are expected to receive a grant of €1,000 next year. We should monitor the issues in respect of carers, but the change in the means testing means a couple with two children can earn up to €30,700 and receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and a couple can earn up to €49,200 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance and still qualify for other benefits. Carer's qualification for other social welfare supports was an issue that was regularly raised with me. If one was not entitled to the carer's allowance, one did not qualify for many other welfare supports. It is important that the Minister has opened the scheme to ensure that carers can be entitled to some welfare supports, if not the entire package of supports.I echo much of what has been said about carers, namely, the importance of increasing, by way of financial supports, the ability of people to take on the role of recognised carers. People who are wealthy have the alternative of putting their dependants into some sort of institution or they can employ people to look after them. However, many people who are caring for their dependants are not wealthy and miss out on welfare supports. Such supports are beneficial and have made a significant difference to many people's lives.I welcome the fact that many of the increases will be implemented from the beginning of January. In the past increases on petrol, cigarettes and alcohol were imposed from midnight on the day of the budget whereas increases in social welfare payments were sometimes not implemented until November. January, February, April and May are the only months mentioned. Bringing forward the payment of these increases and allowing people to benefit from them has been an important change over the past couple of years.The increase in the threshold to €20,000 in assessing capital for all schemes except the SWA is also very important. There is no point in encouraging people to save responsibly by putting their money in a financial institution rather than under the bed if as a result they lose out on a vital part of their income.Although it is not specifically related to this Bill, I welcome the introduction of the doctor only medical card. In my area there is quite a good reaction on the part of the health board to applications for medical cards made on medical grounds. It is not stressed that there are two ways of getting a medical card, on the basis of means or on the basis of need. Where there is genuine medical need, the health board has usually facilitated the provision of a medical card. It should be reiterated that if a person has a medical problem, application for a medical card should be made on medical grounds.I have a problem with the increase in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme, particularly for people on low incomes who rely on family income supplement. I often wonder why medicine does not seem to be getting cheaper given that in the era of high technology, plasma screen televisions and computers have come down in price. I do not know anything about this area so I am shooting in the dark. Are there plenty of checks on the money being paid to pharmacies by the State under the drugs payment scheme? I do not know the answer to that and I do not have any particular agenda other than the belief that if people are going to be paying more every month, the other side of the coin is that there must be adequate checks on what it is costing to provide the service.I agree with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin that some people who should be on long-term invalidity support are in receipt of disability benefit for a year or more. Perhaps the Minister would examine that issue so that people will be given the correct payment from the start. That would save money because it would avoid the necessity of carrying out another assessment in respect transferring to the alternative benefit.We should try to minimise bureaucracy and red tape. Ultimately it is like dealing with the vintners in the context of the national identity card. Bureaucracy could be minimised if there was joined-up government and all the information was available in one place. Joined-up government would have been helpful in the context of the dietary supplement change, in terms of rural transport initiatives, and in so many other Departments. That issue is incidental to the Bill under discussion. There are so many issues to which I did not allude, including maternity benefit.The package speaks for itself. It provides €12.25 billion in 2005. Many people will gain from it. They will be happy to see their benefits increase rather than remain static. I look forward to the next couple of budgets which will conclude the efforts being made on the five-year programme.

They have received no increases despite the fact that over the past two years they were due quite small increases on their very small wages. The An Post pensioners have also been denied the meagre increases due to them. I pay tribute to the workers and their unions——

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The social welfare increases are welcome for those unfortunate enough to have to survive on social welfare amid so much wealth and affluence. The unfortunate people on social welfare must survive on less than €150 a week. Even with the increases, they do not reach a level in line with the minimalist objective of the national anti-poverty strategy which set a target to be reached by 2007 of €186 a week. That is the anti-poverty target for the lowest rates of social welfare. For even that much to be achieved increases of €18.50 a week will have to be given in budget 2006 and budget 2007 because the increase in this budget for 2005 is less than the strategy required. CORI, which again produced its critique and analysis of the budget in record time, summarised the increase thus: "While the new social welfare rate of €148.80 is a major improvement, delivery of the NAPS commitment remains critical."As we all know, and people who survive on social welfare know it far better than any of us, within two months of their receiving their €12 or €14, if they live in local authority accommodation, and the vast majority of them do — the vast majority of tenants in Dublin City Council survive on social welfare — the rent goes up and the €12 automatically becomes €9 or €10, and it does not take very long for that to be eaten up by other increases. That is the reality and many of them have told me over the weekend that while they welcome the increases, they are very rapidly swallowed up, in some instances at least, by the State itself via the local authority. Moreover, many will say that the main reason these social welfare increases look so good is because they follow seven years of neglect.I will refer briefly to the savage 16 social welfare cuts. I understand the Minister has them under review. The perception at the time of the budget was that they would be reversed. That has not happened.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I welcome the significant increases in allowances, pensions and a range of other supports that will directly benefit the 970,000 who claim a weekly social welfare payment and particularly welcome the funding for disability and unemployment benefit. I also welcome the commitment from the Minister that young people suffering from autism who are currently in psychiatric homes will be removed and placed in suitable and safe surroundings.The changes directed have reduced the measure of unnecessary anxiety, pressure and confusion among the vulnerable sections in our society. The Bill ensures positive steps towards the modernisation of social protection, including the provision of care, improvement of social inclusion and combating poverty in our society. However, some glaring anomalies remain. A carer travelling with a person under 16 years of age enjoys free travel whereas a 16 year old must fund his or her bus and train travel. The 16 year old should not have to pay and the free schemes will have to be extended to allow both carer and young person to travel for free.While there are approximately 50,000 full-time carers, as a result of the 2004 budget only 1,000 extra carers will now receive carer's allowance. Only 24,000 will get carer's allowance and approximately 100,000 part-time carers will not receive carer's allowance. A widow should be entitled to receive both widow's pension and carer's allowance if she operates as a full-time carer but the social welfare single payment rule prevents this. The Carers Association urged the Minister to waive this rule for pensioners and lone parents in particular, two groups which are often on the poverty line.As a lone parent or pensioner, one is only allowed to receive one payment. If a carer is in receipt of a disability payment, he or she cannot also receive carer's allowance. The carer's allowance should be increased to the same rate as a nursing home subvention, which is €190 per week. It is stated Government policy to maintain older people in their own homes for as long as possible. However, the Government pays to put the old in nursing homes but does not keep them in their own homes.Much change has been achieved with the 2004 budget but much remains to be done. Will the Minister consider removing the means test for carers? He should be more generous when old age pensioners apply for the non-contributory pension and something should be done to help those who are a few euro over the qualifying threshold. For example, a man from my county was €1 over the threshold but was not entitled to his old age pension. That is not right and the Minister should seriously consider this issue.

Like Deputy Gregory, I record my support for the An Post workers who have a valid case that needs to be answered by Government. I hope they do not find themselves seeking social welfare due to unemployment in addition to the injustice they have already suffered. The Government needs to seriously consider the issue of mismanagement that the workers are highlighting. The increases they seek are modest.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I have made my point. I listened carefully to the Minister, Deputy Brennan, stating that for every €3 spent by the Government, €1 is spent on social welfare. He stated that two out of every five people would receive some share of the €12 billion being spent by his Department. However, the Government should ensure that we integrate more closely as is the case in other countries. There is no difference between the money paid as a tax allowance and that paid as social welfare. It is effectively money which the State foregoes. However, there is a perception that if one gets money by way of a tax allowance, one is being of great service to society by being employed whereas if one gets the money by way of a social welfare entitlement, one is utterly dependent and in some way disempowered by virtue of the fact that one is seen to be getting some kind of handout. While I know we call it an entitlement and it is not a handout, I ask that the integration of the tax code and social welfare code might reflect that all of us, including the Minister and I, get some benefit from the State by way of a tax allowance, in the same way as a carer or person in receipt of child benefit. Moreover, we should quickly get rid of the exemptions and anomalies which mean that not only are workers on minimum wage outside the tax net but those on huge incomes are outside it, which is an injustice that continues to fester.The legacy of the system where all employment is considered good is an oversimplification which leads us to overlook many problems caused because the production of items which hurt or damage people and society is still considered good, so long as it gives employment. Our values need to be assessed to check that we are not excusing activities that do damage by perceiving them as good.Many on social welfare would remind the Minister that all good work is not paid, including caring, child rearing, repairing one's house or growing one's own food, all of which contributes to society in no small way. Deputy Keaveney referred to the need for joined-up thinking and I support her call. Currently, the poverty trap in the social welfare system means that people are afraid to make changes. They are afraid to even change jobs, which makes a good case for considering more closely the guaranteed basic income scheme. I briefly discussed this with the Minister and would like to discuss it with him again because the Government has reached a point where it sees the merits and logic of moving closer to this.As the Green Party finance spokesperson, Deputy Boyle stated that introducing returnable tax credits would be easily achieved and would also mean that the minimum wage earner, who currently foregoes any tax credit, would at least get the tax credit, which would be a beginning to the recognition that we are all involved in contributing to society whether we get paid through the Department of Social and Family Affairs or by way of the Revenue Commissioners with a tax allowance. This needs to be integrated and we need to end the false dichotomy and recognise that a guaranteed basic income would be a way to achieve this.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Sinn Féin welcomed the increases in social welfare payments included in the budget announcements, although many of the increases were long-sought and long overdue. The Government needs to accept that increased investment in social protection helps society as a whole. Social welfare payments are important in helping people through times of difficulty when they face unemployment, the risk of becoming homeless or are caring for elderly or ill relatives. They should not be viewed as handouts, the cost of which the Government must keep to a minimum. Rather, they are necessary to aid low income families with the cost of child care, fuel costs, special dietary requirements etc.Increased social protection along with the tax system must be used to close the gap between rich and poor. Social protections, when properly implemented, enable people to access education and employment and to escape the poverty trap that in many families is generational. This is one of the reasons it is important to allow welfare recipients to retain secondary benefits for a substantial period after accessing employment.When compared with the appalling onslaught of last year's 16 welfare cuts on the most disadvantaged, this year's Social Welfare Bill seems almost generous. Last year's cuts have not been fully reversed as of yet. It is true some have been reversed and some have been amended but others have yet to be addressed, which the Minister acknowledged. The reality is that this State has had a buoyant economy for almost a decade and it is only now the needs of the most disadvantaged are even beginning to be addressed. Disgracefully, the years of economic boom have seen a rise in the levels of poverty in this State. Before addressing a number of issues in detail, it is important to point out the extent to which inequitable stealth taxes, which disproportionately impact on the less well off, have eaten into welfare increases and tax measures introduced in this year's budget.The lack of child care provisions in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill is astounding. It is a damning indictment of the Government's real attitude to the issue of child care. Increases in child benefit are welcome but they are not adequate if this remains the Government's stated preferred method of assisting families with child care costs. Sinn Féin called for a child care supplement to be paid as a top up for child benefit for under five year olds and commend this proposition to the Minister once more. Sadly, this budget will do little to address the difficulties faced by parents to secure affordable child care. In regard to the crèche supplement, the Minister has stated that community welfare officers will be re-empowered to grant crèche supplement as judged necessary. We will have to see how this discretion is implemented but it is not the same as reversing last year's cuts.Why was there no increase in the child dependant allowance? This targeted income measure is a particularly useful instrument in addressing child poverty and it is inexplicable that there has been no increase for the eleventh successive year. I am incredulous that this area was not addressed. Why was there no increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance? When one takes inflation into account, there clearly has been a decrease in real terms. The failure to increase this allowance is very disappointing when one considers the importance of keeping children in school, particularly those from disadvantaged areas. If parents cannot afford to buy the uniform, footwear and assorted necessities required at the start of the school term, the chance of children missing school days is increased.I am concerned the impression has been given that the restrictions in regard to the rent supplement have been reversed. I am not convinced that is the case and I ask the Minister to address that in his response. What he has said is that he is willing to amend the criteria for eligibility for rent supplement to take into account those "who become ill or unemployed or are assessed by a local authority as having a housing need" in order that they are not disadvantaged. Greater clarity is needed in regard to this issue. The Minister must make the House aware of the contents of any revised guidance notes to community welfare officers on how these changes will be implemented and the extent of the discretion which the community welfare officers will have. Sinn Féin reiterates its call for the full removal of the six month restriction — anything less will fail to properly address the need. In the absence of its full removal, vulnerable people will continue to be put at increased risk of homelessness.This brings me on to the dismal failure of the budget to address the issue of social housing. Social housing waiting lists are at an all time high. The budget measures in regard to stamp duty and first time buyers will mean nothing to those on low incomes and those reliant on social welfare whose only hope of securing a house is through social housing. Those people living in overcrowded conditions, in many cases, with three generations in the one house can see no light at the end of the tunnel. Single males who make up almost one third of those on local authority waiting lists have little hope of making the transition from emergency to permanent accommodation. Those working with the homeless, including Focus Ireland and Threshold, have long argued that an increase in the provision of social housing is key to eradicating homelessness and they have spoken of their disappointment with this year's budget. They have rightly accused this Government of ignoring people on housing waiting lists. Where the Minister has a direct input and a collective Cabinet input, I urge that he exercise himself to ensure that those who are in most need are given the greatest support.

That the Minister has received plaudits from the Opposition is an indication of his success in securing the largest social welfare package in the history of the State. I take umbrage with some of the points made by people opposite but, unfortunately, I will have to move the adjournment of the debate at 7 p.m.I wish to deal with the very positive aspects of the social welfare provisions. Most people would accept that huge strides have been made to try to develop a socially inclusive society. We have removed those on the minimum wage from the tax net, which is a very positive step. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government introduced the minimum wage in the first place. People must accept that over the past seven years, this Government has been very socially inclusive. There was a reference to social protection. The best way to guarantee social protection is to ensure we have a vibrant economy with as many people as possible at work and to ensure they are taxed in a fair manner so that we can distribute the fruits of the economy to those who most need it.Everyone will accept there have been major increases in pension payments. This Government has committed itself to ensuring that pensions will reach €200 per week. I am quite confident that will be achieved given the step this year and those which will be taken in the next two budgets. That is an indication of the Government's commitment to social provision.In the broader context of social welfare, the economy and the taxation system, there is no doubt that over the past seven years, the Government has made a huge contribution to ensuring we have a low unemployment rate. Many people are coming here from abroad to secure employment. That is something which would have been unthinkable ten years ago. It is disingenuous for anybody to come in here, casually praise the social welfare increases in the budget and then highlight every negative thing without first acknowledging there have been major increases.Child care is an issue which must be tackled on many fronts. The payment of child benefit is welcome but we must address the supply of child care. By increasing child benefit, all we are doing is driving up the price of child care, especially if there are not enough child care places available in the first instance. I urge all local authorities to expedite planning applications for child care and to alleviate some of the problems people experience when they apply for planning permission to change use of their houses to provide four to seven child care places. They must go to extraordinary lengths do so and very often they face objections not from residents, but from planners and from people outside the housing estate.

#LizODonnell	unknown-#LizODonnell-party	unknown-#LizODonnell-dob	unknown-#LizODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion before the House, which revisits the issue of Ireland's overseas development programme and, in particular, our plan to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I am a member, recently deplored the fact that there has been some backsliding in the Government's commitment to reaching that target by 2007. As the former Minister of State who was responsible for securing Cabinet approval for reaching the 0.7% target, I feel a particular responsibility to continue to advocate that that Cabinet decision should be honoured. I attended the United Nations in New York with the Taoiseach when he made that public commitment to the international community on the occasion of the millennium summit. The commitment was made following a full Cabinet process, involving all the usual consultation and departmental analysis. I chaired a high-level review of the Ireland Aid programme at the time, to which contributions were made by representatives of the OECD, the Irish business community and the heads of NGOs and aid agencies. We went through all the issues, examining the problems and challenges of expanding the overseas development aid programme so quickly in the coming years. We put in place a clearly defined plan that was a framework for expanding the programme. We also engaged in a major public consultation to discuss the planned increase in aid programmes in our priority countries. In addition, we discussed these matters with all the stakeholders, including NGOs, churches, missionary orders and the general public.The decision, which was widely acclaimed both at home and abroad, secured our membership of the Security Council. Our Ministers went around the world talking to international leaders, seeking their support for Ireland's place on the Security Council. We returned home when Ireland had secured that place. The Africa vote was very significant in that victory.Quite apart from the politics however, it is important to say why we took the decision to expand our overseas aid programme. We did so because it was the right thing to do. We made a commitment that Ireland would maintain its solidarity, in a significant manner, with the world's poorest countries because for the first time in our history we were in a financial position to do so. We did so in full knowledge of the facts and following widespread consultation, although some people may have thought we were expanding the aid programme too quickly. Those arguments were listened to and we debated them. Since the review process, which I chaired, examined all those issues and took more than a year to complete, I do not see the need for a White Paper.I want to highlight what we decided at that time, following the review committee's analysis of the aid programme's expansion. The key recommendations were: a new fund and action plan to combat the HIV-AIDS pandemic; a new policy focus on governance, democracy and human rights in the developing world; support for the private sector in developing countries; a new strategic and financial relationship with NGOs; a new budget and support framework for Irish missionaries; clear criteria for bilateral aid; and a wider geographical spread of the programme.We looked at whether we would stay with Africa and we decided that we would do so. We decided to make a small expansion into South East Asia, to support Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, which we have done. Primarily, however, we decided we were going to stay with Africa because that is the area of greatest poverty and need in the world. We have had the greatest relationships and long-standing partnerships with six African countries. We made plans with those countries to expand our aid programmes to them. We discussed the expansion and there is no problem of capacity. Issues have been raised as to whether or not, with all this expansion of the programme, there would be capacity on behalf of the stakeholders, our priority country partners, the NGOs and all the other people engaged in this aid endeavour. There is no problem about it. All the NGOs and representatives of the missionaries in Africa recently informed the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the target countries are anxious for more money. This endeavour is about saving lives, which is why it is so important. It is far more important than many other issues we discuss in this House because it represents a challenge that Ireland is geared up to meet. Our engagement with the poorest countries is the one foreign affairs issue for which Ireland is renowned all over the world. This is because we were so recently poor ourselves, have a memory of famine, were colonised and remained under developed for so many years, and we know the value of education.Of all the facts surrounding our aid programmes in Africa, the one I am most proud of is that we are educating young Africans. Our missionaries have been doing that for years. The template of the aid programme began with the missionaries. Our programme is only 30 years old but in that time we have made a huge impact in Africa. I wish the wider public was aware just how important is the work done in Africa in Ireland's name. I am concentrating my remarks on Africa because it is where we are most deeply embedded. We are engaged there in long-term, sustainable development in six countries. I hope that as we expand the aid programme, every Member of the House will support it.We have much to be proud of, given the extent to which the programme has expanded. In 1992, the programme amounted to only £40 million, while next year it will reach €530 million. That is a considerable amount of money that must, and will be, well spent. I urge every Member of the House to take the opportunity at some point over the next two years, before the next general election, of visiting our projects in Africa. It is extremely important for all Members to see at first hand the fantastic, life-saving and life-altering work that is being done in our name in Africa.The Minister for Foreign Affairs is travelling to Africa at the moment to see the projects for himself. I think he will be a changed man when he returns. One must see the chronic poverty and need, as well as the hope that aid engenders. It is not all misery in Africa. It would be shameful to portray the continent as a place of unrelenting misery. It is a continent comprising people of great hope and resources. They may have very little but when they receive help in the form of education, clean water and solidarity, one can see their lives changing immeasurably.I travelled with the President to Kenya and Uganda to see the work of Irish missionaries there. Over the years, thousands of Irish missionaries have worked to change the lives of local people in Africa. They are still working there and are grateful for every cent that allows them to continue that work. I am glad there is now a new fund to help those missionaries to draw down funding that is available to assist their endeavours.As the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, said recently when he addressed us in Dublin Castle, we do this not out of charity but out of enlightened self interest. Given the preoccupation with the war on terror and the need for a secure world, it is constantly overlooked that if the world was a fairer place and millions were not living in despair, the world would be a safer place. Security issues alone will not win the war against terrorism. There is a huge challenge to create a fairer world trading order, to engage in debt relief and build the capacity of developing countries to govern themselves.So many conflicts in Africa have displaced populations, thus creating huge refugees flows. All these developments have downstream repercussions for rich countries. There are plenty of economic reasons it is a good idea for the developed world to support the Third World.In Ireland, however, we have always seen it as a moral imperative. It is a test of our civilised values that we should want to help these people. We do not sleep easily in our beds when we think of the millions suffering with HIV-AIDS and the millions of abandoned orphans. The coping mechanisms that have traditionally safeguarded the welfare of orphans in developing countries have broken down because so many adults have died. I am glad we are maintaining our focus on HIV-AIDS.In regard to expanding the budget for overseas aid, I welcome that a multi-annual programme is back in place. The absence of such an approach has been the problem for the last two years. There was no guaranteed funding, which resulted in slippage and stalling in the budget. During my tenure as Minister of State, a three-year multi-annual programme was agreed, which guaranteed the upward trajectory of funding for this area. We must liberate the overseas aid budget from the annual Estimates wrangle.Unfortunately, however, the three-year budget that has been approved, incorporating an increase of €190 million in funding over the next three years, will not bring us to the target of 0.7%. We must continue to advocate at budget time for the next three years to ensure those minimum thresholds are exactly that. The agreed multi-annual funding must be only a baseline and Members must continue to advocate in support of this endeavour. There is cross-party support for the expansion of the overseas aid budget.Fine Gael has put forward a proposition that we should legislate to reach the UN target. Such action may well be necessary and would achieve broad support in the House. Over the years, as the budget has expanded, there has perhaps been insufficient debate in the House. Likewise, there has been insufficient public awareness of the great work that is purchased by taxpayers' money. Irish people are generous by nature and are among the most generous contributors in the world by way of voluntary contributions to charities. This should be reflected in the Government's programme.Many members of the public think of overseas aid in terms of the work done by the NGOs including Trócaire, Goal and Concern. Those agencies do fantastic work, funded by the Government and the people. However, the public is not fully aware of the depth, strength and scope of the official programme, which is run by our own people in six priority countries in Africa. It is a diverse programme which is based on partnership. I stress again the need for all Deputies to take ownership of the program and to transmit that to their constituents. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to contribute to this debate.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	380	Like Deputies O'Donnell, Michael D. Higgins and Allen, I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs. I cannot have it both ways. As much as I may be expected to vote against it, I support the Government amendment. I was extremely disappointed that we were unable to honour our commitment to keep on track in achieving the target of 0.7% of GDP by 2007. It is up to those of us with some experience of observing the work done by Ireland Aid to advocate even more strongly, along with the NGOs, missionaries and other groups, to ensure that a clear target date is set.I concur with Deputy O'Donnell that there is merit in examining in greater detail the need for legislation in this area to prevent an annual or multi-annual wrangle regarding the overseas aid budget. I welcome that the Minister proposes to engage in a consultative process that will end in the production of a White Paper. The public will engage in this debate and that will facilitate the emergence of a greater consciousness of the need to maintain this level of support.When one has the opportunity to see at first-hand the work that is done, one cannot but marvel at what can be achieved with relatively little money. I was fortunate to visit Uganda and Ethiopia earlier this year, during which Deputy Woods and I spent almost an hour with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia. Our discussion included such issues as good governance, greater transparency and improved monitoring of the election process. These issues are almost as important as the money we spend on HIV-AIDS. Prime Minister Zenawi fully recognises Ireland's commitment to overseas aid.I also had the opportunity to listen to President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda earlier this year at the United Nations trade and development summit in Sao Paolo. He outlined in glowing terms the contribution Uganda could make to the wider world. As Deputy O'Donnell has said, in agreement with Mr. Kofi Annan, it is in our enlightened self-interest to support Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique and all other countries with which we have an association. An intervention in a hospital in Kampala, whereby best practice is encouraged, medical professionals are educated about the latest research into retroviral drugs and so on, can have a significant impact on the HIV-AIDS programme. Such developments are facilitated through the co-operation of St. James's Hospital and Trinity College Dublin.The capacity for such assistance is significant and current programmes only scratch the surface in terms of best practice for medical professionals, training the trainers, peer reviews and other issues. There are some 14,000 displaced persons in the refugee camp in Gulu in northern Uganda. An Irish doctor is working there with one of the NGOs developing anti-malaria projects and training health workers to help reduce the level of child and maternal mortality. This is indicative of the work that can be done. If some 200 malaria nets can have a significant impact, what would 400 or 4,000 achieve? The provision of clean water is another imperative.Ireland is making an important contribution to the provision of universal access to primary education throughout Uganda. In one school I visited, there were 2,642 young people streaming in from the mountains to receive basic education in classes of up to 102 pupils. I cite these examples to illustrate what could be achieved. I have emphasised repeatedly the importance of investing more money in training teachers, in developing curricula and education research. In the Tigre province of northern Ethiopia, for example, a transformation has been achieved in the last seven years with the help of hydrologists from the National University of Ireland, Cork and the University of Wales, Bangor. Deputy Michael D. Higgins is aware of the progress that has been made as he knows the area well. The lives of the people in that area have been transformed through the provision of a better health service and improved housing. Now there is grass, bees, honey and milk. This is why we should be daring enough to set the goal of 0.7%.I was encouraged by the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in the Joint Committee on European Affairs. He pointed to the draft conclusion regarding the importance of ensuring a coherent contribution of Community overseas development assistance which will be discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels next Monday.I hope the Minister will elaborate later on what he suggested in his contribution. I hope we will see concrete proposals on the setting of new and adequate ODA targets for the period 2009-10 by April of next year. That would be a step forward.

I remember, when at school, collecting pennies for the black babies. We sold the  Far East  and other mission magazines, organised raffles and did what we could.However, I was recently part of a group of parliamentarians which travelled to Zambia. The trip received wide coverage. I am sure most of Ireland knew we were there although they may not have been told exactly why. My trip to that beautiful country at a beautiful time of year left a lasting mark on me. For the first time in my life I saw real poverty. I firmly believe that there is no poverty except where there is hunger. We can speak in relative terms but we saw a beautiful country with 80% of its population in abject poverty and almost 30% suffering from AIDS.Like our own country, Zambia was colonised. Should countries which, in other times, plundered and pillaged Zambia and other African countries be made to pay an extra penalty to compensate for what was done? The Zambians are beautiful people who accept their fate very easily. Television and radio programmes and newspapers do not give an idea of the poverty of third world countries, compared with seeing it at first hand.I had the pleasure of meeting the chargé d'affaires in the Irish Embassy, Mr. Patrick Curran, who is from my county of Waterford. His work in the country with the small sum of €15 million was simply unbelievable. It is difficult even to convey the vastness of the country and I speak only about one African country.When politicians visit another country we always look at what politicians do there. It was amazing to see a constituency of 20,000 registered voters, 10,000 of whom vote. In that area of Lusaka, 800,000 people live in the most awful poverty. Much of what we saw in Zambia left a mark on me which I will never forget. I began to wonder what was Ireland's contribution and I made inquiries when I came back. A small amount of money can make a considerable difference to a hospice or an education or training centre. We saw a training centre containing 20 sewing machines where people come in shifts to be trained in the use of the machines before going out to start their own businesses.I was proud to see Ireland's contribution to that African country, from a modest beginning in 1974 to €1.8 million now. This is a wonderful contribution, although it is not enough.

However, as one who also had the honour of visiting Zambia and of seeing at first hand the work of Development Co-operation Ireland in very effective programmes across a wide spectrum under the guidance of our chargé d'affaires, Mr. Patrick Curran, I was particularly impressed with the impact Irish aid is making there.Programmes funded by Irish aid are scrutinised, their merits recognised and funds allocated accordingly. Our delegation, which included my colleague, Deputy Wilkinson, visited the department of foreign affairs where we met the deputy Minister. We emphasised to him the importance of accountability in all kinds of aid which comes from various countries to Zambia, not least from Ireland. Irish taxpayers will always want to know their funds are being used to the utmost benefit of the people for whom they are intended. The manner in which the programmes are organised through the efficiency of our embassy in Lusaka makes me confident that Irish aid is effective in Zambia.Nevertheless, I welcome the White Paper process announced by the Minister of State which will give us the opportunity to make submissions during the coming year. This will help us see how best we can target timeframes.I regret that I do not have more time to speak on this issue but I am grateful for the few moments given to me.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I wish to share time with Deputies Finian McGrath, Connolly, Gormley and Ó Snodaigh.Ba mhaith liom tacaíocht a thabhairt don tairiscint seo: gur chóir don Rialtas an gheallúint a thug an Taoiseach i Meán Fomhair 2000 ag na Náisiúin Aontaithe, go mbainfeadh Éire amach 0.7% den ioncaim náisiúnta mar chabhair do na tíortha forbarthacha. I support this motion calling on the Government to honour the absolute commitment of 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2007. The Taoiseach made this commitment in September 2000 yet in the past two years Government spending has fallen from 0.41% to 0.39% and the target of 0.7% has been reneged on.As stated by the policy officer of Christian Aid, having made the solemn commitment in September 2000 at the UN Millennium Summit, which helped get Ireland a seat on the UN Security Council, the Government is now squandering the position of global leadership on poverty it worked hard to establish. While it may promise further increases in aid in 2006 and 2007, how can anyone trust a Government that has reversed a Cabinet decision, described by the Taoiseach in Johannesburg as our absolute commitment to reaching by 2007 the UN target, thereby breaking its word to the poorest of the poor? This is the issue before us.Worse than that the Government is reneging on its commitment, which could have a domino effect. Since 1970, the United Nations has been encouraging the governments of developed countries to spend 0.7% of national wealth, or gross national income, on aid to developing countries. This amounts to just 70 cent in every €100. While just a handful of European countries have achieved the target of 0.7%, including, I believe, Denmark, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden, others have set more distant targets than Ireland, which is a critical point. If Ireland, which up to now had been giving leadership on the issue, now reneges on its goal of achieving the target by 2007, it is setting a very bad precedent for other members of the European Union to do likewise. This is one of the main reasons the commitment must be honoured now.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I find it very depressing that such a motion is before the House, as it is disgraceful for the Government to fail to honour the absolute commitment to reach the United Nations target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid. It is a scandal that the poor of the world must wait for the Government to act while other rich countries spend more on arms than it would cost to feed the 1.3 billion living in severe poverty. This is a crime against humanity. No excuse exists for the 500 million people chronically malnourished, the 1 billion without access to safe drinking water or the 840 million illiterate adults in a world full of wealth. This is a crime and I blame the collective governments of the world especially the eight richest ones.I raise this issue to give a voice to the poor and to the constituents of mine who have lobbied me on this most important matter. The time for debate is over and it is time the Government gave the 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid. Most people are angry about this matter and it should not be left to a few rock stars to try to raise funds for the poor and starving of the world. We need action starting now, which is planned effectively over a period of time. I am disappointed the Taoiseach has gone back on his word, particularly after the absolute commitment made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. I urge the Government to change its mind and support the original proposal of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid, in which case we would all win. It is never too late to change one's mind and I urge the Government to think again.This money represents a vital cog in the distribution of wealth and resources across the world. With 840 million illiterate adults in the world, we should consider examples of good practice in literacy in countries like Cuba, where an education system works for the poor and creates generations of young people that can make a positive contribution to world peace and justice. In mentioning Cuba, we should not forget the case of the Miami five, the incredible story of five men imprisoned in the United States who were fighting terrorism against their own people. I raise this issue to challenge the hypocrisy of the Bush regime and its constant undermining of poorer countries.Five Cubans who were trying to stop Miami-based terrorist groups from taking violent action against the people of Cuba were found guilty of charges ranging from murder to espionage by a court in Miami, which relied on the evidence of convicted terrorists. All are innocent of the charges brought against them. Extensive intimidation of jurors by these same convicted terrorists was a feature of the trial the Cubans are now appealing their convictions. The release and exoneration of the five victims of this obvious miscarriage of justice is sought. The campaign is dedicated to the memory of the 3,478 Cubans killed and the 2,099 maimed at the hands of US-based terrorist groups since 1959 in Cuba. I again raise this issue because of the attacks and constant undermining of poorer countries.I urge all Deputies to support the motion calling on the Government to honour its commitment to reach the United Nations target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid by 2007. I commend the motion to the House.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Addressing developing countries' indebtedness remains a crucial issue for all those working to improve the well being of poorer nations. In 2000 the Taoiseach formally announced Ireland's commitment to meeting the UN's target for overseas development aid of 0.7% of gross national income by 2007. I acknowledge that considerable progress had been made by 2002, for which an interim target of 0.45% of GNP had been set, when overseas development aid reached 0.41%. However, ominously, the level of overseas development aid remained at 0.41% in 2003, the year of the cutbacks that were not really cutbacks, but rather pauses in the rate of progress.Unfortunately this has left the Government with a lot more to do, to coin an election slogan. The Taoiseach in 2003 reiterated the Government's commitment to further increase overseas development aid and achieve the UN target of 0.7% by 2007. Unfortunately both the Government and the recipient countries are fast running out of time for this target to be achieved. Ireland has long held a firm commitment to assisting the world's poor, which has been commended by many people, including Bono, Bob Geldof and former President Mary Robinson.In this regard, I must commend the work of the former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, Deputy Kitt, now Government Chief Whip, whose own personal passion to align the level of development aid with our economic strength was never in doubt. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, observed the extent of the vast food shortages affecting the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa during his frequent visits to that continent. He frankly stated that they served as a damning indictment of our collective failure to address the needs of the most vulnerable and the needy, and he included his Government in this statement.Food shortages are caused by many factors, including poor rains resulting in harvest failure and livestock deaths on a horrific scale. The spectre of HIV-AIDS continues to devastate virtually entire populations and along with the famine it has literally plagued the continent of Africa. Zambia, which is being visited today by the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who is meeting missionaries and NGOs, witnesses an average of 150 funerals daily of people who die from HIV-AIDS.The Minister for Finance announced an increase of €60 million or 15% in Ireland's overseas development aid allocation for 2005 in the Budget Statement. This may sound significant until one realises that it comes from a relatively low base, which is already approximately 0.44% of GNP. I urge the Government to get the overseas development aid show back on the road and to aim to adopt a progressive and incremental approach towards realising the 0.7% of GNP target by 2007.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The Government has broken the promise it made on behalf of Ireland to the world's poor. We now know that rather than the 0.5% the Government promised only three weeks ago, on its own figures we will achieve only 0.43% by 2007, which is less than we were supposed to have achieved in 2002. At this rate Ireland will not reach the UN target of 0.7% until some time in the 2030s, far from the striking distance referred to by the Minister of State. In the meantime more than 8,000 people die of HIV-AIDS every day and millions go without an education. Ireland had the opportunity to lead the world in the fight against global poverty. We had the opportunity to be in the vanguard, pushing the world to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015. Now we are swiftly losing this opportunity.While the first millennium development goal of achieving gender parity in primary education by 2005 will not be met and developing countries need an extra €50 billion of financing to reach the millennium development goals, this Government is busy reneging on its promises. The excuses that last year we were too poor and this year we are too rich just do not wash. The UN target was expressed as a percentage precisely to allow for lower or higher growth. Other countries, like Sweden, that have committed to and achieved the target have no problem understanding this principle. The Government itself signed up to the principle at a time of high growth so presumably it knew what the target meant in real terms, as was spelt out in the report of the Ireland Aid review committee.Next September the UN will meet to look at progress in achieving the millennium development goals. Before the Taoiseach goes to New York, he should restore Ireland's standing by putting in place a clear timetable for achieving the 0.7% target and supporting it with legislation in the Oireachtas.The Taoiseach promised this on three separate occasions — I was there when he gave the commitment on 0.7% of GNP in Johannesburg. Is there anything we can do when a Minister or Taoiseach gives a promise like this? We can learn a lesson from our friends in Canada. Democracy Watch and the Government Ethics Coalition have called on all Canadian parties to introduce a law that makes it illegal for politicians and other public officials to lie and gives citizens an easy way to file a complaint with a new federal ethics commissioner. The legislation would give the commissioner the power to impose very high fines for lying. According to Mr. Duff Conacher, the co-ordinator of Democracy Watch, "Canadians are sick of politicians baiting voters with promises and then switching direction when they win power". Mr Conacher should come to Ireland, where lying at election time is a given for many political parties. The promise on ODA, however, is a new low because the Taoiseach used the world's poorest people as pawns in the Government's bid to get a seat on the Security Council.The Canadian idea has some merit. In Canada, if a corporation lies in its advertising, only six Canadians need to sign and send a letter to the Competition Bureau and it will investigate and determine how the corporation lied and what corrective measures are required. If any corporation or corporate executive lies to their shareholders, the shareholders have the right to go to court to seek compensation for the damage done by the lies. Again, this is not a bad idea when one considers the recent scandals at AIB Bank. I know the Taoiseach has explained that he did not get into politics for the money but if this proposed legislation was introduced here, he would certainly be declared bankrupt and would have to leave politics. This is a man who seems to promise, and unkinder souls may even say lie, with impunity.

Bertie Ahern, mar Thaoiseach, do chruinniú mullaigh na mílaoise i 2000, dul i léig.

It will not even reach the pre-election promise of 0.45% for 2002. By the Government's own figures for economic growth, released as part of the budget, aid will only reach 0.43% by 2007. When we analyse the figures for GNP and the ODA allocations, we realise that the Government is really committed to allocating less than 0.4% for next year with very slight increases after that. We have already seen what its commitments are worth.This can be at best seen as the tiniest temperature fluctuation in the ODA freeze we have endured since this Government took office. There can be no more excuses. I can state unequivocally that in Government, we will achieve the minimum of 0.7% of GNP for official development assistance as an expression of our political will to ensure Ireland does its part to meet the development goals that would cut global poverty by half by 2015. That is a commitment.We are talking about poverty and meeting UN targets. The Minister came in here and quoted figures of how great an increase there will be. If the Exchequer has increased funding to tread water, the amount spent on official development aid will increase in line with that but, because we are the fourth wealthiest nation in the world and the second wealthiest in Europe, for us to achieve the percentage as set out by the Taoiseach in 2000, there must be a substantial increase in the funding we grant to the ODA budget.I concur with the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who pointed out last night that previous Fine Gael-Labour coalition Governments failed to lead in this issue. Hopefully we will see more commitment in the future and the spend will increase.We are not just looking for a commitment on this side of the House, we need the Government to live up to the commitments it made at an international summit. It was not Deputy Gormley, Deputy Allen or I who made the commitment, it was the Government and it has shamed us internationally by refusing to live up to it. That commitment is like the Taoiseach's commitment to socialism, it is not genuine, it is not worth the words that came out of his mouth. That has been proven time and again and it has been proven on this issue that is so important for the millions around the world who are dependent on us, the wealthiest nations in the world that are supposed to lead by example and to give the money so these countries can develop and enjoy the fruits we have enjoyed.

No other issue has seen Members of this House as united in condemnation of the Government than the reneging on a promise made to the poorest of the world.Regardless of party or politics, those of us who care about the less well off were proud of the fact that our Taoiseach, on a world stage, led the way and made a commitment on behalf of Ireland. Unfortunately, it looks as if the Taoiseach's only commitment was to get a seat on the United Nations Security Council. The fact that so many African countries supported our candidature was proof that they believed the commitment he made.Was the issue discussed at Cabinet before the Taoiseach made that commitment and, if so, was there a further Cabinet discussion before the decision was made to renege on that promise?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	392	That is a good question. Will the Minister of State answer it?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I congratulate the former Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on her straight talking. She stood up as Minister of State at a time when there were questions over the Government's commitment to the Third World. I will be interested to see how she carries through on her statement when the vote is taken. As she said, education — apart from actual gifts — in the Third World such as Africa, is so important. We have a major commitment to that, as has been shown in the past by missionaries from all churches. When a commitment is made by the Taoiseach they deserve to know they can stand over it. The former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, was also extremely committed and like Deputy O'Donnell he made it clear we should meet our targets. However, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is happy to go out and stand in the middle of Africa and inform us there is no way the Government will meet its commitments. There is a massive difference in the attitude of the Ministers now in office.It is vital given that the economy is progressing reasonably well, a matter in which we can all take pride, that we must also be able to take pride in looking after the poorest of the poor. Not long ago we were exporting 40,000 of our people to London, Birmingham, Canada and so on and the difficulties being experienced by some of them should be examined with a view to helping them financially. Any voluntary group that seeks help for the Third World gets a generous reaction from the people. If the Government did the same I do not think there would be an outcry or any resignations from the House. I beg the Government to re-examine the issue. To say the money, if given, could not be handled is bunkum.

That the motion is before the House is an indication of the problem that has arisen in the current Administration. The whole issue arises from one of broken promises, a solemn undertaking given to achieve a certain commitment in regard to Ireland's contribution to overseas development aid, not only to this House but throughout the world for a particular purpose. Then something extraordinary happened. The Minister designate, before he was properly appointed, indicated that the budget for his Department should be cut. That is the first time in the history of the State that an incoming Minister decided the budget for his Department should be cut before he took up office. He tried to justify that afterwards but there are more serious implications.There is also the creation of the image of Ireland. A promise was given by the Taoiseach, the Government and the former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who had given a commitment that Ireland would achieve a certain standard in setting the pace for others to follow. The effect was that the potential recipients of overseas development aid could look at the international map and say that Ireland, a country that knew and understood the position, was prepared to a make a commitment. What a disappointment for them when they heard that the Minister said he should have less money, that he could not spend it all.According to the Government, Ireland is one of the happiest countries of the world. We are among the top ten wealthiest countries. What message does the Government attitude convey to those in need throughout the world when, given our previous solemn promise, we have decided to change our attitude? That is a bad vibe and a bad decision and is in keeping with the previous decisions of the Government.All Members recognise the needs of those in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and elsewhere. It is sad that there is a question mark over whether the aid that was deemed necessary initially is necessary. At this time in our history it is pertinent to recognise that we may have poverty here. There are situations of deprivation, despite the riches the Government thinks we should all indulge in on a regular basis. There are people in other parts of the world who are in the throes in poverty, the extent of which we can only imagine. It is a sad reality that we recognise, or more properly fail to recognise, the people who would be in a good position to help, having been in that position not so long ago. In the past 150 years we have been in that position many times and we, more than anybody else on this planet, should know what it is like to be without, to want, to appeal to the outer community for help. We would expect that the Irish Government would be able to respond favourably in that situation. It is a source of great disappointment that we are in this position.I pay tribute to the former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs who had responsibility for this area. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will not comment but I wish to give her credit for what she has done to date. While I understand what she has to do tonight, I would like her to vote with the motion. The fact remains that the standard she has set is a need that was already identified by people here and abroad.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I could not quite believe the decision of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to so soon in office abandon some of the core values of the Irish programme. As a former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, our programme is one everybody in Ireland can look at with pride as something positive that has been achieved. When Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government on their own in the late 1980s the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, savaged the aid programme to the point where it all but disappeared. When the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil took office in 1992 one of the points of agreement in the formation of the Government was to systematically increase the spend on aid to bring our contribution up to the 0.7% level.Governments of all persuasions and combinations have enthusiastically attempted to honour the commitment since that time, until the recent reshuffle when Deputy Conor Lenihan was appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for this area. I refer to the rainbow coalition and the coalitions between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats since 1997. There were significant increases in this country's overseas development aid budget when those Governments were in power. All parties in the House have given a commitment to further development in this area.I was concerned by comments made recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, during a debate on RTE about the advocacy work of organisations like Trócaire and Concern. I will put my cards on the table by reminding the House that Trócaire was involved in advocacy when, along with many Irish people, it helped to develop an understanding in Ireland of the nature of apartheid.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	399	That is what advocacy is all about. Trócaire and Concern have informed Irish people about what it is like to live in poor, developing countries and have explained how such problems might be remedied. If the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has reservations about advocacy, I invite him to spell them out. The neo-con agenda, which originates in the United States, views advocacy in respect of global human rights, such as the right to economic and social development, as worthy in some way of being viewed with disfavour. I hope the Minister of State has not based his views on advocacy on the ideas of neo-con writers on the issue in the United States. If he has taken his opinions from such people, it is a bad omen for the Irish aid programme, which enjoyed cross-party support in the House from 1992 until now. The Minister of State referred to the production of a White Paper on this matter. I hope the opportunity presented by that process will be used to revive the promises the Government has badly broken and to renew the commitment it freely entered into.I know certain people inside and outside Iveagh House think it would be difficult, if not impossible, to spend properly the expanded aid budget which would be available if we decided to meet the 0.7% commitment. The comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, suggest that he believes that is the case. As a former development worker and a former Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I think such an argument is absolute piffle and rubbish.

We could also invest significantly, perhaps as a memorial to the missionaries about whom many Deputies rightly speak with pride, in the training of teachers, doctors and nurses in the many African countries which face development challenges. If the Minister of State were to embark on such an ambitious investment programme, he would not have any problem spending 0.7% of GNP. If he continues to have difficulties in finding things to spend the funds on, we will do it for him.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion. I commend my colleague, Deputy Allen, for tabling the motion before the House.Ireland has a positive reputation for responding to international crises and assisting under-developed countries. The OECD development assistance committee has commended Ireland for its sharp focus on poverty reduction. All well-off countries face the huge challenge of making an impact and improving the quality of life of the poorest people on earth.Like some other Members, I recently visited Zambia to see the excellent work being done by Development Co-operation Ireland. Ireland's bilateral aid to Zambia, which has a population of 10.8 million, amounted to €14.65 million in 2003. That money was well worth spending. HIV-AIDS is arguably the greatest threat to overcoming the chronic poverty experienced by 80% of Zambia's population. DCI has had a strategy of supporting those affected and infected by HIV-AIDS at all levels, from household to national level. It supported orphans and vulnerable children in two of Zambia's nine provinces in 2003. During my visit to Zambia, I visited an AIDS hospice in Lusaka. I will never forget the image of a young mother and her son, both of whom had been infected with the HIV virus.I commend the work done by many Irish missionaries who work tirelessly in remote regions throughout the world. I had an opportunity to meet many of the missionaries, whose work often goes unnoticed, during my visit to Zambia. Some of them are teaching there and others are working with AIDS, irrigation and communications projects. Members of the House are the missionaries' voice in this country. Overseas aid is the most practical way in which the Irish people, through the Government, can assist those who need help most.Deputy Allen was correct to say last night that 8,000 people die from AIDS every day. Some 25% of the population of Zambia suffer from AIDS. Money and education are needed to curtail the disease, which is the biggest obstacle to reducing poverty and achieving the millennium development goals. Our capacity to respond at all levels depends on strong leadership and the allocation of adequate resources. Similarly, malaria is a major killer in the world's poor regions.The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has argued that Ireland's total overseas aid package will be worth €1.8 billion over the next three years. He acknowledges that we will not reach the 0.7% target, but his claim that we will be within "striking distance" of the figure by 2007 is not good enough. The Minister of State has started his first ministerial visit to a Third World country, where he will see poverty, disease stricken areas and, above all, the significant work being done by Irish people, including missionaries. When he returns, I hope he will have had a change of heart. He should seek increased funding from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen.I commend the Minister of State's predecessors, Deputies Kitt and O'Donnell, who did tremendous work in the overseas development area. The work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has been commended by officials from other countries. The Government's stance in this regard, which is not good enough, is setting a bad example for other countries. Following a successful EU Presidency, it is a shame that the Government has reneged on its promise. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to think again about this important matter. The Taoiseach promised at the United Nations millennium summit in 2000 that Ireland would meet its target, a commitment that he reiterated at the global summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in 2002. I commend Deputy Allen for bringing this motion to the House.

Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an díospóireacht a bhí againn anocht agus aréir. Tacaím leis an oráid a thug an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Conchúir Ó Luineacháin, sa Teach aréir. I express my appreciation, and that of my ministerial and departmental colleagues, of the contributions to this important debate from those on all sides of the House. It is clear the House is united in its support for the Government's development co-operation programme. It is united in its determination to ensure that Ireland continues to play a meaningful and important role in combating global poverty and the marginalisation of many millions from the benefits of social, economic and political inclusion.In light of the various statistics which have appeared in the media, it is important to reiterate that the level of development assistance provided by the Government is at an historic high and is destined to be even higher in the years to come. It is important for people to understand that we are gradually moving up the ladder.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Ireland's current spending in this area of approximately €475 million puts it in the top league of donors. Its allocation is well above the EU average as a percentage of GNP and the increase of €190 million over the next three years will ensure that it maintains this high position. The way we spend money in the developing world is as important as providing the money. The quality of our programme has been lauded internationally and the work of Irish development workers and NGOs warrants substantial international respect.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	415	When the executive director of the World Food Programme visited Ireland during our EU Presidency, he specifically referred to the humanitarian work of the many Irish NGOs operating in the field. Much of this humanitarian endeavour is being funded by the Government's development programme. We are also funding the key UN agencies, such as the World Food Programme. This agency is a key partner for Ireland and we can safely say we have assisted it in saving thousands, if not millions, of lives in recent years.I received a personal letter from the director of the World Food Programme thanking me for my contribution as former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, complimenting Ireland on its significant contribution to overseas development aid and looking forward to more such contributions.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	417	It is dated 24 November 2004. The director regards Ireland as one of the World Food Programme's closest partners and recognises its positive programmes and absolute commitment to continuing to increase the resources we make available to the World Food Programme and overseas development aid on a consistent basis. In any analysis of a country's development programme, it is not sufficient to look solely at overall aid flows in terms of cash and percentages. It is also necessary to consider where and how development funds are spent. Our development programme is totally untied, in line with best practice. This means the goods and services provided represent best value and often help to establish local service providers. We do not link our aid to Irish goods and services, nor do we place conditions on cash transfers or set up obstacles thereto.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The issue of HIV-AIDS was raised during the debate. I fully subscribe to the view that the HIV-AIDS pandemic represents the single greatest challenge to social and economic progress in the developing world. How can progress be achieved when so many teachers, health workers and public servants are stricken with the virus? The private sector, which must, in the final analysis, provide the engine of growth in poor countries, is also deeply constrained by the effects of the syndrome. A whole generation has been orphaned in countries such as Zambia and Zimbabwe. Ireland is playing a key role in international and local efforts to combat this scourge.Combating HIV-AIDS represents the greatest single thematic expenditure across our aid programme. We are working at every level in this regard, from vaccine research to local education and community care. We will expend almost €50 million on HIV-AIDS in 2004. Deputies will be aware of our efforts to raise awareness of HIV-AIDS during our EU Presidency. One example of this was the major HIV-AIDS conference organised by the Presidency last February. We will continue to ensure that HIV-AIDS continues to be afforded the utmost priority in the aid programme.If one adds the €475 million committed to overseas development aid in 2004, the commitments in this regard for the next three years and our contribution of €6 million to the World Food Programme in 2004, one will note that over the next four years, Ireland will make an official contribution of some €2.3 billion to overseas development aid and the World Food Programme. We must all be very proud of this.Deputy Burton stated that every Government, of all colours, made significant increases to overseas development aid and she criticised the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan. However, the Minister of State has secured an increase of 15% for next year. This is surely significant and will amount to €1.8 billion over the next three years, or €2.3 billion over the next four years. This is significant money in anyone's language. The Minister of State should be congratulated on this achievement and not castigated.I pay tribute to Deputy Burton, a former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for overseas development aid who has experience as a development aid worker. However, our overseas development aid contribution has increased by 500% since she was in power——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	426	However, she did not break her word.

I acknowledge the disappointment felt in the House, and beyond, that we will not reach the target by 2007. Deputies will be fully aware that the Estimates process is a difficult one and the Exchequer faces many competing and deserving demands. The increases obtained are very sizeable, amounting to the largest in our history. In addition, we have received a three-year commitment, which provides an excellent opportunity for careful planning and implementation.Some Deputies have raised the issue of establishing a legislative basis for the target. We have considered this suggestion. I am not convinced of the merits of this possible course of action. Enshrining expenditure commitments in legislation could create precedents that could be invoked in many areas of expenditure. The Government requires flexibility to manage the economy and has the constitutional right and responsibility to do so.The large aid increases outlined in the recent budget are the minimum now available to us. I fully support the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, in his efforts——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	434	This motion is about a debt of honour owed by the Irish people to the poorest of the world. In 2000, our Taoiseach committed this country and its people to increasing official development assistance to 0.7% of GNP. As I stated in the House last week, the Government has made much of this promise. Many plaudits have been bestowed on Government, many bows have been taken and many photo-calls have resulted.However unthinkable it may be that we should break our promise under such circumstances, it is not the cost to Ireland's international reputation that concerns me most, but the breach of faith with the poorest of the world's poor. In international relations, nations are often judged on their economic, military or diplomatic prowess, but in the affairs of people we are judged not on how we deal with those who can do us good or ill but on how we treat those who have no means of compelling our good treatment. Ireland is a country with a deep commitment to humanitarian action across the globe. From Afghanistan to Zambia and everywhere in between, Irish people are engaged in development work in the world's poorest countries. Some have gone to these countries in the uniform of this State, wearing the blue beret of the United Nations. More than 40,000 Irish soldiers have served the causes of peace and peace-keeping in some of the most difficult arenas of the world and many have died. Other people have travelled to the countries in question in the habit of a religious order while others have vested themselves in the simple cloak of common humanity.In recent weeks, we became all too aware of the work undertaken by people with Irish connections in both Afghanistan and Iraq and of the risks they run. There is a certain irony in the fact that the Irish were so moved by the death of Margaret Hassan and so aware of the humanitarian work she was doing. The irony lies in the fact that, at almost exactly the same time as the Government was making extensive and genuine efforts to save the life of Mrs. Hassan, it was breaking its promise to the people of the developing world.As I stated last week, Irish people have gone to help the world in countless numbers and their contribution has been incalculable. It is long past time that the State matched their contribution with an enduring financial commitment. Let there be no misunderstanding that this is not a matter regarding which the Government would have to persuade the Opposition. There is total support, across all parties, for doing whatever it takes to meet and keep meeting the UN target. Ever since the commitment was first made in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, published by my predecessor, Dick Spring, and augmented by Deputy O'Donnell and the Taoiseach, this issue has not been contentious, nor was it contentious when the Government put a date on the realisation of the UN target. It is therefore all the more inexplicable that the Government has chosen to abandon the target against that background. If the Government said that because it was determined to meet the UN target it would have to cut back on some other aspects of our representation abroad or even the entertainment budget, we would not have argued with that. It is long past time that our national contribution to official development assistance was removed from the annual haggling of the Estimates process. I do not agree with the Minister of State's point about ring-fencing it by legislation.As a nation and a society we can and must decide on the portion of our national income that we will devote to overseas development aid each year. We should set that portion aside each year. Accordingly, I proposed and am sorry the Government will not take up the suggestion that Ireland's overseas development aid should be made a charge on the central fund, as with the national pension reserve fund, which would be a fixed proportion of gross national product to be paid over each year to a national overseas development aid fund from which development aid should be disbursed. If it cannot all be wisely spent in one year, it can be spent in the next. Any funds not spent on Ireland's aid programmes can be contributed to UN-led efforts such as the global fund on HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria. The fund would also be in a position to disburse aid to areas of crisis such as Darfur.The Labour Party will maintain the campaign on this issue. Tomorrow we will launch a postcard campaign under the title, Let Them Know It's Christmas, to make the public as aware as possible that this Government is reneging on a solemn commitment even though there is no need to do so.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I congratulate Deputy Allen on moving this motion on overseas development aid, and the Labour Party and Green Party for the contributions they have made in joining this effort.The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, once famously, and with some irritation, said in this House: "I wonder how many different ways we have to say ‘no' for people to get the message." He was referring to the release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, but he and his Government protested too much because it is clear now that the Government's constantly repeated "no" really meant "yes".When it comes to overseas development aid, however, the opposite holds true. That assumes that, given the events of recent days, the words "true" and "this Government" could be used in the same sentence. We might have seen half the Cabinet on their feet, at home and abroad, wondering this time how many ways they have to say "yes" for people to get the message that they were serious about meeting their overseas development aid target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. For the past five years the Government's answer has been "yes". As the Taoiseach put it in Argentina, Ireland is putting its money where its mouth is.The Government said "yes" at the Millennium Summit, in Argentina a year later and in Johannesburg a year after that. In the same year, 2002, it said "yes" in the programme for Government and in the progress report a few months ago, in Sustaining Progress, to the United Nations in New York, in the human development report, to the World Association of Newspapers congress and to the Dáil. A few weeks ago, in the salubrious surroundings of Dublin Castle I watched the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, look the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, in the eye and tell him, in all the solemn splendour surrounding him, that this Government would definitely meet its target of spending 0.7% of GNP on overseas development aid.The truth was definitely "no". When it became clear that the nos had it, we were treated to another round of some in the Progressive Democrats Party behaving like the Opposition, as if the Government in which the smaller partner exists symbiotically had nothing to do with them. The notable exception to this was Deputy O'Donnell. Speaking on overseas development aid the Tánaiste said: "My strong view is that we cannot abandon one commitment without having an alternative commitment." What is that commitment? A few weeks ago, she spoke about overseas development aid in the disgraceful context of: "the many competing demands in the area of disability, health care and so on".That attitude is best summed up by the woman with a disability who contacted my office after hearing those remarks and said she was outraged that people with disabilities were referred to as a competing demand. She asked why two sectors, overseas development aid and disability, should be linked in any way, shape or form and whether the horse-racing industry was not a competing demand. She said she was ashamed that this country had not honoured its commitment to developing countries, but that she would not accept that the disability sector had anything to do with it.The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs Deputy Conor Lenihan wanted to inject some realism, as he put it, into this debate. This is the realism. In the course of this ten minute contribution, 60 children will die of a vaccine-preventable illness and 80 babies under a month old will die worldwide. By the time I finish at 8.30 p.m., ten African children will have died of measles, 450,000 of whom die of it every year. Every minute I or anybody else stands speaking in this House, at least one woman in the developing countries will die in childbirth. Every 30 seconds a child dies of malaria. Today, 8,000 people will die of AIDS. By the end of this year, just like every year, whooping cough will have killed 300,000 children and diarrhoea 600,000 more under the age of five years. In 2001, tetanus alone killed 200,000 new-borns and 30,000 mothers. That is realism.It is the kind of realism that makes the self-congratulatory tone of Government contributions to the debate all the more distasteful. It is the realism that people in developing countries do not so much live with but die of every day. It is clear from what I and others in the Opposition have said that overseas aid is not charity; it is justice, freedom, health, education, opportunity and responsibility. Today is 8 December, the official start to the Christmas season. There are 17 shopping days to Christmas and, while half the world is at risk from obesity, the other half is dying of hunger.What we give in aid now and have promised to give is a minuscule fraction of our wealth. The spin that, proportionately, our aid levels are up, diminishes not just the Government but all of us as a nation. It is only 150 years since the Famine which claimed millions of Irish people through death and emigration. When we consider how far we have come and think how much we have 150 years on, should we not be the first to lead by example, reach out and allocate the 0.7% of GNP which the Government committed in our name on the world stage to the world's poorest, most helpless people? It is our moral duty and is nothing more than our wealth, privilege and commitment oblige us to do. When John Donne wrote "I am involved in mankind", he meant all of us.The millennium development goals are realistic and achievable. Halving poverty and hunger, providing education for all, improving standards of health, halting the spread of major diseases such as HIV-AIDS and slowing down the degradation of our environment in the next ten years are all eminently achievable if the political will exists. If we do not meet our stated target, far from using the excuse that everyone else is doing it, so why not us, we should not give just the 0.7% of GNP promised but should actively campaign for other countries to follow our lead.We would do well to remember where we came from. Europe received $75 billion worth of aid from America after the Second World War. I would like to see the European Union mobilise global action and resources for health research so that we can target developing countries and prevent both the spread of and death from diseases such as malaria, TB and HIV-AIDS. These diseases that mainly affect developing counties receive only a tiny fraction of the current drug-research budgets, and it is painfully obvious that a breakthrough in the treatment of these diseases could save millions of lives. Someone said to me recently that the OECD countries have gone over the horizon from the Third World countries in terms of development.Of the 1,400 pharmaceutical entities produced in the recent years, only ten have resonance for developing countries and, of that ten, only two apply to people. We could do a great deal more in spending the money we have and co-ordinating European focus and concentration on dealing with the causes of pestilence, disease, crop failure and so on. The future of the developing countries is our responsibility. Every child who dies and every little girl who does not get a chance to go to school simply because she is a little girl is not the business of somebody else, it is ours. Our choices affect their lives. That is the realism. The Government is happy to leave it to someone else, but we are not, and I am sure that large numbers of people in the country share our position. There is certainly work to do in streamlining the reach and delivery capacity of the various aid organisations. Notwithstanding that, it is a small world, and in that small world there is no such thing as other people's children, they are all our children and our responsibility. I urge the Government to honour the absolute commitment made to reach the UN target by 2007. I support the calls from various Opposition benches and the motion introduced by Deputy Allen. We have a duty to introduce legislation, to operate in a similar way to the national pension reserve fund, to place a statutory obligation on any Irish Government to allocate a sum of 0.7% of GNP from the Exchequer towards ODA annually. That is a good basis for us, when asked Seamus Heaney's question "Who is my brother?", to answer truly and honestly that everyone is.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I referred to the provision of child care in communities and highlighted the difficulties facing people trying to access it. The extra provision in child benefit alone will not address the problem of the scarcity of child care facilities. The lack of such facilities is predominantly due to the scarcity of resources in this area. If we continue to invest in child benefit without providing sufficient child care places, all we will do is inflate prices and price providers of such facilities at the lower end of the scale out of the market. I urge local authorities to ensure that planning permissions for such facilities are expedited and that people are encouraged, through whatever mechanism possible, in urban and large residential areas, to apply for planning permission for a five or six place child care facility to enable them to provide such facilities in their communities. We have focused for too long on large-scale child care facilities. If we go down the route of encouraging the provision of such facilities in communities, it would be more beneficial. The Government has decided that child benefit provision is the way forward in accessing child care facilities, but until such time as we address the shortage of spaces, a major problem confronts us.Having regard to the context in which the budget was introduced, we must pay tribute to the Minister for Finance, in particular, for the provision for people with disabilities. That must be acknowledged in this House. While I am dealing with the child care provision, the budgetary package for people with disabilities is a positive step in addressing the myriad problems faced by parents with children with an intellectual or physical disability. This package is worthwhile and welcome. The Minister said such provision will constitute a guaranteed fund for the years going forward. That will enable people in this area to make budgetary plans. It will enable the Department and the health boards to ensure that people in this area who need support can access it on an ongoing basis. People in this area simply voiced their concern on many occasions over the years because they did not have the necessary resources or time to be more involved because of the difficulties they faced in putting their children through education and raising them as best they could. I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance, in particular, for the provision for people with disabilities.Many people have admitted that this social welfare package has been positive in that it seeks to address those who are most in need. That has been acknowledged by many people, including Opposition members.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The debates on this Bill and on the budget indicate that there is a perception that we can continually fund social welfare. Equally, we must ensure we have a mechanism in place to finance it. The Government has been very positive in ensuring that we have a vibrant economy, low unemployment, low taxation and an incentive to work, invest and create employment. It has taken steps to ensure that the moneys raised can be distributed as outlined in the package of social welfare improvements delivered by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.I refer to one or two points made by the Labour Party. I have a major difficulty with its description of the new medical card as a yellow-pack medical card. That is an affront to anybody who is finding it difficult to access primary medical care. There are 100,000 medical cards in place that allow people to go, free of charge, to their GP and access advice and medical care. Statistics show that many people do not have to go further than a consultation with their GP and are happy to be secure in the knowledge that they can go to their local GP whenever they have a major health concern. It is totally disingenuous of the Labour Party to dismiss this as another stunt. If we are serious about being socially inclusive, we should try to ensure that as many people as possible can access services when they fall on hard times. Equally, there are many people who fall just above the threshold of eligibility for a medical card, and the announcement on medical cards will be welcomed by many families who are finding it difficult to afford primary medical care.

If people are sick they can now access their family GP free of charge. That is a wonderfully positive step. I encourage the Government to ensure on an ongoing basis that as many people as possible are included in that scheme. Moreover, more than 30,000 people hold medical cards in their own right.

That is why he is over there and we are over here. The reason there are fewer people with medical cards is that more people are at work. More people are above the threshold for qualification simply because they are in a position to generate their own income.

That puts paid to the lie that the Government does not cater for people on low incomes. It introduced the minimum wage, which was a positive step. It has now achieved a situation where nobody on the minimum wage is in the tax net. That should be welcomed by everybody.Social housing was mentioned. Politicians of all hues have responsibilities in this area. There are cases across this country in which public representatives are the ones delaying the delivery of social housing. I have been at meetings where public representatives objected to the provision of social housing.

I know of local authority members who say they will accept affordable housing but not social housing. It is damaging local authorities' ability to draw down funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for social housing. That attitude is negative and it is creeping into all political parties. A previous speaker mentioned that the provision of social housing has been delayed. I know, not only from anecdotal evidence but from direct involvement, that representatives from all political parties are involved in trying to play all sides of the scrum. That issue must be addressed.The issue of carers has been debated for a long time. Everybody acknowledges that those who care for the elderly and those with disabilities make a huge sacrifice. They also give service to the State. Any person who gives service to the State in an unselfish manner should be rewarded. Changes have been made. The respite care grant has been increased to €1,000. The issue of carers must be addressed on an ongoing basis. Everybody acknowledges the work carers do in their homes in caring for their loved ones. That they are providing a service for the State must be acknowledged. I am sure that over the next few years that will be done.We must accept some important facts. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has sat through this debate and listened attentively to all sides. One common idea has come out in this debate and that is that if we continue to pursue the policies this side of the House recommends, they will go a long way towards achieving social inclusion. If we pursued the policies advocated by those on the other side of the House, we would have a chaotic situation regarding public finances. Some parties say the Government is spending money in a way that is not achieving the productivity levels they would like. Other parties opposite are selectively saying they will be the de facto opposition. It is timely to remind people on that side of the House that they have a duty not merely to criticise, undermine and make accusations, but to put forward policies and prioritise the areas in which they are interested.

It is about the measures that have been put in place by the Minister to help people who, for whatever reason, cannot support themselves. Reference was made to the important point that these are not just handouts but entitlements. Irish citizens are entitled to the support of the State, the taxpayer and the Government to ensure they can live their lives if, for whatever reason, they fall on hard times. The Minister made reference to this important message in his contribution when he stated this issue is not about statistics or throwing out facts but about real people and the impact payments have on their lives. This often gets lost in debates. We talk about statistics, figures and facts but what we are trying to do is ensure that——

Encouraging people to save and make pension provisions, and ensuring they will have a reasonable standard of living in their later years, are positive developments. However, they have been completely overlooked. While I listen to Members asking why we have not done one thing or another, the savings scheme is a positive step and a measure which has encouraged people to save. In years to come we will reap the dividends of the fund for public service pensions. We must consider the issues in the context of today but must also analyse the figures going forward to ensure we have an economy that can support an ageing population as demographics change.

The Bill is extraordinary. I listened to Deputy Kelleher extolling the virtues of the current Minister and the former Minister. I should not mention that there might be some ideological block between the two. Nonetheless, I congratulate the incoming Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, on the red colour of his tie, which I am sure is an indication of an ideological intention that was not shown in the Bill. I presume he has intentions to produce other social welfare Bills but on the basis of this performance, he could be in difficulty.

The Bill is unique because it comes as a result of the miracle of Inchydoney, where Fr. Seán Healy spoke to the multitudes. The multitudes were convinced that the people had been wronged. Why else would Fr. Healy have been asked to talk to the multitudes, calm them and assuage their fears? It went throughout the land that there was a problem and that somebody should come to help. Lo and behold, along came poor Fr. Healy. Now, however, Fr. Healy is being blamed for the budget and for the lack of delivery on social welfare and every other area. How did the Government plan this and get away with it? Why should poor Fr. Healy, an innocent victim of circumstances, be blamed for the inability of the Government to deliver on its promises, which is what it amounts to?I believe in the Damascus-type conversion, so far as it goes. I believe in the conversion of the Taoiseach and the equally incredible conversion of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to socialism.

However, I cannot understand why everybody is under the impression that all issues have been resolved, including those in regard to housing, social welfare and inequity. Nothing has been resolved because, sadly, everything is the same.The budget and the Bill are non-events, but this fact will not percolate to the people for a couple of weeks. However, after Christmas, when the public suddenly discovers what this means for them, they will find that the social welfare increases have long since been eroded by increases in the cost of living which are now regarded as incredible.

I am amazed that a Member on that side of the House would refer to it. The Government is good at giving history lessons in regard to 1997. I am surprised it does not go back to 1977, 1877, 1677 or earlier because the comparisons it makes do not relate to the present. The Government boasts about the country being awash with money and having money to spend on anything. What does it spend, however? Nothing. It has delivered nothing in regard to social housing, affordable housing or carers. The general public and people with disabilities will have to wait three more years before the Government is out of office and any delivery is made.I will address the savage 16 atrocities committed against the unsuspecting Irish public one year ago. A series of cuts were enforced by Government across the board. What happened? In the past week, I received a request from my local health board, as agents for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to find accommodation for €500 per month for a person with a serious illness. The only accommodation I could find in my constituency for €500 per month was a condemned house. What does this mean and what does the Minister think of it? Why was no direction given in the budget to address this serious issue caused by the cuts imposed one year ago which have not been reversed? The Minister knows well they have not been addressed.

There is no one to whom they can talk and anything they say or do will have no effect on what happens to them.The 16 cuts were allegedly reversed in the budget but, sadly, they were not. That is in keeping with most of the Government's performance. Everything it has promised in the past seven years has not been delivered. It has failed under every heading. It has claimed anything positive which has happened in the past seven years to be of its doing. The only thing for which the Government did not claim responsibility was the good weather last summer.

Unless some attention is paid to that area, the next generation will be added to the 100,000 or so people who are desperate for a house. I do not know what will happen in the next generation nor do those opposite because the problem is dire and it will get worse.When I first got involved in public life, people lived in caravans in the hope that they would get a local authority house. The only thing which has changed is that people are living in high rent accommodation and they are getting no support from the Government, and they will be there for the rest of their lives because they will never be able to buy a house——

I am not a socialist but I believe in social justice. Instead of those opposite professing socialism, it is about time there was recognition of the need to apply social justice.The Special Olympics were held here a year ago. There is talk of the emphasis of the Government on the needs of people with disabilities and their carers. I am afraid the Social Welfare Bill and the budget were a disappointment in that respect. The people with disabilities include the elderly who have urgent needs. If they manage to live for another three or four years, there might be some recognition of their position by whatever Government is in power then. I know what it is like for people who are elderly, who have urgent needs and who may not have a long time to live. Some time ago, I dealt with a case of a person who had a pressing need for the disabled person's grant which required a report from the occupational therapist in the local health board. Eventually the grant was refused on the basis that the person was not in dire enough need. Subsequent to my objections and those of other public representatives, including Members opposite, a visit was made to the individual concerned who was told that her need was not sufficient to warrant the granting of a disabled person's grant at that stage.In a country which professes to be among the top ten wealthiest countries in the world——

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I thank my colleague for sharing time. I am glad to have the opportunity to address the Social Welfare Bill and that the Minister is here because in my 15 years as a Member of the House, he is one of those who listens to and takes note of what people have to say and may make changes on the basis of what they say.There are many pleasing aspects to this budget about which many people have spoken glowingly. This budget was well designed to appease many of the interest groups and to get them off the playing pitch so that they would not criticise it. However, there is a number of items in the budget we should note and about which we should ask the Minister to give an explanation as to why he took certain decisions and what amending decisions he might take.I do not understand why, when the general social welfare increase was €14 per week for individuals, old age pensioners received an increase of only €12. The Minister might say the difference between €12 and €14 is not much, but it is €100 per year. Why are we treating elderly citizens, the people who have built this country, differently from everyone else on social welfare? Most people on the old age pension are getting contributory pensions. They have paid for them by paying their stamps. They are drawing on the insurance scheme to which they contributed over the years. Why are they not entitled to a suitable increase like everybody else? The Minister should note that the social insurance fund has a surplus of €1.6 billion and it will have an even greater surplus this year. Why did the Minister deprive the pensioners of that measly €2 extra per week?The child dependant allowance has been raised by many commentators and was flagged clearly in the run-up to the budget as an issue about which something needed to be done. The child dependant allowance has remained the same since the early 1990s. There is a number of anomalies in respect of it. The first ridiculous one is that there are three different rates —€16.80, €19.60 and €21.60. On the face of it, one might say that is not much of a difference, but it makes a difference to families. There can be a difference of €250 between what is paid to one family to look after its child and what is paid to another family to do likewise. Strangely, it is based on the payment made to parents. If one is unemployed, one's child is worth €16.80 per week, if one is a widow, one's child is worth €19.60 per week and if one is an invalid, I think, one's child is worth €21.60 per week. When I raised this before, the Minister got a note from the officials to say that it is not too bad because there used to be 35 different rates of child dependant allowance and now there are only three. I hope the Minister does not give me that response again.Another answer which is sometimes given is that it was a disincentive to work, but I do not accept that. Perhaps at one time it was a disincentive but then we introduced the back to work allowance which the Government has tried to cut back. The back to work allowance took into account the child dependant allowance and it was a bonus for those going back to work because they received 75% of that allowance for the first year. It was not a disincentive to people going back to work so we must scrap that idea. All the independent commentators have said the child dependant allowance should have been addressed. Why was it not addressed? Will the Minister do so on the next occasion?I outlined the situation in respect of carers the last day. Carers feel terribly let down but there is light at the end of the tunnel. As I read it, the Government has given absolute guarantees, if they are worth anything, to give anyone who is a full-time carer and not working outside the home the respite care grant of €1,000 per year even if they are not getting the carer's allowance. The Carers Association says there are approximately 140,000 carers in the country. We are recognising something like 22,000 people through the social welfare system. By increasing the income disregard, the Minister will take in another 1,000 or 1,400. If 25,000 are covered in that way it will leave about 115,000 or 120,000 who will receive nothing, although according to the association they are carers. If we take what the Minister is saying at face value, he will give those people the respite grant. If that is the case, it will cost him €120 million per annum but he has allocated only €9 million. On that basis, the Minister will be providing the respite grant to 9,000 people.

We get all sorts of history lessons here about what happened in 1997 but the Minister should look back to what occurred in 2001 and what the previous Minister committed himself to at that time. He said that was stage one of a three-phase payment that will raise child benefit to a particular level. The commitment was honoured in the first and second years but in the third, fourth and fifth years the level has not even reached the original commitment for year three. That is very disappointing.We need to examine what has happened regarding the so-called savage cuts. The back to education scheme was tremendously successful but the previous Minister, Deputy Coughlan, messed it up. The new Minister has gone some way towards mending it. I ask him to take the final step back to reinstate the six-month eligibility limit.Unemployment benefit is an insurance scheme. People agree to pay stamps towards the rainy day when they might be unemployed. The savage 16 cuts reduced the amount of time one can draw on one's stamps from 15 to 12 months. That is an insurance scheme and it should not have happened. It is a bit like paying car insurance and discovering that when a crash occurs the insurance company will not pay out.

As my colleague says, it was a breach of contract.I wish to refer to a matter that I do not think has been raised so far in the debate. There is a number of people in my age group and the Minister's, or perhaps a little older, who will shortly be reaching pension age. They have been home-makers and home-carers for most of their lives. Years ago, they became housewives when they had to give up work, compulsorily, on getting married. They worked for a short time but the stamps they paid at the time are no longer worth anything. They are now approaching an age when they will be seeking pensions and they feel let down.

This is one of the most important issues facing the nation as it moves forward. One of the difficulties that arose a number of years ago and which has now caused anomalies in the social welfare system, was that PRSI contributions should not be paid into savings. As a result, people's pensions were affected. People were advised not to pay PRSI and now end up not being able to obtain a pension because they have capital assets that are worth more than the level permitted by the State.In recent years, a number of measures have been included in the social welfare code for the elderly or for young people to make pension provision for their later years. Such moves are to be welcomed and public representatives should encourage them at constituency level to ensure that people make proper provision for pensions.I welcome the increase in the old age pension provided for in the budget. We are well on the way to reaching the €200 per week target in the programme for Government. Pensioners across the country are being looked after by the Government. They welcome the recent increases not alone in this budget but also in the preceding ones. As a nation, we will be judged by how we look after our elderly citizens and those most vulnerable in society. I also welcome the increase in child benefit, as well as the €14 increase that was given to all social welfare recipients.Compulsory PRSI contributions for the self-employed were introduced in 1988. A small number of people are now receiving a pro-rata pension that was introduced by the Government in 1988. It was for people who had five years or more PRSI payments so that they would receive a pro-rata pension. What they are actually getting is a half pension, however. I have discussed this matter with the Minister and he has said he will examine it with a view to introducing it in five, six or seven parts. Issues have arisen concerning self-employed people who did not pay PRSI contributions prior to their 66th birthday. At this stage, they may have made nine or ten PRSI payments, yet they cannot get a pension.Up to last year, missionaries who returned from foreign fields were able to benefit from the old age non-contributory pension. I know it was not the Government's intention but because of an amendment that was introduced last year, these retired missionaries are unable to obtain pensions. They should be entitled to an old-age pension. They have given a life-time's work to the foreign missions, some of them for 40 or even 50 years. I know them personally. They have been great ambassadors for Ireland but for one reason or another they changed citizenship while living abroad. They were advised to do so when living in South America and Africa but having returned to Ireland, either on holidays or to retire, they now find they must be living here as citizens for two years before they can be considered for a pension. The Minister should examine this matter to ensure that retired Irish missionaries are looked after when they return.

I also welcome the increase in the family income supplement. The carer's allowance and the disregard relating to a spouse's income have been increased in recent years and again in this budget. We are now in a position where the recipient of a carer's allowance can come into the tax net. We must rectify this issue in the future. It would cost little to the Exchequer to ensure that the carer's allowance is taken out of the tax net. Many of the means-tested allowances are now technically taxable. There is an opposing argument that the means-test prevents such allowances from being taxable. However, we must consider the approach of removing all means-tested allowances from the tax net.There have been many improvements to the carer's allowance since its introduction. Free travel to anyone over the age of 66 is automatically extended to his or her spouse. For those in receipt of the carer's allowance and the free travel scheme, free travel should be extended to their spouses or partners.Another issue has been brought strongly to my attention in recent weeks. When I was growing up, I had a neighbour who was deaf and had a speech disability. People had to learn to communicate with him through sign language. I recently was in communication via text messaging with a friend who is deaf and has a speech difficulty. He explained that the invention of text messaging technology has changed his life completely in terms of his ability to communicate with others and conduct his life as a "normal" person. For teenagers with similar difficulties, the advent of mobile telephones has changed their situation entirely from that experienced by this man at the same age. We should consider the possibility of providing persons in this situation with a free text messaging service. Such a scheme would have a significant impact on their quality of life.Many health boards and county councils have installed storage heating for elderly people under the disabled person's grant and the provision of housing aid for the elderly. Much of this storage heating works on the night-rate electricity. Up to last week, free electricity credits and units were given to elderly people against the standard rate. Those using the night-rate electricity for storage heating could not avail of these. I welcome that the ESB has decided to introduce a new billing system, whereby credits can be used by night-rate as well standard-rate users. This was a concern because storage heating is an economical and safe way of providing heating for the elderly. The change is good news and will boost the confidence of those elderly who have been advised to install storage heating.I am concerned that the capital disregard for means-testing has been increased for all capital schemes except the social welfare allowance scheme. This is a problem for people who have had capital over the years in that such capital is heavily penalised in calculating the disregard that allows people to avail of some form of payment from the State.I welcome the increase in the respite grant to €1,000 from 2005. Many of the changes introduced in the budget and in the Social Welfare Bill 2004, especially with regard to the carer's allowance, are welcome. I congratulate the Minister on the good job he has done and thank him for the many times he has given us a listening ear in terms of the various schemes we have tried to put forward. As public representatives, we have close contact with people and knowledge of the anomalies in the system, which cause difficulties from time to time. I am delighted the Minister has been willing to listen to our representations on these issues and look forward to further increases in the area of social welfare in future budgets.

#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I welcome the increase of €12 for old age pensioners, which brings the weekly rate to €179 and ensures we are on target to achieve the Government's commitment to increase the old age pension to €200 by 2007. The increase of €14 in all social welfare payments is welcome. Child benefit is also increased by €10 for the first and second child, and by €12 for the third and other children. This brings the rate of payment for one child up to €141.60 per month, while the parents of four children will receive a monthly payment of €637. Likewise, family income supplement has increased, as has maternity benefit.There is also good news for carers. The income disregard for a single person is increased to €270 and to €540 for a couple. This means that a wife whose husband's income is €540 per week can qualify for a full carer's allowance. The respite grant has increased to €1,000 and carers will qualify for this grant regardless of income. It is expected that this grant will be paid to an additional 10,000 carers.For social welfare means-tested payments, the capital assessment is eased because the first €20,000 of capital is disregarded. This means an old age pensioner can have a considerable amount of money but still qualify for a full pension. Other changes in the Bill will help many people. Of every €4 the Government spends in 2005, almost €1 will go to social welfare recipients. We have reduced poverty to historically low levels. The rate of consistent poverty has fallen to 5.2%, down from 15% in 1994, equating to approximately 71,000 households. In addition, there has been an encouraging drop in the figures for consistent child poverty. This rate has decreased from 17% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001. We have implemented the most significant series of social welfare and child benefit increases in the history of the State. Social welfare payments have increased by 27% above the increase in the cost of living from 1997 to 2004.This Bill aims to make significant progress in delivering the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government and the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement, relating to pensions and other social welfare provisions. This Bill is part of a package that aims to make a real difference to those at risk of poverty, especially families, the unemployed and those unable to work because of age or disability, both in terms of income or in terms of other supports given to them via the social welfare system.We are also keen to recognise the contribution of carers and the demands on them. As a result of the 2005 budget, all those aged 66 and over will be €12 per week better off than at present, with weekly rates of €166 for non-contributory pensioners and €179 for contributory pensioners. These will come into effect on 1 January next. Maternity benefit will increase from 70% to 75% of reckonable earnings. There will also be an increase of €14 per week to €165.60 in the minimum rate of maternity benefit and adoptive leave benefit.We have a particular concern for the older generation who have made invaluable contributions to the well-being of the economy and society. All our budgets since 1997 have included measures to improve the income situation of those on pensions. At the previous general election, we promised to increase state pensions to €200 per week. Last year's budget provided for an increase of €10 per week while this budget provides for a further €12 rise, showing clearly that we will deliver on this commitment. There is another substantial rise in the level of income tax exemption for pensioners, up to €33,000 for a married couple. We are on target for achieving the Government's objective of having basic state pensions of €200 by 2007 and we remain committed to doing so.A particular effort has been made in this budget to address the needs of those on the lowest rates of social welfare. Some have seen real increases in recent years which have been somewhat below those of others. The increases are a significant step to enable recipients to live life with dignity and is in line with our commitments under the national anti-poverty strategy and Sustaining Progress.The family income supplement, which is paid to working parents in low-paid employment, is being increased to an unprecedented €39 per week at a full year cost of €15.3 million. This will result in an increase of €23.40 per week for most of the 14,000 families receiving the payment and will make another 2,600 families eligible for it. The family income supplement is an important scheme because it encourages people to enter and remain in the labour force. It not only gives them an adequate income but also puts them on the road to economic independence and enhances their human dignity.I appeal to the Minister to contact local authorities to ensure these high increases to pensioners and the unemployed are not siphoned off by county councils increasing the rents on council houses and differential rents, thereby leaving tenants less well-off. It is important that this point be made.I have promoted the cause of carers all my life. I thank the Minister for what he has done for carers this year. Nevertheless, there is more to be done in this area. The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs has studied the issue of carers for the past 12 months. We have found that a problem exists for carers who are widows or widowers. I urge the Minister to accept the recommendations of the joint committee and pay approximately half the rate of carer's allowance to a person in receipt of a widow's pension. At present, a person in receipt of a widow's pension does not qualify for carer's benefit. These people feel they are not being treated equally. I accept that this measure would be costly but we must move towards it. The Minister has moved some way in this direction by giving the respite grant to all full-time carers. However, carers need recognition. Anyone who looks after an elderly person in his or her home does great work for the country. An elderly person should always have the choice of being cared for at home rather than going into a nursing home. I have nothing against nursing homes but the choice should be available. We must do everything in our power to ensure that carers are well looked after.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I wish to share time with Deputy Wall. This is probably the smallest Social Welfare Bill I have ever seen. It does not even merit a centre page. I am sure Deputy Brennan is hearing language he never heard before. He has never needed to hear it.Whenever I consider Ireland's social welfare system, I recall a story told to me by a friend of mine. He went, full of excitement, to America where he was welcomed at the airport by his uncle. Instead of telling him he was glad to see him and asking for news from home, his uncle told him that, above all else, he should not get sick. That advice shaped his view of America. His ambition was never to get sick. He knew that if he was not able to look after himself, he would be in serious trouble.Our social welfare system is developing in that way. Few people are now dependent on social welfare, unlike the 1980s and early 1990s when we had high rates of unemployment. For that reason, they receive less attention. However, those who go out to work and also depend on social welfare for support payments are being treated very badly. Will the Minister take a long look at this question? I recognise that he has not been in his portfolio for long and will have to become familiar with certain areas. When he does, will he take a close look at the question of lone parents who work?A few weeks ago I tabled a parliamentary question about the overall figure for social welfare fraud. I was told that fraud to the tune of €28 million could be attributed to lone parents who worked. That seemed a very high figure. When I looked at it, I discovered that the so-called fraud is not fraud at all. The rules relating to lone parents had changed. Until the introduction of the 16 social welfare cuts by the former caring Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, lone parents who went out to work could earn €293 per week. For anyone to try to live and rear a child on a gross income of €293 per week is beyond my imagining but that is what they were required to do. A lone parent who exceeds that amount now automatically loses the half payment of lone parent's allowance which he or she had received until that point. Unfortunately, no one told lone parents about this change. A lone parent might have been in receipt of the half payment for anything up to three years without knowing he or she had exceeded the limit. One young woman thought the €293 limit referred to net and not gross income and had always been careful to keep her earnings under that limit. She suddenly received a letter from the Department of Social and Family Affairs saying that she owed €17,500. She was expected to pay that sum immediately before the Department decided whether or not to take court action against her. This young woman was left with a gross income of €310 per week, she owed €17,500 and she had a young child to keep.The €28 million was not fraud. It was not claimed fraudulently. Fraud must involve deliberate intent, and this did not. This had nothing to do with fraud, which is a matter to which the Minister will need to give serious consideration. I have an entire file with details of young women, one of whom owes €19,500 and has no idea how she can pay it with very a limited income. However, that is the type of letter being issued which shows the kind of impersonal contact with people who have very real lives and are desperately trying to keep their heads above water. They could have sat at home and decided to rear a child up to the age of 18, but did not do so and decided to get back into the workforce.I ask the Minister to consider another area, which was not affected by the budget but should have been, namely widows under the age of 66. Deputy Callanan spoke glowingly of how Fianna Fáil looks after the elderly. A similar line used to be trotted out about Fianna Fáil looking after widows. Widows under 66 with young families represent a group that has not been looked after. A strong case exists for giving them secondary benefits. They have a lifestyle based on the expectation either of staying at home while their husbands went to work or of having two incomes and that expectation completely changes. However, they get none of the secondary benefits that all other social welfare recipients would get in such circumstances. At this stage something should be done for them.The budget failed to touch another group, those who rely on the fuel allowance to heat at least one room in the house. The fuel allowance has not increased in years while the price of coal has. I recently spoke to a coal merchant who told me that coal is now regarded as a luxury item.All Deputies have at some time asked MABS to look at a budgeting problem of a constituent on a very low income. MABS is an excellent organisation, which really brings matters under control and brings a degree of certainty and security to people with financial problems that have got out of control. It was an insult to give €700,000 to MABS to help it alleviate hardship nationally. People working in that service might well have felt better if nothing had been given. It is beyond me how this could happen. MABS works with people in dire straits. I am sure the Minister in his constituency work has referred people to the service.I hope that when the Minister gives detailed consideration to what he will provide, he addresses some of these matters. The Social Welfare Bill really only addresses the increases. I hope the detail will have some more meat in it and will address some of the difficulties I am discussing. I am not alone and all Deputies have their own hobbyhorses.In the main young women are getting up from the fireside and going out to make a life for themselves at work. They are being hit by bills and then to add insult to injury told that they have made fraudulent claims, which total €28 million. That matter needs to be seriously reviewed. I do not want to have to continue to appeal such cases and I am sure the same is true of other Deputies. The Department of Social and Family Affairs needs to take action to address this problem.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I thank Deputy Lunch for sharing time. Everybody concentrates on his or her own particular aspect of this Bill. Recent figures from the CAO show that 5% fewer students now attend third-level institutions. While the Government White Paper has a target of 15% participation by adults at third-level, the reality is closer to 5%. Earlier this month a FÁS report based on CSO figures stated that nearly half of the 380,000 who left school with only a primary education are sadly unemployed. The argument for cutting the back to education allowance by the former Minister for Social and Family Affairs was fraudulent use of the scheme. No Government should ever take action that prevents people from participating in education regardless of stage of life.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The Celtic tiger was formed around education. Education has been the soul of the country in the past ten years. With the help of God the trend shown in the CAO figures of a 5% reduction in third-level participation will be reversed. The Minister did not do what he should have done on the back to education allowance. He should have reversed it and perhaps even decreased it further to give others a chance.The figures are before the Minister. FÁS believes that most of those who are unemployed are people who left school with only a primary education. Who knows what sacrifices they had to make that prevented them from going to second and possibly third-level education? It could have been pregnancy, personal illness or illness of a loved one that prevented them from such an opportunity. However, the Minister has taken steps, which ensures they will not have the opportunity that he and others had. I ask the Minister to make the back to education allowance his top priority. We have heard of various aspects from Deputies on both sides of the House. However, we must never prevent people from bettering themselves and this can only be done through the education system.Opportunities exist in ITs, universities and other third level facilities. The international business community looks to Ireland as having a pool of well-educated people. However, simply because the Government was unable to pick out the bad apples that destroyed the scheme in the first place, the previous Minister for Social and Family Affairs took the opportunity of cutting everybody's chance by changing the system. I ask the Minister to make this his top priority and give people back the opportunity to educate themselves. No Government, including this one, should deprive our sons and daughters of the opportunity of improving themselves. We must ensure that the educational level of our employees and potential employees is not in any way diminished. If the Minister does that, many people will say it was a great decision and colleges and universities will say it was a positive move. The cutback was made to remove fraudulent applicants from the system but it was a failure. The fraudulent applicants should have been sorted out and the back to education allowance improved in the budget.The same applies to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. I will not be critical of the Social Welfare Bill because there are measures in it that I fully support but this scheme differentiates between the person on social welfare and the person on a good income. The back to school clothing and footwear allowance has not changed in years, it is still €80 for a primary school child and €150 for a secondary school child. That would not buy a pair of shoes now. A recent Labour Party study showed — it was not refuted — that it costs €1,000 per child to go back to school in September. That applies to high earners and social welfare recipients, but we only offer €80. That will not improve standards in education. We wonder why children do not finish their schooling but young children cannot face up to going to school because the clothing they wear makes them appear second class to their peers in school. That has not been addressed in this Social Welfare Bill. It is an aspect of the education system that falls within the Minister's remit and if he changes it, we will see a better attitude to education. We must never lose the opportunity to improve the educational chances of our children but while we have raised other amounts, we have done nothing about the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.The cost for families with two or three children going back to school in September is high. Parents find themselves in difficulties with moneylenders and we have to send them to MABS to get them back on the straight and narrow. This happens between September and Christmas, the tough period for any family on social welfare, when they are under most pressure to provide for their loved ones. That is when they must pay for the children to go to school and prepare for Christmas, matching the children's peers in school.This is the pressure children and families on social welfare face. The matter should be investigated. Unemployment is falling but there are too many still reliant on benefits and we should improve matters for them. If we improve educational opportunity for people in the system, we will give them a new respect for themselves. That respect will rub off on the children, ensure they match others in the school and achieve employment when they complete their education.Child care is also a major problem. People travel 40 miles in the mornings for child care. Surely that is not beneficial to family life. The Minister should examine this area.There is much in the Bill that is admirable but I cannot support it. I hope that the Minister will look at the items I have mentioned and do something to address them.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and wish the Minister every success in this portfolio. It is impossible to satisfy everyone but he has made a number of positive moves in this Bill. It is a substantial package compared with last year's Bill and the rowing back on some of last year's cuts is welcome.The Minister focused on carers in his speech. Carers are mainly women and the Minister acknowledged that we have an obligation to them because their job lasts seven days a week, 24 hours a day. They make huge sacrifices and are under massive pressure. I welcome some of the changes the Minister has made for carers in the Bill.The extension of the respite grant must be commended. The number of carers who come to my clinics who are not entitled to this grant is astonishing but that has been addressed in this Bill. I would like the Minister to address the forecast of an extra 9,000 carers availing of the grant. There is some discrepancy in the figures for the number of carers who will qualify for this. The Minister might indicate how he has arrived at the figure of 9,200 full-time carers receiving the grant for the first time. Any ambiguity must be ruled out because this is a positive measure to address a situation we come up against every day in our clinics.I also welcome the fact that the grant has been increased to €1,000 and that it now applies to every person being cared for. In many households two people are being cared for and it is good that has been recognised.I compliment the Minister on removing the condition that a recipient of carer's benefit must have been in employment in the three months prior to the commencement of full-time caring. Many people have argued that a carer's allowance should not be means tested. Huge costs are involved and this is the first in a series of measures the Minister hopes to bring into play for carers. We have not seen the end of the benefits to be rolled out in the years ahead.Widows' inability to obtain social welfare benefits and the carer's allowance should be examined. Widows, particularly those involved in caring for someone, have had a raw deal in the social welfare system. A widow should be entitled to a social welfare benefit and qualify for carer's allowance. Perhaps the Minister would look at that issue.I shall refer to some of benefits removed last year, which the Minister has seen fit to reinstate, one of which is the back to education allowance. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister on the matter in November and while I accept he has rowed back from 15 to 12 months, the reality is that on 1 September 2004, the time was increased from six months to 15 months. While it has been improved by three months I ask that it be rowed back to six months, as applied originally. As has been articulated by many Members the back to education allowance has been of enormous benefit to many. I tabled a parliamentary question recently in which I asked the numbers who availed of the back to education allowance and the number is massive. It is important to address the issue of those who have been denied the opportunity to get an education for whatever reason. This is an allowance of which we will reap the benefits because these people go back into the workplace and pay their taxes. On a cost benefit analysis it is a measure that must be extended.Last year the six months rule with regard to the rent supplement caused hardship for many. I welcome the fact that the Minister has reversed that decision and that the six months rule to qualify for rent supplement has been removed. I am aware that if one argued one's case with the community welfare officer one could avail of the rent allowance. The reality is that it was a discretionary decision on the part of the community welfare officer. Once it has been established, as the Minister has made clear, that a person has a local authority housing need, he or she should be entitled to the rent allowance with immediate effect. I welcome that decision and applaud the Minister. The Government tried to defend the cut at the time but it caused much hardship. To say it did not work and that the decision should be reversed is commendable.On the issue of turning down two offers of a local authority house I welcome the fact that the offer has been extended to three refusals. Some may say that if one has been offered a local authority house one should grab it. However, the reality is, and it happens in my constituency, that many local authority houses may not be fit for habitation and it may not suit the circumstances of the individual to be located in a particular area. In that case it is important that they be given a chance provided their reasons for refusal are reasonable. In most cases they are reasonable. I appreciate the leeway being given in regard to the refusal of a local authority house.I welcome the return of the crèche supplement and the diet supplement, the cost of which probably was not huge. For those availing of them they were welcome benefits. The issue of child benefit is a matter on which I have strong views given the cost of child care. I recognise the Government's policy is to provide for child care through the child benefit. I recognise the points the Minister made in his contribution that this is a fair and equitable system and treats everybody equally right across the spectrum and that it does not discourage anybody from taking up employment. The massive 250% increase in child benefit from 1997 to date has to be acknowledged as it has been extremely generous. I spoke with a lady recently who has three children, two of whom are twins, who receives €564 in child benefit per month, which is a significant payment. However, the cost of child care for the month was in excess of €1,000. The reality is that, generous as child benefit is, for many women who might like to go out into the workplace, the cost of child care is so prohibitive the option is not open to them. What is the best way around this issue? I realise the Government's policy is to provide for child care through the child benefit, whether that means increasing child benefit at a greater pace to cover the cost of child care or looking at other avenues. Something has to be done to make it more attractive for women to go out and work if that is what they want. I do not know how the Government intends to address the issue. A case has been made for the child dependant allowance, an issue to which the Minister referred. It could be argued that it provides a benefit to those who are in receipt of social welfare where it is most needed. The policy of going the child benefit route is a good one but the level of payment will have to be increased.I tabled a parliamentary question on the money advice and budgeting service recently, on behalf of a colleague, the response to which was that the number of inquiries has exceeded its original expectations. My understanding is that there has been a huge increase in the amount of money spent on the money advice and budgeting service. While the Minister has provided an additional €700,000 this year, the amount being provided to the service is much greater. If the Minister were to expand on that issue it would clarify some of the points raised.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate, which has lasted almost seven hours. I have listened to the debate with the exception of approximately ten minutes and have taken careful note of the points made by all Deputies but particularly those made be the Opposition spokespersons who represent their parties. We shall have four hours on Committee Stage tomorrow and I shall use that forum to tease out some of the technical aspects and specific questions put to me. I am confident I have presented a fairly balanced set of changes and substantial improvements. As there is only so much one can do in any one budget I will have to continue to work on the issues in the year ahead and to use whatever mechanisms are available to me to make improvements.Out of every €3 the State spends, €1 goes to social welfare entitlements. An estimated 970,000 persons on average are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year. That affects approximately 1.5 million people, including dependants, that is, two out of every five people in the State. That means we are dealing with the quality of life of many people. I am conscious of the importance of these issues for families, individuals and children all over the country.The increases of €14 and €12 in social welfare payments are three or four times ahead of the expected rate of inflation. I wish they were more but they are significant. Social welfare spending has more than doubled from €5.7 billion in 1997 to €12.25 billion next year, an increase of €1billion. We will spend more than €1 billion more in 2005 than we spent in 2004. I agree with Deputies who say that while it is called spending, it is people's entitlement. It is no thanks to the State or the taxpayer, these are payments to which people are entitled.I refer to the issue of carers given that many Deputies raised the matter. The reality is that I am continuing to do more in this area. The package being provided in the budget is an extra €40 million to enhance support for carers and to allow more carers qualify for entitlements. I made eight changes in the budget, each of which was an improvement. Carer's allowance and carer's benefit were increased by €14 per week. Many Deputies mentioned that the respite grant was increased from €850 to €1,000, which is expected to benefit approximately 33,000 full-time carers.The respite care grant has been extended to include all carers who provide full-time care, subject to employment related conditions. If one receives unemployment benefit and is therefore available for work, one will not be included under the terms of this provision, which is one of the most significant developments in the recognition of carers since the benefit was first introduced. An additional 9,200 full-time carers will receive the grant for the first time. I am changing the system so that the grant will be payable in respect of each person who is being given care.Deputy Cooper-Flynn asked me to indicate how I have determined that 9,200 full-time carers will receive the grant for the first time. I may speak about this matter at greater length on Committee Stage. The Central Statistics Office census contained some interesting figures about the number of hours of unpaid care provided by carers. Some 84,000 carers provide up to two hours of care per day, 15,000 carers provide between two and four hours of care per day, 7,957 carers provide between four and six hours of care per day and 40,000 carers provide over six hours of care per day. The 150,000 figure, which was referred to by many Deputies, is reached when one adds the number of people in all four categories. The majority of the 150,000 carers provide less than two hours of care each day. While I do not deny the value of the care they provide and am grateful for it, it cannot be said that they are full-time carers. Approximately 48,000 carers provide more than four hours of care per day. Some 23,000 carers who work more than ten hours per week receive carer's payments. Therefore, a balance of approximately 9,200 remains. I can give more details of the figures on Committee Stage. An additional 9,200 people will benefit.Many Deputies spoke about widows who are not given any additional carer's allowance when they start to do some caring. I would have liked to have included an extra 50%, as the committee recommended, but I chose to take the respite route this year. The widows in question will each receive the respite grant of €1,000 for the first time. I consider it to be a recognition, not a payment. It does not pay for much, but it recognises that the widow or old age pensioner is doing some caring work. The payment is not means tested; it is simply given for doing the work.When one examines all the changes I have made in the provisions for carers, one will see that they are worth over €40 million, which is significant. I would like to do much more in this area. As a result of the changes I have made, a couple who have two children and earn up to €30,700 can receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and a couple who have two children and earn up to €49,200 can receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance as well as free travel, the household benefits package of free schemes and the respite care grant. That is a significant improvement.I do not agree with the Labour Party's proposal to abolish the means test. I am not making a political point, but merely stating the opinion I have formed having listened to the Private Members' debate and thought about the matter. It has been estimated that the cost of abolishing the scheme would be approximately €160 million. If I had €160 million to spend, I would focus on the rates. It costs approximately €50 million to change the rates by €1. It is obvious that the Labour Party's proposal would change the rates for everybody by €3 or €4. One must engage in a trade-off in that regard. While it is important that we should make substantial improvements in respect of carers, if we had €160 million, it might be more appropriate to spend it on improving the lot of carers in need. We should find a way to recognise the work of carers. If carers do not need a particular financial support, we should recognise their work in another way. We plan to do much more in the area of carers. We have put in place a €40 million package, extended the €1,000 grant to a further 9,200 carers and raised the income disregards so that a couple who earn up to €49,200 can receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance and a couple who earn up to €30,700 can receive the maximum rate. The substantial improvements we have made this year will help many carers.I do not want to get argumentative about the so-called 16 cuts because I am not trying to play politics with them. I have examined nine of the cuts in detail and will examine the remaining cuts in the months to come. I have made changes to all the nine cuts I have considered. I will not engage in discussions about whether I have reversed the cuts. Having examined the cuts to see what difference they have made to individuals, I have eased them, amended them or reversed them. I have made all the provisions much more useful and appropriate to those affected by them. For example, the weekly income threshold for the half-rate child dependent allowance in respect of certain benefits has increased from €300 to €350.I appreciate the comments of Deputies about the back to education allowance, which I will examine. It has been strongly argued to me that evidence is available to demonstrate that the change to six months led to many applications from nationals and non-nationals who went on the register deliberately to gain the allowance which one can receive for many years while one is in third level education. I will keep the matter under review because I accept the point, made strongly by Deputies Wall and Stanton, that we need to make it easier to move from unemployment to education. I have gone some of the way because it has been strongly argued to me that there is hard evidence of substantial and deliberate abuse of the scheme when the line is drawn as low as six months. I will review the evidence to see if I can change the threshold further when I have been convinced that the abuse I have mentioned is under control.I have provided that the one-parent family payment provisions will continue to include a halfway transitional payment for six months. One-parent families will continue to be paid for six months as they move to employment.I have removed the six-month rule from the rent supplement scheme. That does not mean that we can be careless about it, however. Deputies have argued that we need to ensure that people need the accommodation and that they entered into rent agreements honourably. If they are genuine, the six-month rule that I have removed completely will be examined on the merits of individual cases. I am satisfied that those who need rent supplement will get it. I have no desire to stop people from getting rent supplement. They will continue to get it as long as they can demonstrate they need it. It will be quite easy for them to demonstrate that at the relevant offices. I have increased the income disregard for rent supplement. I have decided not to increase the minimum contribution of claimants from the present €13.A number of Deputies asked me about the money advice and budgeting service. Deputy Lynch took me to task about the fund of €700,000 I have provided for. The Deputy may have confused the House somewhat because the service's actual budget for next year will be €12.6 million, an increase of €1.2 million or 11% on 2004. The €700,000 fund has been allocated over and above the budget I have mentioned because the service lost €700,000 as a result of a change that was made. I have restored the €700,000 in a different way, as Deputy Penrose mentioned, by giving it to the service to use as it sees fit. I will not tell the service how to use the fund. It can make such decisions on the basis of the expertise it has developed from its day-to-day operations. I am sure it will use the money to help those who need it.I accept the argument that we will have to be careful to ensure that the fund of €700,000 is not just given to banks which can well afford to help the people in question. Banks should not soak up the fund as a direct subsidy from the State simply because it happens to be available. I have put back exactly the same amount as was taken from the system.I have made it clear that the crèche supplement has been restored. Any individual who can demonstrate to health service personnel that he or she requires the crèche supplement will receive it. That was the original intention behind the supplement and it remains so. The same holds true for the diet supplement. I have restored this year that supplement which existed one or two years ago.I am not making an issue of these measures. However, I have changed nine of them substantially and I will continue to review those nine and the remainder and make practical, sensible changes thereto as best I can. None of them is fixed in concrete.

This refers to Bree national school in Enniscorthy, County Wexford, which has 180 pupils. It is an extremely good school with excellent educational facilities and good results. The principal is John Joe Fitzgerald and the chairman of the board of management is Fr. Aidan Kavanagh. The school is in my parish and I was educated there many years ago.In June 2004 the Department of Education and Science sanctioned the school to appoint an extra teacher to its staff, based on the enrolments early in the year, to start in September 2004. The school, however, did not reach the target of 184 pupils and had only 180 pupils on the roll by 30 September — two families did not enrol due to housing problems. The sanction was reversed. The school appealed this but the Department of Education and Science turned down the appeal. As a result third and fourth classes joined to form a single class of 40 pupils. There are six classes in Bree national school, junior infants, senior infants, first, second, third and fourth combined, fifth and sixth. Three of these comprise more than 31 pupils, far above the departmental guidelines. The management and teachers feel that the post must be sanctioned because this would meet the children's needs better than their present environment of 37 or more pupils in some classes and over 40 in others.While I recognise the Minister is under pressure and has many decisions to make, the school and I make this appeal to her. The pupils are being denied the attention that is their right. To date the school has been informed that the extra pupils will arrive and enrol in the coming weeks — two have already enrolled. This increases the numbers in the school and diminishes the quality of the learning environment. As the school is close to Enniscorthy town it is developing rapidly.Will the Minister tell me tonight that the extra teacher can be sanctioned in line with the sudden growth of the school? The Department aims to ensure that all primary schools operate in an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. A class of 40 pupils is most unsatisfactory for teacher and pupil, especially for the teacher who tries to identify the weaker pupils in the class. Some parents fear that if their children are lacking in some area of their education they will not be identified in such a large class because the teacher will not have the time to give them one to one attention.Bree national school is not in a position to distribute its pupils in minimum class sizes. For the Minister to say tonight that she will ask the Department's inspector in County Wexford to monitor the situation would be an unacceptable answer. It is unacceptable to have 40 pupils in one class. Will the Minister look on this favourably? I hope she will be able to give me some good news that I will be able to convey to the staff of Bree national school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	547	I thank Deputy Kehoe for raising this matter in which he obviously has a personal interest, having been educated there himself. The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year. Those are the guidelines. They work fairly throughout the country, are objective and one may deviate from them only where a school experiences rapid growth in enrolment. In such cases, an additional post, referred to as a developing school post, may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specific figure.The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2003 was 159 pupils, which warrants staffing of a principal and five mainstream posts for the 2004-05 school year. On the basis of projected enrolments, a developing school post was approved provisionally in July 2004. However, the required enrolment figure was not achieved and sanction for the post was withdrawn.To ensure openness in the teacher allocation system at primary level, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The staffing of this school for the 2004-05 school year was considered by the appeals board on 21 October 2004. The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in Department circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule was not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 21 October 2004. I am sure that any Deputy would appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.The staffing schedule at primary level is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. I too would be concerned if there were 40 children in a class since there is no reason for it. It is up to local school authorities to ensure that the children are distributed in classes of a more equitable size. The Deputy said that there were three classes with 31 pupils. There is therefore no reason for one class to have 40. It is up to the school to ensure equitable distribution of pupils in classes and that the differential between the largest and the smallest classes is kept to a minimum.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	549	The Deputy is right. The inspectorate is monitoring the deployment of staff and class sizes to see why we have a situation whereby, on the figures given to me by the Deputy, there are 40 pupils in one class and four other classes with an average of 29. That is obviously something that must be examined to see on what basis school policy decisions in this regard have been made and why there are 40 in one class. Perhaps the banding of classes might be done differently. As the Deputy knows, significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years, coming down to approximately 17.5, as a result of which class sizes have reduced. We will continue to do that. However, that is not the issue tonight, rather it is that of a particular school. I regret, regarding the decision of the independent appeals board on the school, where the projected figures were not achieved, that it is not possible for me to intervene in its work.

The former was extended and refurbished a few years ago, and today it is suitable for the educational needs of modern curricular requirements. I had occasion to visit both schools in Dunfanaghy in recent weeks. On the other hand, Holy Cross School, the subject of the Adjournment debate, definitely belongs to the first half of the last century. Space and facilities for both teachers and pupils are grossly inadequate, to put it mildly.Holy Cross national school was constructed in 1960 as a two-classroom school. Little has been done since apart from the installation of an oil-fired central heating system in 1996. The school is outdated, unsuitable and unsafe to teach or meet the demands of the present child-centred curriculum. The building, originally constructed as a two-teacher school, is now being used by two mainstream teachers, a resource teacher also based in the school, a visiting learning support teacher, two special needs assistants, a part-time secretary and 37 pupils. It is unbelievable that a two-classroom school should have so many demands on its limited space.The situation is extremely unsatisfactory for the following reasons. First, the cramped conditions make it extremely dangerous for the entire school community, including teachers and pupils. Second, there are no classrooms for the resource teachers or the learning support teacher. Third, there is no staff room and no office facilities. Fourth, the toilets are most unsatisfactory and have no hot water, and the cisterns are of asbestos which has the potential to become a serious health hazard. Following a storm last Halloween, the flat felt section of the roof has been leaking, and management has been advised that the section requires re-felting immediately because of the danger with electrical fittings and so on. Children in the school with special needs have no space or classroom in which those needs can be catered for.Having visited the school a few weeks ago, I was impressed by the dedication of both teachers and pupils working under almost impossible conditions. The extra teachers were confined and operating from cubby-holes no bigger than wardrobes. The classes were jam-packed with no room for movement. Facilities such as offices, staff rooms and general purpose rooms are non-existent. As far as such facilities are concerned, the pupils of Holy Cross are being treated as second-class citizens and that is simply not acceptable.The truth is that the school must be improved and modernised immediately to create a safe environment for the entire school community. The plans are ready to be implemented. With the extra resources available for such buildings next year, Holy Cross in Dunfanaghy should be catered for. I understand that the estimate for the refurbishment and extension is less than €250,000. It seems ludicrous to put the safety of children at risk for what is by modern standards such a meagre figure. Will the Minister include the above school in the new building programme under active consideration? Many other schools in the area have been renovated and modernised in recent years, and it is most unfair that Holy Cross should be left waiting for basic minimum accommodation requirements. Will the Minister seriously consider, after a long wait, the case of Holy Cross school in Dunfanaghy?

I am sure the Deputy will agree that is a generous allocation of teaching staff to a school. The staff includes a principal, a mainstream assistant, a shared permanent resource teacher, a shared learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher. Despite what the Deputy described as cramped conditions, I have no doubt the children are getting the very best of education, care and attention.The school has submitted an application for an extension to and refurbishment of the building. Deputies will be aware that on Sunday I announced the funding that will be allocated to schools during the course of next year. Some €270 million will be allocated to primary schools and €223 will be allocated to post-primary schools. Those are generous allocations.The Deputy mentioned exposure to asbestos in the school in question. It is important that the school contacts the Department immediately about the asbestos problem the Deputy said was present in the cisterns.

It covers dealing with dust extraction and the presence of radon. Therefore, it is important that the school contacts the Department immediately particularly in regard to the presence of asbestos.I do not know about the costings of the project. The Deputy mentioned a figure of €250,000. We have a scheme under which we devolve money locally to small and rural schools for the provision of additional accommodation. We will examine those over the next few weeks. Perhaps up to 120 schools will be invited to participate in that scheme. We will examine that as soon as we announce the major projects that will come on stream.Over the next few weeks I will highlight the major projects in respect of which final preparations will go to tender, those advancing to site stage over the next 12 to 16 months, those that have been invited to participate in the devolved scheme, public private partnership projects and those included in the summer works scheme.I do not know if the Deputy is aware of whether the school applied for funding under the summer works scheme. Some of the issues he highlighted might have been included in the school's application, which I will consider.

While listening to Deputy McGinley, I thought that if we had the same scriptwriter, he or she could have duplicated the Deputy's speech in respect of this school because I have a similar story.The story I am bringing to the Minister's attention is Scoil Bhreac Chluain in Annascaul in County Kerry. It has 91 pupils and is in urgent need of funding. Annascaul is a rapidly developing area. Planning permission has been granted for a number of housing developments in the area and the school will be under severe pressure due to the increase in the population. The school is about 100 years old and it also has cramped conditions.The school's board of management has applied for funding for a new school but it is still awaiting sanction for it from the Department. In the meantime there are two issues that need to be dealt with. The school has applied under the summer works scheme 2005 for the provision of a new boiler because the existing boiler does not heat the school. I visited the school on Monday and went to the boiler house and what I saw frightened me. Rust is falling off the pipes and the children are not being provided with proper heat. It is an urgent problem. Addressing this problem would not cost a great deal. The board of management wants a new school, but this problem must be dealt with if provision for a new school will not be sanctioned this year. The provision of heat is an important health issue.There is another difficulty in the school. It has also applied for funding for the provision of a prefab. There is no place in the school for the children to do PE or to exercise, particularly in the winter months when it is raining because the children cannot go outside. The children have to do their artwork in the corridor adjacent to the toilets. It is the only place they can do such work. Last Monday when I visited the school the principal told me that a nurse is due to call to the school to carry out eye tests for the pupils. A room of a certain size is required to do that. To facilitate the nurse, the principal will have to vacate a classroom for about two hours. If it is a fine day, the children who use that classroom will be in the playground for two hours, but if it raining, the only place they can use is the corridor. That is the reality. The children are being deprived of physical education.It is a wonderful school and the teachers deserve every credit. They teach chess, Irish dancing, drama and a great number of after-school activities. If the school was allocated funding for the provision of a prefab, it would make life that much easier. It would also be safer because having to do artwork in the corridor outside the toilets is not acceptable and the condition of the toilets, as in the case of the school referred to by the previous speaker, is not great because they are old and unsuitable.The chairperson of the parent's council wrote to me pointing out that the pupils are being deprived of their right to take part in physical activities and health education, to explore and express their creativity through artwork, to be part of an assembly group and be involved in role-plays and dramatic productions, all because they have no space in which to perform these activities. The principal and staff of the school are worthy of exceptional praise because they provide such a high standard of education, considering the limited facilities they have. The parents rightly believe that the provision of funding for a new boiler and a prefab should be granted as provision for these needs is mandatory. They are not seeking anything special, they are looking for the provision of heat and a space for the pupils to do their artwork and PE. There is a major debate currently about childhood obesity and exercise is important factor in addressing that problem. Unfortunately, in Kerry we experience a high level of rainfall. Therefore, it is not possible for the pupils to play in the school yard all the time.I am aware the Minister is making decisions on schools and it is opportune for me to bring her first-hand the story of Scoil Bhreac Chluain. A new school is required, but if it is not possible to sanction approval for it this year, the two facilities I mentioned should at least be provided to make life more bearable for the pupils and the teachers.

The current enrolment of the school is 91 pupils with a principal and three mainstream assistants, plus a permanent resource teacher. The school's enrolment increased slightly over the five years from 85 pupils to 91 pupils. That school has four classes and four permanent classrooms, a principal's office, a staff room, a library and learning support-remedial room.

I am sure there are pupils who are able to do their artwork within their own classrooms, but I have not seen the situation. I take the Deputy's word for it because she visited the school.The school has submitted an application for the provision of an extension and the refurbishment of the existing building to include a general purpose area and improved toilet facilities. Prefabs are generally allocated for the provision of extra classrooms. From what the Deputy has said, the classroom space is not a requirement in so far as there are four classes and four classrooms.The Deputy raised the issue of funding under the summer works scheme. Next year I hope to allocate €60 million to the summer works scheme — a successful scheme — to allow schools to carry out improvement works during the summer holidays. This year we allocated €31 million and 448 schools benefited. It may be possible next year to include a number of other schools and a number of more costly projects, which are important to provide things like windows, heating and so on. The school has applied for a replacement boiler under the summer works scheme. I will examine that with a view to making a decision in early February. All such decisions are based on need rather than on any decision of mine.Next year a sum of €493 million is being allocated for schools. A total of 141 major building projects are already on site and 28 will start over the coming weeks. I will announce details of 75 major primary and 30 major post-primary projects which will be authorised to complete the design process in the coming weeks. They will go to construction over the next 12 to 16 months. A further 18 to 20 post-primary schools will be included in public private partnerships and 120 primary schools will be invited to take part in the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation.With all of that and the €60 million under the summer works scheme, I hope to be able to make real inroads into the building need of schools throughout the country. I will certainly examine the needs of scoil náisiúnta Bhreac Chluain in the context of the summer works scheme.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue. It relates to the problems experienced by members of PDFORRA, enlisted members of the Defence Forces, in airing their concerns to senior management in the Naval Service and the Defence Forces and right through to the Department of Defence.I represent a constituency that has a major naval base in Haulbowline and am aware that it is sometimes frowned upon for members of the Defence Forces, the Naval Service in this case, to come to me to air their grievances. However, if the mechanisms requested by PDFORRA and agreed upon by senior management were functioning properly, I would not be in this Chamber raising this issue. The reason I am is because PDFORRA's views and the concerns it has raised regarding sea days, impacts on family life and many other issues have not been addressed and no cohesive debate is taking place in the Naval Service between management and PDFORRA to address the concerns of ordinary members of the Defence Forces.Individuals highlighted their concerns to me as a person who acknowledges the work done by the Defence Forces, particularly the Naval Service, and the huge strides made to achieve efficiency and bring forward the implementation plan. The five-year plan is moving to its final year in 2005. An agreed conciliation and arbitration process was set up so that ordinary enlisted men could air their grievances and concerns. However, there are still difficulties.Most of the people involved in the Naval Service who are represented by PDFORRA have no difficulty in improving efficiency and productivity levels. However, the consultation process has not been as effective as initially expected. That is an indication of the problems I am trying to highlight. We all accept that the Navy must go to sea and that it must stay at sea. Every member of PDFORRA accepts that. However, huge sacrifices are being made. Changes in the structures, the amount of time that must be spent at sea and the amount of time available when they come back from sea to recuperate and be involved in family life are made without consultation. The basic fabric and structures of what we would consider to be ordinary everyday living are not comparable when dealing with people in the Naval Service. They join the service in that knowledge. However, their concerns should be listened to. It is disappointing that, having set up a process for the enlisted men and women, it has not functioned to the standards envisaged.There is a strong maritime tradition in Cork. The members of the Defence Forces in the Naval Service are committed to productivity and want to see the Navy fly the flag. Equally, the management and the Department of Defence must acknowledge that co-operation is a two-way street. To date it has not been that.In the broader context, the Naval Service has performed its duties admirably, not only in protecting our fisheries but in transporting troops to various conflict areas throughout the world and taking our flagship right across the world to Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. It is an important factor in Ireland's commitment to the UN. However, There are major problems regarding consultation, negotiations and basic discussion between management and the members of PDFORRA on the issue of bringing about the efficiencies and productivity outlined in the five-year plan.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I thank Deputy Kelleher for raising this issue, which I will answer on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea.The system of representation introduced in 1990 provides, at national level, both a conciliation and arbitration scheme and a military forum, either of which can be used by PDFORRA to raise issues coming within the scope of representation which are of concern to its members. In addition, a set of agreed arrangements are in place which provide mechanisms for issues to be raised at every level in the Defence Forces.At various stages during the formation and implementation of the Naval Service implementation plan, consultations have taken place at both local and national level. The Minister is not aware of any particular issues arising. Were there any issues, he would have expected PDFORRA to use any of the fora available to it to have them addressed. I understand that Naval Service issues are a standing item on the agenda for the military forum and a meeting of the forum is scheduled for next Monday.I concur with Deputy Kelleher on the value of the work the Naval Service does. It is respected throughout this country and abroad. The Minister has asked me to say that he would be very concerned if PDFORRA has decided to embark on a course of lobbying public representatives on issues. He is very surprised at this course of action in light of the fact that the issue has not been raised under the formal machinery in place for dealing with such matters. Embarking on such a campaign is in breach of the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, and the Minister is of the view that it will do nothing to advance the consideration of this or any other claim. He asks the Naval Service to use the services and facilities that are available.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	566	A copy of the report in question has recently been received by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and by the Prison Service. Both the Department and the Irish Prison Service are committed to keeping up to date with all emerging research in this area and are currently examining the report.I have previously made my position very clear on this matter in that I not support the introduction of needle exchange in prisons. Any person seeking syringes, needles and fluids under such a scheme would be indicating to the prison authorities that he or she is in possession of, or expects to shortly be in possession of, controlled drugs and proposes consuming them. To supply a prisoner with the requested items in these circumstances would, in effect, be to tell him or her that prison management will facilitate the commission of serious criminal offences in the prison.Introducing a needle exchange scheme would act as a clear message that the use of intravenous drugs in prisons is tolerated. This is not a message that anyone wishes to send. What hope could any prisoner ever have of breaking their addiction if they were to be facilitated in continuing it? For many prisoners, imprisonment offers them an opportunity to examine their problems and, with the support of prison services, to try and address them. By facilitating rather than challenging drug abuse, the Prison Service would be consciously releasing prisoners back into society as full blown addicts with a habit only capable of being fed by the commission of further serious crime or even degrading acts of prostitution. Further, the logic of supplying clean, safe syringes would, by extension, apply to supplying safe, quality assured heroin as well, so as to avoid overdoses and poisoning. That is not a proposition anyone in this House would support.Needle exchange schemes would subvert and run contrary to increasing staff vigilance in searching for drugs and preventing them being smuggled into prisons. As far as I am concerned, drug control in prisons would be reduced to a game in which a blind eye approach to successful breaches of the controls would, in time, become the order of the day. The Prison Service is committed to the twin strategies of supply and demand reduction to deal with the issues of drugs in prison, closing off routes of supply and providing support to prisoners to tackle their addictions. The introduction of needle exchange would run contrary to these approaches.As a criminal justice agency, the Prison Service is actively working to prevent breaches of the criminal law relating to illicit drugs. I, my senior officials and the prison governors are convinced that, over time, the operation of needle exchange programmes in prisons would be a negative influence on the behaviour of prison staff by eroding their commitment to law enforcement. It is simply not possible to have staff fully committed to preventing the possession and distribution of controlled drugs within prisons while simultaneously distributing syringes to prisoners to be used to inject controlled drugs. I am also conscious of the fact that prison staff themselves are totally opposed to needle exchange and, interestingly, independent research has shown that many prisoners are similarly opposed.It must be pointed out that prison based needle exchange programmes are still the exception rather than the norm worldwide. In the small number of prison systems where they do exist, they are generally based in low security, open centres. Conditions there are far different from those in higher security, closed prisons similar to those Irish prisons where needle sharing is an acknowledged practice among opiate addicted prisoners. Unlike the majority of prisons where needle exchange has been most closely studied, candidate prisons in Ireland are closed, higher security prisons where out of cell time is much more limited. In these circumstances, there would be continuing long periods of time when access to the supply of needles would be limited and needle sharing is likely to persist during these times.The transmission of blood borne illnesses is something which is of concern to the Prison Service and I. That is why Trinity College's department of community health and general practice was commissioned in 1999 to carry out the first research ever undertaken in Irish prisons to establish the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C in the prisoner population. These research findings were immediately made public. Since that study the Prison Service has made significant strides in harm minimisation measures by way of increasing education and awareness of potential harms and development of the methadone maintenance and other programmes.I remain committed to pursuing Government policy to end the use of heroin in Irish prisons. It would be a contradiction of this stated Government aim for the Irish Prison Service to tolerate continuing intravenous drug use involving a needle exchange programme. Ending of all heroin use must mean just that.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in conjunction with the Prison Service, has been working hard to implement the Government's response, as stated in the programme for Government, to deal with this serious issue. Early in the new year we will implement our new strategy of mandatory drug testing, addiction counselling and treatment, increased measures to prevent drug usage and a genuine system of rehabilitation.The Prison Service remains fully committed — as resources permit — to further developing and expanding appropriate treatment programmes, in conjunction with community and health agencies, to meet the treatment needs of this prisoner group.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The Government's overall policy to tackle the drug problem is set out in the national drugs strategy 2001-2008, Building on Experience. Responsibility for co-ordinating implementation of the strategy lies with the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is primarily responsible for policy with regard to supply reduction, including legislation.One of the key performance indicators in the strategy is to increase drug seizures by 25% by 2004 and by 50% by 2008, using the 2000 seizures figures as a baseline. The Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise service have already achieved considerable success in combating the problem of drugs supply. Data on street value of drug seizures is as follows: Garda seizures for 2000 —€20 million, 2001 —€45 million, 2002 —€49 million and 2003 —€100 million; and Customs and Excise seizures for 2000 —€11 million, 2001 —€60 million, 2002 —€34 million and 2003 —€21 million. The increase in drug seizures in recent years is indicative of an increase in demand for illicit drugs but it also indicates that the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise service are achieving considerable success in the area of supply reduction.The establishment of specialist Garda units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Garda national drug unit, operating under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime, including drug trafficking, effectively.Our legislative package for tackling organised crime is one of the toughest in Europe. The Garda Síochána has available to it a broad range of legislation to facilitate the fight against serious or organised crime. The Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 have been successfully used to deprive those engaged in criminal activity of their assets and continue to be some of the most significant legislative tools available in the fight against organised crime.At an international level the Garda Síochána continues to work in close co-operation with both Europol and Interpol. In addition, Garda Síochána liaison officers are posted in the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and France. In June 2004, the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 was signed into law. This provides for the competent authorities of two or more member states, by mutual agreement, to carry out criminal investigations with a cross border dimension.The European Arrest Warrants Act 2003, which came into effect on 1 January 2004, implemented the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member states of the EU. This Act simplifies extradition and surrender procedures between member states of the EU for offences such as illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Moreover, as a signatory to various conventions providing for mutual legal assistance, Ireland is in a position to provide assistance, on request, in drug related cases.The efforts of the Garda Síochána and other State agencies continue to be brought to bear against those who would seek to profit from drug dealing. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been assured by the Garda authorities that the level of resources employed in this area will remain under review with a view to making changes, as necessary, in the ongoing fight against drugs.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	569	In July 2003, the Government approved my proposal that a regular national crime victimisation survey, carried out biennially, would be a valuable and useful complement to the information on crime already available, which includes the Garda Commissioner's annual report and the headline crime figures which I release quarterly, and would provide a more comprehensive perspective on crime victimisation than is currently available. When undertaken on a regular basis, such a survey would provide useful information on emerging trends in crime and so provide input into developing strategies to combat crime.The expert group on crime statistics, which I established and the report of which I published in July 2004, recommended the establishment of a central crime statistics unit which would, inter alia, examine the collation of information relating to crimes reported to and recorded by the gardaí, examine the collation of information relating to other crimes where the Garda Síochána is not the prosecuting authority, identify the needs of key stakeholders within the criminal justice system and the wider research community and make recommendations on the necessary structures and resources to be provided to allow statistics compiled within the criminal justice system to be analysed so that emerging trends can be identified. I have accepted the recommendation that such a unit be established and work is underway on establishing it within the Central Statistics Office.The report of the expert group strongly endorsed the Government decision to conduct biennial national crime victimisation surveys and recommended that the central crime statistics unit would be responsible for overseeing the national crime victimisation survey and involved in its design and planning. I have also accepted this recommendation and work on the survey will be undertaken by the unit as part of its duties.I understand from the Central Statistics Office that a crime and victimisation survey is to be carried out either via a dedicated survey or a module on the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, in 2006. This approach has previously been used in both 1998 and 2003. The Central Statistics Office expects that dedicated crime and victimisation surveys will be carried out in 2008 and biennially thereafter as recommended.I also understand that the Central Statistics Office intends to develop these surveys in a way that will maximise their utility and their coherence with other administrative data available in the criminal justice system. It is important to stress that the figures that will result from these surveys will not be directly comparable to the crime statistics published by me for the Garda Síochána as there are rudimentary differences in sources, definitions and classification methodology. However, that will in no way undermine the crime and victimisation surveys which will provide fuller information about the level of crime.

I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that there are currently 75 gardaí attached to the ministerial pool, of whom 56 are allocated on a full-time basis to drive Ministers, former Taoisigh, former Presidents and judicial figures. The remaining 19 gardaí are on a relief panel and cover periods of absences through annual leave and illness.I am further informed that the annual costs of such drivers is approximately €5.2 million and includes salaries, allowances and subsistence. As these drivers are currently tasked with providing personal protection to the Ministers, there are currently no plans to replace them in the ministerial pool with civilian drivers.

It is managed by Business in the Community Ireland, a non-profit organisation. The linkage programme has been funded in the amount of €700,000 in the current year. In deciding the 2005 allocation, I will have regard to the overall budget allocation for probation and welfare service funded projects, 75 in total. Due to the increase in the 2005 budget allocation for the probation and welfare service, it is likely that the linkage programme will receive an increase in funding in the coming year.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	572	Given the extent to which European Union law impinges on all aspects of public governance, not only those for which my Department has responsibility, it is assumed that the focus of the Deputy's question is the free movement rights enjoyed by EU citizens who wish to reside, study or seek employment in Ireland.Since British citizens are exempt from immigration control in this jurisdiction, by virtue of an order made by Government, what follows is not relevant to their situation. The panoply of EU free movement rights are set out in a number of articles of the treaty itself together with two regulations and a series of nine directives. These rights have over the years delineated free movement rights by reference to purpose of visit — beginning originally with workers and extended subsequently to the self employed, persons who provide or receive services, self sufficient persons, students and retired persons. The general effect of these legislative instruments in the areas comprehended by the Deputy's question are as follows.Article 18 of the EC Treaty lays down the right of every citizen of the Union to move freely within the territory of the member states, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in the EC Treaty and by measures adopted to give it effect. Community legislation stipulates that member states must generally admit nationals of other member states and the members of their family into their territory against presentation of a valid identity card or passport.The free movement of workers enshrined in article 39 of the EC Treaty entails the right for nationals of member states to take up residence within the territory of other member states and to reside there for the purposes of seeking employment. The period of residence for a person seeking employment may be limited. However, in the Antonissen case — C 292/89 — the European Court of Justice determined that it was unlawful for a member state to require an unemployed EU national to leave after six months where the person concerned provides evidence that he or she is continuing to seek employment and that he or she has genuine chances of being engaged.The situation in regard to students is set out in Council Directive 93/96/EEC. In essence that confers the right of residence on students who are enrolled in a recognised educational establishment for the principal purpose of following a vocational training course where such students are covered by sickness insurance and have sufficient resources to avoid becoming a burden on the social security system. However, in another European Court of Justice case — C 184/89 — the court determined that a student did not automatically lose his or her rights of residence as a result of having recourse to the host member state's social security system.The circumstances in which a person who is exercising EU Treaty rights of free movement may be removed from a member state are set out in Directive 64/221/EEC. The grounds may be summarised as grounds relating to public policy, public security and public health. That directive is intended to limit the discretionary power which national laws generally confer on the authority responsible for the expulsion of foreign nationals. In the Van Duyn case — C 41/74 — the European Court of Justice held that the directive confers rights on EU nationals which are directly enforceable by them in the national court and which the courts must protect. The directive also contains extensive procedural safeguards, regarding reasons for decisions, appeals and so forth. The public policy ground may not be used to serve economic ends.Similarly, in the case of Bouchereau — C 30/77 — the European Court of Justice found that the public policy ground cannot be invoked solely on the basis of a previous criminal conviction. The objective is to ensure that since free movement is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Community law, its effects can only be abrogated in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Proportionality requires justified grounds for a measure, justified balance between the measure and the objective and justified balance of interests between the individual and the state concerned.An EU national who is resident in another member state for more than three months is entitled to a residence permit. However, since the permit constitutes mere evidence of an entitlement to be here, failure to possess one cannot of itself constitute a ground for expulsion. These provisions are given effect in Irish law by the provisions of the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations 1977, SI No. 393/1977, and the European Communities (Right of Residence for Non Economically Active Persons) Regulations 1997, SI No. 57/1997.On 29 April 2004, Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states was adopted. This directive codifies in a single instrument the complex legislative corpus and the case law on free movement and residence. Member states are required to bring into force by 30 April 2006 such laws, regulations and administrative provisions as are necessary to comply with the directive.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	574	The proposals for the introduction of a fixed charge procedure for certain public order offences are contained in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which was published in July this year and which is awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil at present. Section 29 of that Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure for certain public order offences under that Act. The procedure will apply to an offence under section 4, intoxication in public place, and section 5, disorderly conduct in public place. It is intended that the fixed penalty procedure will be an alternative to criminal proceedings being taken in the first instance.In general, the section provides that a member of the Garda Síochána who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person — who is not less than 18 years old — is committing, or has committed, an offence under section 4 or section 5 of the 1994 Act, may serve on the person personally or by post a fixed charge notice. In default of payment the person will be prosecuted for the offence.The fixed charge notice will be in a prescribed form and will state specified matters, including when and where the fixed charge offence was alleged to have been committed, that a prosecution for it will not be instituted if within 28 days the person pays the prescribed amount or within a further 28 days pays an amount which is 50% greater than the prescribed amount and how the payment may be made.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will also be empowered by section 29 to make regulations prescribing relevant matters, which will include the amounts to be set for the fixed charges.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Navan Garda station as of 6 December 2004 was 47, all ranks.The Deputy states that Navan Garda station had the same number of gardaí in the 1980s as it has in 2004. While it is true that the strength of Navan Garda station in 1988 and 1989 was 47, the same as in 2004, this was as a result of a gradual increase through that decade, starting from a figure of 39 in 1980. Furthermore, local Garda management advise that during the 1980s a protection post at Tara mines was in existence, in which two gardaí were deployed during each eight hour tour of duty. This represented a demand on resources at that time. This post is no longer in operation.Garda personnel deployment throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public. The needs of Navan Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country during future allocations of probationer gardaí, where possible by way of permanent transfer of members to the division.As regards Garda resources generally, the Deputy will be aware that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources.Clearly, of course, they will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing and, as such, will have a real impact.

I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter before the end of this year. As regards the Dóchas centre, a final decision on its future cannot be taken until after a site for the new prison complex has been acquired and Government approval for the construction of a new complex has been obtained.While no final decision has been made to demolish the women's prison facility at Mountjoy, it is true that additional facilities are required for women prisoners and the intention is to provide an improved facility on the new site. In such a case, it would be more cost effective to transfer all prisoners from the existing site at Mountjoy to the new location when construction work has been completed, making the Dóchas facility redundant and freeing up space for a more attractive redevelopment of the Mountjoy site. Any female prison constructed on the new site would be equal, if not superior, to the Dóchas centre.The Dóchas facility will, at a very minimum, continue to remain in operation until a new facility has been completed and brought into operation, which will not happen before 2007/2008 at the earliest.

The use of Garda stations was considered as part of the major review of the Garda organisation structures under the strategic management initiative, SMI, programme of modernisation which looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. The Garda SMI implementation steering group's final report, which I have laid before the House and which is available on my Department's website, does not refer to the closure of any Garda station but rather makes recommendations to assist policy making with regard to the management and use of all available resources, including Garda stations.However, the position has changed significantly since the consideration of these issues under the SMI, in that the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, which proposes the most fundamental modernisation of the Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State, provides that the commissioner will have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform. It would be premature to anticipate at this stage what proposals, if any, might be developed by the commissioner in this context.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	578	Part II of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, as amended, provides in section 4 for an offence related to the possession of drugs with a value of €13,000 or more for the purpose of sale or supply. Section 5 provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment as well as for a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment.According to section 5, a court should not apply the mandatory minimum sentence where it is satisfied there are exceptional and specific circumstances which would make it unjust in all the circumstances to impose the minimum sentence of ten years. Factors to which the court may have regard include whether the person pleaded guilty, taking account of the stage at which such an intention was indicated and the circumstances surrounding the indication, and whether the person materially assisted the investigation of the offence.I am, of course, concerned that serious drug trafficking should be severely punished. In this respect, on the television programme to which the Deputy refers, I said that in recent times I had noticed a pattern of heavier sentencing for drug trafficking offences. Figures supplied by Garda authorities with regard to prosecutions under these provisions indicate an increase in the current year in the number of persons receiving a sentence of ten years or more. Figures relating to prosecutions since the provisions came into force on 26 May 1999 show that by 18 May this year, a total of 180 persons had been prosecuted, of whom 12 received a sentence of ten years or more. By 29 November of this year, the number of persons prosecuted had risen to 229, with 22 persons receiving a sentence of ten years or more.Information from a study commissioned by my Department into the criteria applied by the courts in sentencing under these provisions suggests that the provisions have resulted in a significant number of drug traffickers pleading guilty to serious drug trafficking offences. There are also indications that the provisions are of benefit in combating drug trafficking in that offenders are encouraged in accordance with the terms of the provisions to materially assist the Garda authorities in the hope of receiving a sentence of less than the ten year mandatory minimum.Nevertheless, I am examining whether improvements could be made to the provision in question to strengthen its effect. In this respect, I am considering bringing forward proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the Dáil at present.

The initiatives funded included a conference on perpetrators of domestic violence and an exhibition of 365 international posters to raise awareness of the issue of violence against women.My Department is one of five with responsibilities with regard to violence against women. The Department of Health and Children, through the health boards, has responsibility for the provision of care services to victims of violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. It also provides funding for non-governmental organisations such as Women's Aid, rape crisis centres, women's refuges and so on. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government assists in the provision of crisis accommodation, including refuge accommodation, for people who are forced to leave their homes as a result of domestic violence. The Department of Education and Science is responsible for educating pupils about this issue. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs funds community development programmes and grant aids local groups dealing with the issue.My Department's responsibilities with regard to violence against women include legislative initiatives, the provision of any necessary responses from the civil and criminal systems, preventative measures that can be put in place, including intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence, and awareness raising measures aimed at changing society's attitude to domestic violence. In addition, my Department co-ordinates the work of the national steering committee on violence against women, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.The Deputy is aware of the significant body of legislation that has been enacted by the Oireachtas with regard to all forms of violence against women and the importance which has been placed on the enactment of such legislation. The Deputy is also aware of the importance given to crimes against women by the Garda Síochána and the courts. Cases involving domestic violence receive priority treatment by the Legal Aid Board.Over the last number of years, my Department has supported the establishment and development of a number of intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence. These include MOVE Ireland, which operates 11 programmes nationally, the south east domestic violence intervention project, which operates four programmes in the south east, and the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency, which is operating on a pilot basis in the Dún Laoghaire and Bray District Court areas.In addition, my Department, on behalf of the national steering committee on violence against women, has conducted a number of awareness raising campaigns around the various aspects of violence against women in recent years. In conjunction with the committee, the Department is developing a national television and radio advertising campaign with regard to domestic violence, which will be conducted jointly with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland in the new year.

I am fully committed to establishing the commission as soon as possible.

In particular, the offence of a rape of a female reduced by 24% and sexual offences overall showed a decrease of 22% when compared with the figures for 2002. The headline crime offences of possession of firearms and discharge of firearms also showed a decrease of 4% and 10% respectively over the previous year. In addition, the number of robberies and aggravated burglaries also decreased by 14% over the previous year.I am conscious of the overriding necessity to ensure that public safety and security are given priority in any review of policy and legislation relating to firearms. With this in mind I have decided to bring forward, at an early stage, certain proposals for inclusion in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. In this context, I am looking at a number of proposals, including more severe penalties for firearms offences, set minimum sentences for the most serious offences, the introduction of a new offence of modification of a firearm, for example, the sawing off of a shotgun and a statutory basis for a period during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána. If approved by Government, I hope to see such proposals being brought forward as amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.In recent years, the Department has funded a number of awareness raising campaigns relating to rape and sexual assault which were conducted by the national steering committee on violence against women. In addition, as a preventative measure, the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform has provided funding to a number of rape crisis centres to deliver a training programme in schools in their locality.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has recently provided joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research, which is entitled "The Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases", is being carried out by the department of law at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland. This research should give us greater understanding as to why some victims choose not to report cases to the gardaí, what we can do about under reporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 47 together.The programme for Government and the progress of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing and reviewing child care services and to keeping child care at the forefront of its social agenda.The Deputies will be aware that there have been significant improvements in the provision of supports for the development of child care over the last number of years. Child care was identified as an investment priority under the National Development Plan 2000 — 2006. This was a direct response to the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 to develop a strategy for the development and delivery of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.My Department has been designated as the lead Department with respect to the development of child care to meet the needs of parents in employment, education and training. The equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, education and training.The EOCP 2000 — 2006 aims to increase by 50% the supply of centre based child care places by programme end. The programme also has a focus on many of the quality issues which were identified in the child care strategy and aims to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services throughout the country. In recognition of the many achievements of the EOCP 2000 — 2006 up to December 2003, the funding for the programme was increased to €449.3 million in spring 2004, from an earlier allocation of €436.7 million. Indeed, Deputies will recall that the original funding set aside in 2000 for the EOCP under the national development plan was €317 million. The Government has been so committed to the need to develop child care that the funding for the EOCP over the period 2000 to 2006 has now increased by 57% to €499.3 million following the recent budget.Our commitment to the development of the child care sector in Ireland has been reaffirmed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in budget 2005. The multi-annual capital envelopes announced that day include the injection of a further €90 million in capital funding into the EOCP over the five years from 2005 to 2009. This will mean an increase of €50 million in the availability of capital under the 2000 — 2006 phase of the EOCP bringing the total funding for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 — 2006 to €499.3 million while the remaining tranche of additional capital funding will be spent under the next phase of the EOCP.The programme provides capital grant assistance to create and enhance new and existing child care facilities, staffing grant assistance to community based not for profit organisations whose child care services have a strong focus on the support of the child care needs of disadvantaged families, and offers supports to the city/ county child care committees, to the national voluntary child care organisations, such as Barnardos, Childminding Ireland, the IPPA and the National Childrens Nursery Association and to others who are working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland.Total funding committed under the EOCP in the period to end November 2004 amounts to €266.8 million, of which €223 million has been allocated to child care facilities and €43 million to quality improvement measures. This will create 31,973 new child care places and will support 28,442 existing places. Of these, 20,500 new child care places were already in place by June 2004, an increase of 36% in the supply of child care places in four short years. These new places offer parents greater access to child care throughout Ireland as they meet their work and family needs. A significant part of the remaining funding will be required for continuing support to existing projects and for the provision of capital grant assistance for the development of child care facilities in areas where there are gaps in service provision.Following the provision of additional capital funding in budget 2005, I expect to be in a position to make a significant announcement of capital grant assistance within the next week or so. This will further expand the availability of quality child care places across Ireland.The above measures relate to the supply of quality child care. I also draw the Deputies' attention to the recommendations of the expert working group regarding the demand side of child care. Government policy in the area of child support aims to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children, whatever care options their parents choose for them. In that context, child benefit is the main fiscal instrument through which support is provided to parents with dependent children, and it provides support to all parents irrespective of income and employment status.In his Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced further increases of €10 per month to €141.60 per month for the first two children and €12 per month to €177.30 per month for third and subsequent child from April 2005. This means that over the period since 1997, monthly child benefit supports have been increased by more than 380%. This level of increase is unprecedented and delivers on the Government's objective of providing support for children generally while offering real choice to all parents in the care of their children.Further measures on child care are being provided by the Government in a range of different ways and I have outlined a number of examples for the Deputies' information. In 2001, the Department of Finance allocated €12.7 million capital expenditure for the provision of up to 15 Civil Service crèches for the children of Government employees. Five crèches are in operation and a further crèche is due to open in January 2005. Proposals for additional crèches are being considered.In March 2001, the IDA launched a scheme to provide for the creation of high quality, workplace child care facilities in IDA Ireland business parks around the country. Four of these have opened, with another under construction and a sixth at contract stage. Since the start of 2002, the city and county enterprise boards have approved funding of over €1.5 million to 150 child care centres across the country. This funding comprises mainly staffing grants, with a small number of capital grants available.Capital allowances are available for capital expenditure on the construction, extension and refurbishment of a building, which is used for the purpose of providing a pre-school service or similar service. There is also an exemption on the usual benefit in kind provisions for employees who enjoy free or subsidised child care facilities provided by their employers. In such circumstances, the employer must be wholly or partly responsible for both financing and managing the child care facility.The outcomes of the present programme will be monitored closely to inform the forward planning process in order to support the twin needs of quality child care provision and labour market supports. This Government's record in providing enhanced child care services is without parallel and I am confident that we are moving rapidly to ensure that there are quality services available to parents throughout the country.

The general policy on family reunification where the family members in question are not visa required, requires that the person already in the State must be in a position to support the family without recourse to public funds. The spouses and children of the majority of foreign workers in the State fall into this category.The policy on family members who are visa required is that a non-EEA national who is working in the State on an employment permit may apply for family reunification for a spouse or a minor child on condition that he or she has been working here for at least 12 months, or three months in the case of certain skilled workers, and are likely to remain so for a similar period, that is, the employment permit has been renewed. He or she must be in a position to support family members without recourse to public funds.In line with this policy, visa applications are considered by a visa officer and the average processing time is from four to six weeks. In the case of a refused visa application, the decision may be appealed in writing to a visa appeals officer in the immigration division of my Department. Such an appeal incurs no charge and the only limitation is that an appeal must be submitted within two months of receipt of the refusal notice. A decision on an appeal will issue within four to six weeks of the date of receipt of the appeal.A person granted refugee status in Ireland may apply for family reunification under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996. Save in very exceptional cases, under section 18(3) upon verification by the Refugee Applications Commissioner of the authenticity of the relationship, such permission must be granted to immediate family members of a refugee, that is, spouse, minor children and, if the refugee is an unmarried minor, his or her parents. Applications for family reunification may also be made for dependent members of a refugee's family under section 18(4). Dependent member of the family means any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who is dependent on the refugee or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain himself or herself fully.As these applications by their nature require very detailed and individual examination it is not possible to give an average processing time. On a more general note, the immigration division of my Department is continually endeavouring to improve the quality of services to its customers.

A detailed breakdown of these actions in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens' rights is not readily available. However, a database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána indicates that in 2003, the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available, of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department, 34 cases of alleged assault were recorded and 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest were recorded. The remaining 70 cases recorded included allegations of defamation and harassment. In the year to date, 120 actions have been initiated or received. They include 37 cases of alleged assault and 25 cases of alleged unlawful arrest.Civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against the Garda Síochána concerns assault and unlawful arrest. The majority of these cases have been settled for less than €25,500. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State Counsel.The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents, which result in successful claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí, are examined with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into question. One of the principal aims of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 is the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána which will secure public confidence and which will address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.Year (Total Amount)AssaultUnlawful ArrestOther€€€2001 €1,619,746.83Awards1,904.61 (1)20,950.68(2)22,220.42 (1)Settlements123,164.59 (5)33,965.49 (3)162,782.25 (9)Costs244,665.35123,199.41886,894.03Total€369,734.55€178,115.58€1,071,896.702002 €1,240,388.40Awards1,270 (1)3,809.21 (1)56,500 (2)Settlements166,924.48 (6)106,835.58(10)185,078.82(11)Costs230,769.67148,714.19340,486.45Total398,964.15259,358.98582,065.272003 (Provisional) €1,276,127.55Awards11,000 (1)10,000 (2)4,870 (2)Settlements75,000 (4)303,011 (5)112,814.84 (4)Costs145,561.7071,794.28542,075.73Total231,561.70384,805.28659,760.572004 (Provisional) €686,993.29 As of 03/12/04Awards15,000 (1)03,215.06 (1)Settlements48,697.48 (3)223,007 (7)47,500(2)Costs110,316.3194,702.16144,555.28Total174,013.79317,709.16195,270.34The number of cases in which awards were made by the courts and the number of cases which were settled out of court are shown in brackets in each case.

This figure refers to those members who have successfully completed the student-probationer education-training programme.I am further informed that a total of 1,072 members across all ranks have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda Síochána since the 6 June 2002. A total of 1,563 recruits have been attested to the Garda Síochána in the same period. Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees are serving members of the force. Therefore the strength of the force has increased by 491 members since June 2002.Formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. Therefore, the serving strength of the force at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase 3 of their training but have not yet formally graduated.

One fundamental consideration, which arises in most cases, relates to the extent to which the couple will in the future be in a position to support themselves without recourse to public funds. That in turn requires an evaluation of the nature and extent of the relationship between the persons in question.Where the persons in question are married that evaluation is relatively straightforward from an administrative point of view. However, where the relationship is more informal its dynamics are more difficult to determine objectively — particularly where it is not underpinned by any formal legal contract. At present, the Irish immigration system does not recognise same sex couples as families for immigration purposes. It is, of course, possible for both parties to such a relationship to enter the State independently, for example, for work or study purposes. A similar situation arises in the case of unmarried couples.The issue of non-marital partnerships and same sex relationships is currently being considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. It is also an issue which I intend to address in my proposed discussion document on an immigration and residence Bill, which will be published in early 2005.

In addition, the national juvenile office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants.The Children Act 2001 came into effect in May 2002 and it was at this point that the existing Garda diversion programme began operating on a statutory basis. Included in that Act is the introduction into the criminal justice system of the concept of restorative justice and family conferencing, the provisions for which are currently being put into effect by the Garda Síochána. The diversion programme is delivered throughout the country by specially trained gardaí. Resource implications are constantly under review and applications for additional resources are made on a case by case basis when and where necessary.On Garda resources generally, the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context due consideration will, inter alia, be given to the resourcing of the juvenile liaison scheme. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government.The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps.

There are good health, safety and security reasons for not providing needle exchange programmes in prisons and to do so would be inconsistent with the commitments set out in the programme for Government. Emphasis within prisons is on health education and, where appropriate, substitution treatment. Prisoner health education not only discourages injecting behaviour but also points out the health benefits of not sharing needles and injecting equipment.Introducing a needle exchange scheme would act as a clear message that the use of intravenous drugs in prisons is tolerated. For many prisoners, imprisonment offers them an opportunity to examine their problems and, with the support of prison services, to try and address them. By facilitating rather than challenging drug abuse, the Irish Prison Service would be consciously releasing prisoners back into society as full blown addicts with a habit only capable of being fed by the commission of further serious crime or even degrading acts of prostitution.Needle exchange schemes would subvert and run contrary to increasing staff vigilance in searching for drugs and preventing them being smuggled into prisons. Drug control in prisons would be reduced to a game in which a blind eye approach to successful breaches of the controls would, in time, become the order of the day. As a criminal justice agency, the Irish Prison Service is actively working to prevent breaches of the criminal law relating to illicit drugs. It is simply not possible to have staff fully committed to preventing the possession and distribution of illicit drugs within prisons while simultaneously distributing syringes to prisoners to be used to inject illicit drugs. The Irish Prison Service is committed to the twin strategies of supply and demand reduction to deal with the issue of drugs in prison — closing off routes of supply and providing support to prisoners to tackle their addictions. The introduction of needle exchange would run contrary to these approaches.The report of the group to review the structure and organisation of prison health care services considered the matter of developing a syringe exchange programme within Irish prisons and came to the conclusion that such a step could not be recommended. Furthermore, the programme for Government states: "we will publish a plan to completely end all heroin use in Irish prisons". This will include the availability of treatment and rehabilitation for all who need them and the introduction of mandatory drug testing for prisoners where necessary.My Department, in conjunction with the Irish Prison Service, has been working hard to implement the Government's response, as stated in the programme for Government, to deal with this serious issue and we will, early in the coming year, implement our new strategy of mandatory drug testing, addiction counselling and treatment and increase measures to prevent drug usage and to provide a more complete system of rehabilitation.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	595	In 1998, the Government set up a review group to examine issues arising from the illegal and harmful use of the Internet, with particular emphasis on the protection of children. The group in its report recommended the establishment of a system of self regulation by the Internet service provider industry as the most flexible, efficient, least bureaucratic and cost effective means of combating these illegal and harmful uses. The components of such a system were to include the following: an Internet Advisory Board, IAB — established February 2000 — which promotes awareness of Internet downside issues, co-ordinates efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet and monitors the system of self regulation by the Internet service provider industry; a public hotline for reporting child pornography, established 1999 and funded by the industry; an industry code of practice setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider, agreed February 2002.The code of practice and ethics, which was agreed between the Internet Advisory Board and the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland, ISPAI, sets down the conditions around such issues as acceptable use policies, complaints procedures, obligations in respect to "take down" notices and so forth. The ISPAI has a key role in monitoring compliance with the code and enforcing disciplinary actions in the event of non-compliance.In 2003, the Internet Advisory Board carried out a review of the implementation and effectiveness of the code of practice and ethics after a year in operation. As part of its review, the board commissioned an independent examination by the IAPCODE project based at Oxford University, which receives funding from the EU's safer Internet action plan. Its report endorsed the code as a model of its type; however, it recommended a number of adjustments to take account of the recent legal developments in the area of data protection, e-commerce and mechanisms for dealing with content originating abroad.The Internet Advisory Board's review, which was presented to me in July 2004, found that the technical and legal requirements of the code of practice and ethics remains valid and appropriate and also found a positive level of compliance among those service providers who have subscribed to it. However, while at present 15 of the largest of the Internet service providers, representing 95% of Internet traffic in the State, are members of the ISPAI, ongoing effort is needed to ensure that the totality of the industry is represented and signed up to the code of practice and ethics and formally supports the industry hotline.As part of the ongoing process of evaluation of the effectiveness of the self regulatory regime for the industry, I invited senior executives of all the Internet service providers to meet with me on the 12 October last. I emphasised that, for self regulation to work, it must be supported by all of the industry. I propose to keep this issue of industry self regulation under active review in conjunction with the Internet Advisory Board.

So far, 11 firearms and four knives have been seized. A number of prosecutions are pending as a result of the operation.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that community policing in the Dublin metropolitan region west division forms an integral part of Operation Crossover II and that there are 78 gardaí employed on community policing duties. The total personnel strength of the Dublin metropolitan region west division as at 6 December 2004 was 662, all ranks. Local Garda management is satisfied that the resources available in west Dublin are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area.

The Government decided that all outstanding claims to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child, as well as future claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish born children, would be examined and decided on individually. A notice to this effect was published on 18 July 2003.The amendment to the Constitution following last June's referendum has allowed the Oireachtas to deal with the issue of citizenship for children of non-national parents. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004 is before the Oireachtas. The situation on the ground will not change until the legislation has been enacted and commenced. Any person born in Ireland is still entitled to Irish citizenship. This continues to attract persons with no link to Ireland to seek to come here to acquire Irish and EU citizenship for their children.I will make my proposals for the future handling of such cases known after the legislation has been enacted. As I have said before, the approach will be based on decency, pragmatism and common sense.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I have previously informed the House that allegations of serious wrongdoing by members of the Garda Síochána, such as those broadcast on the "Prime Time" programme, are of serious concern to me. Some of the cases featured in the television programme of 8 January were previously reported and in the public domain. A number of the cases have been dealt with in the courts or by the existing complaints and disciplinary mechanisms. Civil proceedings have been initiated in certain cases and there may yet be other civil actions, so the Deputy will appreciate that, in the circumstances, I am limited in what I can say on the specific details of individual cases.On 1 November 2004, I received a report from the commissioner in respect of all matters featured in the broadcast in question. In his report, the commissioner reviews the investigation of each case highlighted in the programme and proposes a number of specific measures with regard to the systems, practices and procedures that operate within the Garda Síochána to ensure the existence of adequate safeguard mechanisms for the mutual benefit of members of the public and the force. One recommendation of the commissioner in this regard is to carry out an initial pilot project for the installation of stand alone digital audio-visual recording systems in two Garda stations. The pilot project is to assess the various issues involved and it will cover reception areas and areas from which access can be gained to interview rooms and detention cells.The Deputy will appreciate that I need to consider the report carefully and discuss it with the commissioner before making further detailed comments. The Deputy is well aware of my views that the existing law and procedures for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána are not adequate to the task. Allegations of the type aired on "Prime Time" provoke entirely legitimate unease in the public mind but can also cause frustration within the force at what is sometimes regarded as a lack of balance and fairness.The most fundamental objective now must be to put in place a mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána which commands the full confidence of members of the public and the force alike and which will adjudicate on complaints in a manner accepted by all as authoritative. To this end, a key objective of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 — Committee Stage of this Bill is being taken in Seanad Éireann today — is the establishment of a fully independent ombudsman commission which will have wide powers to investigate complaints made against members of the Garda Síochána. I hope these proposals will come before this House soon and that they will have the support of all Deputies.

The intention is that the drugs policy will facilitate consistent regulatory and operational structures in pursuing both supply and demand reduction.The policy will have regard to the commitment in the programme for Government to end all heroin use in Irish prisons and my commitment to achieving a drug free prison system. Working to fulfil these commitments will involve implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population and meet prisoners' treatment needs.Central to supporting future supply and demand reduction will be the introduction of mandatory drug testing, as envisaged in the programme for Government. Already, prisoners accommodated in the open centres at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House, and in the designated drug free areas of Wheatfield Prison and the training unit and St. Patrick's Institution in the Mountjoy complex, are required to undergo frequent drug tests to confirm their drug free status.Mandatory drug testing will, however, soon operate throughout the prison system. It will enable identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enable enhanced focusing of resources and act as a deterrent to drug misuse. The new prison rules, which are almost finalised in my Department, will include specific provision for mandatory drug testing and, in this context, it is intended that the Irish Prison Service will, early in the new year, commence implementation of a new strategy of mandatory drug testing, addiction counselling and treatment and increased measures to prevent drug usage to provide a more complete system of rehabilitation.

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.The new recruitment campaign for the Garda Síochána has already commenced and record numbers of recruits will be taken on. In each quarter, for the next three years, approximately 274 recruits will be taken into the college. If one takes into account the projected number of retirements, one will note that the recruitment process will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as 2006.This record recruitment drive will place at the disposal of the Garda Commissioner a significant increase in Garda resources. The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Garda personnel deployments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources.

If parents acting in good faith leave their children in the care and custody of another appropriate person, the State will not interfere with those arrangements so long as the decision does not amount to a failure in the duty towards their child which would justify State intervention. There are no circumstances in which I can direct such children to leave the State and I would not wish to do so.

To attempt to provide such a breakdown would require the Garda revisiting each of the 118 cases involved, which would entail a disproportionate use of time and resources.The above costs include Garda expenses associated with these removal operations. The Garda Commissioner advises me that, given the wide range of immigration duties performed by the Garda Siochána and the Garda national immigration bureau in particular, it is not possible to identify the particular pay and overtime costs incurred by the gardaí in connection with these charter flights. He informs me that charter flights involve a lower ratio of Garda escorts to deportees than is the case using conventional schedule flights, resulting in savings to the Garda budget.There are two main categories of repatriation charter flights: small charters, organised to remove disruptive deportees that commercial airlines will not take on account of previous disruptive behaviour on board aircraft, and big charters organised to return larger numbers of deportees in a more efficient way than using scheduled flights. Ireland does not have direct flights to the destinations where these charters have taken place. The alternative to chartering is transiting through hub European airports involving longer transfer times, more inconvenience to deportees and the attendant risk of deportees absconding in transit.The use of charter flights, including joint charters shared by two or more countries, is accepted and used widely across the European Union as an effective and efficient means of returning persons illegally present on the territories of member states following individual consideration of their cases. The European Council of Ministers adopted a decision in April 2004 facilitating the greater use of joint repatriation flights as a means of demonstrating solidarity among member states, increasing the rate of returns and making more effective use of resources. Ireland has carried out two such joint operations with the Netherlands on 28 November 2003 to Romania and Bulgaria and with the UK to Romania and Moldova on 18 November 2003, details of which are provided in the table.It is well established that an effective deportation process is a necessary element of an immigration system. The lack of an effective means to deport persons not granted permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration and asylum laws. Failure to enforce deportation orders in the case of disruptive behaviour would produce two main outcomes: it would send a clear signal that deportation can be avoided by simply being disruptive and disruptive behaviour by deportees on scheduled flights would become the norm, leading to concerns for the safety of passengers and staff on aircraft, and cause further difficulties for the gardaí in the already problematic task of enforcing deportation orders.

I have nothing further to add to what I have already put on the public record about criminal activity at Dublin Port other than to say that the Garda authorities assure me that a high priority has been and continues to be placed on the prevention and detection of the larceny of high value products from Dublin Port. This involves the deployment of appropriate strategies involving the exploitation of all available resources in intelligence led operations. In this regard, substantial quantities of stolen goods have been recovered and persons arrested.

The majority of cases relate to inmates imprisoned in Cork, Limerick and Portlaoise. I await legal advice from the Attorney General on the matter and cannot comment further other than to say that it is my intention to vigorously contest the claims.A new accommodation block for Portlaoise Prison is the subject of a tender competition and it is anticipated that construction works will commence in 2005 and be completed by 2007. As the costs and operational issues of retrofitting in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy and Cork Prisons are prohibitive, the Prison Service seeks to develop new state of the art prison facilities on green field sites. In the case of Mountjoy Prison, a process is under way to identify suitable sites near Dublin. My officials and the Office of Public Works are examining plans for a new prison development on Spike Island.

To achieve that, it is planned to recruit almost 1,100 new recruits every year for the next three years. The advertising campaign for this first tranche of 1,100 recruits was launched on Thursday, 25 November 2004.Some 130 members of all ranks of the Garda Síochána will retire during 2005 on compulsory age grounds. In addition, the Garda authorities project, on the basis of averages from previous years, that an additional 321 members will either choose to retire having attained 30 years' service and reached the age of 50 or otherwise retire or resign.The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources outlined above. Of course, they will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will also be possible to address other priorities, such as the need to increase significantly the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing, where they will have a real impact.

Under section 18(3), such permission must, save in very exceptional cases, be granted to immediate family members of a refugee, that is, spouse, minor children and, if the refugee is an unmarried minor, his or her parents, upon verification by the Refugee Applications Commissioner of the authenticity of the relationship.Applications for family reunification may also be made for dependent members of a refugee's family under section 18(4). Dependent member of the family means any grandparent, parent, brother, sister, child, grandchild, ward or guardian of the refugee who is dependent on the refugee or is suffering from a mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonable for him or her to maintain him- or herself fully. Such applications may be granted at my discretion.A non-EEA national working in the State on an employment permit may apply for family reunification with spouse or minor child on condition that he or she has been working here for at least 12 months, or three months for certain skilled workers, and is likely to remain so for a similar period, that is, the work permit has been renewed. He or she must be in a position to support family members without recourse to public funds.Ireland's policy in this area is broadly in line with that of the rest of the European Union and with practice internationally. However, as family reunification is a very important migratory issue, I will examine this type of immigration fully in the context of the development of the new immigration and residence Bill. However, I do not envisage any significant change in the current conditions regarding the length of time that the non-EEA national has been in the State and the ability to support dependent family members without recourse to public funds.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	610	Section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.While the labelling of containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold with a view to combating under age consumption of intoxicating liquor is an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome to render it effective in practice. Those challenges arise under two headings.First, practical difficulties will be encountered where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, for example, a six pack of bottles, a plastic wrapped tray of cans or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of wine. That raises the important question of whether the label should be attached at the point of sale or earlier in the distribution chain.Attaching labels at an earlier stage would be simpler but it would create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and that would lead in turn to increased distribution costs. Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules. Also, it would be naive to overlook the possibility of labels being removed, or being made non-legible, after sale. The possible transfer of the contents to another unmarked container cannot be ruled out either.Second, from an enforcement perspective, it is clear that possession by an under age person of a labelled intoxicating liquor container does not in itself constitute proof that the product had been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container. The container in question may have been taken from the family home or may have been sold to a person over the age of 18 years in good faith by the licensee before being passed on to the under age person. Such a container may have passed through several hands before finding its way into the hands of an under age person.Issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container were raised during consultations on implementation of section 22 of the 2003 Act and my Department subsequently raised them with the Office of the Attorney General. The Attorney General's office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container and doubt is therefore cast on the utility of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.One option that could be considered in the context of future legislation is a presumption that any intoxicating liquor container found in the possession of an under age person had been purchased by that person from the licensee identified on the container until the contrary was proved. However, the Attorney General's office has also advised that such a proposal would raise serious constitutional issues and would run the significant risk of being found to be inconsistent with Article 38 of the Constitution.For those reasons, I do not, as I have already stated on several occasions, intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act at this time. I will, however, give further consideration to this matter in the context of the forthcoming Bill to codify the licensing laws. I will give serious consideration to any reasonable and workable proposal that would deal with this matter without giving rise to the practical, enforcement and evidential difficulties that I have outlined.

Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to comment in any detail on the statement referred to by the Deputy.However, for the information of the Deputy, all applications for refugee status are processed in accordance with the statutory framework set out in the Refugee Act 1996, as most recently amended by the Immigration Act 2003. The refugee determination agencies in processing asylum claims also have regard to the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for determining Refugee Status. Consideration of an applicant's credibility is dealt with in some detail in both the UNHCR handbook and in section 11B of the 1996 Act. This would also be a key focus of training in the refugee determination agencies which is provided by a number of sources, including the UNHCR, and is kept under constant review.

The Supreme Court judgment of January 2003 in the L&O case is complex but an important finding was that while an Irish born child has a right to have the care and company of his or her parents, there is no absolute right for this to take place in Ireland; further, the Government may determine to deport a family, notwithstanding the effective removal of the Irish born child, without violating the child's rights. The absence of such automatic rights of residence are a feature of most immigration regimes even those with jus soli rule of citizenship such as the USA.It is a matter for parents of a child who is not liable to be deported to make a decision about the welfare of that child if they themselves are deported. Ordinarily, parents have a duty as well as a right to provide properly for their children's upbringing and this duty is recognised by the Constitution. If parents acting in good faith leave their children in the care and custody of another appropriate person, the State will not interfere with those arrangements so long as the decision does not amount to a failure in the duty towards their child which would justify State intervention. If, on the other hand, the parents exercise their rights in voluntarily taking their child back with them, the exercise of such parental rights cannot be interpreted as contrary to the international conventions referred to by the Deputy.

My objective over the period of the annual Estimates campaign has been to ensure that the financial resources being made available by Government for the justice sector in 2005 are appropriate to meet the many challenges that lie ahead.I have succeeded in securing an all time historic high level of funding for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its associated agencies. The Garda, the courts and the prisons together with the Department itself have never been better resourced or equipped. The Garda budget is over €1.1billion. Within three years the strength of the force will be 14,000. The Department's budget, which in addition to providing services at central level also supports the work of over 20 agencies which are supplying public services in legal aid, equality, immigration, private security industry and so forth, will have a budget of €366 million in 2005.The funding will enable a number of key public policy imperatives to go ahead next year. Included in these is the recruitment of additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force by 2000 within two years, bringing its total complement to 14,000, with these additional gardaí being deployed in high visibility and non-indoor policing duties. Also included is the continuation of the national child care programme which is addressing historic shortfalls in the supply of child care facilities in all areas of the State, particularly in the designated RAPID areas, and construction of a brand new state of the art criminal court complex.In addition, early in November last I made additional direct funding available to the Garda Síochána for the remainder of 2005. This has enabled the Garda to undertake a number of high visibility policing operations including: special burglary prevention patrols in residential housing estates; additional plain clothes and uniform patrols of areas where increased incidents of disorder are identified; additional uniform and plain clothes patrols of areas adjoining business and commercial areas of cities and large towns; additional patrols of public areas where public order problems are prevalent; increased Garda presence on the road network between now and the end of the year to reduce the number of road traffic fatalities through intensified road traffic law enforcement; high visibility uniform presence on busy thoroughfares, particularly late at night, where large numbers of people are congregated following late night entertainment, especially during the lead up to Christmas; increased inspections of licensed firearms to ensure adequate security; patrolling in the vicinity of car parks of licensed premises at key times and when serious road traffic offences are believed to be committed; increased emphasis on community policing patrols, which will entail visits to elderly and vulnerable persons residing in remote locations, and extra patrols during the lead up to Christmas to provide security for the additional cash in circulation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I draw the Deputy's attention to my responses to previous questions which were taken on 16 November 2004, Nos. 228 and 229, and on 23 November 2004, Nos. 407 to 409. I indicated that, for security reasons and the need to carry out essential maintenance, a small cohort of prison staff continued to be assigned to duties at both the Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention. There are currently 11 and 13 staff serving at the Curragh and Fort Mitchel respectively and the following table provides a breakdown by grade:GradeCurraghFort MitchelGovernor 211Assistant Governor1Clerk 11Clerk 21Prison Officer74Chief Trades Officer 211Trades Officer15Total1113The Deputy will note that since my previous reply to the House on 23 November last there has been an increase of one in the staff assigned to Fort Mitchel, a trades officer. This is because the trades officer in question had been providing cover in respect of an officer on sick leave at another institution and on that officer's return, the trades officer resumed work at Fort Mitchel. I should point out also, regarding the two governor posts, that while they continue to maintain a watching brief in respect of the institutions in question, they have been assigned senior management responsibilities elsewhere.The last prisoners transferred out of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel on 20 January 2004 and 10 February 2004 respectively. Fort Mitchel was fully operational until mothballed on 10 February 2004 and the Curragh was fully operational until mothballed on 20 January 2004.The following table shows the amounts paid in salaries, expenses and overtime to the staff remaining at the Curragh and Fort Mitchel from the dates on which they were mothballed to end November 2004.CurraghFort MitchelTotals€€Salary (incl. employers PRSI)514,000606,4001,120,400Expenses (Travel and Subsistence)1,0004,900*5,900Overtime71,80056,000127,800*The amount shown in respect of expenses at Fort Mitchel is distorted somewhat by the fact that staff of Fort Mitchel are also, on occasion, temporarily assigned to Cork Prison and the above figure reflects expenses in respect of such temporary transfers.As previously indicated, some overtime at these institutions is necessary due to the pattern of cover required to maintain security on a 24 hour seven day week basis and the small number of staff providing that cover. The mothballing of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention continues to achieve the Government's objective of significantly reducing overtime levels in the Prison Service. The service has been able to secure savings in respect of pay costs of both facilities in the year to date and significant overall savings in respect of overtime in 2004 has been achieved as most of the staff from the Curragh and Fort Mitchel have been redeployed to effect overtime savings in other Prison Service institutions.When the Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention were mothballed it made sense to retain a small cadre of staff from those institutions rather than retaining private security firms which would have incurred additional costs. In any event, it would not have been appropriate to retain a private security firm in a situation where the institutions in question were not being closed but simply mothballed so that they could be reopened at short notice should the Government decide on that course of action.The staffing arrangements of both institutions are being kept under continuing review and any decision on their future will have regard to the ongoing discussions between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers' Association about eliminating overtime and reducing other costs. These discussions are close to being concluded and I am hopeful that an agreement will be finalised in the next month or so and that staff will ballot for acceptance.

There are legislative and procedural safeguards to ensure that persons are not returned to countries where they would be at risk. The issue of refoulement as set out in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 is given full consideration in every case before a deportation order is made.My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	619	Racially motivated incidents are independently recorded by two bodies, the Garda Síochána and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI.The NCCRI was established with funding from my Department. Its objective is to develop an integrated approach against racism and promote a more participative and intercultural society. The NCCRI, in partnership with a range of non-government organisations, has organised a system of reporting racist incidents. The system aims to profile the number, type and location of incidents and to identify emerging trends.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda racial and intercultural office was established to co-ordinate, monitor and advise on all aspects of policing in the area of ethnic and cultural diversity. The office monitors the statistics of racially motivated incidents on a monthly basis. In addition to this, staff liaise with victims of crime and with the investigating Garda. The Garda authorities inform me that there is an approved policy for recording incidents that are racially motivated. The NCCRI records incidents that are not necessarily related to criminal offences. This is one reason for the difference in the number of incidents reported to the Garda Síochána. I am pleased to note that the number of incidents with a racist motive recorded has fallen since 2002. There were 102 such incidents reported in 2002, 69 in 2003 and 42 incidents reported up to 8 November of this year.Incidents motivated by racism, sectarianism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are recorded on the PULSE computer system. Personnel at the Garda racial and intercultural office, which was established in 2001, monitor all incidents to ensure that the system is accurately recording all such offences. Where such incidents occur, the Garda Síochána ensures that an investigation is pursued with reference to the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Prohibition of the Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which are the relevant legislative instruments pertaining to hate crime. Garda policy on the recording in PULSE of racially motivated incidents was circulated to the organisation in December 2002.I understand that the Garda Commissioner has approved the appointment of ethnic liaison officers. There are 145 such officers stationed around the country. The role of the liaison officer is to liaise with leaders of ethnic communities and inform and assure the ethnic communities of Garda services and protection.

In the meantime sufficient support to underpin the existing analogue communications networks and data communications networks will be maintained. Further information on this issue is outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 27313/04 of 3 November, 2004. In addition, it is planned to upgrade the PABX installations in some 50 Garda stations so that they can be brought on to the Government VPN.I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that replacement Garda vehicles will be provided in accordance with normal replacement schedules. Normal scheduled replacements take place at approximately 100,000 miles for cars and vans and less for motorcycles. Indications are that between 400 and 500 vehicles will be replaced next year. Upgrading of vehicles depends on the particular use of those vehicles but the policy of the fleet management section is one of continuous improvement in specifications both in terms of safety and vehicle application. This is reflected in terms of safety features and sophisticated Garda equipment, which is written into Garda specifications.The policy of Garda management is to provide the safest possible working environment for its members and vehicle purchase will always reflect this policy. Improvement in vehicle specification is continuous and upgrades will take place depending on the merits of particular situations.

The number of Garda drivers, motorcyclists and air crew involved in presenting this fleet amounted to 12 members.As the members who participated in this presentation were on regular duty at the time, there were no incremental costs above the normal payroll costs associated with the duration of this event. It is estimated that the payroll cost of members present for the press launch of the traffic corps amounted to some €800. The fleet of vehicles present have already been paid for out of the Garda Vote and, consequently, the only cost would have been the fuel costs of diverting these vehicles from existing duties to Garda headquarters.The motor vehicles on display were sourced from the following stations: Blackrock, Naas, Mullingar, Fermoy, Ennis, Drogheda, Kells and Castlebar.

The review includes consideration of the measures to support witnesses in court cases who may not wish to enter the programme and current international best practice. I can assure the Deputy that, when received, the recommendations of the review will be given full and careful consideration.In respect of the particular case raised by the Deputy, it is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to comment on individual cases. However, it should be noted that admittance to and continued participation in the witness security programme is entirely voluntary on the part of the witness and no compellability can be or is involved.

The preparation of heads of a judicial council Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department and I expect to be in a position shortly to bring the heads to Government for approval, with a view to publishing the Bill itself in the first half of 2005. The legislation will provide, among other things, a process for the investigation of complaints about judicial misbehaviour, including lay participation in such investigations.It is my intention to bring the heads of the Bill before the joint committee on justice when they have reached a suitable stage so that Members of both Houses can have a pre-emptive look at how the legislation is developing. I am confident that the promised legislation will be enacted during the term of office of the present Government so the question of a delay in fulfilling the promise made in An Agreed Programme for Government does not arise.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	626	Legislation is currently being prepared in my Department which will criminalise trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation as provided for in the EU Council framework decision on combating trafficking in persons. The legislation will also take into account the protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, supplementing the UN convention against transnational organised crime. It will also take into account the Council of Europe draft convention on action against trafficking in human beings. Negotiations on this instrument have not yet been completed.A series of measures has been taken at national level. From a legislative point of view, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking ) Act 2000 creates an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and provides a framework by which those engaging in trafficking of illegal immigrants can be dealt with under the law. Section 2(1) of this Act states that a person who organises or knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to seek asylum shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,500, €1904.61, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both; or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both. This provision will not apply to anything done by a person otherwise than for gain or to anything done to assist a person seeking asylum by a person in the course of his or her employment by a bona fide organisation if the purpose of that organisation includes giving assistance to persons seeking asylum.Furthermore, the Immigration Act 2003, which was brought into operation in September 2003, requires carriers operating aircraft, ferries or other vehicles bringing persons to Ireland from outside the common travel area to ensure that those carried are in possession of the necessary immigration documentation — a passport and, if required, a visa. The Act provides for a fine to be imposed in respect of each passenger carried with inadequate documentation.In addition, section 8 of the Act places an obligation on Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, the Garda Síochána and also the refugee determination bodies to share information regarding non-nationals, including applicants for refugee status, for the purpose of the administration of the law relating to their entry, sojourn in the State and removal from the State. The provisions in the Act are designed to ensure the proper flow of information between the relevant Departments and agencies involved in the delivery of services in the asylum and immigration area and for the efficient and effective fulfilment by the bodies in question of their functions in those areas. The sharing of relevant information is an essential tool in the fight against trafficking. It is the very essence of a "joined up" Government approach to the problem.The Garda national immigration bureau has as one of its primary objectives the co-ordination and direction of strategies to combat trafficking in illegal immigrants. Garda liaison officers in London and Paris interact with local law enforcement authorities on immigration, people smuggling and trafficking matters. European initiatives in the area of enforcement and compliance with immigration procedures and combating illegal immigration have focused on building upon the relevant provisions of the Schengen acquis and incorporating them into Community legislation. Council Directive 2001/51/EC of 28 June 2001 supplementing the provisions of Article 26 of the convention implementing the Schengen Agreement incorporates a system of carriers liability into European law.Other measures include the establishment of a European agency for the management of operational co-operations at external borders which will co-ordinate all joint operations and pilot projects. It will also establish its own specialised branches responsible for dealing with specific aspects of control and surveillance of land, air and maritime borders by transforming the existing, more informal, centres structure into an EU structure.The directive on the residence permit issued to third country nationals who are victims of trafficking in human beings or to third country nationals who have been subjects of an action to facilitate illegal immigration who co-operate with the competent authorities was adopted at the JHA Council of 29 April 2004. The purpose of this directive is to strengthen the European Union's legislative framework for combating illegal immigration by granting a residence permit of limited duration for the victims of trafficking of human beings. The granting of the residence permit is subject to conditions designed to encourage victims of trafficking to co-operate with the competent authorities against those suspected of committing the crimes in question.The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 makes it an offence inter alia to organise or knowingly facilitate the entry into, transit through or exit from the State of a child for the purpose of the child’s sexual exploitation or to provide accommodation for such a child while in the State. The penalty on conviction on indictment for that offence is a maximum of life imprisonment, a reflection of the seriousness of this type of crime. Finally, the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 allows for the confiscation of assets of those involved in criminal activity, including trafficking in people, drugs and so forth. In addition, the powers of the Revenue Commissioners may be brought to bear where appropriate — for example, assessment or liability for tax on illegal earnings.

At that time I also announced that the corps would be headed by a new assistant commissioner. The assistant commissioner, on his appointment, will review the structure of the new traffic corps, the allocation of transport, equipment and human resources and to which divisions these resources will be distributed.Additional funding has been made available for the purchase of 382 motor vehicles, vans, motor bikes and so forth. It is estimated that approximately 100 of these vehicles will be allocated to the traffic corps to support the road safety initiative. This investment in new vehicles will maximise the safety of members of the Garda Síochána and members of the public in the variety of uses of Garda vehicles. Furthermore, it will minimise maintenance costs and improve the re-sale value of Garda vehicles.

This is reflected in the recruitment campaign currently advertised. There are no other changes to the eligibility criteria for entry to the Garda Síochána as far as the current competition is concerned. The educational requirements with regard to the Irish language remain in place.As I have stated previously, it is right that future intakes of recruits to the Garda Síochána should as far as possible reflect the composition of Irish society, and I am anxious to see if there are any possible changes to the existing criteria which might facilitate recruitment from different ethnic backgrounds in our community. With this in mind I have asked the commissioner, as part of his overall review of the entry requirements for the Garda Síochána, to examine whether any of the existing eligibility criteria militate, however indirectly, against the recruitment of members from ethnic communities in Ireland.One of the eligibility criteria which could benefit from review in this regard is the requirement for entrants to have an educational qualification in Irish but there may be others which could impact on entrants from ethnic communities. Perhaps there may also be issues not specifically related to entry or eligibility but which might equally raise issues for certain communities. I have, therefore, asked the commissioner to consult appropriately with representatives of the immigrant community in this regard in the context of his review of the eligibility criteria for entry to the force.With regard to the Irish language specifically, whatever new arrangements might be put in place in the future, Irish will continue to have an important place in the Garda Síochána. Everyone who wishes to must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. In this regard, the Garda Síochána has a very strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Indeed, proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force and that will continue to be the case.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Prior to 1 July 1999, people with an ongoing condition were able to avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which catered for people who were certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. People who qualified for inclusion in this scheme did not have to pay more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drug refund scheme, families and individuals paid the full cost of their prescription medicines and, at the end of each quarter, could claim reimbursement from their health board for expenditure over £90 in that calendar quarter. The threshold for these schemes did not change between June 1997 and July 1999.With effect from 1 July 1999 the drug payment scheme replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drug refund scheme with a monthly threshold of £42 or €53.33. Under this scheme, no individual or family paid more than £42 per month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines for use in that month.The DPS has provided a fairer and more user friendly system than the previous schemes, particularly through the provision of monthly medicine budgeting for families, and has produced significantly greater overall benefit for patients. It introduced full reimbursement, at point of supply, of the cost of approved drugs above the monthly threshold. In line with quality customer service principles, there was no longer any need to pay first and then reclaim this expenditure from the health board and, unlike the DCSS, everybody was eligible for the DPS.The total reimbursement to patients under the DRS and the DCSS in 1998 was £75 million in the last full year of operation. In contrast, the DPS benefited patients by £110.73 million or €140 million in 2000, the first full year of operation, and this cost has increased to €204 million in 2003, the latest figure available.The following table sets out the dates on which the thresholds increased and the new thresholds:Date of increaseNew threshold1 July 1999£42 (€53.33)1 August 2002€651 January 2003€701 January 2004€78The threshold for the DPS will be increased to €85 with effect from 1 January 2005.My Department appreciates the concerns raised about the increases in the DPS threshold and has carefully considered the issues involved. However, I hope the Deputy will agree that, given the need to prioritise health spending in order to maximise the benefit over a wide range of pressing expenditure options, the aggregate benefits to its clients of the scheme over its predecessor's and balancing this with the greatly increased expenditure on the scheme, an increase of €8 in the threshold is not excessive.

The decision to commission the study followed a recommendation by a cross-Border working group on pre-hospital emergency care, one of a number of groups established under the North South Ministerial Council to examine areas of co-operation in the health field.The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on the Department's website. The study concluded that the introduction of a dedicated inter-hospital transfer service would be appropriate in an all-island context. It indicated that this would involve significant capital investment and annual operating costs. The report identified this cost at €12 million capital and €4 million revenue for a single helicopter.Inter-hospital air ambulance services are currently provided to the health boards by the Air Corps and the Irish Coast Guard on a request and availability basis. The service is provided subject to the nature of the mission, available aircraft and other operational commitments. Most patient transfers are airport to airport with onward transfer by land ambulance.My Department and the Department of Defence are currently finalising a service level agreement to formalise arrangements for the future provision of an air ambulance service by the Air Corps. A significant helicopter fleet replacement programme is being put in place for the Air Corps. In this regard the Department is advised that the Minister for Defence has authorised his Department to open negotiations for the acquisition of six new helicopters for the Air Corps. Each of the new helicopters will have a specific air ambulance capability and will be made available under the terms of the service level agreement. The new fleet will also have a far greater flying capacity than is available currently.In addition, the Department has met with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which has confirmed that the Irish Coast Guard will continue to provide services on the same basis as heretofore.Finally, the Department is advised that plans are being developed within the voluntary sector for the introduction of a dedicated HEMS, primarily in an inter-hospital transfer role and with a view to the service becoming operational in 2005. The Department will closely monitor developments in this regard over the coming months.

Since 1890, any individual or company, including a medical practitioner, may open a pharmacy, provided that the shop and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions are personally supervised by a full-time pharmacist who is not acting elsewhere in a similar capacity.The dispensing and supply of medicines under the community drugs schemes is governed by the 1996 community pharmacy contractor agreement, the community pharmacy contract, between a health board and a pharmacy contractor. Under section 21(1), a pharmacy contract is void where a practitioner — a registered medical practitioner or a registered dental practitioner — who has a beneficial interest in the contracted pharmacy practises or commences practice in the location of the pharmacy.This sub-clause does not apply to those who held such contracts before 30 May 1996. The reason for this is to prevent any suggestion of impropriety whereby a practitioner would prescribe medicines which are subsequently purchased in the pharmacy in which he or she has a beneficial interest. For the same reason, the pharmacy review group recommends that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between dispensing and prescribing. I am currently examining the report of the pharmacy review group and I expect to take definitive decisions on it shortly.Decisions on the awarding and retention of contracts are a matter for the health boards. If the Deputy has information on breaches of clause 21(1) of the contractor agreement, he should notify the CEO of the relevant health board.

If the property is over 125 sq. m., stamp duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property, whichever is the greater. Certain exemptions and reduced rates of stamp duty apply to first time house purchasers who are owner-occupiers of second-hand houses. The 2005 budget increased the stamp duty exemption threshold for such purchasers from €190,500 to €317,500 and reduced the rates applying to house values up to €635,000.Section 92B of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides that the trustees of a trust to which section 189A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies, whose trust funds are established out of public subscriptions for the benefit of permanently incapacitated individuals, will be entitled to first time purchaser relief in respect of the first house or apartment bought or gifted, following the establishment of the trust, for occupation by the beneficiary. Where there is more than one beneficiary, relief may be claimed for each of the beneficiaries.I have been advised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that a scheme of disabled persons grants is operated by local authorities with capital provision from that Department. These grants are designed to meet the needs of persons who are either physically handicapped or are suffering from severe mental handicap or severe mental illness. Where a new dwelling is being bought or built a maximum grant of €12,700 is payable. In the case of adaptation of an existing dwelling, 90% of the approved cost of the works is available up to an effective maximum grant of €20,320. Full details of the scheme and the conditions applicable are available from the local authority in whose area the dwelling is situated.There are no plans to change the system of stamp duty in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.

They are obliged to file an annual return and pay income tax on their profits. They are controlled for tax compliance purposes in the same way as taxpayers in all other sectors.The Revenue Commissioners' statement of strategy, 2003-2005, contains a strong emphasis on maximising compliance with tax and customs legislation and outlines a number of related key objectives and supporting strategies. These apply to dog breeders in the same way as to all taxpayers.They include the harnessing of technology to provide an effective risk based selection system for Revenue Commissioners audits as well as a new organisational structure designed around the customer base to ensure that an integrated approach to tax compliance is implemented at a regional level. This restructuring has been fully implemented. Special compliance districts, set up under this restructuring, monitor any activity that has been brought to their attention. The strategies provide for an increase in the resources available to the audit programme and ensuring that these resources have the necessary level of skills to enable the audit programme to be implemented successfully.These initiatives are geared towards ensuring that the maximum number of taxpayers, including those dealing in dog breeding and selling, are paying the appropriate level of taxation on their activities.

However, this figure includes the cost of reducing the VAT on certain goods and services which were at a reduced rate of VAT on 1 January 1991 and which, under the provisions of the EU sixth VAT directive, cannot be reduced below 12%. If those goods and services which cannot be reduced are excluded, the cost of the rate reduction in question is estimated at €800 million. These figures show that a reduction in the 13.5% VAT rate along the lines proposed would have significant consequences for the Exchequer.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I thank the Deputy for identifying the report to which he referred in last week's parliamentary question. In this field, a large number of reports are published each year. In 2004 alone, there have been six major conferences on this subject, each with approximately 100 tabled and poster presentations. The Deputy last week stated that what has become known as "the Stewart report" was "the most recent report published on electromagnetic fields and radio frequency radiation". The Stewart report was published in May 2000 and is, accordingly, not the most recent report in this area.My advisers are familiar with this report. The Stewart report represented a review of the information available at that time. It led directly to focused programmes of research, some carried out in the UK and some carried out in other countries and co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation, to deal with some of the issues left unresolved or open in the report. While the Deputy has correctly quoted extracts from the report, substantial new information is to hand since it was published. The Stewart report was not a UK National Radiological Protection Board report but the report of an independent expert group on mobile phones. The National Radiological Protection Board, NRPB, published its response to the Stewart report, "Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields", Doc NRPB 12(2) in 2003.I will deal with the particular sections of the report which I know to be of concern to the Deputy. The report states:It is not possible at present to say that exposure to RF radiation, even at levels below national guidelines, is totally without potential adverse health effects. The reason is that research is not being done on the issue.Following the publication of the Stewart report, much research was done on the issue. The NRPB in its 2003 report, following a review of all the work carried out since the Stewart report, stated:In aggregate the research published since the IEGMP report [the Stewart report] does not give cause for concern. The weight of evidence now available does not suggest that there are adverse health effects from exposures to RF fields below guideline levels.The World Health Organisation international EMF project stated at its 2004 meeting that no causal relationship had been established between radio frequency emissions and any adverse health effects, notwithstanding very determined scientific efforts to establish such relationships. The Stewart report states, "the gaps in knowledge are sufficient to justify a precautionary approach".A precautionary approach has indeed been adopted by many countries, including Ireland. This has involved Ireland adopting recognised international guidelines for exposure to electromagnetic radiation. These guidelines limit the exposure to levels which are many times less than the experimental levels at which no adverse effects have been established.The Stewart report recommends "that an independent random, ongoing, audit of all base stations be carried out to ensure that exposure guidelines are not exceeded". ComReg audits Irish sites on a random basis to ensure compliance with licences. Not all sites are audited. However, ComReg has just concluded a programme of measurements of 400 sites around the country. While the final report is awaited, it is understood that no site was found to exceed the guidelines.The Stewart report recommends that planning should be extra cautious around schools as children are more susceptible to the effects of radiation and will be exposed to it over their lifetime. Children are indeed more susceptible and will be exposed over a much longer period than today's adults. For this reason, a specific programme of research focusing on children was launched under the WHO project and this work reported back in June 2004 that no adverse health effects in children arising from mobile phone base stations, or the use of mobile phone handsets which cause much greater exposure, had been found.The Stewart report recommended that "beams of greatest intensity should not fall on any part of school grounds, to ensure that the accessible location where the greatest exposure to the radio frequency radiation signal occurs was not within school grounds". This was consistent with the other recommendations in the report. The most recent work, as mentioned above, has removed any validity for this recommendation. The UK Court of Appeal decision of 12 November 2004 that mobile phone masts "do not pose a risk to public health that would justify a ban on positioning them near schools" was made following consideration of the evidence since the publication of the Stewart report.The Stewart report also said that, since there are no scientific grounds for setting guidelines below the levels set by the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection for the public, the expert group avoided setting exposure limits for school buildings and grounds below these limits. For the same reason it did not wish to recommend that there should be a particular minimum distance between the base station and the school.My officials maintain a watching brief on all the evidence presented each year on this issue and Ireland participates in the relevant international bodies which monitor this work and set limits on electromagnetic emissions to protect the public.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.Under the 2004 sports capital programme I allocated €61 million in respect of 738 projects. I advertised details of and invited applications to the 2005 sports capital programme on Sunday and Monday last, 4 and 5 December. The deadline for submission of completed applications to that programme is 4 February 2005.

Following their marriage on 2 October 2004 they were no longer qualified to receive this payment. One of the parties concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 7 October 2004. His application was disallowed on the grounds that he was not available for employment. It is open to him to appeal this decision to the social welfare appeals office. A form for this purpose has been issued to him by his local office.He is currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance at the rate €202 per week. The other party is currently on a CE scheme.

Entitlement to payment is conditional on satisfying contribution conditions based on the social insurance record of either the wife or her husband.An earnings limit was introduced for deserted wife's benefit as and from 31 August 1992. The limit, which applied only to new claims after that date, is currently €12,697.38 a year, gross earnings. Where earnings are in excess of this amount, there may be entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of deserted wife's benefit, provided earnings do not exceed €17,776.33 per year gross.The earnings limit was introduced to more effectively target support on those deserted wives who required an additional supplement to their income until they were able to support themselves and to address inconsistencies between the benefits available under this scheme and those available under the social assistance lone parent's allowance — now replaced by the one-parent family payment — and the deserted wife's allowance scheme, which are both means tested.The deserted wife's benefit scheme was closed to new applications with effect from 2 January 1997, on the introduction of the one-parent family payment scheme under which an eligible parent with dependent children is entitled to payment irrespective of gender or the circumstances that gave rise to lone parenthood. This scheme is effectively a residual scheme which will disappear over time.A review of the earnings of deserted wife's benefit cases commenced in mid-2004. Depending on the outcome of the review in each case, clients may experience reduction in their benefit.I am satisfied that the social welfare arrangements in place for deserted wives and lone parents generally are appropriate and there are no plans for changes on the lines proposed.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	651	It has been clearly stated since taxi liberalisation that, based on legal precedent, there can be no duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders as regards open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation.However, an independent three person panel, the "taxi hardship panel", was established in February 2002 to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime, including an estimate of the numbers of individual licence holders involved, the likely financial implications and the recommended criteria for assessment of extreme personal financial hardship under any subsequent proposed response by Government.The report recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. The payments recommended by the panel range from €3,000 to €15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved. The Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of these recommendations. The payments in question do not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship.Area Development Management Limited, ADM, was engaged to administer the taxi hardship payments scheme which is implementing the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report. Hardship payments totalling €13,983,000 have been made to 1,192 qualifying applicants under the taxi hardship payments scheme to date. I understand that a meeting of the ADM board is due to take place today following which it is expected that further hardship payments will be made to qualifying applicants.

This increase will result in an overall funding commitment of more than €12 million for the RTI to end 2005 which is all the more impressive when it is borne in mind that a total of €4.4 million was provided for it when the initiative was first proposed in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.I understand that some 42,000 transport services were provided by the 34 RTI projects in 2003 on some 380 rural transport routes. A total of 305,000 passenger trips was recorded on these services in that year.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 to 111, inclusive, together.The EU Council Directive 91/628 on the protection of animals during transport, as transposed by Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Order 1995, does not apply to the transport of pet animals for non-profit making purposes. However, this order does provide that the transport of dogs for commercial purposes is subject to a number of conditions. Requirements include ensuring that the animals are fit for transport and are accommodated in such a way as to avoid risk of injury or unnecessary suffering. Animals must be provided with adequate ventilation and space to stand in their natural position and to lie down. Food and water must be available to the animals so that they can be fed at intervals not exceeding 24 hours and watered at intervals not exceeding 12 hours.In March 2004 my Department introduced a system for the registration of transporters of dogs for commercial purposes and for the inspection of vehicles engaging in such transport to the Continent. The forthcoming regulation on the protection of animals during transport will further improve the conditions under which animals are transported throughout the European Union. The breeding and sale of puppies is not a matter for my Department.

The woman concerned has an ongoing asylum application in the State which is at the appeal stage in the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Applications for refugee status in the State are determined by independent bodies such as the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. A final decision on this application for refugee status will be made upon receipt of the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The husband of the woman concerned arrived in the State on 17 January 2002 and applied for asylum on the same day. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 5 March 2003 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order. He was given three options, to be exercised within 15 working days. These options were to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; to leave the State before an order was made or to consent to the making of a deportation order.Representations have been received setting out the reasons the person concerned should not be deported. The case file in this matter will be examined having regard to section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.The son of the woman concerned arrived in the State on 17 January 2002 and claimed asylum. His application was refused and he was notified of this decision by letter of 14 November 2002. His subsequent appeal was refused and he was notified of this decision by letter of 4 April 2003 in which he was informed of the three options open to him at that point. These options were to leave the State before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a deportation order; to consent to the making of a deportation order; or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons he should not be deported and should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which deals with prohibition of refoulement, including consideration of all representations received on his behalf. On 26 January 2004 a deportation order was made in respect of this person. He was notified of the order by letter dated 19 February 2004 and was requested to present himself to the gardaí in order for arrangements be made for his deportation from the State. He failed to report as requested and was classified as having evaded deportation on 1 March 2004. He subsequently instituted judicial review proceedings challenging his deportation.As these proceedings are still ongoing and one of the matters at issue concerns family unity, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is precluded from commenting further on this sub judice case or making any general comments on the issue of family unity which could be interpreted as relating to the points at issue in this case.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	663	A broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda Síochána to confront serious and organised crime. Our criminal legislative framework reflects international developments to respond to the global growth of organised crime, including drug trafficking, as well as specific measures enacted to meet our own domestic situation. This framework is kept under continuous review.The Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 have been successfully used to deprive those engaged in criminal activity of their assets. The powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau will be further bolstered with additional measures in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is currently before the Seanad. This Bill will make certain technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and will remove doubts about when a person may be said to be in possession or control of property for the purposes of that Act. Other relevant legislative initiatives are planned in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The first of these is provided for in Part 3 of the Bill. These provisions will allow the courts to admit, in certain specified circumstances, previous witness statements where a witness recants or refuses to testify at trial. Given that such refusal to co-operate may arise from intimidation, the provision is designed to ensure that witness statements might still be available to the courts even though the witness subsequently refuses to co-operate.Other initiatives, which I will propose by way of amendments to the Bill, will make it an offence to participate in or contribute to the activities of a criminal organisation, strengthen existing provisions for minimum mandatory sentences for drug trafficking and create a new offence of supplying drugs to prisoners. Implementation of EU money laundering directives has severely limited the scope of criminal gangs to launder proceeds of crime and a third such directive is currently being negotiated. Following its agreement, my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, will examine what national legislation is required to give it effect.The establishment of specialist units within the Garda Síochána, such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Garda national drug unit, have enabled the gardaí to tackle organised crime effectively. These specialist units all operate under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services and have direct responsibility for addressing organised crime. Strategies pursued by the gardaí include focusing on the structures and systems which support the illegal drug trade, maintaining an intelligence led approach in targeting and dismantling drug distribution networks and depriving criminal networks of their assets.The national drugs strategy sets out a framework for action for the period 2001-08. Under this strategy, all elements of drugs policy were brought together in a single framework for the first time. Drugs policy is being delivered across the four pillars of supply reduction, demand reduction, prevention and treatment and research.A steering group under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is currently conducting a mid-term review of the national drugs strategy. This review will focus on identifying priorities for future action and enable the group to refocus the strategy, if necessary, for the remaining period up to 2008. My Department and the relevant associated agencies are involved in this review. At this mid-way point in the strategy, the Garda Síochána has far exceeded its drug seizure targets and continues to achieve considerable successes.

The first report of the commission dealing with paramilitary activity was released in April.I am heartened by the positive elements of the latest report, particularly the reduction in paramilitary activity. However, the report underlines the absolute necessity to end all forms of paramilitarism on this island. Consequently, all criminal activity related to funding paramilitary activity must end as well. This is a central feature of the approach of both Governments in their efforts to ensure a lasting peace and a political settlement in Northern Ireland. The Government appreciates the efforts of the Independent Monitoring Commission in preparing this comprehensive report.

These main dealers are most likely to possess all the necessary diagnostic tools for proper vehicle maintenance. For vehicles involved in accidents, at least three separate tenders must be obtained and submitted to the technical inspector for evaluation and selection. The decision is then made whether to repair or replace the vehicle.

At that point they are automatically removed from the committee and are either re-appointed for a further term or are replaced by new members.The person referred to by the Deputy was initially appointed to the visiting committee at Arbour Hill Prison on 20 September 1999. He was subsequently re-appointed to the committee with effect from 20 September 2002. Appointments to the visiting committees are made by me on foot of representations, usually either by individuals nominating themselves or from local representatives nominating a constituent. I can confirm that representations by an elected representative were received regarding nominating this person for appointment.It is my policy to appoint all new members of prison visiting committees to a prison in their home county or a neighbouring county. This has resulted in significant savings for the Irish Prison Service.

The majority of actions taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau are taken against the assets of persons suspected of a range of offences including, among others, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, corruption, receiving stolen property, aggravated burglaries and murder. In some of these cases the conduct of the individuals against which the bureau has acted may be said to be linked to an organised crime gang.While figures are not directly available for the number of organised crime gangs involved, an estimate can be gained from the number of applications made under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and the number of Revenue Commissioners actions per year. The number of applications made under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 to the High Court over the five year period 1999 to 2003 was as follows: section 2 — 33 cases involving 58 defendants; section 3 — 36 cases involving 49 defendants; section 7 — 36 cases involving 47 defendants. The number of tax assessments issued over the same five year period was: 1999 — 183 assessments; 2000 — 120 assessments; 2001 — 144 assessments; 2002 — 142 assessments; 2003 — 182 assessments. It should be noted that there will be an overlap between section 2 and section 3 orders and there will be multiple cross overlaps for tax targets so these figures are higher than the number of targets.The use of specialist Garda units in the fight against organised crime, such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Garda national drug unit, all of which operate under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime, including drug trafficking, in an effective way.The legislative package available to the law enforcement agencies in this country for tackling organised crime is one of the toughest in Europe. The Garda Síochána has available to it a broad range of legislation to facilitate the fight against serious or organised crime. The Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 have been successfully used to deprive those engaged in criminal activity of their assets and continue to be some of the most significant legislative tools available in the fight against organised crime.The efforts of the Garda Síochána and other State agencies continue to be brought to bear against those who would seek to profit from drug dealing and organised crime. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the level of resources employed in this area will remain under review with a view to making changes, as necessary, in the ongoing fight against drugs.

The director general of the Prison Service recently commissioned a major three year research project on this topic which, it is expected, will present an accurate picture of recidivism which, in turn, will assist and shape the way we manage prison sentences in the future. The findings of this research are expected in early 2007.

I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, €96.7 million has been provided for 2005. Furthermore, I have given the go ahead for the new criminal court complex, to be located at Infirmary Road, Dublin, which will be the first PPP project undertaken in the courts building programme.Having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, it is a matter for the service to decide how the funding provided is specifically allocated. The funding provided allows the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies and I am confident that the level of funding provided is adequate not only to maintain existing levels of service but also to provide for improvements in services and in court accommodation.

A further 251 prisoners were on temporary release on that date.On the date in question, 95% of the total bed capacity was in use. Moreover, before allocating a prisoner to a particular facility, account has to be taken of factors such as the prisoner's age, gender, the nature of the offence, security and whether they are on remand or sentenced. In addition, consideration must also be given to facilitating visits to the prisoner.There is a clear need for new accommodation both to address the overcrowding difficulties that arise from time to time in individual prisons and to upgrade some of the existing prison capacity. In particular, I am determined to make progress in eliminating the need for slopping out. To this end, plans are in train for the possible building of two major prison developments, one on a green field site in the greater Dublin area and the other on Spike Island, County Cork. It is intended that these new facilities will offer significant improvements in the areas of work, training, educational and medical services for inmates as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	683	I propose to take Questions Nos. 139 and 140 together.Provisional statistics show a decrease, not an increase, of 7% for the third quarter of 2004 compared with the same quarter last year and an overall decrease of 6% for the first three quarters of this year when compared to the first three quarters of 2003. Furthermore, there was a decrease of 3% in headline crime and a decrease of 14% in non-headline crime for 2003 compared to 2002. These decreases are encouraging and are indicative of both mine and this Government's ongoing commitment to reduce crime levels in this country through strong and effective crime prevention methods.Strong provisions have been put in place to combat the causes of public disorder and anti-social behaviour countrywide. Reductions in violence and public order offences have followed the enactment, during 2003, of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, along with the publication of the Garda Síochána Bill, which give significant additional powers to the gardaí to deal with public order and street crime. I particularly welcome the news that the number of assaults causing harm recorded in the third quarter of 2004 have decreased a further 2% compared with the same period last year.In July, I published the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. This Bill provides for increased Garda powers in a number of areas, including preservation of a crime scene and powers of arrest and detention. The Bill also contains some additional provisions relating to admission as evidence of previous witness statements, prosecution appeals and fixed charges for certain public order offences. I am proposing to bring forward amendments to the Bill to provide for a number of further legislative measures.In particular, I am aware that there is a growing concern about incidences of anti-social behaviour in society. I am concerned that vulnerable people, particularly the elderly, can be subjected to serious nuisance and forms of harassment which of themselves may not be criminal offences but which may cause great distress to the people concerned. One of the amendments I am considering for inclusion in the Criminal Justice Bill will empower the gardaí to apply to the courts, by way of civil procedure, for an anti-social behaviour order which would enable the court deal with the matter as it sees fit.In September of this year, I relaunched the Crimestoppers initiative, an imaginative partnership between the gardaí, the business community and the community which has been in place for a number of years. It operates a confidential freephone Crimestoppers number which is available to the public to alert the gardaí about crime or suspicious activity and to offer information regarding ongoing Garda investigations. The confidential number is staffed by specially trained gardaí who are able to assess the value of the information being offered in the battle against crime. "CrimeCall" has also been launched, replacing "Crimeline". This programme is a proven effective method of identifying the perpetrators of crime based solely on the assistance of the public.Garda youth diversion projects, formerly Garda special projects, are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project.With regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, honouring the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources.Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. In each of the next three years there will be an intake of almost 1,100 new recruits per year. The advertisement campaign for this first tranche of 1,100 recruits was launched on Thursday, 25 November 2004.I cannot, however, stress enough that while legislative measures such as the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act can help to curtail the problem of anti-social behaviour, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. In reality, it falls on all parties with an interest in this area to play their role in helping to address the problem of anti-social behaviour.

In my reply of 17 November, I advised the House that on further examination of the case, I decided to grant this person temporary leave to remain for a period of 12 months with her case being reviewed at the end of that period.Applications by individuals for leave to remain in the State are dealt with on a case by case basis with the merits or otherwise of each application being examined singularly. The granting of leave to remain may arise from a number of factors without any one being predominant. For these reasons, it is not the practice to comment on individual cases.As stated in my reply of 3 and 17 November, the decision not to proceed with the effecting of the deportation order in this case arose from matters unrelated to this person's asylum application. I am satisfied that the decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal not to recommend the granting of refugee status in this case was correct and there is no threat to the safety of this person if she were returned to her country of origin. Further, no issue arises in this case which warrants any amendment to the existing relevant legislation.

Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupils involved and having regard to a range of factors, including the overall resources available to the school.The school concerned has been allocated 25.20 additional teaching support hours per week and 27 hours per week special needs assistant support to cater for the special educational needs of the students enrolled, including the student referred to by the Deputy. The level of support allocated to the school in question by my Department was determined after detailed consideration of the school's application, the supporting documentation provided and having regard to the overall level of resources already available to the school to address special needs issues. It is a matter for the school authority concerned to deploy this allocation having regard to the assessed needs of individual pupils involved and in line with their evolving needs.

The local youth club grant scheme was introduced in 1999. The scheme aims to make provision for the support of youth work activities at a local level. These grants are made available to youth clubs and groups through their local vocational education committee. This scheme encompasses a number of grants, including a start-up grant which is designed for new youth groups in need of assistance to begin their programmes.The special projects for youth scheme makes grant-in-aid available to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged due to a combination of factors, including substance abuse, homelessness and inadequate take up of ordinary educational opportunities. While my Department has overall responsibility for the allocation of funding, projects are administered on the ground largely by grant administering agencies, which include vocational education committees and national youth organisations such as the National Youth Federation, Foróige and Catholic Youth Care.

I will authorise the schools concerned to complete the design process to the point where tenders can be issued. When these schools and their design teams report back that they have completed the work I will, on a rolling basis during the year, authorise projects to move to tender and construction.

This system will involve a general teaching allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, SEN, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability, specific learning disability and also those with learning support needs. It will also allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence SEN.The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of a shared learning support teacher together with part-time resource teaching hours. The pupil in question falls into the high incidence category. It would be expected that the pupil's SEN can be met from within the current resource/learning support teaching allocation available to the school. The school authorities were advised accordingly on 3 December 2004.

It was not the intention that the group should consider animal welfare issues generally. Instead, the terms of reference were designed to allow the group focus on the specific issue of puppy farms so that it could report at an early date. I am satisfied with that arrangement.The group undertook public consultation and has held two meetings to date. Its report is currently being prepared and I expect to receive it early in the new year. At that stage, I will consider the group's recommendations and decide the action to be taken. I also intend that the report will be publicly available.As regards the wider issue of animal welfare, the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for that legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.

The regulations contain penalties for non-compliance with this requirement or for defacing or rendering illegible the above particulars. These arrangements followed consideration of all practicable options for ensuring identification of dogs, including that of micro-chipping. There is no proposal at present to alter them.

It is for the council to address this matter in the context of the local circumstances involved and the possible measures available to it under the Waste Management Acts.My Department sought subsequent corroboration from the Attorney General's office of the legal advice obtained by Limerick City Council and, at his request, forwarded this to the city manager for information purposes only. At no point did my Department issue, or purport to issue, an instruction to the city council on these matters, as the decision to provide a waiver and/or a collection service is properly one for the local authority.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	702	From the commencement of the single mandate for elective local government, local authorities were required to make specific arrangements to provide a reasonable level of service for Oireachtas Members and to facilitate them in carrying out their work on behalf of local communities. Statutory regulations have been made in this connection. Copies of these regulations — the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003 — and an information note are available in the Oireachtas Library.The regulations provide, inter alia, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas Members by the local authority and, in this context, a parliamentary representative may notify a local authority of his or her postal or electronic address. In addition, equivalent systems, procedures and time frames to those used for correspondence from local authority members apply also in respect of Oireachtas Members. Similarly, where there are arrangements for electronic access to information by councillors, these should likewise be made available to Oireachtas Members.Managers are required to meet at least annually with local Oireachtas Members and thus provide an opportunity for an update on developments and for any difficulties encountered to be raised and addressed. This is, of course, additional to normal and regular contacts between public representatives and local authority officials regarding particular problems or issues.As these arrangements have been introduced relatively recently, I intend that they will be kept under review with a view to any necessary amendment of current guidance on these matters. In the meantime, I expect authorities to facilitate parliamentary representatives, in the spirit and the letter of the regulations, in the timely provision of local authority documentation.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The retail planning guidelines prescribe a maximum floor area of 6,000 square metres gross retail floor space for large scale single retail warehouse development. This aspect of the guidelines has been under review, taking account of the need to ensure proper planning and sustainable development while also supporting effective competition in this sector of retailing in the context of ongoing developments in retail formats.With regard to any individual development proposal at a particular location, it would primarily be a matter for the planning authority, and An Bord Pleanála where appropriate, to consider all relevant planning issues, including the potential transport implications, in the context of determining any such application. It would be open to the planning authority to require that any such proposal be accompanied by a traffic impact assessment demonstrating that the road network associated with the development has the capacity to cater for the traffic generated by the development without causing undue congestion and that the development can be served by existing and planned public transport services.In bringing the review of the retail planning guidelines to a conclusion, all relevant issues, including the possible transport implications as they relate to this type of development generally, will be taken into account in the context of determining whether any changes to the guidelines are appropriate.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	705	The common frog is protected under wildlife legislation and may not be taken from the wild without a licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of my Department. Each year the NPWS receives a small number of applications for licences to allow the capture of live frogs and these are adjudicated individually.So far this year, three licences have been issued for the capture of the common frog alive from the wild. Two were for the purpose of relocating frogs away from a new road building project and the other is an annual licence which authorises the applicant to capture specimens of rana temporaria— European common frog — by hand from a number of specified counties for the purposes of research. My Department does not license vivisection. The use of live animals in experiments in Ireland is, I understand, strictly controlled by the Department of Health and Children, which issues licences under the Cruelty to Animals Act, as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	706	Under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976, my Department is responsible for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares for the purpose of coursing. There is no evidence to date that hare coursing in Ireland adversely impacts on the conservation of hare populations and there are no proposals to change existing arrangements for the licensed netting of wild hares for live hare coursing.In the case of the coursing meeting last season in which the mortality was exceptionally high, the possibility of stress, myopathy, as a constructive factor was considered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department. While it was not possible to establish why, in this particular case, the hares should have been particularly vulnerable, my Department regarded this level of mortality as a serious matter. Accordingly, the club in question will, this year, be holding a scaled down event, closely monitored by my Department to ensure that its management regime does not increase the risk of myopathy.

Such materials or devices are transported by road within the State to hospitals, research laboratories and to or from sites where industrial radiography is being performed.My Department would not be informed of such transportations as these are regulated by and require a licence from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII. The licence obliges the licensee to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations for the safe transport of radioactive material as well as a number of additional requirements. Furthermore, the Garda is also informed in the case of the transportation of large sources used in medical product sterilisation facilities.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	708	An important milestone in the ongoing implementation of the national spatial strategy, NSS, has been reached with the adoption by all regional authorities of regional planning guidelines. Such guidelines were introduced by the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide a long-term strategic framework for the development of the region concerned. Section 23(2) specifically provides that regional planning guidelines shall address a range of matters for the whole of the region, in accordance with the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.Regional planning guidelines, acting as a framework for development plans at county and city level, will advance the process of more deeply embedding the concept of sustainable development within the development plan process. In addition, and building on the national spatial strategy, the regional planning guidelines now in place across the country provide a more strategic and transparent framework to inform the assessment of development plans during their public consultation phases with regard to a range of criteria, including sustainable development.Section 10(1) of the 2000 Act provides that each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. All proposed development is regulated by the planning process and decisions made by the planning authority on planning applications must take development plan policies and objectives into account.
