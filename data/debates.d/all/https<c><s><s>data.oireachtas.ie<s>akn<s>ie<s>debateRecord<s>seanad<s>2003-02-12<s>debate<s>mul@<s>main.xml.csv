#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:To ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment if her attention has been drawn to the sudden closure on Friday, 7 February 2003 of Graham and Heslip, Ennis, County Clare; the arrangements being made to pay the employees their outstanding wages and entitlements; if the company has been paid Government grants and the plans, if any, being made to have the company reopened.I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.

There will be a sos between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Will the Leader explain the reason the Government has ordered Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill 2002 to be taken on the same day? I am sure she will agree precedent has been that Second Stage is taken on one day, with Committee and Report Stages taken on other days.Last week Senator Ryan asked the Leader if she could find out from the Government the nature and scope of the amendments, if any, planned for the Freedom of Information Act passed by both Houses some years ago. He raised the issue because changes were being mooted in the press.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Senator asked if the Act was being subverted.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I will leave the subversion issue for the Leader as she is well able to deal with it.I ask the Leader to obtain answers to two questions from her colleagues in Government. The Official Secrets Act 1963 has, to a greater extent than any other Act, embraced the culture of secrecy in our public administration. In 1997 a select committee of the other House, chaired by a former colleague of mine, Deputy Charles Flanagan, proposed the repeal of the Official Secrets Act. Does the Government have proposals to act on the committee's recommendation? The repeal of the Official Secrets Act would constitute the single most important step towards smashing secrecy in our public administration and embracing the principle of accountability that we are all trying to promote in public life?It is my understanding that the budget of the Office of the Ombudsman has been slashed by some 15% to 20% this year, a move which does little to encourage the notion that members of the public can have issues arising from their dealings with the public administration investigated through that office. This is a retrograde step which needs to be highlighted because the Act establishing the Office of the Ombudsman has done more to expose bureaucracy and the culture of secrecy in our public administration than any other Act passed by the Oireachtas.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Less than a week after the issue was debated in the Houses, it seems ridiculous to have to ask the Leader to have a member of the Government come before the House to explain precisely what is its policy on the possibility of war in Iraq. The current approach appears to be based on the good cop, bad cop routine, with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs choosing to speak in humanitarian terms here last week, whereas the Minister reportedly spoke in belligerent terms in the Dáil yesterday. An inspired leak also appeared in The Irish Times this morning essentially stating that Government policy would be to support whatever America does.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I was not aware this was the policy of the Government, particular the Progressive Democrats Party.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	10	When did the contents of The Irish Times become Government policy?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The leak was clearly inspired. One would expect the Fianna Fáil Party to take an issue which involves a risk to 12 million children as seriously as the rest of us and at least avoid heckling when it is raised. I ask for clarity from the Government on its position in the event that the United Nations does not pass a second resolution next Friday. I am aware of everybody else's position, including that of most European Governments, yet I do not know the position of our Government because it speaks out of both sides of its mouth, which should not come as a surprise.In recent months I have called on a number of occasions for a debate on housing in light of the fact that the Taoiseach appears to be coming round to the view, after many years, that something should be done about the hoarding and price of building land. It would be appropriate for us to have a debate on housing and the price of building land and I would welcome an investigation into the ownership of building land.Most Members will agree that another issue the House could usefully debate is Northern Ireland. I would welcome a debate because I would like to discuss a particular party which appears to be in a position to be pacific in this part of the country and act in a militarist way north of the Border. It is a most extraordinary partitionist position for a political party which claims to be republican in that it supports paramilitarism in the North yet claims to be the leader of a pacifist movement in the South. I would like an opportunity to discuss those contradictions and many others and I suggest to the Leader that a debate on Northern Ireland would be useful.I want to use my position here to raise an issue which is of local but also national concern, namely, the fact that Cork city will be the European City of Culture in two years. A major issue is developing in Cork about the future of the School of Music. If there is not a Government decision to proceed with the building of the School of Music in Cork, there will be an end to formal music education there. The current position is impossible and untenable and if a decision is not forthcoming, I ask the Leader to use her considerable good offices to try to persuade the Government to do something about it.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That matter could be raised on the Adjournment.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Order of Business is satisfactory. I want to raise the question of Iraq. We had a good debate on Iraq last week and we established the views of this House. It is now in the hands of the Government to make a decision so it is not necessary to continually debate it here. We have given our views and the Government now must make the decision.Now is the time for a debate on Northern Ireland because the Government needs to hear an expression of views in that regard.We had an interesting debate on crime recently but since then we have learned that there are now 15 murder cases outstanding in the Limerick area. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is hoping to transfer the Special Criminal Court to Limerick but he must ensure that he continues to deal with that issue with vigour. I understand it takes two to three years to bring a murder case to trial. In the United States they do not talk about crime as much as public safety. We talk about public safety for our citizens, but if murder cases are not reaching trial for three years the Minister must take action. It is not a question of public safety if criminal cases take that length of time to come to court. I understand that is the position. I would like the Minister to confirm it and to ensure that he exercises the same vigour in this area as he has done in others.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I take Senator's Quinn's point that we have debated Iraq. Many Members contributed to the debate and the views of the House were clear on it, but it would be wrong to let the statement pass which suggested that anybody in this country, whether in the Government or otherwise, would condone the killing of 12 million children, which is the way it was represented. As far as I am aware the Government's position is clear on the matter. We are hopeful that a peaceful settlement can be reached in this dispute. In the event of military action we would want it to have the authority of the United Nations by way of another resolution and it would be wrong of us to anticipate the outcome of those events.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Government is already doing that.

I warn the House that this issue will be a flash point in rural areas in the near future because many farmers are looking to wind energy as an alternative source of income. In addition, many communities also obtain a dividend from the people who invest in wind energy projects. I would like the Government to carefully examine the impact this directive will have in rural areas and I forewarn the House that it will become a hot topic.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I endorse what the Deputy Leader and Senator Quinn said about the question of Iraq. One can only assume that Senator Ryan suffers from the type of advanced amnesia that affects academics in the context of debates of this nature. When he comes out into the sunlight, I would suggest that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minster of State, Deputy Kitt, have given the utmost clarity to the Irish position.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Senator Mooney is the only one who believes that.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs who – for the first time as a Foreign Minister – delineated the difference between military and political neutrality. This country will make its decision in light of inspector Hans Blix's report next Friday. To use football parlance, I ask the Leader to keep her eye on the ball in terms of what is happening in the region in general.There is a growing crisis in North Korea and a number of humanitarian issues have come to light there. The potential loss of 12 million lives in Iraq, which I hope will not happen, is already a reality in North Korea. It is a country which, in economic terms, is a basket case. The world humanitarian agencies are attempting to stem the flow of disaster and hunger in that area and there is an opportunity for the House to debate the potential crisis building in North Korea, which has threatened a nuclear strike on the American forces in the area. Perhaps this House might devote itself to debating the global issues involving Iraq and North Korea at some time of the Leader's choosing.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I realise we had a useful debate on the situation in Iraq last week, but there are media reports this morning of a significant shift in Government policy in that we would abandon our United Nations commitments and unilaterally declare support for the United States action against Iraq. That is a significant move in terms of our foreign policy and one which cannot go without debate in this House.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I make the request in light of the significant shift in Government policy.Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to explain to Members and, in particular, to the women of Ireland the reason he has failed to extend the BreastCheck national breast screening programme? He promised last year that it would be extended nationally by the end of 2002. I draw the Leader's attention to the fact that in north Tipperary alone, there will be 45 unpredicted early cancers as a result of the failure of the Government to extend this vitally important programme.I remind the Leader again, although I realise it is not her fault, that the Minister for Transport still has not published the strategic rail review.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House to debate the radical reorganisation he has already set in train in his Department, particularly in the light of the Cromien report published a number of years ago in which some key recommendations were put forward? A number of community-based structures were set up by the Government in recent years, but the Department of Education and Science is one of the Departments deemed to be not responsible enough to reach down to the communities because of structural difficulties. In light of that and a number of other concerns expressed, it would be helpful if the Minister came before the House to advise us on the interesting proposal he has now set in train and the decision he has made.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	29	There is total confusion with regard to the provisional driving licence system involving over 300,000 people, including the leader of our country. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to come before the House to debate the proposed measures under consideration and his plans to reform the licensing system. It is important to debate this issue soon as many jobs are at stake. Many elderly widows took up driving after their husbands died to get to the local post office or church and are now very confused. Some of my constituents have applied for tests but have been told they cannot be tested until the end of the year.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Those are points that can be made during the debate.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	31	This is a serious issue.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Leader is a former Minister for Education.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Distinguished.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Yes, distinguished. Will she intervene with the current Minister for Education and Science regarding the ASTI ballot next month on the supervision and substitution proposals? Today we have seen that in the Minister's county the cost of supervision and substitution is twice what it would be if the teachers were doing it. According to the statement of the principals and managers of schools, this episode is having particularly difficult consequences for discipline, which is breaking down in some schools. If this did not cause additional funds, I could accept the Minister's stance but it is costing twice as much, which is unbelievable. Those involved should be called together – management, principals and the ASTI – to pre-empt any future deadlock.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I ask the Leader to contact the Minister with responsibility for insurance matters as we will have a serious situation this St. Patrick's Day. It would be inappropriate if ours was the only country in the world with no festivals on 17 March, a day celebrated in America and other parts of the world reached by the Irish diaspora. It would be ironic if ours was the only country which could not hold a festival that day but there are serious issues regarding insurance problems in this area. I ask the Leader to intervene.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Will the Leader contact the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to confirm that the dispute between the Irish Dental Association and her Department is near a resolution as reported in the media earlier this week? I would appreciate the Minister coming to the House to clarify the issue.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Senator Hayes asked about Second Stage of the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill. It is due to conclude at 1 p.m. As Committee Stage is due to be taken at 4 p.m., there will be a three hour gap. Normally it would be better to have a longer gap but it is better to take Report Stage later. Those who have tabled Committee Stage amendments can proceed with them. Having Report Stage the next day will allow those who will feel their amendments did not get due consideration to table them again. There is more need for a gap between Committee and Report Stages, particularly as the Committee Stage amendments for the Bill have already been tabled.Senator Hayes also asked about the Official Secrets Act 1963. An all-party committee issued a report in 1997 calling for the Act to be repealed. I will inquire as to whether there is a plan to repeal it. The Senator also said the Ombudsman's budget had been slashed by 15%. Knowing the Ombudsman as we do, that will not halt him. He is very punctilious about his duties and has done great service to the country.Senator Ryan said we had a debate last week with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, who was a humanitarian, while the Dáil had the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was truculent. That is the nature of the person in each case.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	38	That is very revealing.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I am not sure in what category we would put Senator Ryan. The nature of the person infuses the debate. The Government has been quite clear. It is awaiting what the chief weapons inspector says on Friday to the United Nations, with which we are linked, whatever it says or does.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Therefore, we will have a policy after Friday.

Sometimes that is done for good reasons, at other times for mischievous reasons; one does not really know.Senator Ryan wanted a debate on housing. Senator O'Toole and his comrades – comrades being the right word – managed to include the need for housing in the new programme, which is good. However, without making a political point, Mark Fitzgerald of Sherry Fitzgerald announced this morning that all of us who are middle-aged should leave our houses to live far away and give our houses to others. That is a ridiculous, sexist proposal. I am not giving out about Mark Fitzgerald—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	42	On a point of order, it is a precedent of the House that people who are not Members are not referred to. That is a precedent the Leader should observe.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I take that point. The firm of Sherry Fitzgerald proposed we all get out of our houses and give them to others. I have no notion of doing so and I am sure many others feel the same way. It is daft.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Senator Ryan also wanted a debate on Northern Ireland, as did Senator Quinn. I will try to arrange it. The Taoiseach is travelling to the North today to meet the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. I apologise for not covering these matters already but there was a diversion. Regarding Cork as European City of Culture and the School of Music, the Department of Finance is considering the issue. I hope it will make an announcement shortly.I thank Senator Quinn for his remarks on the debate last week, which went an hour and a half beyond the allotted time. The debate lasted only 40 minutes in the Dáil but there were terrific contributions from all sides here. The Senator also raised the delay in bringing cases to trial. Sometimes it takes three years for a case to come to trial, which is a long time for justice to be seen to be done.Senator Finucane raised the matter of the 34 special protection areas for saving energy and warned of the effects on the countryside if wind energy is pursued in each of the areas in question. I find that wind energy always provokes huge debate and antagonism, yet one sees wind energy projects in other countries.

Senator Mooney said correctly that there was clarity in the Government's views on Iraq and called for further debate on North Korea.Senator O'Meara asked for the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House to discuss the BreastCheck programme.

Senator O'Meara also asked about the strategic transport review by the Department of Transport. The Minister for Transport has not yet brought it to Cabinet which would want to see it before we get our hands on it.Senator Fitzgerald asked for the Minister for Education and Science to discuss with the House how he proposes to implement the recommendations contained in the Cromein report. While the process has already started, it would be a useful debate.Senator Bannon asked for clarification of the situation regarding provisional licences. I agree with him that this is not just an issue for elderly widows, worries were occasioned by the statement that appeared to mean that a person could not drive without an accompanying fully licensed driver but there has been some diminution of that stance since. The Minister for Transport should come before the House, however, because this is a real issue in rural areas.Senator Ulick Burke asked about the ASTI, of which I was a member for many years. It is rare that teachers turn down money. This is an internal conflict at the level of the union executive. Principals and vice-principals are exercised by what will now happen but there can be no change. The TUI is running the system satisfactorily. In some schools where both unions have members it is being run satisfactorily. On this occasion the Minister for Education and Science is right, they must make up their minds. I now understand the ASTI will not accept benchmarking either, turning down a rise of 13%. It also sounds as if it will turn down the supervision arrangements. There cannot be intervention on the issue because the TUI is already running the system. The Minister could not intervene and I would not encourage him to do so.Senator McHugh asked about insurance for festivals. There is a Bill in the Dáil that deals with licensing for outdoor events. It will be a useful vehicle for raising the insurance issue when it comes before the Seanad next week. People living in villages, towns and cities find insurance costs for festivals prohibitive.Senator McCarthy asked about the dispute with dentists. When I spoke to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs yesterday, she told me she was hopeful that there would soon be a satisfactory resolution.Senator Coghlan asked about the Minister for Transport's proposals for a regulator. When I asked the Minister about the matter, he said there would be an interim regulator within two weeks. The position will not require legislation because of its interim nature. Legislation will then be prepared for a full-time regulator.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House regarding the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Bill 2002. I trust that the House will agree that its enactment will result in a significant step forward in the strive for consumer protection, as well as building on the laudable scheme for disbursement of moneys to worthwhile projects established under the Dormant Accounts Act 2001.The House will no doubt recall the considerable publicity that surrounded the introduction of the dormant accounts scheme last year. I am also sure that it is aware that interest in the matter is not new. The issue of dormant assets has long been of great interest to the public, both Houses of the Oireachtas and the media – primarily in the potential there could be for the State to put the funds to good use. Failure on the part of the financial institutions to trace the owners of these moneys has long been a matter of public conjecture and concern.With the Dormant Accounts Act, the Minister for Finance and the Government established the basic framework for addressing these concerns. The Act deals with dormant assets held by banks, building societies and An Post. Its success in meeting its primary goal, reuniting people with long lost or forgotten assets, has been significant, with almost half the moneys which lay dormant last March having been reclaimed in less than 12 months. It is not often that legislation emanating from the Department of Finance results in such an obvious windfall to members of the public. The successful achievement of this objective of the scheme is commendable.This Bill shadows the Dormant Accounts Act in providing that life companies must take all reasonable steps to identify and contact the owners of unclaimed life policies. It is open to question what is reasonable in this regard but we can rest assured it is in the interests of insurance undertakings to pull out all the stops to reach their customers in circumstances where they will lose the underlying funds, yet still have to administer the policies if they fail to trace the owners. Therefore, the Bill is essentially a consumer protection measure, designed to protect property rights of individuals.The legislation must also deal with the situation where the owners of funds cannot be traced or these owners do not come forward to claim their moneys. In these circumstances, the insurance undertakings will be required to transfer the net encashment value of the policies, as defined in the Bill, to the dormant accounts fund due to be established in the coming weeks by the NTMA. I stress the point that no individual will lose his or her right of access to those funds. The rightful owner, including the policyholder or, for example, his or her heirs, will have a guaranteed right to reclaim the funds at any time. The Bill provides that the amount repaid will be exactly what the policyholder is entitled to claim under the terms of the policy.It must be expected, nevertheless, that some policyholders, for whatever reason, will never come forward to claim the moneys due. For example, the policyholder may have died without informing his or her heirs of the existence of the policy. The person may have emigrated and discontinued correspondence with the life company or decided that the amount due under the policy was not worth pursuing. Therefore, the Dormant Accounts Act introduced a scheme for disbursement, for charitable purposes or purposes of societal and community benefit, of funds not likely to be reclaimed. Moneys transferred to the fund under this new Bill will be subject to the same disbursements scheme. However, this is still on the basis that sufficient funds will be held back to meet any potential claims from owners.There are many types of life assurance policy on the market as products are often tailor-made to suit an individual's needs. This has a significant bearing on two important aspects of the Bill: the amount that an insurance undertaking will be required to transfer to the dormant accounts fund in respect of an unclaimed policy and the criteria for "dormancy".There are a number of issues to consider in relation to what is owed to an individual under any particular life assurance policy. Unlike a bank account, the money is not there "up front", in a way that the customer and the insurance undertaking know exactly what is owed on any given day. First, the majority of policies provide risk cover as well as having an investment element designed to secure a lump sum for the policyholder at some future date. In practice, the weighting of these two elements varies widely, depending on the needs of the policyholder and, therefore, the type of policy in question. Second, the investment element may be underpinned by a company's asset managed funds, as in the case of unit linked policies. If it is a with profits type policy, it will have other conditions attaching to it. Third, a life assurance policy is a contract that sets out the conditions under which a claim can be made and by whom – it may be when the policy has matured or, for example, by a beneficiary on the death of the policyholder. The amount to be paid out by an insurance undertaking is affected by all three factors.Given the complexities of the issues surrounding the measurement of the encashment value of a life policy, it has been impossible for the Department of Finance to build up an estimate of the amount of dormant funds held by life companies. Nevertheless, it is believed to be significant but this is not the reason for moving forward with the legislation. Of primary importance is the need to make people aware these policies exist and remain unclaimed. This will be done via personal notifications to policyholders and also by way of public notices to be placed annually in national daily newspapers and prominently displayed in the public offices of the companies concerned. This year alone, four separate notices will be placed in the newspapers in relation to the dormant accounts scheme.As regards the amount to be transferred from any given policy, insurance undertakings will calculate the net encashment value on the date of transfer to the fund. This will be calculated net of any insurance considerations in order that the fund will only receive the assets representative of the investment portion of the unclaimed policy. The amount required to provide insurance will remain the responsibility of the life company.In relation to the relevant period of "dormancy", the Minister has taken account of the disparate nature of life policies and provided that this will depend on whether we are dealing with a specified term or non-specified term policy. For specified term policies, dormancy will occur where there has been no customer initiated communication with the insurance company for a period of at least five years from the later of the date the policy matured or the date the policyholder last made contact with the undertaking. For policies with no specified term, dormancy will occur where there has been no customer initiated communication with the undertaking for at least 15 years. Senators will recall that 15 years is the dormancy period applicable to banks, building societies and An Post under the Dormant Accounts Act 2001.The scheme proposed will improve regulation in relation to unclaimed life policies and mirror and harmonise with the scheme already in place for credit institutions. It will require institutions to do their best to contact policyholders and reunite them with their moneys. It will also generate further funds for disbursement to charities and the community at large. Broadly speaking, the programmes or projects to benefit will be those designed to alleviate poverty or social deprivation or assist those who are physically or educationally disadvantaged. I am sure the House will agree this is a commendable use for the moneys which have, until now, benefited only the financial services sector.I will now outline a few of the key principles enshrined in the Bill but, in particular, should point out that, though the Minister for Finance is bringing forward these proposals, it is the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs who will have primary ministerial responsibility for the scheme, especially the disbursement aspects. The proposed scheme will apply to all insurance undertakings in the State and all policies of life assurance taken out by Irish residents, other than policies which form part of the assets of occupational pensions schemes, group health insurance or disability benefit schemes and sponsored superannuation schemes. The application of the provisions of the Bill is set out in section 6.The fundamental basis for the scheme lies in how "dormancy" is assessed. As I indicated, under the proposed scheme a non-specified term policy will be deemed unclaimed where the insurance undertaking has received no customer initiated communication with respect to the policy for at least 15 years prior to commencement of the scheme. A specified term policy will be deemed unclaimed where the policyholder has made no contact with his or her insurance company in relation to the policy for at least five years from the later of the date the policy matured or the date the policyholder last contacted the company. These definitions, set out in section 6, will be applied uniformly by all insurance undertakings.Insurance undertakings will be obliged to personally notify customers whose policies are valued at €500 or more that they have an unclaimed policy with that undertaking and what steps the customer must take to reactivate the policy or make a claim under it. Insurance undertakings must, for the sake of all other customers affected by the scheme, place annual notices in two or more national newspapers. These annual advertisements, the first of which is scheduled to take place in March, will generate public awareness of the scheme. The Minister for Finance believes, given the success of the same procedures under the 2001 Act, that this will encourage policyholders or their heirs or executors to make contact with the insurance companies to see whether they stand to gain under the terms of a policy held at the institution concerned. Notification procedures are provided for in sections 8 and 9.The framework provides that the net encashment value of unclaimed life assurance policies, where the policies remain unclaimed by March each year, must be transferred by insurance undertakings to the dormant accounts fund soon to be established. The first transfers will take place by April 2004. These matters are provided for in sections 10 and 11. The National Treasury Management Agency will be required to invest these moneys prudently, based on guidelines which the Minister for Finance will help to draw up and having regard to the need to meet the costs of making repayments to valid claimants seeking a return of their moneys. The moneys in the fund will generate an investment income, some of which will be used to offset the costs of accruals payments to claimants and the rest of which will be reapplied to the fund. In that way, as set out in sections 14 to 16, policyholders are guaranteed the return of everything owed to them.The Bill also provides that the regulatory authority – currently the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment but at some point the proposed Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority – is entitled to appoint inspectors for the purpose of ensuring compliance by undertakings with the provisions of the legislation. The inspectors will be authorised to check that an insurance undertaking has the necessary systems and procedures in place that will ensure undertakings are attempting to make contact with policyholders and that all relevant moneys are being transferred to the dormant accounts fund. Inspectors will be entitled to inspect the undertaking's records for these purposes and will have access to any relevant records held by the National Treasury Management Agency in respect of transfers to the fund. The provisions with regard to inspection are contained in sections 18 to 25, inclusive.In summary, the Bill provides for, first, identification of the types of policies and undertakings to be covered by the scheme and those policies which will not be captured; second, the period of "dormancy" applying and, third, the obligations of insurance undertakings in relation to notification of policyholders that their policies may be deemed "unclaimed". Other key points are the procedure, including the timeframe, within which moneys which remain unclaimed are to be transferred to the dormant accounts fund.The Bill also places an obligation on each undertaking to maintain a register of unclaimed policies which will contain the name and particulars of each policyholder whose policy has been deemed unclaimed. It will also contain details of the class of policy, the amount transferred to the dormant accounts fund and the date of transfer to that fund.There will be an obligation on each undertaking to complete a certificate of compliance with the provisions of the legislation in order that any failure on the part of undertakings can be quickly identified. In addition, the role of the inspector, whose remit will be to check compliance with the legislation on the part of the insurance undertakings, has been detailed.Other features of the legislation are required from an operational standpoint, such as the maintenance of confidentiality regarding ownership of the moneys in unclaimed policies and amendments to the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 to ensure the entitlement of the NTMA to manage and invest moneys realised from unclaimed life assurance policies, and to entitle the board to disburse surplus of such moneys. There are also the standard provisions for commencement, interpretation, etc., that are found in a Bill of this nature.This Bill, which is the result of lengthy and intensive negotiations, represents a significant extension of the scheme established under the 2001 Act. The provisions of the Bill were finalised during the period when the dormant scheme began operating in the credit institutions, which provided great insight into how it might work in practice for the life assurance companies. The Minister has been reassured by the success of the scheme for dormant accounts. Its achievement to date in reuniting people with their money represents an important consumer protection measure. It is hoped that the benefit to policyholders will be as great as it has been to holders of dormant accounts. This Bill is innovative legislation which I commend to the House.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He is an able substitute for the Minister for Finance who cannot be with us this morning.I and Fine Gael support the aims of the Bill, but there is a number of key areas where we have questions to ask. The Minister of State has referred to these aspects in his speech. One of the key issues is contacting people who hold policies. I am reminded that when I was in secondary school a salesman called to my house selling insurance to one of my parents and he almost had me, at 18 years of age, signed up to take out an insurance policy. When insurance companies and insurance brokers go to such lengths to garner customers, the Minister should ensure that they go to tremendous lengths to contact these customers before funds from these accounts end up in the dormant accounts fund.I accept what the Minister of State has said about the Dormant Accounts Act 2001, that it has proved largely successful and has seen many customers reunited with funds which lay dormant for a long period. I am a little worried about the lengths to which the insurance industry would go to contact holders of policies. It is proposed that advertisements should be placed in two national newspapers. That is not enough, nor is it enough that the insurance companies contact policyholders by post. When canvassing one comes to houses not occupied during the day and notices the amount of post lying around. One wonders if it will be thrown into the bin.I strongly encourage the Minister to implore the insurance industry to make contact with people who hold these policies because it is not sufficient to rely on An Post. We have learnt that An Post may not make daily deliveries of post to houses in future. By the time this Bill becomes law, perhaps there will not be any postal deliveries to households in certain rural areas. If that were the case, then an extra onus would lie on the insurance industry to make sure that they contact people who hold policies.Another area of grave concern is the distribution of the funds which will be derived from this legislation. In the past we have seen how funds derived in similar fashion, through the national lottery or other schemes, are used as slush funds when it comes to the immediate run-up to general or local elections. It is important for the integrity of this scheme that any doubt or any possibility that the funds garnered in this way might be used for political objectives and political gain should be removed completely.I am also interested in what the Minister of State has said about the investment of the funds. How will these funds be invested once they are garnered? In recent times we have seen the alarming decline in the national pensions reserve fund. Where investments were made in overseas stock exchanges and shares, we have seen an alarming drop in the value of the funds. We all understand and accept that the market rises and falls, but it is important that any funds raised in this way should be invested prudently for the future.The Minister of State placed special emphasis on the appointment of inspectors who will oversee how the insurance companies enforce this new development. Is it envisaged that the Department would take on permanently people who would act in the role of inspectors or that these people would be consultants hired in at certain times during the year? It is important that safeguards are put in place to ascertain whether the insurance industry is complying with the letter of the law.Fine Gael supports this legislation but in the key areas which I have outlined the Minister needs to ensure that safeguards are put in place for this fund into the future. Being involved in local government, we see how very cynical people are about the use of such funds. It is crucial that these funds do not develop into some sort of slush fund. If they did, it would be a sad development. The Minister of State outlined a broad spectrum of bodies and organisations which might possibly benefit from the use of the funds. I welcome the inclusion of some of these bodies, but we have seen over the years how funds such as these have been used to influence votes in certain areas during election campaigns and it would be a retrograde step if this fund were to be used in such a manner.I support the thrust of the legislation and presume a calculation has been made of how much money and how many people are involved. While it is difficult to estimate how many will come forward to claim unclaimed life assurance policies, I presume a tentative figure has been generated. I look forward to Committee Stage when we can discuss the amendments I have tabled.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I support and welcome the Bill which is based on the good experience we have had with the dormant bank accounts legislation. That scheme has raised €400 million, a substantial sum. Obviously, it is impossible to estimate what will be raised under this legislation but presumably it will be a useful amount.My experience of the dormant accounts legislation has been good. I had two accounts, one a personal account and the other a farm account. There were tiny amounts of money in both, around £20. Nonetheless, the bank wrote to me in regard to both and, as the Minister of State put it, I was reunited with my money. In some cases a person might have forgotten the numbers and details of the account and is not sure how to pursue the matter. In any case, the legislation had that useful impact. There is a positive consumer aspect to it.That is even more the case potentially with insurance. Bank accounts are relatively straightforward concepts. Everybody understands what a bank account is but insurance policies are complicated and many of us do not necessarily understand their implications, intricacies and mode of operation. There is a considerable act of faith involved in an insurance policy. Therefore, legislation such as this, which encourages insurance companies to get in touch with customers, is beneficial. There is no element of confiscation in the legislation, any more than there was with the dormant bank accounts legislation. If insurance companies fail to track people down, it does not alter or diminish the rights of the people concerned should they come forward later to claim what belongs to them. There is no downside to it from the point of view of the policyholder.I am inclined to agree with the point made by Senator Phelan. Insurance is different from banking. Perhaps a more proactive approach is needed, therefore, rather than just correspondence. Perhaps telephone calls should be encouraged as a fall-back if the correspondence fails to elicit an answer. Many find financial correspondence off-putting and even if they do not put it in the bin, they might put it aside for long periods and sometimes never actually get around to it.I would not worry about postal deliveries only being made three times per week. That is a flyer, the type of thing in which agencies and the media sometimes engage. There is not the ghost of a possibility that anything less than postal deliveries five days a week would be either contemplated or tolerated.Concern was expressed about slush funds. I can only go by the experience in the constituency which I contested in the last general election. There were certain announcements of sports grants and so forth but in all cases, as was probably the case in most other constituencies, the schemes that received support were of long standing which had all-party or cross-party support. People were glad to get the money. There was little controversy about slush funds in my constituency.The dormant accounts fund disbursements will not be the responsibility of the Department of Finance. There are broad definitions in the legislation which do not provide great detail. I wish to suggest two areas where it would be socially worthwhile to provide moneys from the fund. The suggestions arise from problems brought to my attention in recent weeks. There are a limited number of medical cases involving rare conditions, the treatment of which is expensive and may have to be undertaken abroad. However, the cost is beyond the capacity of the individual and would also distort health board budgets. If somebody needs, for example, €250,000 for a certain treatment and they are one of half a dozen people in the country with the condition, it presents acute dilemmas for health boards. How does one weigh up one person's case against alternative uses under which many can be treated? There is a need for some type of fund or source of money for the small number of rare cases which require expensive treatment.The second area is a little broader. It would be accepted by all sides of the House that while money has been spent on treatment of disability, both mental and physical, services and the resources behind them are still far from what they should be. I have personal experience in this area. I have a nephew who is severely handicapped. He is just over 18 years of age and lives in Cumbria in sheltered accommodation. Broadly speaking, services have been available for him.I met a family last week, one of whose children is severely autistic. The father is a small businessman who managed to raise funds for treatment for a few years at a specialised facility in Boston. However, the child is now back home with weekend respite care available just once a month. The answer is more frequent respite care because these situations put enormous strain on working families and relationships within them but funding is only available for respite care once a month. Therefore, any source of funding to improve the situation would be welcome. There has been some debate about the freezing of additional amounts for disability services. Although much good work is being done in many facilities, we cannot be satisfied yet – more needs to be done. One of the uses to which this fund should be put is to try to help improve these situations.The Bill is based on the same lateral thinking applied to dormant bank accounts. It also applies to the management of the funds through the NTMA and similar type models with which we are familiar in this context.I am concerned by how much of the national development fund is being spent on compensating landowners. This is the case more so in urban than rural areas. I was interviewed on a radio programme yesterday morning when the spokesman for CIE, Mr. Barry Kenny, admitted that over half the cost of public transport projects in Dublin was accounted for by land compensation. That is a dreadful situation. I made the point in an article at the weekend that the rights of property in the Constitution were subject to the common good. In the vast majority of cases, those who have to give up land to facilitate public transport projects would not be selling it otherwise and are not in immediate need of the money. Enormous sums are being paid out. There has not been sufficient public debate on the matter.

One of the newspapers recently reported that the metro to the airport was to cost €4 billion. I cannot stand over that figure – it may be wrong – but it is appalling that over half that sum will be spent on land compensation. There may be a case for having some form of bond scheme. Although it was not satisfactory in all respects, the old land bond system was never found unconstitutional and operated for decades. If someone's house has to be knocked down, he or she will need to buy a new one and need the cash to do so but, in most cases, the money will not be needed immediately. We also need to debate whether it should be paid, the level of payment and the criteria but perhaps the money should be in bond in order that it could be used for productive purposes, whether for infrastructural or other purposes. The issue needs to be aired because of the huge amount of money involved, much of which could be described as a windfall. The Ministers for Finance and Transport and their respective Departments should examine it closely.I welcome the Bill as a positive measure that is part of a series of similar measures.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey. I also welcome the Bill. In my first few words in this House some ten years ago I spoke of the need for brevity. Therefore, I will attempt to set an example by not repeating the words of Senators Phelan and Mansergh in praise of the Bill.The Government is not a disinterested party, in the sense that it is impartial, in seeking those who may have a right to dormant accounts. I am concerned that it is not enough to merely inform the public. Rather, we must go out, seek and persuade them to examine their affairs. There is a difference between looking for someone to make contact in order to make a claim by informing them and persuading them to do so. If the Government just informs, many of those who might have known will not come across the accounts and not make a claim, leaving the State with the money for good causes. We need to go out and sell this to possible claimants to make sure they are aware of the scheme and that the money may be taken from them.I am concerned about the wording of the Bill in sections 8, 9 and 12 which makes it sound like there is no such thing as electronic communication and that we are still operating with paper communications. If the Bill was written in the 1890s, similar words would have been used to those now being used – there is no sign of modern communications. My 24 year old son does not write letters or read the newspaper, other than the sports pages, but communicates well with others through the Internet, text messages and email. In the 1600s – in the 100 or so years after Caxton had developed the printing press – when legislation was produced they insisted on everything being publicised by the town crier, ignorant of another form of communication, namely, the printed word. Sections 8, 9 and 12 use words that would have been used in the 1890s. For example, section 8 states, "each holder of the unclaimed policy shall be given written notice by the insurance undertaking concerned of the following.". This notice to policyholders seems old-fashioned.Senator Phelan referred to a possible threat to communication but it does not matter whether there is a two, three or five day delivery service because it will not have a major effect if it is a few weeks or a few months late. We do, however, seek a way of making sure people are contacted to the best of our ability.I am elected by the NUI. The electoral register contains the names and addresses of about 100,000 graduates, but many of those addresses were registered when the individuals concerned left university 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago. It may be the address of the flat in Rathmines where they lived while at UCD, and they will subsequently have moved elsewhere. There is a much simpler way of contacting these people nowadays and keeping them informed – by making a register available on the Internet.I am concerned, therefore, about the wording in those sections. Take the section dealing with publication of notice, for example. In section 9, it is pointed out, "section 8 does not apply and the insurance undertaking shall publish or cause to have published a notice in 2 or more daily newspapers circulating in the State and in Iris Oifigiúil”. Those are exactly the words we would have used – not back in the 1890s perhaps because Iris Oifigiúil may not have been around then – but certainly in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s or 1970s, before the arrival of the Internet. The State is not a disinterested part here. In fact, it is almost open to the accusation that it is in the State's interest for people not to apply because more money will then go to the various worthy causes intended in the Bill. Let us then consider the register of unclaimed policies. Section 12(4) provides: "The register may be kept in any form subject to its being capable of being converted into a legible form and being used to make a legible copy or reproduction of any entry in the register". That sounds like language from a previous generation. I am sure the officials who have put much very worthy work into this will say it does not exclude electronic communication, but that is not enough. It is not sufficient to not exclude electronic communication, and I want an insistence that electronic communication will take place.Let me take the example of people who, though they have not even considered it themselves, are asked by another party whether it is possible that they have an unclaimed assurance policy. These people should be able to look up a register at home. If they are in Donegal, for example, they should be able to consult the relevant site to discover whether they have an unclaimed policy, rather than having to go through the traditional, old fashioned paper register. I may be wrong, and hopefully the Minister will point out that I am incorrect and that the legislation will insist that the register be made available on the Internet, rather than making people travel all the way from another part of Ireland to seek out the register, wherever it is, and go through it.The two points I wish to make are, first, on the method of communication and, second, on the register itself, and making sure that it is available. One of my heroes is Tim Berner-Lee, who invented the worldwide web and decided that he did not want an income from it. He did not go out to seek an income. He has not been recognised as a hero, despite the benefits with which he has provided the world. Another young man in his early 20s, a Norwegian called Linus, invented the alternative to Bill Gates's Microsoft. Bill Gates resolved to make a load of money and became the richest man in the world, and more power to him, but Linus decided that he wanted to give his system to the world. It is almost the equivalent of William Caxton, back in the 1400s, deciding that he would patent his system and get money from everybody who ever printed anything in the future.The reason I am going to some pains on this point is that I am an enthusiast for communication in much more efficient ways than this Bill seems to suggest. I imagine the Minister will say that the Bill does not exclude electronic communication, and it does provide that the register may be kept in any form subject to its being capable of being converted into a legible or written form. I hope the Minister will be able to show me a provision in the Bill that insists upon the register being made available by electronic means.I have singled out this aspect because with this Bill, there is a real need to persuade the public that this money may belong to them and that they should check it before the State takes it from them. The Minister will say that the great success of the dormant account is such that it is likely to contain a far greater surplus in the future, thereby ensuring that if somebody does seek to reclaim money at a later stage, that money will still be available. I am sure that is correct, but I want to encourage people to check whether they have a claim and to make is easy for them to find that information and process their claim. I ask the Minister to respond to that point.I will not touch upon all the other areas of the Bill. It is a very worthy Bill that should be supported. I am very happy to see it enacted and wish the Minister every success with it.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I join other Senators in welcoming the thrust of the Bill. It is designed to do two separate but complementary things. The first is to inform policyholders or potential claimants that they may have a life assurance policy that has not been claimed and the second is to set up a mechanism for the transfer and disbursement of funds. In terms of the latter, the balance is about right, although I do have a few comments to make about it. I am not altogether sure, however, that we have made anything remotely like sufficient provision for telling people in the first instance that there is a policy in existence under which they may be entitled to make a claim.The comparison has been made, properly and rightly, with the 2001 Bill, but there is one significant difference. In many cases, the policyholder will be deceased, so the person entitled to claim the money is not actually the person who made the contributions to the life assurance company over the relevant period. It is also perfectly possible, therefore, that the person who is entitled to claim the money does not and never did know of the existence of the policy. They may be the nominees, the heirs or beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased person but may have no knowledge of the existence of a policy under which they might be entitled to claim money. That is a significant additional difference, which must place a greater onus on assurance companies to tell people of the existence of a policy in the first place.As I read it, the only requirement under this Bill is for the assurance company to contact a policyholder or the heirs of a policyholder at one point only – five years after the policy matures. There is no requirement upon the assurance company to contact the policyholder at any time before the policy matures, as there should be, and there is clearly no responsibility upon the assurance company to contact the policyholders or their heirs for a full five years, or in some cases, 15 years, after the policy matures. Apart from anything else, this means that the assurance company has the benefit of that policy and the funds that accrue from it for a period of five or 15 years. It is almost certain under the terms of the policy that they would not have to pay out interest on foot of that, so they basically pocket the money and presumably hope that, in many cases, nobody turns up.There should be a much greater onus on the assurance companies to inform policyholders at various stages during the process of what the entitlement might be. There is also, as far as I can see, no responsibility at all upon anybody, be it the NTMA or the assurance company, to tell people after the event that the money has been transferred. Once the notice has been given and the advertisements are in the newspapers, there is no specific obligation on the assurance company or the NTMA to contact potential policyholders or claimants at some stage in the future to tell them that the money is there and ready and waiting to be collected. That is also a deficiency.Most assurance companies are cash rich and profitable, and it would not be unreasonable to require them, even before a policy matures, to contact policyholders on an annual basis to remind them what the state of play is – to remind them, at the very least, of the basic fact that there is a policy in existence.That general principle should apply, incidentally, beyond life assurance policies. When I was looking at this Bill yesterday, I recalled that prior to my election to the Dáil in 1992, I had a pension policy with our biggest life assurance company for three or four years, which I froze. I have not heard a single word from the company since. I was well on the way to forgetting the policy until the Minister published this Bill and, in timely fashion, reminded me of it. I have not received one written communication, electronic or otherwise, from that assurance company in the past ten years. There must be an obligation on companies to communicate with policyholders on at least an annual basis. While this should apply before the policy matures, it should certainly apply when it matures and for each year of the five years before it becomes unclaimed under the terms of the Bill.A serious case can be made to improve the way in which one can claim moneys due after they have been transferred. In so far as I can tell, there is no power in the Bill for an individual claimant, or someone who thinks he or she might have a policy, to inspect the register. It is not a question of whether the register is kept in hard copy or electronic format – one cannot check the register that includes other names. I accept a balance must be struck and that private information should not be shared with those who have no direct interest in it. Senator Quinn raised an interesting point. It is surely possible for individuals to check electronically whether they have funds held by an assurance company or which have been transferred to the NTMA.I looked at the amendments proposed on Committee Stage in the Lower House and was struck by one proposed by Deputy Richard Bruton of Fine Gael regarding maintaining a central database. If one thinks a deceased relative may have had a life assurance policy that has matured but does not know with which company it is held, one has no alternative but to start making inquiries of individual assurance companies. There is no central database one can check. The Bill offers the opportunity to introduce a central register or database that would make it possible for individuals to contact assurance companies, or more particularly the NTMA, to establish if there was a policy under which they might be entitled to claim money. There should surely be a responsibility on the NTMA to maintain a register containing the names of policyholders whose unclaimed policies were transferred to it. There is no such facility or provision in the Bill. That is unfortunate. We should use the opportunity to introduce such a provision.The structure for the disbursement of funds provided for in the Bill is ingenious. It is obviously an attempt to strike a balance between providing the kind of slush fund about which Senator Phelan spoke and a transparent feature. I am more than a little bewildered by what we have ended up with. The board is now required to draw up a plan that observes the general principles set out in the Bill but the Minister, in consultation with the board, still has the power to direct that a programme be funded from the moneys assembled in the fund. The description in the Bill of what the moneys can be used for is pretty broad and no doubt the plan would be, too. We need to decide whether we want a transparent policy implemented by the board or allow the Minister to decide. The latter seems to be the most sensible option but if we want the Minister to make the decision, we should remove the bureaucratic underlay set out in the Bill.It is quite normal for the Opposition to deplore the regulations a Minister is entitled to make on foot of a Bill but these take the biscuit. Section 7 allows the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to change any provision of the Bill he or she wants, provided he or she does so for the common good or the "orderly regulation of financial services". This is too broad a power to give to the Minister. There is little point in introducing a Bill of this kind if the Minister can change any provision in it by regulation – it should be much more restrictive. Regulations should be made by the IFSRA with the consent of the Minister for Finance.I am puzzled as to the reason the basic power under the Bill is given to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. It would surely have made more sense to allow the Minister for Finance make regulations that govern an important part of the financial services industry. Admittedly, his or her consent is required under the Bill but the reason is beyond me the primary responsibility is given to the Minister whose primary interest is dispersing the funds. The balance is not quite right.I am not sure that we have imposed the correct obligations on life assurance companies to contact policyholders. This is the principal area we should explore further. I would like to hear more about the Dormant Accounts Act 2001. To use Senator Mansergh's words, we have successfully managed to reconnect a number of dormant account holders with their money. How much money has been collected by the agency and what are the plans for dispersing it?I broadly welcome the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I welcome the Minister of State. This Bill is receiving wide acceptance as it is seen as putting money to good use that would otherwise be lying dormant. I agree that we must ensure people are informed of their accounts. How this is best done is critical. It is not sufficient to put notices in newspapers a couple of times a year. There will be a strong onus on the State to inform people that they hold unclaimed assurance policies. The Bill must deal with this more strongly and effectively.The Minister of State has outlined that the money will be prudently invested and dispersed by the NTMA. It is important that we know how much money is involved. Based on previous experience with the NTMA, I am concerned about how effectively it will look after this money. For how long will it be invested by the NTMA before dispersal? I am concerned that moneys could lose value if they are left with the agency for an unspecified time. When I say the agency does not have a good recent record, I am cognisant of the fact that the world economy is not great and that this is affecting investments. If the money to which I refer is left with the agency it could, in time, begin to have a positive effect. It is important to know how long the Government will leave this money with the National Treasury Management Agency before disbursing it.I suggest that the elderly should benefit from this windfall because many of them would have had investments, such as their pensions. I refer in particular to occupational pension schemes. When people retire they discover their pension is worth very little. This could be a mechanism which could assist elderly people in their later years in making their lives a little more comfortable. I welcome the Bill, although I am concerned about how the proceeds of these policies will be managed and that the best benefit will be obtained from them.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. I agree with many aspects of the Bill that have been highlighted and I am delighted it has been introduced as there are many good reason for it. However, it may have been introduced too hastily. Perhaps we should have waited until details of what will happen in regard to the proceeds of the dormant bank accounts had emerged. It would be helpful to have information about the amount of money that will be collected from that procedure, the use to which the moneys collected will be put and how much it will cost to collect the proceeds of these unclaimed policies. That would be a good and necessary exercise to carry out before we deal with these policies, which are an unknown quantity. We do not know how much money the proceeds of these unclaimed policies will generate, the number of unclaimed policies, how much it will cost to collect the proceeds from them or the purpose for which those proceeds will be used. Perhaps the Minister of State should have waited until all the details in relation to dormant bank accounts were available.A good reason outlined for the introduction of the Bill is that it may make many people aware that they or someone belonging to them may have a dormant policy. As Senator Quinn rightly pointed out, every effort should be made to ensure that people are enlightened about the proposals in regard to the fund and that every effort is made to publicly put in place procedures whereby people can easily find out whether they, or somebody belonging to them, have a policy.Where does the buck stop in relation to the next of kin of the holder of an unclaimed policy? Is the next of kin a member of the policyholder's immediate family, a first or second cousin, a neighbour or would it suffice to have a piece of paper held by a solicitor to the effect that a policyholder intended to pass on to a neighbour the proceeds of a policy in his or her will, even though he or she had not made one? Where will the line be drawn in this regard? Wills are contested in many cases and I am sure the proceeds of these policies could also be contested.The Bill provides that if a policyholder wishes to reclaim the proceeds of a policy, he or she can do so from the fund. How long will the proceeds of unclaimed policies be held in the fund? If all proceeds of the unclaimed policies are spent, will the taxpayer have to pick up the tab if a person claims in three or four years that his grandfather, grandmother or somebody belonging to him had a policy, the details of which he can present. Who will pay the proceeds of that policy if the money in the fund has been spent?Like other Members, I am also concerned about how the fund will be disbursed. The majority of the holders of unclaimed policies are from various parts of the country and, as a result, the proceeds that will be transferred to the fund should be disbursed throughout the country. The proceeds of unclaimed policies should be ring-fenced for projects in areas from which the policyholders come. Projects funded should also carry the names of the policyholders to the effect that a project has been made possible as a result of the proceeds of a policy belonging to Joe or Mary Soap or a project should carry the names of a number of policyholders. The proceeds of unclaimed policies should not merely be transferred to a pool of money and then disbursed by the Government or by a Government Deputy in his or her constituency. The people who took out these policies should be acknowledged in regard to the proceeds of their policies funding for the provision of future projects.I welcome the Bill, although I have reservations about some aspects of it. As Senator Quinn said, I hope that every effort will be made to notify policyholders and their next of kin of the details of unclaimed policies. I hope the Bill will have the effect of bringing forward many holders of these policies, who do not realise they have them, or their next of kin. The Bill will generate much publicity in relation to bringing that to light. I hope that the Minister of State will respond to my point concerning the next of kin of such policyholders.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I thank the Senators for raising a number of pertinent questions concerning the details of the Bill. I also thank them for their co-operation in facilitating the passage of the Bill through the House. I am particularly pleased that I can relay to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the general support among Members for the Bill.We all appreciate that life assurance is a technical subject. The Minister has attempted to produce a Bill which manages to deal with the complex issue of unclaimed life assurance policies in a relatively straightforward manner.I listened with interest to the concerns expressed by Senators, which I will convey to the Minister. The main issue raised concerned the sending of notices to all relevant policyholders every year, regardless of the fact that their moneys would have been transferred to the dormant accounts fund. This issue was raised by Senators John Paul Phelan, Quinn and McDowell. It should not be forgotten that prior to and possibly since these policies became inactive, the life assurance companies have been trying, to no avail, to make contact with the policyholders. It is also significant that it is in the industry's interest to pull out all the stops to contact these policyholders because the companies will lose the underlying funds if no contact is made, although they will still have to administer the policies.To compel the undertakings to go beyond what is reasonable in this regard will involve an extra cost to the industry, which inevitably will be passed on to the consumers. In trying to reach a balance, the Minister specified that notifications will take place every year so that there will be sufficient notice. This year alone there will be four newspaper advertisements to this effect. The best example of the success of this to date is the fact that the contact made to date this year has been very successful. Since the scheme came on line last March, less than 12 months ago, the number and value of reactivations have been significant. Some €400 million lay dormant at the end of last March, of which, by the end of last December, €150 million had been reclaimed. Given the difficulties prior to the introduction of the scheme, it must be accepted that it has been a considerable success. I am advised by my officials that the Department has already received a number of queries about the scheme, many of which have come through the Department's website, and this is before it has come into operation.I accept Senator Quinn's point about notification. His example of the universities is a good one. Obviously, nothing much can be done about the fact that contact can only be made through the correspondence addresses given to the life assurance companies and that they may not have the relevant e-mail addresses. However, details of the schemes are available on the websites of all Departments.In response to Senator McDowell, while it is true that companies have enjoyed the use of moneys during the five or 15 year periods, policyholders will still receive the full benefit and return they are due.

If they have the use of money for up to 15 years and they are not obliged to pay interest on it, why is it in their interests to contact policyholders before the 15 years have expired?

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Regarding the point made by Senators John Paul Phelan and McDowell that the money in the dormant account fund could be used as a slush fund, obviously the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has no intention of doing this. The Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the fund be used for charitable and community purposes, which is exactly what is provided for in the Bill. The involvement of the disbursements board is significant in that surplus moneys, subject to the guidelines laid down in the 2001 Act, would be disbursed by the board under the overall policy guidelines given by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Obviously, no accusations can be made against the Government about slush funds.Senator John Paul Phelan was concerned about the impact of the recent losses in the national pensions reserve fund. It is fair to say the National Treasury Management Agency has given excellent service, principally in its capacity as manager of the national debt. The Government has advanced new policy initiatives responding to the changing environment. The agency has shown its ability to build on its core experience and respond quickly to changing demands. The Minister has every confidence in its ability to manage the proceeds from dormant accounts.The functions of the inspectors are specifically laid out in section 19. Inspections will be conducted as and when necessary, probably for two to three months from May 2004 onwards. Inspectors will have access to the institutions' registers of unclaimed policies for the purpose of carrying out their functions. Their fees will be paid from the reserve account of the dormant accounts fund.Senator Mansergh asked that consideration be given to persons or projects catering for mental health. Section 41 in Schedule 2 reads: ". for the purposes of programmes or projects, designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability". This section was deliberately drafted as broadly as possible to give the board maximum flexibility in prioritising areas, including the area to which the Senator referred. It gives the scope to provide funding for any type of mental or physical health problems. Knowing the composition of the board, I have no doubt that it will give a high priority to those to whom the Senator referred, something with which I am sure we all concur.Senators Quinn and McDowell raised the issue of a central database containing details of policyholders whose policies are unclaimed. A proposal was brought forward for such an electronic database, accessible to members of the public to the extent that they could check if there were any dormant assets in their name. That proposal has been examined and the concept holds a great deal of merit. It would come into effect where the controller of the database received reasonable evidence of a claim to the proceeds of a dormant account or unclaimed life policy. The Minister has already stated that, if such a database was properly constructed and managed, it could assist members of the public in tracing dormant moneys. He is aware that a number of commercial organisations are interested in assisting with such a database.We should not underestimate, however, the legal complexities and obstacles to be surmounted in proceeding with this proposal. As such, it is not something that can be countenanced for the Bill because it requires detailed further analysis from both the legal and commercial viewpoints as well as the agreement and assistance of the industry. A number of issues must be considered, not least of which is the legal and constitutional right to privacy enjoyed by all and also the institutions' duty of confidentiality to their customers. The second major consideration is the commercial viability of the establishment and maintenance of such a database. However, as there is merit in the proposal, the Minister for Finance has asked his officials to examine the matter further and discuss with the industry and the Office of the Attorney General the pros and cons of such a proposal. As he sees it, the centralised large volumes of personal data would not only have to be legally permissible but also cost-effective and user-friendly to warrant pursuing the exercise. I assure Senators that this matter is still under consideration as a short-term objective.Senator Paddy Burke referred to the definition of a policyholder, which recognises that many people – for example, the person who proposed the policy, his or her heirs or assignees – are entitled to make claims. It will depend on the circumstances obtaining at the time of the claim, that is, whether the original policyholder is still alive.Senators Paddy Burke and Terry also mentioned the operation and management of the fund. As already stated, this will be done under the auspices of the NTMA. The money transferred to the fund will be split between two accounts – a reserve account and an investment and disbursement account. Now that we have a clearer idea of how much money will be coming into the fund and the length of time it has been dormant, the officials from the Department of Finance have already begun to discuss with the NTMA how the money is to be divided between the two accounts in consideration of the purposes these accounts are to serve. Once the officials have a feel for this, they will discuss it with officials from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Under the scheme, which has been running for some time, we cannot know how long the money will remain in the investment account. In any event, the board will be advised to operate very reservedly for a few years until we see how the scheme operates.Senator Paddy Burke suggested we should wait a little longer. In this country we are plagued with waiting a little longer for so many things to happen. While I agree with the Senator in many cases, I certainly do not agree we should wait any longer in this instance. We should get on with the job because nothing but benefit will accrue from this Bill.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Bill 2002 is a Bill to amend the governing charters of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The initial driving force behind it was the introduction of a new member of the body to be known as "Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland". The purpose of the change is to render the body politic of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland consistent with those of the Royal College of Surgeons in England and the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, institutions with which it has a rapport.In its current form, the Bill contains 37 sections and goes considerably further than previous legislation in tidying up the Government charters so as to allow for the creation of a single text which will govern the college. The Bill also provides for extraneous matters necessary for the proper management of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.
#CamillusGlynn	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-party	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-dob	unknown-#CamillusGlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I am delighted to welcome the introduction of The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Bill 2002. Founded in 1784, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is a recognised college of the National University of Ireland. As the charter for the Royal College of Surgeons has never been incorporated in law, this legislation will, for the first time, regulate its position.This amendment is needed to clarify and simplify the position of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The charters of 1844, 1883 the 1885 and the 1965 Act contained provisions, which amended and-or repealed the charters which preceded them. In certain instances, however, the provision being replaced was not repealed, despite it being rendered redundant, which undoubtedly led to confusion and a degree of ambiguity. In addition, as a result of the number and extent of charters, the governing documentation of the college has become extremely complex and arduous to digest. For these reasons, a considerable portion of this private Bill is aimed at having one referable document regarding the governance of the college.The Bill also introduces new categories of member and new classes of officer to the institution. The category of "Member" will now be known as "Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland", a title consistent with those which obtain in the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in England and Scotland, with which the college has an excellent rapport. It must be noted that this new category of member necessitates the removal of the use of the word "member" contained within the charters and the 1965 Act, where it is used interchangeably with the category of member known as "a fellow". This must be changed to avoid confusion in the future. The Bill also creates a new status entitled "Fellow by Special Election of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland", whose status will be distinct from and in addition to the category of member currently known as fellow.It is essential that the position of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is finally regulated in Irish law. It is also important that such an essential Irish institution takes its place on the Statute Book.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was founded in 1784 by royal charter granted by King George III of Great Britain and Ireland. The college was originally established to educate surgeons at a time when surgeons were trained separately from physicians. In 1886 the undergraduate training of surgeons and physicians was merged and the college formed a medical school for this purpose. The medical school is a recognised college of the National University of Ireland and its graduates receive the MB, BCH and BAO degrees from the university. Graduates also receive the historical qualifying letters testimonial of LRCP & SI, as licentiates of both the royal colleges of physicians and surgeons in Ireland.The main objective of the medical school is to provide the education and experience that will enable its graduates to enter postgraduate training in any specialty of medicine. To this end, the curriculum is designed to allow the student to develop a balanced perspective of domiciliary, community and hospital care and acquire a sound knowledge of the principles of both the science and art of medicine.Today, more than 5,000 of the college's graduates – 400 of whom are in Malaysia – are practising worldwide. The highly qualified graduates of the RCSI are a source of great pride to this country and are at the forefront of medical practice at home and abroad. Their expertise is renowned around the world.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is located in a beautiful building, which occupies a pivotal position in the capital. Once passed into law, the Bill will bring clarity to the confused position which currently obtains.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	87	This is an historic occasion and a unique opportunity. It is the first time in the lifetime of this Seanad that Members have had an opportunity to debate legislation introduced under a unique parliamentary and legislative device, the Private Bill. When I attempted to discover the distinction between a Private Bill and a public Bill, I was informed that a public Bill involves the population at large, whereas a Private Bill involves bodies incorporated by charter. I understood we had declared a republic in the late 1940s. Delving into our history has certain historical resonances.I thank the sponsors of the legislation for the deliberate way in which they attempted to inform colleagues on all sides of its importance to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and for their co-operation and courtesy to us all in advancing the purpose behind the legislation.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is an important school of medicine, of which all citizens should be proud. It has a distinguished history and position in this city occupying one of the most beautiful education buildings. Since the late 17th century it has produced many fine physicians and surgeons throughout Ireland and the world. It is important to state also it has a particular role to play because of the large number of non-nationals who have attended the college during the years. It has made a unique contribution to medical education in that a significant proportion of graduates come from non-Irish backgrounds. It is important to recognise this, particularly in the current climate to which we all have attempted to adapt in recent years. We are learning a great deal from the college, not only in terms of its expertise in the area of medical education but also in terms of what it has done to educate people from other countries and ensure its profession is of the highest possible standard.This is a technical Bill which attempts to bring together in one consolidated legislative measure the governance of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. There is an obligation on us to pass it, having deliberated on it on Committee Stage. I understand a joint committee will bring it forward in the coming weeks. I offer my party's  imprimatur to support its aims and objectives and give it the swiftest possible passage through this and the other House. As Senator Glynn said, its essence is not just consolidation but the establishment of new categories of membership which are important because they fit into the categories of membership between colleges on these islands.I refer to what might possibly be a divisive point. I have heard mutterings off-stage that a party in the other House may have a certain difficulty with the word "Royal". If that view is advocated by the party in question, it is churlish and selfish because those who argue that tolerance and respect should now become the bywords and the principle in other parts of this island must respect and show tolerance to the history of institutions such as this and their connection to other colleges on these islands. I do not wish to be divisive but to ensure the party to which I refer is listening.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is an important college, not just from a medical point of view but also in terms of the history of this country and our neighbouring island. If parties use this Bill, which is an attempt to ensure the governance of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is of the highest possible standard and that its rules and regulations are consolidated, as a cynical, political tool with which to say something to other audiences, that should be condemned by us. I say this before others take up the cudgel in that respect.

As Senator Hayes pointed out, it is an historic occasion in that this is the first Private Bill to come before this Seanad.The updating of the legislation was long awaited. The previous wording was slightly antiquated and narrow. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has moved into such diversified areas of health that the current wording does not cover everything it would want to do. As a result, this legislation is before the House.I speak with some knowledge in that I am a member of the Medical Council on which I represent the public interest and know a little about the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and its great educators. I first came across them when I visited the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland school of medicine in Beaumont Hospital, a school of excellence providing the best service offered by the State in the line of medical education.Before it was established as a school for medical training of undergraduates, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was engaged solely in the training of postgraduates. In the middle of the 19th century it joined with University College Dublin and became a school of medicine in its own right. It is now branching out into areas which in recent years have met public demand in the whole area of physiotherapy, for example, in respect of which degree course last autumn it held its first graduation ceremony. Last autumn also saw the establishment of its school of pharmacy which was urgently needed as prior to that the only such school was the one located in Trinity College. Even with an additional three or four schools, we still would not have enough places for the number of undergraduates who want to do pharmacology.Senator Brian Hayes also pointed out the number of non-national students who study in the college. The State owes the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland a debt of gratitude because overseas students pay €30,000 per year and the spin-off to the economy in terms of accommodation for students and the money they spend in travelling to and from the country is enormous. I am not a mathematician but imagine the income from the RCSI would amount to approximately €40 million a year, which is not insignificant.I referred to my involvement with the Medical Council. This day next week I was due to travel to Penang to inspect its medical school, of which the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and UCD are overseers. I am greatly disappointed that because of the troubles in the Middle East the trip will not go ahead but hope it will be back on course later in the autumn. The medical school in Penang is a wonderful set-up. Not only is it an educator, it is also educating people in their own environment.There is also a programme in place which has a vision for 2020 where the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is considering only taking foreign students for part, but not all, of their training. While that is a positive step forward because it will meet a demand from other countries, it will close off some of the income it has enjoyed previously. It is important, therefore, that we support it in examining the other areas mentioned. I am also delighted RCSI graduates enjoy equal acceptance throughout the world with their counterparts from the Royal Colleges of Surgeons in London and Edinburgh.I support Senator Brian Hayes's sentiments on another point. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is the only medical college which enjoys equal status on a 32 county basis. Its postgraduates come from all over the 32 counties. It is intrusive for a member of another party associated with this House to suddenly jump on the bandwagon and say they do not like the word "Royal". Every Member of the House and citizen of the country is as republican-minded as members of that party. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is recognised throughout the world for its excellence and high standards in medical education. It would be a retrograde step for it to lose the word "Royal" because it is a recognised part of its name and not recognised as having any great political significance.I take great pleasure in being associated with the Bill.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the Bill and hope it has a speedy passage. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has an illustrious past and its present and future are even brighter. The work I have seen undertaken in the college, not just in the field of medical education but also in research over the last 30 years, has been quite splendid and I see it going from strength to strength. While it wants to change its charter so as to be in line with other colleges such as the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, it will also want to be in line with colleges such as the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland down the road from it. Recently when some colleagues of mine from the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland asked me what this charter was about, I said I thought it was because the RCSI wanted to be line with their college, which provoked great laughter from them. I congratulate the RCSI on bringing this Bill forward and hope it passes through the House speedily.It is interesting that this is the only way charters can be changed. Perhaps when we look again at reform of the Seanad, we might look at the way Private Bills are dealt with, a matter which has not been examined for a long time.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I am glad to speak in favour of this Private Bill. Even though I am quite a long time in the parliamentary system and have been a Member of the Seanad in the past, this is quite new to me as we did not deal with a Private Bill at that time. It is interesting that the original charter was granted by George III on 11 February 1784 and today, 12 February 2003, 219 years later, there is a modest commemorative event. Perhaps "shindig" is the wrong word but the college has a little celebration on its charter day, and rightly so.While we were very well briefed on this issue, I was interested in how Private Bills were dealt with in the Seanad. The procedure for dealing with such Bills was established in 1939 and one wonders who decided it. I agree with Senator Henry that though it seems arcane now, it is novel and interesting, marking out the work of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.Let us get the "Royal" issue out of the way. I, too, heard what one might call off-stage mutterings, not from anyone associated with the Seanad but from the Dáil. Ours is the Upper House and theirs the Lower House. We can, therefore, leave those low thoughts to those in the Lower House and deal with this when we meet in committee. I see the word "Royal" as a marketing tool. If one is selling one's wares in 50 countries throughout the world and one wants an entree into the various markets where there are bright students for one's college, the word "Royal" is a marketing tool. It conjures up many images, none of them imperialist or subversive. It is plainly just a common sense marketing tool. Those who can be heard muttering nearby should be sat on quickly.There are two key aspects to the Bill, one of which is consolidation – there have been five changes to the charter since 1784. Poor George III came to a sticky end, though I am glad the college survived so well. George III went mad. As he is not around, I can say what I like.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	91	It happened in the twilight of his political career.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Exactly. If there have been five changes to the charter, there is a clear need to consolidate. The second key aspect of the Bill relates to the distinction between members and fellows. That terminology must be strengthened in order that it is quite clear what people can do.I thank the promoters of the Bill and I am glad they are present in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery, both the solicitors, Vincent and Beatty, and representatives of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, as befits their position in the matter.I am interested in the work being done by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, its IT expertise in particular. The college is believed to have the greatest IT expertise of all the medical schools and colleges and every student is presented with a laptop on the day he or she enters the college. It also owns quite a lot of property, particularly Mercers Hospital, which it operates as a community health centre for the people of the area – a feature of its philanthropic approach.As Senator Feeney said, students from all over Ireland and 50 other countries attend the college. The fees make it independent. Apart from individual trusts and grants for various projects, in general terms it is not dependent on State funding. Senator Feeney is also correct in saying the families of overseas students come to see how their darlings are getting on in Dublin, even if it is the darling of the fifth wife. This forges social and commercial links between our capital city and the many countries where the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has an outreach facility linked to Dublin.I am honoured to bring this Bill before the House, although I defer to the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I wonder who the Leas-Chathaoirleach was in 1939 when the original Bill was laid out. We are delighted that this Bill enjoys the support of all parties. It mentions people of 25 years of age which is somewhat limiting. I hope we can change this because it would rule out many younger applicants. There is also the matter of direction which might cause problems on the basis of equality legislation. Those are details we can correct in these Houses.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Labour Party supports the aim of this Bill – the provision of a modern framework for the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. As with any Bill, public or private, Government or Opposition, we have the responsibility of ensuring the enactment of the best possible legislation. We will suggest a number of changes to the Bill on Committee Stage but are happy to co-operate with the promoters of the Bill in addressing these issues.There are some areas to do with policy that concern us, one of which has already been mentioned by Senator O'Rourke, the need for section 27 to comply with equality legislation. Section 27(4) contains a crude cut-off point that a person cannot qualify if he or she is under 25 years of age. We believe such a provision is rare in legislation and has not been used since the enactment of the Employment Equality Bill 1998, which prohibits discrimination in vocational training over the age of 18 years. We would not favour this requirement to be expressed in terms of age. It could be redrafted to suggest that seven years study of medicine is required. This would achieve a similar result without offending equality legislation.We also have problems with sections 12 and 29. Section 12 provides for the revocation of degrees awarded by the college in certain circumstances, such as allegations of fraud. As with any disciplinary procedure, it is important to provide some basic protections for the accused person. These are missing from the Bill and would be dependent on by-laws. We should be reluctant to allow degrees to be revoked on the basis of such notice as the section provides. Firmer guarantees of fair procedure are required. A similar issue arises in section 29(6). It is desirable that we spell out the guarantees of fair procedure that will be afforded rather than ask the Oireachtas to leave everything to the officers of the college.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has been very responsible in consulting widely in advance of the publication of the Bill, the objectives of which are very worthy. The Labour Party will respond in a similar spirit of co-operation in terms of any changes that should be made. The model undertaken by the college in the Bill is one for any organisation which wishes to introduce private legislation. As a new Senator, I am glad that I have been involved in this process. It has been an interesting and rewarding experience to deal with legislation initiated outside the House. We should look at a broader application of the idea in terms of Seanad reform, with other groups initiating legislation we can take on board.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I am delighted to support this Bill, on which we will be able to work to remove some of the infelicity that Members have noticed. I also pay tribute to the work of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and recognise how important it has been, not only in medical education in Ireland but also as a form of invisible export of knowledge and education, from which there is a spin off because those who are educated in this way are ambassadors and friends of Ireland. The work the college does around the world has great potential for the economic enhancement of the country as well as helping us in other ways.On the medical education front, it is extremely important that we enable the college to be in the position where its graduates have a tradable and recognisable qualification, particularly within these islands. The health service in Northern Ireland depends on people with qualifications from Dublin, Edinburgh or London. It is vital that they should be on an equal footing and transferable and that standards and validation are the same. I am glad the college is preparing itself for this.I find the Bill difficult to read because of the necessity of referring to other documents. I get worried when a person needs a shelf of books in front of him or her before a Bill can be read. Anyone affected or influenced by legislation in any field should have one document before him or her where he or she can find out his or her rights and responsibilities. I take heart from the explanatory memorandum which suggests that will be the outcome of the exercise. Why could that not have been the starting point? I would be interested to hear what the draftsmen to say about that, whether there could have been a process of consolidation with everything between the same two covers.I was worried about the rights of appeal in these difficult disciplinary matters and suggest to the college the possibility of a visitor. I know there is provision for the censors, who seem to have quite an onerous task. However, in this day and age, the idea of a totally self-regulating body is rather passé. It might not be a bad idea to have an external presence among the Senators, as other colleges do, such as a visitor.I was also somewhat worried about a phrase suggested in the insertion in paragraph 16, stating that the council shall be afforded the widest flexibility as regards the governing of the college. While one should not require people to dot every "i" and cross every "t", I find it difficult to get a satisfactory legal definition that comprehends what "the widest flexibility" is, other than "Let's do whatever we like". I suggest we look at that on Committee Stage.I acknowledge that the House has a responsibility to recognise the importance of the college and its noble traditions over the centuries; its contribution to medical education, medicine and the health care of people in Ireland and its current work to export that kind of knowledge to many countries across the globe. I am glad the college is also extending its concerns to the other health disciplines. It is hugely important that we begin to consider health in a holistic way and that the people engaged in this are trained together.I welcome this development and, with the co-operation of the college and its legal advisers, I am sure we can improve on this Bill on Committee Stage so as to leave the college with a charter that will carry it forward in future decades.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I welcome the Bill and the manner in which it has been introduced. During my travels around the world, especially in Asia, I have found that in the case of practically nine out of every ten people whom I met and who were well informed about Ireland, it was due to their having attended the Royal College of Surgeons, which has enormous respect. I support anything that will enhance its value, whether in a marketing sense – and I had not thought of it in that context until the Leader referred to it in marketing terms – and enable it to go forward through the next 219 years. I am even more optimistic than Senator Hayes who spoke of the next decades – I believe it will go even further if we get matters right in this Bill.I know something about Private Bills and charters, as a member of the board of governors of Hume Street Hospital for some years. In that institution, we have a similar problem and, probably, a similar intention to do something. In that case, it is quite unique, though not as old as the time of King George III – the charter of Hume Street Hospital dates from 1916, under a different King George. That charter specifies that the governing body of the hospital will be made up of "gentlemen" and we have not been able to change it for legal reasons.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	99	We may have to introduce a Private Bill in the Oireachtas very soon in that regard. I wish to touch on some aspects of the Bill, without getting into detail. I have the highest regard for the effort which has been made to ensure that the governance of the college is protected. I commend the work that has gone into making sure that the anomaly of distinguishing between members and fellows is understood.In relation to the use of the word "Royal", I grew up in what I might call a republican family and I recall my father, a strong republican in those times, pointing out that, whenever a revolution occurred in the Roman empire, people did not get rid of the statues and other memorabilia of the previous administration. On a visit to St. Petersburg some years ago – it was then Leningrad – we were told that on the night before the October revolution, Lenin took the revolutionaries aside and warned them not to damage any of their history and traditions. In fact, the revolutionaries did not damage any of the memorabilia of the previous Czars, even though they hated them. In my view, apart altogether from the marketability of the word "royal", we should not be frightened of holding on to our traditions.In welcoming the introduction of this Private Bill, I believe it will find general approval, although questions have been raised on some aspects. An aspect which may not be always understood is the distinction between enabling legislation and enforcement legislation. The fact that this Bill will enable the college to award degrees at some future time does not give it the authority to do so. I hope that may put minds at rest; we will have an opportunity to discuss that aspect more fully on Committee Stage. It means they will not have to revise the charter if, at some future time, it is decided that the college should award degrees. In that event, the matter would be in the hands of the Oireachtas.Some of us who have availed of the facilities of the college for other purposes are aware that it does not confine itself to its better known functions of teaching and research. I and Senator O'Toole have happy memories of the counting of NUI graduate votes in the Seanad elections last July at the college. I wish the Bill well in its passage through the House, with any appropriate improvements.

My memories of the Seanad election count, to which Senator Quinn has just referred, are slightly mixed. Happily, we were both elected on two occasions.

It is appropriate that we should deal with it with some despatch. Its objectives are admirable.Without repeating points made by other speakers, I wish to draw attention to a few matters to which, perhaps, the Leas-Chathaoirleach may wish to respond. The Bill proposes to change the terms of office of certain office holders including, I believe, the president of the college. That is quite appropriate and I fully approve – the term of office was too short otherwise. However, there appears to be a certain contradiction in section 32 which states: "The Council of the College shall have the power to determine by resolution the term of office of any office holder." I believe that is superfluous and, indeed, conflicts somewhat with the earlier provision to lengthen the term of office. It is simply a general enablement and does not add anything to the Bill. However, if there is some particular reason for it, I have no very strong view on the matter. I simply suggest that we look at it more closely.I also question the provision in section 36: "This Act shall come into operation on the (blank) day of (blank) 2003." I believe it would be more appropriate, in case there may be questions as to how the commencement date is to be established – normally, a Minister establishes a commencement date for parts of an Act – to strengthen that provision by stating that the Act shall come into operation on the day of enactment. Specifically, that would be the date of signature by the President. I suggest that as a simpler and cleaner way of dealing with the matter. I propose to return to those matters on Committee Stage and perhaps the sponsors of the Bill would look at it again in the meantime.In relation to the use of the word "royal", we should not lose the opportunity of ridiculing revisionists wherever we find them. I fully support the views articulated by Senator Brian Hayes and other Senators in dealing with this aspect. In my office earlier today, when I was dealing with an entirely different matter and trying to find some creative surges in that regard, all I could think of was how to rename the Royal Showband, the Royal county or the Royal Dublin.

I am not sure what the royal family or Jim Royle and his family would make of all of this.People who cannot accommodate their history should find a different place to live. This is the name of this distinguished college. I might say it is the distinguished name of this distinguished college. In that sense we should reflect on the fact that this is where it is rooted and that is what it means. It is a good reminder of the length of our history and that we should not spend our lives flattening out the spaces in history. That is not the way we do our business; we look at it in the round and we deal with it.I hope we have matured as a nation. I certainly know that everybody in this House will have grown up and matured to the point where we do not need to blow up Nelson's Pillar once again. We can leave it sitting there and deal with it.This college has given significant and important service, both to this island and abroad, and has brought the image of Ireland, in practical and special terms, to other places. It has done us much service in that area. It behoves us to be supportive of this attempt by the college authorities to progress and also to look at ways in which they can make changes in the future. To that extent, I welcome the enabling section – section 31 – which allows the college to develop in other ways. It would be my intention to support the Bill in any way possible and to facilitate its passage through the House.

The threshold mentioned in the Bill is €500. On Committee Stage in the Lower House the Minister seemed to indicate the possibility of reducing the threshold in the future. The amendment seeks to ensure that if the threshold is reduced in the future, all the proceeds which go into the fund between now and then would be subject to the regulation of the Minister.

In particular, it would place a considerable administrative burden on companies if they had to re-examine each policy to see how much it was then worth to establish whether personal notification was required. There would also be difficulties with unit linked or with-profit policies and the fact that such policies can decrease as well as increase in value. One particular date for the purpose of this legislation needs to be the focus point. The Minister considers this adeqate. Policyholders have been put on notice that their moneys are due to transfer to the dormant fund. The annual public notices and notices in the premises of institutions will keep the public informed of the scheme. I do not propose to accept the amendment.

If a policy has reached its conclusion and in two or three years another policy was to be unclaimed by the same person, it would be appropriate and not too large a burden on the financial institution if people were contacted according to the number of policies they held.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	117	This amendment is important, even if it might seem obscure on first reading. The Bill provides for a statutory requirement that only one notice be given, irrespective of the number of policies held. As I said on Second Stage, there should be a requirement on assurance companies to provide a notice at least once each year during the five years or until such time as the legislation comes into play – 15 years in some cases.The Bill does not impose any obligation on assurance companies until such time as the policy is deemed to be unclaimed. It is possible that there will have been no contact between the assurance company and the policyholder or the relatives of the deceased in cases where the policyholder is deceased. There should be such an obligation. The amendment does not seek to provide for this but at least it would provide for the possibility that there might be an obligation.On Committee Stage in the Lower House, the Minister said insurance companies will have been making efforts to contact policyholders over the previous five years because it is in their interests to do so. I do not understand why this is in their interests or why we should assume they have been making such efforts. As I said on Second Stage, it seems perfectly within the interests of insurance companies to retain funds for as long as possible. The Minister of State said that they will lose the underlying funds while still having to administer the policy. I am not sure what he means by the phrase "they will still have the obligation to administer the policies while the funds are being transferred into the agency fund".
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	118	To reassure Senator John Paul Phelan, section 8(1) specifically provides that each holder of an unclaimed policy should be given written notice by the insurance undertaking concerned. This means that if a person has more than one policy, he or she will be given notice for each policy and there will, therefore, be no difficulty.With regard to annual notification as outlined in section 9, public notifications will take place every year so we can take it that members of the public will have sufficient notice about what is happening to their money. This year alone, there will be four such advertisements. The experience to date shows that the passage of this legislation through the Houses has aroused public interest and the Department has received many queries in respect of it. We cannot emphasise enough that, in the first instance, it is the business of every individual to check if they or their relations have policies that have been left dormant. Irrespective of how comprehensive we make notification, there will always be a case for further notification. Some €150,000 has already been reclaimed, which record speaks for itself.Senator McDowell made a point about it being unfair that life companies have the use of money from unclaimed policies for a considerable period before notice is made to the policyholders. He gave an example that if €20,000 was due on a person's policy today, but he or she did not claim until after they were notified of its existence – some five or 15 years after it was due – they would have suffered a loss and would only stand to gain the €20,000, even though the life company made good on the interest. That is not the case. Section 2(4)(a) provides that the amount to be transferred to the dormant account from the life companies includes any interest applied by the insurance undertaking on the relevant date to the moneys payable under the policy, in accordance with the usual practice for the undertaking concerned. The relevant date in this instance is the date of transfer to the dormant accounts funds.The Irish Insurance Federation has advised that all insurance undertakings apply non-contractual interest to the proceeds of any moneys left on deposit with them – in other words, on unclaimed policies. In drafting the Bill, account was taken of this to ensure the policyholder was not prejudiced and to make it clear to the undertakings that this interest must still be applied, even though the moneys will now be lost to them.There is no gain to the assurance company as the Senator suggests. The point has been accepted by the companies that they have long enjoyed the use of the unclaimed money, but this legislation requires them to transfer all the proceeds of the policy, including the accrued interest, to the dormant fund such that what they have enjoyed can still be claimed back by the policyholder. The policyholder is fully protected.

Perhaps we can tease it out further. Is the Minister of State saying that if, on maturity, €20,000 might be payable, it is the practice of insurance companies that, if the money is not claimed for the five years afterwards, to apply non-contractual interest? What rate of interest would apply and what is the normal practice?

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The money must be paid over. It is provided for in legislation.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	123	My real difficulty is that the Minister of State spoke of the comprehensive provision for notifying people of the existence of a policy. However, it is not comprehensive; it is specifically on a once and once only basis after five or 15 years. It is not a huge administrative burden to place on insurance companies to require them to write or, in deference to Senator Quinn, communicate once a year after the maturity of a policy to say it has matured and asking if the holder or family member would like to claim it. This is particularly so in the many cases where the policy holder is deceased.Perhaps the passage of the legislation in 2001 might have jogged people's memories about accounts they held but about which they had forgotten. However, we cannot jog the memories of deceased policyholders and, therefore, we need a more formal and regular notification mechanism than is provided for in the Bill.I assume this came out of negotiations with the industry. The Minister surrendered too much if he accepted that one notification was sufficient. I urge the Minister of State, between now and Report Stage tomorrow, to consider placing a greater burden on companies to communicate with policyholders.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I agree with Senator McDowell. When one considers that the companies have had the benefit of unclaimed funds for a number of years, it is not an undue burden to expect them to try to make contact with policyholders on more than one occasion. While newspaper advertising is a good idea, there are many different daily newspapers. Some years ago, it may have been enough to place an advertisement in two or three of the main newspapers, but, as Senator Quinn pointed out, many people do not buy newspapers. Therefore, we must make extra efforts to try to contact people. Given that companies have the use of funds for a number of years, they should be under more of an obligation to make regular contact with policyholders.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	125	With respect, there is a certain misunderstanding. The minimum requirement is one notification, but it is in the interest of the companies to keep trying to contact policy holders because they are administering the policy and the cost—
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Will the Minister of State say what that means? I am not being difficult, but I genuinely do not understand what "administering the policy" means.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	127	The policy remains as a policy on the company's system so there is a cost factor involved, even though the company cannot reclaim the cost because it must pay over the full amount. Therefore, it is of no benefit to the insurance company.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	128	They are not contacting the owner of the policy.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	129	There is no benefit to insurance companies to retain policies. Companies would be far better off if the holders came forward to claim their policies. For that reason, we have a stipulation that a notification must issue once a year. If one writes to people once a year to tell them they have a dormant account and they take no notice, I do not suppose writing twice a year will make much difference.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The companies will write once and once only. That is the only obligation in the Bill.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I do not see where this cost factor arises. What does administering the policy actually amount to when the policy has matured, they have calculated whatever non-contractual interest they are going to pay and have transferred the money into the fund? It may appear on somebody's computer somewhere but that is surely the end of it. I cannot see how it would be a huge burden on the assurance companies in those circumstances, which would make it in their interests to get shut of a policy early.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Again I agree with Senator McDowell. The Minister said that it would be of benefit to the assurance companies to offload these policies. If that is the case, then surely we need to have more protection for the consumer. If it would be to the benefit of the assurance companies to offload the accounts to the fund which will be established, and if they cut corners and do not try to look up every tree in every part of the country in search of policyholders, then there is a greater need to protect the interests of policyholders. According to what the Minister of State is saying, it would surely make more sense for the assurance companies to do very little and let the money go to the fund rather than make every effort to try to contact people. I believe that is what Senator McDowell is saying, and I support him.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	134	To clarify further the point about the cost to the insurance companies, they may continue to provide some form of insurance cover, and they certainly would have the administrative costs of holding those records and calculations, despite the fact that the policy has been discontinued. The experience has been that people are coming forward as a result of the public advertisements and so on and that it is not necessary to go to the lengths that the Senator suggests. If we impose further costs on the insurance companies, those costs will inevitably be passed on to the consumer.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I will not go on forever about this because it is not a germane or serious issue, but I do not understand how the costs of administering a policy could possibly be that onerous. What insurance do these companies continue to provide for a policy that has been discontinued, to use the Minister of State's words? Do they, out of the goodness of their hearts, decide to continue some insurance—
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	136	There may be life cover.

The life assurance policy in most cases will mature when the individual dies. Where does the continuance of insurance come into play if the individual is dead? The individual is dead, the relative does not claim for five years, so what possible additional costs can there be to the assurance company? What insurance can it possibly continue to provide if the maturing element is complete and the individual is dead?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	138	They may still continue to have to hold records and hold the policy. They are obliged to continue to hold a policy even though it is dormant, and there are costs associated with that.

Is it possible to develop the Bill in some way to allow for notice to be given in a variety of ways, whether by fax, e-mail or whatever, provided of course that there is an acknowledgement or clarity of receipt? I know that the definition section describes communication as including electronic communication.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	142	That point will be dealt with in a later amendment.

In page 12, subsection (1), line 36, to delete "€500" and substitute "€250".I mentioned, when discussing amendment No. 1, that the figure of €500 is used in the Bill. This amendment is designed to question how or why that figure was arrived at. My understanding is that, in similar legislation dealing with dormant bank accounts, a figure of €100 or thereabouts was used. I ask the Minister to explain how and why the €500 figure was arrived at.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Minister for Finance has informed the Dáil that most low value policies are not yet computerised, so that if insurance companies had to personally notify these customers, it would entail a lengthy and substantive trawl of paper records. Considering the value of such policies, this does not seem worthwhile at this time. A balance must be reached between the aim of reuniting people with their money and not placing an undue administrative burden on the institutions, especially as the costs involved will only be passed on to the consumer.The full burden of keeping track of a policy should not lie solely with the institutions, and the individual must also take responsibility. The Department has been negotiating this Bill for some time and the industry has already begun preparing for its onset. Since publication of the Bill, the companies concerned have already been attempting to identify policies valued at or above €500. To lower the threshold below €500 would, I understand, cause significant problems for the industry.There is nothing to prevent the companies from writing to all their policyholders or doing so more than once, which is likely to happen in any case. This year alone, there will be no less than four public advertisements placed regarding this scheme, two by the insurance industry, one on behalf of the banks and building societies and one on behalf of An Post. This should bring the scheme well within the public mindset.The Minister has indicated that once the records relating to low value policies are fully computerised and the backlog of unclaimed policies has been cleared, it might then be appropriate to consider lowering or removing the threshold for personal notifications. This is a matter primarily for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.Regardless of how a policyholder is notified and whenever he or she decides to come forward, the right to reclaim all that is owed is statutorily guaranteed. For those reasons, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. I am somewhat satisfied with part of what he has said. He noted that the Minister envisages the possibility of lowering the threshold in the future.We come back to the financial institutions that will be affected by this. I would imagine that many accounts, particularly older ones, would fall under the €500 threshold, and it is not unreasonable that a threshold should have been used similar to the one that was used for the dormant bank accounts legislation, which was, I believe, around €100. It would have been more appropriate to set a threshold like that.We are revisiting the argument that the financial institutions will be inconvenienced and will have to go to some expense to follow up on all these smaller accounts that are not yet computerised. However, these companies have had the benefit of this money that has lain dormant for however long, and it would not be too much to expect that the threshold would be considerably lower because €500 is a not inconsiderable amount of money. A lower threshold would be more appropriate.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I have no doubt the insurance industry was less than delighted with the Bill and I am sure departmental officials had interesting negotiations with it and that this is the compromise they reached. The underlying principle is very simple – companies are holding money that does not belong to them and whatever the amount might be, it should be transferred to the fund and available to be claimed in future. I would have thought that this principle holds as much for €10 as it does for €10,000 and €100,000.The Minister of State's response about computerisation is difficult to buy. While I can well believe older policies are not computerised, I cannot imagine insurance or assurance companies computerise accounts purely on the basis of value. I imagine they computerise an account when someone takes out a policy. I do not think the Minister of State made up this excuse but it seems fairly lame.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	147	What the Senators have said seems very reasonable. To give an example, one company has approximately 500,000 policies below €500 in value which have not yet been computerised.

To personally notify the account holders would involve a manual trawl of paper records. This would be a huge undertaking and we might never see the money from the accounts and the people concerned might never be notified. One would have thought that all accounts would have been computerised but that is not the case.It might be possible to look at this in the future when it would be a matter for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. While I know this is no assurance, I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister and inform him of the Senators' views. It is not possible to accept the amendment as of now.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I thank the Minister of State for his very informative response. It is horrific that one company could hold 500,000 policies with values of less than €500. Taken to its extreme, the company could hold up to €250 million that does not come within the scope of this Bill. It is hardly surprising that many of the unclaimed policies are small as they are the ones most likely to be forgotten about. If companies take money from people, they surely have a minimum obligation. The minimum obligation under the Bill is to pay the money but if it is not claimed, it should be transferred to the NTMA.The Minister of State has given a flavour of the potential value of small policies and more strength to the argument of those proposing the amendment.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I agree with Senator McDowell. The Minister of State mentioned a company which holds 500,000 small policies, a staggering amount. The purpose of asking questions is to ensure the money goes back to its rightful owners. While I accept that the Minister of State will speak to the Minister concerned, we require something more concrete.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The Minister of State has revealed a fascinating piece of information – I had no idea we were talking about this amount of money. We do not know how much money is involved but 500,000 policies of less than €500 in value gives us some idea of the challenge facing us. I accept the Minister of State's view on the prohibitive costs of writing to 500,000 people about what could be €20 or €50 policies. Nonetheless, we must look at this matter again. I would be pleased to know it is not closed and that no company is sitting on a large amount of money that is outside the scope of the Bill. This must be considered again. Perhaps the solution is to reduce the €500 limit to €250 as suggested by Senator Phelan's amendment.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Some of us are old enough to remember the insurance agents who called bringing only paper files. When insurance agents call to a customer now, they bring a laptop and everything is computerised from the outset. It is somewhat surprising to learn that one company has 500,000 small policies but it does not follow that there is €500 in each of those; some of them could be so low as to not be worth dealing with. I do not know what average we should take.The difficulty lies with old policies where the details are only available in paper records. While it is a matter for the companies, I hope they will computerise all the policies they hold as this would make it much easier to contact policyholders.While I do not want to give an assurance, I will speak to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs about revisiting this mattere in the future. It is a question of striking a balance between the company and the customer. While my verbal assurance will not be written into the Bill, I tell the House in all sincerity that I will speak to the Minister about this. We have established the principle and perhaps should prevail on companies to computerise all their accounts. While the points the Senators have made are very sensible, I would appreciate if we could deal with the matter now and perhaps revisit it in the future.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	154	If the Minister of State has the information available to him, perhaps he will let us know how many extant policies there are? I assume he does not have information for each company but can he tell us how many policies above €500 in value the company mentioned has? This might give us some sense of where we are drawing the line.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I had information for only one company. Companies do not have this information because they will not deal with it until legislation is passed. It could be some time before we become aware of it. If one company has 500,000 policies, it is likely there are millions.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	156	These companies are trying to have it every which way, which is hardly surprising because that is their business. They tell us that they can guestimate the number of policies with proceeds of under €500, to which this does not apply, but they will not have an estimate of the number of other policies with higher proceeds until such time as the Act comes into play. What they are really saying is that it is too much trouble. It may cause a little bit of trouble for them. Perhaps it is a little like Ryanair in that they are used to pocketing money for a service they did not provide or maybe it is factored into their profits on the assumption that nobody would collect this money. I assume that is part of the argument in this regard. We are here to represent the consumers and it for us to push them into an administrative effort, even it costs them a few euro.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I move amendment No. 4a:In page 12, subsection (1), line 46, after "State" to insert ", also by electronic means".This is a simple amendment to the reference in the Bill to the publication of notice which states "shall publish or cause to have published a notice in 2 or more daily newspapers circulating in the State and in Iris Oifigiúil”. My amendment adds the words “also by electronic means”. I could almost stop at this stage because I am so sure the amendment will be accepted.The Minister of State said on Second Stage:Insurance undertakings must, for the sake of all other customers affected by the scheme, place annual notices in two or more national newspapers. These annual advertisements, the first of which is scheduled to take place in March, will generate public awareness of the scheme.This is great because the Minister of State is trying to create public awareness of the scheme. It is important because the State is not an impartial observer in that it stands to benefit if those to whom this money is due are not found. Therefore, it is not just a question of placing notices in two newspapers to inform people and see if someone turns up. We must go out of our way to encourage people to look.The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, in responding to the previous amendment, spoke of the old days when insurance salesmen visited houses armed with sheaves of paper on which they wrote people's details. As a result, up to 500,000 policies are still on paper. He contrasted that with the modern salesman who comes equipped with a laptop and a modern way of doing things. Despite this, we still insist on this old fashioned way of informing members of the public of the issue of unclaimed policies by placing notices in Iris Oifigiúil and two newspapers. This presumes everyone either buys or reads these publications. There are many newspapers in circulation in Ireland, some of which are not Irish. Some people who read tabloids would never be likely to come across the notices if they were placed in the publications mentioned.There is, however, a simple, easy and cost-effective way of communicating this information, namely, on the websites of insurance companies. We must ensure this notice regarding unclaimed policies is included on the website of each insurance company. All such undertakings have websites which contain many details, such as address and telephone number, and which should include the notice in question. Using electronic means of communication is an essential part of modern living. I do not know if the wording used in the amendment is correct, but I believe it to be.As I said this morning, it is almost like somebody in the 16th century proposing the employment of the town crier to go around and tell people, because they did not really believe the printing press would work. If the State existed in the 1890s this kind of legislation would have proposed publicising in two newspapers circulating in the State. We are not in the 1900s but in 2003 and we are using the same sort of words.I urge the Minister to take into account that when trying to seek out claimants we should make sure information is readily available. Someone living a long way from Dublin who needs to be contacted can simply look at the website to see this information. The alternative is they have to write if they hope to be contacted some way or another. Using Iris Oifigiúil or two newspapers circulating in the State is like something that would have happened 100 years ago. Let us assume there is no cost to this. Every insurance undertaking has a website and it would be a simple matter to include this information there. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.

In my short time here he has been very consistent on the issue of communication via the most up-to-date technology. He has outlined the case very well. As the facilities are now available and more people are computer literate in the technological age, his amendment is entirely appropriate. I ask the Minister to accept it.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. The most important thing Senator Quinn said was that the State will benefit if people do not see they are on one of these lists. We have to make absolutely sure it is available on the Internet because that is the means by which so many people seek information now. The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, really made the case for Senator Quinn when he said that nowadays people are using a computer when they think about life assurance policies.I can remember people such as he described before. Many people tried to get a widow in the village where I lived to take out life assurance so that she had some sort of income. I do not know what happened to her filing system when she died. Now we have to make sure everything is published in a way that can be looked up by most modern people. Some of these will be insurance policies taken out years ago and much younger people will be looking them up, either for relatives or for friends who perhaps do not have access to the Internet.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I receive a huge amount of interesting stuff in my pigeonhole by virtue of the coincidence of names with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I endorse the amendment; it makes common sense. It has one very obvious advantage. A notice in a newspaper appears on one day and is gone, whereas a notice posted on a website is there constantly and is obviously more accessible to people who have the use of PCs.Later in the section there is a requirement that there be a similar notice dealing with unclaimed policies in a prominent position in all brochures. Perhaps that might be extended to all promotional material relating to life assurance policies.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I take the point made by the Senators.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	163	The Minister for Finance is convinced, as I am, that the best way to bring the scheme to the attention of the public at large is through the mechanisms provided in the Bill. Again I reiterate the notices will be in the national daily newspapers and they will also be prominently displayed in all public offices of banks, building societies, An Post, life assurance companies, etc.I accept the Senator's point about the use of electronic communications in the age in which we live, but we must remember we are talking about a slightly different era than our modern communications era. These are policies that have lain unclaimed for at least five years and in most cases substantially longer. These policies would have been taken out some considerable time before that. It would be reasonable to assume the contact details given to the life assurance companies did not include e-mail or website addresses. A vast number of these policies date back to the turn of the century.

It would not be possible, even if desirable, for the life assurance companies to notify customers in this way. The Bill merely tries to set down the minimum requirements in terms of notifying customers. In any case the important point made by the Minister for Finance is that the sole responsibility for keeping track of records does not and should not lie with the institutions. It is for the individuals themselves to look after their own property. Nevertheless, as has been stated on numerous occasions, it is in the interest of the companies to make every effort to contact policyholders by whatever means, as they will lose the underlying funds if they fail the task.As mentioned on Second Stage, information is available on various Government and bank websites including that of the Irish Bankers' Federation and it will soon be on the website of the Irish Insurance Federation. The maximum use is being made of electronic media and, as I assured the Senator this morning, the Minister is considering the use of electronic media in terms of future developments. Despite Senator Quinn's charm and powers of persuasion, I do not intend to accept his amendment.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I thank the Minister for his kind words. I have tabled similar amendments on a number of occasions and they were generally accepted because it had been omitted in the first place.I think the Minister may be mistaking section 8 for section 9. Section 8 deals with the notification of the customers – the Minister referred to e-mail. Clearly I did not table an amendment to that section because I recognise exactly the point he has just made. I also did not table an amendment to section 12, which deals with a register. I originally thought of doing so, as I thought a register should be available, but I realised there were issues of confidentiality and privacy.This section is totally different and I disagree with the Minister for Finance. The Minister of State has just said that the Minister for Finance is of the opinion that the best way to contact them is to omit putting the information on the website. That is impossible. That is not the best way. The Bill proposes prominently displaying this in places like post offices and banks. However, here is a simple cost effective way that is available to everybody who has a computer.The Minister made a real error when he talked about a slightly different era when people took these policies out 100, 80 or 50 years ago. However, the amendment does not suggest notifying them, but rather telling them that this exists. The section deals with publication of notice and states:Where an unclaimed policy is held at an insurance undertaking . the insurance undertaking shall publish or cause to have published a notice in two or more daily newspapers circulating in the State and in Iris Oifigiúil.This is an effort to tell people this scheme exists.We are not talking about insurance companies being impartial in this. I accept the Minister's point that insurance companies will be happy if people find the notice as otherwise the State receives the money in the accounts. I am talking about the State not being impartial. As the State stands to receive the money, it is in its interest that as few people as possible are informed. I find it difficult to accept the Minister of State's refusal to accept the rational case for this amendment. I am concerned that he is not listening and I urge him to reconsider.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I support Senator Quinn. His case is transparently a good one. My understanding of the wording of the amendment is that the Senator is not suggesting we substitute the requirement to place the notice in the newspapers, but that we supplement it. One could specify that the provision would only apply in the event that insurance companies have websites. Clearly, however, they already do.The Minister for Finance has no grounds for seriously objecting to obliging insurance companies which maintain websites to make available this information. I am aware of his propensity not to accept amendments, but even he, I suspect, would be willing to accept this one. I urge the Minister of State to discuss the matter with the Minister overnight.

I want to know if he intends to maintain his position that the section, as framed, is a fait accompli. The proposal is so rational and sensible that I have difficulty comprehending his insistence on rejecting it. I am sure he is under instruction from the Minister for Finance not to accept any amendments.It seems likely that failure to include publication on a website, in addition to two newspapers and Iris Oifigiúil, was an oversight. I am sure if the Minister of State asked the Minister to consider this sensible proposal, we would find it accepted on Report Stage.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I have not been commanded by the Minister for Finance not to accept amendments. That is not his style. If electronic media would improve communication with the audience the Senator is trying to reach, there would be a case for reconsidering the matter. This is not, however, the case. The audience in question is more likely to receive the communication through the mechanisms laid down in the Bill. A considerable effort is already being made to use electronic media through, for example, the various Departments, including the websites of the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs and the new Department for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the Irish Banking Federation, the various banks and the Irish Insurance Federation which is about to come on-line. The information will be available through a range of websites.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	180	We have arrived at the real issue, namely, the contention that the audience in question is not computer literate and consists of old people, like myself, who will not look at the website. Has the Minister of State considered what happened in the context of the overseas accounts, bogus or otherwise?How often have we read in the newspaper about children, grandchildren or nieces and nephews trying to attend to these matters on behalf of people who are not in a position to do so themselves? Some members of the target audience will have difficulty remembering the company with which they hold policies. It is these people who will ask younger relatives to find out on their behalf. While we can rule out the possibility that they will look up Iris Oifigiúil , at least they will be able to persuade others to use the Internet to try to find the information they require. The nature of the audience is the reason we need to have the information notified on websites.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	181	The information is on several Government websites.

The Minister of State is wrong about the audience. It is precisely due to its nature that information must be published on a specific website.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The Senator makes a fair point in that it is possible that the children or grandchildren of people overseas, for example in the United States, may wish to find further information. The natural place to seek such information would be a departmental website or a bank or insurance website. I am informed by my officials that a significant number of inquiries about this scheme and the dormant accounts scheme have already been made on the various websites of the Department of Finance and those of other Departments. From a practical point of view, the proposal would have no advantages.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I promise I will conclude soon. I disagree with almost everything the Minister of State has said. We are passing legislation for the future, not just a few years. I hope most legislation passed by the Houses will endure for decades and there will be no need to return to it. As I stated, the Minister of State's position is akin to someone in the 16th century expressing doubt that the printing press would catch on.On the issue of cost, the proposal does not entail a cost as every insurance company already has a website. The amendment could be changed and the condition added that notification must be included, provided the company in question has a website. The Internet is the cheapest form of public information.I have another concern. Since I started tabling amendments such as this one a few years ago, I have identified some Departments which are very au fait with modern communications and others which lag behind and do not appear to realise the need for change. The Department of Finance and several others have been good at using these communications.The target audience does not necessarily consist of people who took out an insurance policy 20, 30 or 50 years ago. It is much more likely that they will be the sons or daughters of such people who have been asked to seek information about the scheme. The people concerned will not become aware of the scheme unless they happen to buy the newspaper in which notification is published on the day of publication. For example, people living in the Cork area, who tend to read the Irish Examiner, will never become aware of the scheme unless the notice appears in that newspaper.I am disappointed by the Minister of State's response. If he indicated a willingness to think over the matter overnight and introduce an amendment on Report Stage, I would considered withdrawing my amendment.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	188	What does the Senator want to appear on the website which does not appear on other websites?

I want to ensure that the notice to be published at certain intervals is also published by electronic means, in other words, on the website of the undertaking in question. I cannot believe the Minister of State will not accept the amendment.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	190	While the Minister of State consults his official, let me make a slightly different argument. Am I correct in saying that, in respect of the section to which we have just agreed, section 7, it would be open to the Minister in any event to effectively vary, by regulation, the way in which the news can be given? Effectively, he or she could amend the legislation and provide for the amendment being argued for by Senator Quinn. We do not yet know what the information will be because the information contained in the notice is to be in what the Bill calls the prescribed form, which we do not have because that is a matter for regulations but I assume they will set out the procedure that somebody has to follow in order to claim the money due to him or her.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	191	If that is all the Senator requires, that is already on the websites.

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The section refers to the notice being in the prescribed form. What does the Minister of State believe will be required by virtue of that formulation?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	193	It is set out in the various newspapers and—
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	194	It does not state that. Obviously, we can guess what would be involved because I presume it will entail the procedure somebody would have to follow but it states the notice shall be in the prescribed form or in a form which should contain certain information, etc. I assume Senator Quinn is saying there should be a notice on the website similar to what would appear in the newspapers.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	195	What name is the Senator suggesting for the website?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	196	There is a misunderstanding. The notice, in whatever form, will appear in two newspapers. I am saying it should also appear on the website of the individual insurance undertakings. Every insurance undertaking has a website. It would cost nothing to add this information. We do not know what it is but a few extra lines could appear on the website at no extra cost, and it would be the same as that in the local newspapers. It would be a better way of communicating. It is in the State's interest to avoid claims because it will have more money to give to worthy causes. That is the reason I want to encourage the State to ensure—
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	197	The information will be on the various Government websites.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	199	Yes. I referred to Irish Insurance Federation websites. It has been clarified that the insurance companies are happy to put the information on their websites. The Department's website is already receiving questions on the matter. In respect of the prescribed information, that will be general information about the insurance companies involved, who to contact and general details about the scheme. In addition, there is a question and answer section on the Department of Finance website which will give a fuller understanding of the scheme, where people can go, what they should do and so on. The issue is being adequately dealt with. The only point that might be made is that much more information could be put on a website. That is what I though the Senator wanted but, as I said this morning, that would pose its own difficulties.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I will conclude with this point. Why are we going to the trouble of passing legislation which states this information must be placed in two newspapers circulating in the State? The reason we are doing so is to inform people of the scheme. We are simply saying the information should also be included in the website of each of the undertakings. I cannot believe the Department of Finance wants to include the information only in two newspapers and Iris Oifigiúil in the belief that that will solve the problem.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 13, subsection 3(b), line 11, after “policies” to insert “and the number of such policies”.The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, stated earlier that one of the financial institutions holds 500,000 policies under the value of €500. In light of that startling figure it would be appropriate that any advertisement published would contain the number of unclaimed life assurance policies. If a figure of the magnitude of 500,000 policies for one company is mentioned – this adds up to a vast number when one considers all the companies involved – many people would investigate the possibility of an outstanding policy. It is for that reason that I propose the amendment.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	202	It would probably not be possible for the undertakings to publish on the day of the public notice the number of unclaimed policies they hold. Section 9(1) does not require the companies to have identified all unclaimed policies by that date. Each company will merely have to establish by that date, usually the first weekday in October in each year, that it holds at least one such policy. If any such policy meets the criteria of section 9(1), where a policy is below €500 and is deemed non-correspondent, and the undertaking has previously tried unsuccessfully to make contact with the policyholder, then the undertaking must place a public notice in relation to those policies. In each case there seems to be little value in publishing the detailed information. It is enough that the public be made aware that all or most of the life assurance undertakings hold unclaimed policies. For those reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	203	There is some merit in the amendment, although we need not require insurance companies to have precise numbers. If a notice appeared stating there are 500,000 unclaimed policies, rather than just a formal statutory notice, ancillary publicity from radio or television would result. While I accept that there will not be a precise number by October this year, the undertakings will have a clear idea by next year. In three or four years they should be in a position to give us that information earlier. A general broad indication would attract more interest.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	204	That is the reason for the amendment. We often do not pay too much attention to newspaper advertisements, but including an estimate would cause people to take more interest. They would then find out if they had an unclaimed policy themselves.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The problem is that companies may not be in a position to be accurate about the number of unclaimed policies they hold on the date in question. If they gave out the wrong number of policies it would create serious difficulties. If, at a later stage, companies want to indicate the numbers of policies they have that is fine. However, inserting a provision into the Bill that they must state the exact number they have on the first weekday in October each year would be impossible.

In page 13, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following new paragraph:"(f) that–(i) a Central Database of the name and date of birth of unclaimed policies is jointly operated by the NTMA and institutions covered by this Act so that a member of the public can check the possibility that they are the holder of an unclaimed policy or have an entitlement to its proceeds, by furnishing photographic evidence of identity and the Birth Certificate of the possible policy holder, and(ii) the operator of the Central Database, on receipt of this evidence, will  arrange for any institution holding an unclaimed policy in that name to make contact with persons in respect of whom there is prima facie evidence that they are entitled to the proceeds of an unclaimed policy, in order to establish if he or she is entitled to any monies;”.Amendment No. 6 and some of the subsequent amendments seek to establish a central database of names and dates of birth that would be managed by the NTMA, in conjunction with the financial institutions, to provide a list so that people can determine more easily if they are holders of unclaimed policies or are the next of kin of deceased holders of such policies.On Committee Stage in the Dáil, questions were asked about the privacy implications of the idea but a central database operated in a restricted manner by the NTMA would not affect people's privacy. It would make it easier for people to establish if they are policyholders. That will be the major problem with this legislation and if the Minister of State took some of these amendments on board, it should resolve it.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	209	These are the most important amendments that we have discussed so far. The Minister indicated willingness to consider the idea when he dealt with the matter in the Dáil. Simplicity is the aim behind them. If someone wants to claim a policy, there should be one point of contact – one phone number or website – where they can get information. At present, that does not apply.The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, painted an interesting picture of huge numbers of papers gathering dust for decades and did not give the impression that they were collated in an accessible and user-friendly fashion. It would be desirable that the obligation would rest with the NTMA and the companies and that there would be a central database where people could get the information they require. At present, a person would have to contact each insurance company. Some of those companies might not be based in Ireland and only deal through branches here. Some of them, such as the one mentioned earlier, may not be as active in Ireland now as they were 20 or 30 years ago and perhaps their customer service is not as good as it was then.It is in everybody's interest – and certainly in the interest of the consumers – that a central database be maintained. I assume the Minister of State is about to say we should not be providing for this in the Bill and I appreciate that it would take some time to put in place. However, I believe he and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, should take the opportunity to send a clear message to the insurance industry and, indeed, to the NTMA because, once the State has the money, there is some responsibility on us to account for where it came from. We should send a message that we expect such a database to be put in place within a few years.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Minister for Finance has already stated that if such a database was properly constructed and managed, this might further assist members of the public in tracing dormant moneys. However, there are, as I said earlier, legal complexities and obstacles to be surmounted in order to proceed with the proposal and, accordingly, it is not a matter that can be countenanced in the current Bill. There is the matter of a constitutional right to privacy, which is enjoyed by all. Nevertheless, there is merit in the proposal and the Minister for Finance has asked his officials to examine the matter further and to discuss the pros and cons of the proposal with the industry and the Office of the Attorney General. As the Minister sees it, centralising large volumes of personal data would not only have to be legally permissible but also cost effective and user friendly to warrant pursuing the exercise.The House can be assured that the matter is still under consideration as a near term objective and may well be brought into being within a few years, as the Senator has suggested. For the moment, however, it would not be practical to include it in the current Bill. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment now.

#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	214	I am somewhat reassured by the Minister of State's statement that the Minister for Finance is considering the matter. However, there is still rather loose terminology as to what consideration is really being given. In terms of cost effectiveness, to which the Minister of State referred in his reply, I believe it would be quite cost effective and very easily accessible to people. That has to be the main objective and failure to achieve it is the main problem which could befall this Bill. We have to try to ensure that people can easily get access to information as to whether they are holders of relevant policies. The centralisation of detailed information should be looked at. I accept that it may be difficult to include that in this Bill but I would like a more definite assurance that serious thought is being given to it by the Department of Finance. It would be a worthwhile mechanism for people to establish whether they have policies to which this Bill relates.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I accept that, in practical terms, this would take a little time to put in place but I believe the officials are over emphasising the issue of legal and constitutional difficulties. I do not see a need for substantial change in the way one currently claims under a policy – I assume that is by filling in a form and providing certain information, including a policy number. Obviously, a claimant should be required to provide certain basic information and, based on that, the central database would be used to establish whether there was a policy to which he or she might be entitled. What would take time, obviously, is putting the database together.Subject to correction by the Minister of State, I understand there is no requirement under the Bill for insurance companies to give the NTMA details of the individual policyholders or the people they think might be entitled to the money. They are simply required to give the totals to the NTMA, retaining the details on the register within the insurance companies.I suggest the way to start is that, when money is handed over to the fund, the NTMA should also be given details of the policy owners so that, over time, it would build up a database of, at least, the owners of the policies from which funds have been transferred to the agency. Over time – perhaps a relatively short time – one could build up the database and the necessary information to respond to queries.I believe legal and constitutional difficulties would arise only if people had access to information concerning other people's policies. As matters now stand, if one contacts an insurance company one does not have access to the total number of policyholders they might have; one will only be told whether one has an interest in a policy. I do not see that that would necessarily have to change. I accept there would be a problem in giving access to a register but all we require is that one agency has enough information available to it to respond to queries from members of the public.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The Department is taking the matter seriously and has referred it to the Attorney General. I assure the Senator that it is being actively looked at by the Department.I do not quite understand Senator McDowell's point. It is a complex issue and there are other negative aspects in relation to a central database, such as the possibility of fraud and so on. It is a complex issue which has to be looked at carefully. The legal implications are not as simple as the Senator has indicated and that is why it is being considered by the Attorney General and will be further considered by the Minister, perhaps, as the Senator has suggested, with a view to its being introduced after a number of years if it is found that the legal complexities can be overcome.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	217	My difficulty is that I do not understand what the legal complexities are, even in very broad outline. As I see it, if somebody who believes he or she may be entitled to benefit under a policy contacts an agency which has a database of information, that database is not available to them in total but they should be entitled to a simple "Yes" or "No". I do not see where any legal complexity arises.

In page 18, subsection (3)(a), line 22, after “undertaking” to insert “in accord with regulations set by the Minister”.I will be brief because I know you are anxious about the time, a Chathaoirligh. The wording in this subsection is too loose and the object of the amendment is to tighten it up. The subsection states "subject to any charges or deductions that may be made by the insurance undertaking", and the amendment would add the words, "in accord with the regulations set by the Minister". It is just to tighten up the controls on possible corner-cutting by financial institutions which may be concerned with this.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Section 15 of the Bill provides that the moneys to be paid to a valid claimant are to be net of any charges or deductions that may be made by the insurance undertaking, in other words, the charges that comply with the normal legal practice for insurance undertakings in these circumstances. As such, these charges and deductions take account of taxes and administrative charges which the undertaking are legally entitled or, indeed, obliged to recoup from the proceeds of a policy that has been encashed. It would be inappropriate for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make regulations in relation to such taxes as they related to revenue matters or the contractual relationship between the insurance undertaking and its client. In any case, the basis for these charges is the policy contract. The Minister for Finance has long held that these schemes should interfere as little as possible with the rights of customers and that is what both the relevant pieces of legislation have tried to adhere to. For that reason I do not propose to accept the Senator's amendment.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I have a question for the Minister of State about something which I genuinely do not understand. The Bill, and this section in particular, gives the power to the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs to make what are effectively financial regulations. I understand that he is the Minister responsible for the disbursement of the fund at the other end of the process and that is fair enough, but it seems to me that the making of the regulations governing how the insurance companies deal with these matters is, or properly should be, a matter either for the regulator when established or for the Minister for Finance. I really do not see that the Minister disbursing the fund should make the regulations.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	230	All I simply said was that it would be inappropriate for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make regulations in relation to the taxes and administrative charges.

The Bill generally gives the power to the Minister for Gaeltacht, Community and Rural Affairs to make the regulations in relation to policies.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	232	It is simply the policy for disbursement.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I understand that, but in several sections it also gives the power to the Minister to make regulations in relation to how life assurance policies are dealt with, which is properly a life assurance matter for the independent regulator or for the Minister for Finance. I know it requires the consent of the Minister for Finance but I am quite surprised that the Department of Finance, which is the sponsoring Department, has assented to it. It seems strange that the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs should be the primary Minister in terms of making those regulations.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	234	It is only for the actual disbursement of the funds. As I said, he has no involvement in administrative or taxation matters. The Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs has the policy responsibility for the disbursement of the funds which will be done under his agency.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Although it is not a particularly germane matter, section 7 states:The Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, having regard to the purposes specified in subsection (3), following consultation with the regulatory authority and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, may make regulations providing for the application of this Act and instruments made under this Act, with and subject to any modifications that may be specified in the regulations, to policies . that are issued to such class or classes of person .”.It gives a much broader power to the Minister to make regulations about the very application of this Act. For example, according to my reading of it, the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs can change the €500 limit in terms of the policy to which it applies. Why is it that particular Minister? It is a policy decision made somewhere in the Department.

In page 19, subsection (2), between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following new paragraph:"(f) the making of all reasonable efforts to identify unclaimed policies.”.Section 17(2) states:Each insurance undertaking shall furnish a certificate of compliance to the regulatory authority, not later than one month after the end of each financial year, in the form and manner that the regulatory authority may specify, stating, if this is the case, that the insurance undertaking has complied with this Act in respect of the following:It lists three or four areas. This amendment adds an additional item to that list, which is, that they have made every reasonable effort to identify unclaimed policies.It is a reasonable, if not substantial, amendment which is fundamentally important to the object of the legislation. It is a basic amendment which will not damage the legislation in any way. I would urge the Minister of State to accept it.

The agriculture order of merit was created by royal decree on 3 December 1905. The award is a grand cross and only four people from outside Spain have received it, which is the reason I mention it this evening. It was presented to the director general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation in 1996, to the German Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in 1993 and to the French Minister for Agriculture in 2001. I also congratulate the Minister on having been presented a few months ago with the Legion of Honour from the French Government. It was signed by the President of France.That is recognition by two other member states of the quality of our Minister. I hope he will be appreciated in this country, but people sometimes do not get the recognition they deserve in their own homeland. Member states of the EU have accorded recognition to the Minister's unique qualities and we congratulate him on that.I must express a degree of disappointment that Fine Gael has proposed an amendment to the motion, although it was to be expected. That is the party's prerogative. Social partnership is a must for farmers, who have been involved in it since its inception in 1987. No partnership pillar has benefited more from participation in that process than farming. It gives the farming bodies a unique opportunity to participate in a meaningful way in the democratic process. They have a formal partnership mechanism through which they can express their views and negotiate an agreed plan for the next two years. To withdraw from this process would be nothing short of folly on the part of the farm organisations.There are two serious questions that farm leaders must address in the context of their participation in the social partnership agreement now on offer. First, is it in the best interests of their membership to reject the opportunity to participate in the formulation and implementation of policies which affect not only farmers but the general economy? Second, through what other forum will they have an opportunity to defend their rights and interests and protect the benefits they receive under the CAP and other wide-ranging international agreements under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation?I wish to remind farmers of some fundamental developments in Irish farming since 1987. At that time farmers depended solely on the goodwill of meat factory owners for a reasonable income. It was not satisfactory that the incomes of livestock farmers should be dictated by a small group of meat factory owners. In some cases that is still happening. However, at least direct payments are paid directly to the farmers.The Fine Gael record in looking after farmers' interests has always been abysmal, never more so than under the coalition Government of 1982-7. Not alone did that Government double the national debt and raise interest, income tax and inflation rates to their highest levels ever, it did nothing for the agriculture sector which was being strangled by these high interest and inflation rates. Fine Gael could never be accused of any economic innovation or of negotiating a good deal for Irish farmers in Brussels or anywhere else.Contrast that with the imaginative and progressive Fianna Fáil approach. Two of the innovators of the new national partnership process in 1987 turned their minds to the long overdue reform of the CAP in 1989. The then Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, and the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, negotiated and put the most fundamental reform of the CAP in place. These negotiations were in the face of stern opposition from intensive farmer groups across the EU. The CAP reforms came into effect in 1992. They involved transferring payments away from the meat companies and paying price supports directly to farmers. The system was designed to reward the extensive type of farming systems practised in Ireland and was less favourable to the intensive systems practised in some member states.At the time certain interests in farming organisations vehemently opposed these reforms. They have learnt their lesson and are now among the staunchest defenders of the direct payments system. While they ponder whether to join the current social partnership process, I ask them seriously to reflect on where their best interests lie. The choice is theirs. One way or another this Government is going to continue the economic development and expansion of the economy. The Minister will maintain and, indeed, improve his impeccable record of looking after farmers and defending their interests. I ask farm leaders to remember that when the Commission tried to dismantle the 1992 CAP reforms in the Agenda 2000 negotiations the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, was again on hand to defend our farmers' interests and negotiated enhanced payments for them. The package of measures he negotiated brought direct payment rates to record levels. As a result, Irish farmers are today paid in excess of €1.6 billion annually through the Department by way of income supports. This is an important and increasing element of farmers' annual income.I will remind farm leaders and Fine Gael what this Minister and the Government have done for farmers in recent times. First, I will outline the Minister's main achievements. He mobilised the resources of the State to fight the foot and mouth disease threat, which could have devastated Irish agriculture and the economy. He put into immediate effect the cattle destruction market support schemes, involving the use of substantial Exchequer resources, to support the beef sector and producer prices during the BSE crisis. These schemes cost in excess of €400 million. He adopted a hands on approach to re-opening markets for agricultural produce, involving the full deployment of political, diplomatic and technical resources.The Minister developed and implemented, at considerable expense to the taxpayer, traceability systems for cattle, sheep and pigs to provide state of the art food safety guarantees for consumers of Irish products and provide a marketing edge in increasingly competitive markets. He put in place one of the most efficient systems in the EU for payment of direct income payments to farmers, with the vast bulk of cheques now issuing on the first day allowed under EU regulations. No other member state administration matches this level of service.The Minister negotiated, against all the odds, what has been universally acknowledged as a most favourable outcome for Irish farmers in the Agenda 2000 CAP reform. He copperfastened the Agenda 2000 gains in the recent Brussels summit decision on the future financing of the CAP, securing direct payments to 2013. He successfully defended export refunds in the WTO negotiations at Doha, is providing €2.8 billion in public expenditure to support the agriculture sector in 2003, of which €1.6 billion will be paid directly to farmers, and he has continued to allocate substantial Exchequer resources to control animal diseases in the national herd.In order to address the difficulties faced by farmers arising from the bad weather, the Minister obtained EU agreement on a number of occasions to strengthen significantly market supports for dairy products; refunds for skimmed milk powder increased on six occasions and casein aid increased by a total of 80%. He secured EU agreement to allow the use of set-aside land for grazing and fodder and negotiated the lifting of the Russian county ban on beef exports, which was a huge international vote of confidence in the way Ireland handles BSE. The Minister further obtained EU agreement to allow an increase of up to 30% in beef export refunds. He took many other measures in the past year to ensure that Irish farming, despite a difficult year, would continue to survive, expand and thrive.I assure the Minister of our full support of his staunch defence of the direct support arrangements in the current mid-term review negotiations. However, a cause of concern is that recent data indicate that 82% of farmers receiving direct payments get 43% of the payments, averaging €3,300 per farmer, while the remaining 18% received 57% of the total, averaging €20,000 per farmer. The top 10% of farmers took an average of €27,200 per farmer. Anything that can be done by way of front-loading these payments in favour of smaller farmers would be most welcome.Farm leaders would be best employed sitting down with the Minister to devise strategies to meet the robust challenges ahead. The most meaningful way to show a united front to Commissioner Fischler is as committed participants in a new partnership programme. We have the most successful Minister for Agriculture and Food ever to negotiate at EU level on behalf of farmers. Let us give him our staunchest support in the major challenges he now faces – the mid-term review of the CAP and the WTO negotiations. We have a great Minister – nobody knows better the ropes of Europe or the WTO negotiations.I put it to all Members of the House that, across party lines, we should support the Minister in the interests of a thriving Irish agriculture sector. If we do that, we will have done a good evening's work. I trust that the Minister will take our hope and the hopes of Irish agriculture on his shoulders. God speed him.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I second the motion.Senators will be aware that the Irish economy is heavily reliant on our indigenous food industry. That our food industry is dependent on markets abroad is even more startlingly evident. We are self-sufficient in all of the major commodities. For example, we are over 1,000% self-sufficient in beef and almost 1,000% in butter. We must be able to market our produce abroad, particularly into an enlarged Europe, if we are to have sustainable agriculture on this island. This is a real challenge that cannot be met by the Government alone but must be confronted by all sectors of the agriculture industry at every level.For its part, the Government has put in place a comprehensive strategy for the development of agriculture and the food industry over the coming decade. The core aim of this strategy is to ensure that the industry contributes, to the maximum extent possible, to continued economic and social development for our people, especially the farmers – our primary producers. The Government's aim is to assist the industry in its efforts to improve competitiveness and innovative capability and enable it to compete successfully in an increasingly competitive and fast-moving environment.We must remain focused on the serious challenges posed by the current CAP reform proposals and the WTO negotiations. The Minister for Agriculture and Food put Ireland's initial position on CAP reform in clear terms to Commissioner Fischler last week. He has a proven track record in achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland in such negotiations. Most important of all, we must not forget that we are now facing into the most fundamental review of the CAP to date. This is a major challenge which has the capacity to change the whole face of Irish farming. The Commission proposals for the mid-term review of the Agenda 2000 agreement are formulated with a view to meeting the threat in the WTO as well as the increasingly vocal requirements of consumers for safer food and a better physical environment.Our farm leaders must now focus on the threat to the entire framework within which farmers will produce and sell their products over the next ten to 20 years. They must row in behind us and the Minister in the defence of existing CAP support arrangements. For good reasons farmers in many countries, including EU member states, are protected to varying degrees from the full rigours of the marketplace and the basic economic laws of supply and demand. In the face of this, countries with little or no such support for their farmers consider that farmers in countries with higher levels of support are trading with unfair advantages on world markets. They are seeking, in the current WTO negotiations, to eliminate what they consider to be these unfair advantages. The supports provided by the European Union for their farmers are the prime target and European and Irish agriculture has to prepare a robust defence of the CAP in those negotiations.The threats in the WTO and to the Commission's proposals are serious challenges. They transcend any arguments or dissatisfaction that the farm organisations may have with the social partnership talks. Farm leaders would be best employed sitting down with us and the Minister to devise strategies to meet the robust challenges ahead. The most meaningful way of showing a united front to Commissioner Fischler is as a committed participant in a new partnership programme.Fianna Fáil has a vision and a long-term strategy for agriculture that will guide our approach to the major challenges ahead – the mid-term review of the CAP and the WTO negotiations.

The system of modulation proposed by the European Commission would reduce the direct payment to these farmers who may only receive over €5,000 in payments. Modulation could not be justified in these circumstances. Providing funding for rural development at the expense of farm incomes, which have always been the mainstay of rural economies, is a contradiction.Modulation would have a different effect on different farming sectors. Sectors that do not depend as heavily on direct payment would not suffer the same adverse effects as beef and sheep markets. The effects of modulation would be disproportionate in Ireland and I am glad the Minister made this clear to the Council of Ministers.It is clear that Irish agriculture is facing immense changes and challenges over the next few years. The Government can be relied upon to remain totally committed to agriculture and to sustain its major role in this economy, notwithstanding the changed scenario which we are likely to face in the years ahead. Despite all the problems, I am optimistic for the future of Irish agriculture. We have some of the best farmers in the world. We produce quality stock and food in a unique natural environment. We continue to export 90% of all of our agricultural produce into a growing world population.The Government will continue to support agriculture, our most important indigenous industry, and with the necessary EU supports will continue to sustain the dedicated farmers of Ireland. On behalf of the House, we wish to extend our best wishes to the Minister in his negotiations at a crucial time for this country.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:"Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to recognise the difficulties in Agriculture and Food and calls on it to take some measures to re-establish confidence in the sector."Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad arís.The Minister for Agriculture and Food's colleagues have attempted to deflect attention away from the crisis that is facing agriculture at present, a crisis that is totally of the Government's making. Farming, whether on a full-time or part-time basis, must not be allowed to become a countryside maintenance activity, as appears to be happening under the Fischler proposals. Farming must continue to be a rewarded profession that will give a viable way of life to our many farming families.Ireland's position must be defended with vigour, determination, courage and, above all, hunger for success – qualities and traits the Minister has, I am afraid, been lacking for some time. Perhaps he has spent too long in the Department of Agriculture and Food. The evidence points to the fact that farmers and farm leaders have lost confidence in the Minister. It points to the fact that the Minister no longer has clout at the Cabinet table. He is, in fact, perceived by many as being the "yes Minister" to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.The Minister has seen agriculture being plunged into the depths of despair, but he is sitting back and doing nothing about it. The Government's sustained and vindictive attack on the farming community has forced farm families from every part of Ireland to take to the road, converge here in Dublin and plead for help and their very survival. Something like this has not happened since the Minister's party's former disgraced leader, the then Minister for Agriculture, left the IFA sitting in the rain on O'Connell Bridge some decades ago.Farm incomes are falling dramatically and the Government's response is to impose extra taxation on farmers, increase the levies, and introduce massive cutbacks and production restrictions. At the same time, up to €620 million is being left behind in Europe under the REP scheme and other schemes because the co-funding necessary to draw upon those funds is not being provided. It defies logic that, to date, the Government has not seen the sound economic sense in what is being proposed. The REPS budget provides €2 billion for farms. To this day, €130 million of that has not been drawn down. This is money that was set aside specifically for Irish farmers in REPS. Between now and 2006, if the current position continues to obtain, a massive €500 million will be lost to farmers.In addition, €120 million for essential on-farm investment is not being delivered to farmers at a crucial time when they want to invest in their farms and protect our environment. What is happening to the new, simplified REPS plan that the Minister promised in 2002 and that was to be implemented in January 2003? Nothing has happened and there has been no explanation.The Minister's efforts in Europe represent economic lunacy and send the wrong signals to the Commission and the European Union as we enter crucial talks on the Fischler proposals. What about beef premiums? Due to the fact that 2002 was a base year under Fischler calculations, farmers maximised their long-term future under those proposals by applying for special beef premiums up to the end of December. What has happened as a result? We are way over our quota and these farmers are being penalised by 16% to 20% of their income at a time when they can ill afford it. This is not the fault of the Commission or the EU, but of the Minister. In the Luxembourg talks, the Minister gave away those quota rights.The Government has also given the two-finger sign – the Harvey Smith sign, in case people do not understand what I mean – to farmers in the Finance Bill 2003 by confirming the abolition of roll-over tax and the imposition of capital gains tax on land bought under compulsory purchase orders. At the same time, exemptions were granted to others. This land is being confiscated from farmers. They are not willing sellers and, in many instances, it will destroy their farm enterprise. I call upon the Minister to intervene. If the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, wants to be the Judas in this situation, let the Minister be the hero for once and stand by the farmers and honour the agreement that was hammered out with them. Farmers are visibly insulted that these budgetary impositions still stand and, for the first time in years, we are seeing real alienation among the farming community as a consequence of the policies of this Government.The attack the Minister has initiated upon the farming sector goes on and on. I will list the various instances of it: the doubling of disease levies, with the Minister taking €20 a head off the animals; cutbacks in education and the closure of agricultural colleges; the threat to alternative farm enterprises, such as organic farming, through the proposed closure of the college at Athenry; and the veterinary medicines Bill, if implemented, will double the cost to farmers, take €40 million out of their pockets and reduce veterinary usage.Teagasc cutbacks mean that only one post out of three is being filled. REPS fees are going up by 15.5% and advisory fees by 8%. Why is it necessary for the Government to endorse policies that depress farm prices? The consumer still has to pay excessive prices and, in many instances, is being ripped off. A farmer gets approximately 30% of the retail price for food, leaving a massive 70% for producers and retailers. Members should not take my word for it, they should read last week's Irish Farmers Journal. The average price received for an animal is €595. For the meat of the same animal, Tesco gets €1,550, Superquinn gets €1,600, Dunnes Stores get €1,400 and butchers get €1,302.

I call on colleagues to support this amendment because a vote of confidence in the Government and the Minister at this particular time would be as obscene an act as when de Valera, in 1945, went to the German Ambassador to offer his sympathies on the death of Hitler.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I second the amendment.The Fischler proposals for reviewing the CAP have added a great deal to the uncertainty about the future of farming in Ireland and I am dismayed by the lack of effort by the Government to maintain a fair minimum price for farm produce, despite guarantees under Agenda 2000 which were to remain in place until 2006.Farmers feel that they cannot trust either the commissioner or the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who has continued to allow the flight from the land, which has caused a drop in farming income in every single sector. This was made evident by the huge demonstration seen in this city less than a month ago. Farmers from the four corners of Ireland came here at a very busy time of the year to protest at the Minister's inability to serve them. These people, despite the demands made upon them by their work, made the effort to come to this city to protest. I am disappointed that the Minister has failed to recognise that protest to date.Farmers have seen a major increase in the cost of production and are feeling the impact of the Minister's decision to double the disease levy and introduce several other levies. They have also seen a rise in veterinary costs. I know who the Minister is supporting in this regard. Farmers cannot plan their farm business in such an environment and it sends a totally negative signal to young people entering farming today. There are very few of those. This was evident in what Senator Coonan said in regard to the closure of agricultural colleges throughout the country due to the Minister's failure to support them. Young people will not put up with what their fathers and mothers had to put up with. People are working long hours and putting in a huge amount of effort for very little return because the Minister has neglected this sector of the community. He has failed to show any clout at the Cabinet table when making a case on behalf of farmers.The Minister must reject the Fischler proposals on the mid-term CAP review which are detrimental to the future of Irish agriculture. The losses from the proposed cuts will severely damage the farming way of life. The Minister is weak and allowing the Commissioner to railroad his proposals through. This is the message coming from the farm organisations which are very disappointed with the Minister's response to the proposals.The attack on the Irish beef industry will pave the way for beef imports from the USA, South America and Australia by pushing farmers here out of beef production. National beef output from the suckler herd will be cut by one third which will result in the loss of several hundred million euro to the economy, including the loss of CAP direct payments to farmers. There will be further substantial losses in the sheep industry while support prices will be cut in the dairy and grain sectors. We will see a serious drop in farmers' income if the Minister does not act on their behalf.The European Union currently imports 500 million tonnes of beef which will double under the Fischler proposals under which the big winners are the multinational traders who will control food prices around the world. The Minister must face down the proposals in the interests of the economy and farmers.The Government must respond to the farming crisis. Big producers who produce 500 or 600 cattle annually – up to 2,000 in some cases – are being subsidised. They get several euro per head more from the meat plants than small farmers, a matter which the Minister has not investigated. Some of the barons, the Brosnan's and Goodman's, have the Minister where he is today.

The Minister has expressed his opposition at the Council of Ministers.The FAPRI projections for the future indicate a reduction of 12% in beef output by 2009 – three times the European average. They indicate a 30% reduction in the number of suckler cows and a 12% drop in the number of breeding ewes. I might be a simplistic farm economist but if these reductions in the numbers of suckler cows and breeding ewes take place, the figure for the reduction in beef output seems conservative. This assumes no change in the multilateral trading framework but we know that will happen.

The Minister's task is to bring it to the station to which we want to go. There will be more imports from third countries, reductions in tariffs and export subsidies. How will we make European and Irish agriculture more competitive on the international stage in order to serve the consumer in the way he or she deserves while maintaining the maximum number on the land? This can be done. While the CAP has been good to Ireland, we must acknowledge that there has been a haemorrhage from farming, even with the price supports in place.

The trick will be to ensure we keep people in rural areas. It is not good enough for Commissioner Fischler to say this can be done through rural development initiatives. While welcome, if there are no farmers farming in the areas in which the initiatives were taken, the system will fail. We must also realise that the fabric of the countryside, environment and social infrastructure is dependent on our rural population. If the European Union recognises anything, it should recognise the importance of people living in rural areas in terms of its immense social value, value in terms of law and order and in terms of everything else we believe to be important. If it does not recognise this and is prepared to put its money where its mouth is, I am fearful for the future of European society.

If we get to the point where the environmental restrictions are such that they make it difficult for farmers engaged in intensive agriculture to farm, it will present an immense opportunity for us to give consumers the type of food they are increasingly demanding at the prices they are prepared to pay for such high quality food. That is the area on which we must concentrate. There is a major job to be done by agricultural research. In this context, I was disappointed that there was such a cut in funding for such research in the Estimates as there are areas we can exploit to our advantage, a point on which I suspect Senator Quinn is more qualified to elaborate.Under the modulation proposals, once farmers receive payments exceeding €5,000 they will begin to be penalised. If they receive payments exceeding €50,000, they will be quite heavily penalised. Half of farmers will not be affected by the €5,000 limit, a low limit which is not sustainable. It is not enough to allow people to live with dignity in rural areas and a measure that will have to be examined, a point I know the Minister will successfully argue.I am not and never have been opposed to area aid based payments and return to the key point of the importance of allowing people to live in rural areas. One of the difficulties regarding some of the payments we received during the years was that the people whom they were designed to help went to the markets and gave them away. There was a benefit to Ireland in the moneys received but individuals who needed them most frequently gave some of them away. The decoupling proposals are related to area based payments and I do not have a difficulty with them provided the objective of keeping people in rural areas is achieved.Another disappointing aspect of the proposals is that the lifetime of the Agenda 2000 agreement does not appear to have been honoured. We seem to have entered the process of review earlier than required.

Intervention was greatly important because it gave prices a base, otherwise the position would have been catastrophic. Farmers still believe they must produce for a market that will clear for them at a price and that they do not have to give the consumer what he or she requires. If we are to learn anything from international markets, it must be that it is consumers who will decide and that it is up to the Irish farm industry to provide for them. There are many examples within the processing industry of people who do this well, and they need to be supported.I have some sympathy with the view that the increase in disease levies was more than it should have been. I am not saying this to the Minister for Agriculture and Food but to the Minister for Finance who comes from my county.

With regard to BSE, we must examine the situation where a whole herd is depopulated where one BSE reactor is found and the fact that this is done in circumstances where some of the animals might not even have to be tested because they are not of an age that they would require to be tested.

He uses the words "realism" and "opportunity", words I like. They are much better than "Seanad Éireann congratulates" or "Seanad Éireann condemns". I will repeat myself inasmuch as I will make points that the Minister has heard previously because I want to speak out against, what I call, "the ostrich tendency", the tendency to bury our national head whenever the question of the CAP arises.There has been a conspiracy of silence about the CAP dating back to the 1970s. For 30 years we have resisted all attempts to bring it into line with the realities of the modern, market-driven world. The only time I heard this referred to was by Senator Dardis tonight. Even in 2003 we continue to cod ourselves with the delusion that this is a sensible policy. We even try to persuade ourselves that it will continue indefinitely. Colleagues who know me well do not have to be told that I am proud to be Irish and a European and that I am well known around the world as a champion of Irish food. I use the opportunity to do this whenever I can.I cringe whenever I hear of a new refusal either here or at European level to face up to the reality in regard to the CAP. As long as we leave it unreformed, we are trying to live in the past. In its current form it is hugely wasteful and highly inefficient, even in reaching the objectives set for it. It penalises the majority of Europeans at the expense of a small minority. Even worse, it penalises the peoples of the developing world by distorting the marketplace in order that they cannot sell their agricultural goods.Successive Governments have taken the wrong attitude towards this cancer in the European project which we did not invent – it was in place when we joined the EEC in 1973. Instead of recognising it for the uneconomic, unfair, untimely and unsustainable monster it was, we fell on it as though it was manna from heaven. As a predominantly agricultural country, we would have had immense moral authority if we had chosen instead to lead the way out of the quagmire that our partners had created for themselves before we joined. Unlike Britain which clearly has vested interests in the matter, no one would have questioned our bona fides if we had put up our hand and told the truth which has been staring us in the face for the past 30 years – the policy cannot survive as a permanent part of a united Europe.Instead of planning for life after the CAP, we took the other route, which was to stick our heads in the sand and pretend it could be dragged on forever and that the good times would continue. This debate has proceeded in that vein. That is the reason it is important a dissenting voice is heard. We have persisted with this doomed policy at enormous cost. In absolute terms, agricultural policy swallows up the lion's share of the EU budget year in, year out. For an entity with the aspirations of the European Union to spend three quarters of its entire annual budget on farm supports shows a peculiar sense of priorities, although that is not the nub of my objection to the policy.I believe in supporting farms and farmers, in developing the food industry in Ireland and throughout Europe, in helping people to preserve the rural way of life and especially to find new ways beyond agriculture of developing the economic potential of the areas in which they live. I am the first to admit that doing this will cost the broad mass of citizens an arm and a leg. I will not admit, however, that the Common Agricultural Policy as it stands is the right way to do it.Two categories of people are short-changed by the CAP, of which one is customers. Senator Coonan referred to prices and I will not rise to his bait. Customers comprise the broad mass of almost 500 million people the European Union will soon embrace. They must pay twice for the CAP. The smaller part is the taxes that fund the European Union budget; the larger, paying higher food prices. Every time they buy food, they pay too much, more than they need to and more than they should. The prices they pay are not determined by the market laws of supply and demand. They are artificially determined by the need to use the market to deliver a certain level of support to farmers throughout the European Union, soon to be wider. Instead of supporting farmers directly, which is defensible and with which I would not have a problem, we support them through an inappropriate price support system. It is obvious to independent economists that this benefits no one, neither customers who buy the food nor farmers. Despite what it may have done previously, the CAP fails to provide a proper living for most European farmers.Falling incomes have driven increasing numbers off the land, something to which Senator Bannon referred. The CAP has encouraged large-scale, increasingly intensive farming that produces commodities of dubious quality. Some 80% of EU subsidies go to 20% of farmers. In other words, they go to large farmers, as Senator Bannon said. The CAP encourages wasteful over-production of food. It is a peculiar irony that a system designed to make Europe self-sufficient in food is characterised more than anything else by the fact that it produces too much food.This is where the other mass of people short-changed by the CAP comes in, namely, those in the developing world. The negative effect for them of the CAP and the European trade policy that springs from it is much greater than for Europeans. On the one hand, we keep their produce out of our market, by and large, while on the other, we undermine prices for them elsewhere in the world by flooding markets with our surpluses and selling them at uneconomic prices. Meanwhile, we beat our breasts about the need to help the developing world as long as that help is delivered in the most suitable way, usually in the form of cash or loans. We give to them with one hand while, with the other, prevent them from trading with the only commodities they have, namely, the goods they produce. If we traded fairly, we could keep all our trade and the developing world would still be better off.This is not only bad economics; it is a morally rotten way to behave, especially for this country with its traditions and values. As long as we persist in behaving in this manner, we cannot hope as Europeans to gain the influence we set out and would like to have in the rest of the world. The developing world sees the two great powerhouses of wealth, the United States and Europe, lined up against it. Both undermine it by distorting food prices and subsidising food producers. Of the two, Europe is by far the worst sinner. It is something about which we should think long and hard, especially in the current climate regarding Iraq in which America is not the favoured nation.Surely it should be for Ireland to lead the way out of this policy that is both economically and morally bankrupt. No one would ever question our regard for farmers, agriculture and the rural way of life if we were to say it was time we turned our back on the 20th century and found a new way for agriculture that was right for the 21st century. I believe people would listen. If we made such statements, we would be proud of what we would do, whereas we cannot be proud of what we do at present. I do not give answers. I merely say we should not keep our heads buried in the sand and believe this can continue.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate in the Seanad. It is important that agriculture is debated regularly in both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is a good opportunity to debate a number of proposals that will come before the European Union and will be debated internationally in the World Trade Organisation round talks which could have serious and detrimental effects on Irish agriculture.Detailed proposals of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy were announced on 22 January. Outline proposals had been published in July 2002 and the more detailed proposals followed a period of consultation with the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and a considerable amount of public debate. I outlined my position in the Council when the detailed proposals were discussed on 27 January. The proposals are being examined at official level and at working groups and committees in Europe. They will also be discussed in the Council in coming months. We are at the early stages of this debate. We will not get down to negotiations for a number of months. It is important we have this opportunity for a discussion. The Greek Presidency has indicated its intention to reach decisions on the proposals at the June meeting of the Council but whether these intentions can be realised will depend on progress in the negotiations in the coming months.The European Commission's detailed proposals contain four main elements: the decoupling of direct payments from production, the modulation and degression of direct payments, enhanced rural development measures and sectoral proposals, the most important from our point of view being milk and cereals. The Commission also published a considerable body of analysis on the impact of its proposals which had not been available when the outline proposals were published.I will deal with decoupling first because this changes the nature of the way farming and agriculture have been supported up to now. The Commission proposes to replace most existing direct payments with a single annual cheque in the post. The amount of each farmer's payment would be calculated by reference to the average annual amount he or she received in the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, updated to take account of increases in the rates of payment agreed under Agenda 2000. The payment would be conditional on the farmer respecting food safety, environmental, animal health and welfare and occupational safety standards. This is, in fact, compulsory cross-compliance. To avoid the abandonment of land with resultant environmental problems, recipients of direct payments will also be obliged to maintain their land in good agricultural condition.Last year before the outline proposals were published, I asked the economic evaluators, FAPRI Ireland, to carry out a study of the effects of decoupling. There has been criticism in some quarters that the FAPRI study is not comprehensive in that it did not take account of other developments, for example, the World Trade Organisation talks or other aspects of the mid-term review. Any such criticism is unfounded and demonstrates a lack of understanding of the process in which we are engaged. If the FAPRI study had included the effects of those factors, we would not know the effects on agriculture of decoupling alone, something which we must know because we have to take a position on it in the Council of Ministers. The FAPRI report was very clear about the factors covered and the assumptions made. Those factors did not take into account the WTO or other aspects of the mid-term review, just decoupling alone. We need to know the effects of the other developments also. I asked FAPRI, as soon as the decoupling exercise was complete, to extend the study to include the other mid-term review proposals and developments in the WTO. I expect the results of this additional study will be ready in about two months.Regarding the WTO, the current round of negotiations is crucially important. The outcome will determine the framework within which we can support agriculture in the European Union and will trade for many years to come. At present, the aim is to conclude agreement on modalities – that is, the broad rules – for the liberalisation of trade by the end of March. In an effort to influence this aspect of the negotiations, the EU Commission submitted proposals to the WTO secretariat at the end of January. The EU paper was agreed after Ireland and France had requested that it be discussed by the Council of Ministers and after assurances, which we had sought about the level of protection for sensitive products, specifically beef and butter, were given.Today, the chairman of the WTO's committee on agriculture in Geneva circulated a first draft of a modalities paper. The proposals contained in this paper are totally unrealistic. The paper departs from the terms of the Doha ministerial declaration under which the negotiations are taking place and, furthermore, it does not reflect the balance of views put forward by the WTO member countries in the preparatory phase of the negotiations. I expect the Commission to adhere to the mandate for the negotiations that was agreed by the Council of Ministers.The findings of the FAPRI analysis of decoupling were, in summary, that by 2010 beef production would fall by 12% in Ireland and by 6% in the EU as a whole, cattle prices would rise by 8% in Ireland and by 6% in the EU as a whole, lamb production would fall by 12% in Ireland and by 8% in the EU as a whole, lamb prices would rise by 21% in Ireland and by 19% in the EU as a whole, farm incomes would rise by 11% at the end of the period and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions would fall by 13% in Ireland. All of these changes were by reference to a baseline, which assumed no policy change. However, because there will be policy change, I have asked FAPRI to take the WTO round and other changes into account in its further studies.One of the notable findings by FAPRI is that, in the beef and sheepmeat sectors, Ireland would be disproportionately affected. I brought these results, and their disproportionate effect on the Irish economy and on rural communities here, to the notice of the Council of Ministers on 27 January. I also made it clear that the FAPRI study, like each of the six studies carried out on the Commission's behalf, did not take account of the impact of further liberalisation of trade resulting from the WTO negotiations, which would be likely to affect the results of decoupling for the worse.The Commission is proposing to introduce a system of modulation and degressivity over the period 2006 to 2012. Farmers receiving less than €5,000 in direct payments would not be affected. That proposed threshold would be far too low. In my response I stated clearly it was unrealistic for any farmer receiving €5,000 in direct payments to be exposed to reductions. Farmers in receipt of between €5,000 and €50,000 a year in direct payments would have their direct payments in excess of €5,000 reduced by 12.5% and farmers receiving over €50,000 a year would have their payments in excess of €50,000 reduced by 19% by 2012. That would be a gradual reduction up to the 2012. This money would then be used for other purposes. The first 6% of these reductions would be transferred to rural development, through various Leader programmes and the remainder would be used to meet future EU financing needs.At the Council on 27 January, I pointed out that modulation is inequitable in that its impact on different sectors varies, depending on the extent to which direct payments feature in the different support regimes. Those sectors where direct payments do not apply are not affected at all, whereas beef and sheepmeat, which are heavily dependent on direct payments, will be affected most severely. I also drew attention to the complete inadequacy of the €5,000 exemption threshold, a level which would catch farmers on quite low incomes. Direct payments are an absolutely essential element of farm incomes, amounting to €1.6 billion per annum and account for 69% of Irish farm incomes. Any reduction in these payments would impinge directly and significantly on farmers' incomes.The Commission has also developed its ideas for enhancing the range of rural development measures that may receive support. There will be three new sets of measures. There will be support for farmers who participate in recognised schemes to improve food quality. Aid will be provided to help farmers meet standards prescribed in EU law for the environment, public health, animal and plant health, animal welfare and occupational safety, and to farmers availing of farm advisory services for the first time. There will be assistance for farmers who undertake to improve, over at least a five year period, the welfare of their farm animals in a manner going beyond usual good animal husbandry practice.The Commission has put forward proposals for a range of sectors, namely cereals, milk, protein crops, durum wheat, starch potatoes, dried fodder, etc. I will outline the stance, which I took at the Council in relation to the sectors involved of most interest to Ireland. The Commission is proposing a 5% reduction in intervention prices for cereals and the abolition of the system of monthly increments, together with an increase in direct payments. Market conditions over most of the past two years or so indicate a convergence of EU and world prices for wheat and barley. I told the Council that, in these circumstances, it is difficult to justify a further cut in intervention prices, particularly bearing in mind the budgetary cost of the resultant increase in direct payments.The Commission is proposing a range of measures for milk including the bringing forward of the Agenda 2000 reforms by one year to 2004-05, the introduction of two further annual cuts of 5% in intervention prices starting in 2007-08 and restrictions on the purchase of butter into intervention to 30,000 tonnes, with increases in the dairy cow premium and two additional quota increases of 1% per annum. The total intervention price reduction of 25% would be differentiated as between butter and skimmed milk powder with a 35% decrease for butter and a 17.5% decrease for skimmed milk powder. The milk quota regime would be extended to 2014-15.In my view, market conditions do not require the bringing forward of the Agenda 2000 reforms of the milk regime and I cannot understand why we should decide now, four years in advance, to undertake further reform to commence in 2007-08.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Decisions on any such reforms should be considered closer to that date when we will have a better view of the market conditions then prevailing and, crucially, of the outcome of the WTO round. The Agenda 2000 agreement provided for a substantial reform of the sector and we should allow that reform to be absorbed before proceeding further.I have made my position on these proposals clear. I told the Council that significant fundamental reform was not necessary and significant reform would put pressure on the EU budget. The timing of such reform in the absence of further progress in the WTO round of negotiations was questionable strategically. Why should Europe make amendments and proposals without having a view of the WTO round? This would be tantamount to making concessions before receiving a response. The usual response to that in any argument is to pocket the concessions and start from a new threshold. The specific proposals were not – and are not – in accordance with stated EU policy objectives in relation to the European model of agriculture.We hear much from Commissioner Fischler about multifunctional agriculture. I do not see how it is possible to have multifunctional agriculture by reducing farmers' direct payments on a level as low as €5,000 per annum. Most of all, the proposals would impact disproportionately on Ireland. My objective in the negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 and I intend to do that.We do not, nor did we ever, have many votes at the Council of Ministers. We have three votes out of 87. Nonetheless over the years in various reforms, particularly ones that have taken place since the early 1990s, we have wrung substantial concessions from the various negotiations. We have teamed up with other like-minded countries and got a decent outcome. I am confident we can do so again on this occasion.Before people go into a debate, it is a pity they do not do some more research on the realities of life.

This is untrue as more money is available under all the on-farm investment schemes this year than in the previous year and more money is available for the REP scheme this year than was spent on it last year.Some €2.8 billion was expended last year in support of agriculture and the same amount will be spent this year.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I turn to a matter raised by Senator Quinn, who spoke at some length about support for farming and agriculture, which he described as misguided. That is not the case. Farming, agriculture and good quality food production is supported throughout the world. The United States of America, the great entrepreneur, supports this sector to a greater extent than any other country. I have official figures from international research which show that in the European Union agriculture is supported to the tune of $276per capita, whereas the equivalent figure in the United States is $338 per capita. The US also introduced a farm Bill last year which considerably enhanced support for agriculture. I make no apology for supporting farming and agriculture.Senator Quinn also stated that 75% of the European Union budget is spent in support of agriculture. This is also incorrect. Some cursory research before entering the House would have clarified the matter for the Senator. The fact is that 1.5% of GDP in the European Union is spent in supporting agriculture and farming, which amounts to some €41 billion. This is done for good reason and to good effect in supporting multi-functional agriculture and ordinary farming.Senator Quinn claimed the European Union uses agricultural support to dump products and whinged about the plight of developing countries which, he said, has been caused by the big, bad European Union. The EU is the largest importer of agricultural goods in the world and makes specific allocation for the least developed countries. For example, the EU is the world's largest importer of farm products from developing countries, from which it imports as much as the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand combined. The European Union absorbs some 85% of Africa's agricultural exports and 45% of Latin America's agricultural exports and is the largest importer of agricultural products from the poorest countries.I express my appreciation to the proposer and seconder of the motion. It is important that both Houses have a calm, deliberate and informed debate on the critical policy issues confronting Irish agriculture in both the European Union and the World Trade Organisation. Following last week's debate in the Dáil, I spoke to a member of the main farming organisation who told me that while he accepted the importance of the debate, it proved depressing due to the dearth of progressive proposals from the Fine Gael Party. The same has been the case in this House.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I accept your ruling. Senator Callanan's contribution would have been noted by others if they were present in the House.The Common Agricultural Policy was established in the 1960s, before Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973, to secure Europe's food supply and stabilise prices to the benefit of both producers and consumers. In the 1950s food was scarce and expensive and choice and quality were extremely poor. The Common Agricultural Policy encouraged a constant supply of home produced food by providing farm price supports. In this way the instability in world market food prices was avoided through a combination of food import tariffs, export refunds and market management.Since the foundation of the EEC European agriculture has been subject to political intervention and financial supports which have proved very beneficial to both food producers and consumers alike. Consumers benefit through cheaper food prices and by being assured of quality food produced with the highest food safety and traceability standards. The first CAP reform in 1992, coupled with the inclusion of agriculture for the first time in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, forced a major change in European farm support systems.On prices and incomes, in a recent review of the differential between the money farmers receive and the price consumers pay for beef it is clear there is a major difference between what the farmer is paid for an animal and the value of the meat to the supermarket. It appears from the calculations that the supermarkets, in particular, are doing very well in their profit take in that farmers only get 38% of the retail price. This means that 62% of the value is mopped up somewhere along the way by others. Even allowing for the cost of slaughter, overheads, distribution, storage and packaging, it is a huge gap. The losers appear to be farmers and consumers. The middlemen in this case, in particular the supermarkets, appear to be the net beneficiaries of the production system.A similar exercise by others recently showed equivalent gaps between production of milk, lamb, beef and salmon and the price paid by the consumer for that produce. For the sake of farmers and consumers this problem has to be investigated and resolved. We have to ensure there is a fair and equitable difference between what the consumer pays and the farmer is paid.During the years bureaucracy has led to more red tape, for very good reasons in some cases, but it exacerbates the problems some in the sector have in terms of filling out forms and the number of forms to be sent here, there and everywhere. The amount of bureaucracy makes farmers that little bit more pessimistic and it is necessary to ensure payments that are justified are delivered promptly. It is an incredible waste of resources and an enormous demand on the time of the farmer to have to submit a plethora of forms and responses to claim his or her entitlements. There have been many cases of heavy-handed bureaucracy where simple errors or oversights have resulted in fines or penalties being imposed. This exacerbates the difficulties experienced in this regard. That heavy-handed approach has to stop. Commissioner Fischler argues that his proposals would end the bureaucracy to which I refer but that remains to be seen. I fear that one system of red tape will be replaced by another. There is a need for adjustments but it is a matter of how these can be implemented without damaging the nature and quality of farming and farm life.Subsidies must remain an integral part of Irish farming. It would be impossible to implement environmental policies or sustain marginalised farms without them. It is not fair to withdraw them in one short, sharp blow as proposed by Commissioner Fischler. Subsidies are vitally important to a select number who must maintain some form of valuable income on the land. Transitional payments must be in place to safeguard the current generation of farmers while allowing the transition to a new generation who will have to take on board the new styles and standards that are almost inevitable in farming.The Minister said there were record numbers of young people in farming. I know otherwise. I spoke recently to a graduate of a course in an agricultural college. Out of a total of 28 graduates who received diplomas, only four or five intended to actively pursue careers in farming. There have been many incentives in the private sector in recent years. One of the major benefits of the Celtic tiger was a phenomenal rate of growth in terms of jobs expansion and expansion in employment in general. This has led to younger farmers being attracted to industries where they can work under more humane conditions. They can work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or do a number of 12 hour shifts and leave the workplace. It would not be correct to state, therefore, that there are a record number of young people on the land. There might be record numbers doing courses in the colleges which will allow them have a more professional and expert command of the farm being handed down to them but it does not necessarily mean that they will pursue careers in farming.We also need to concentrate on smaller farmers. The vast majority of European subsidies go to larger farmers but what number go to smaller farmers? While figures have been bandied about in this debate, the scales are not balanced in favour of the smaller operator. By and large, they are balanced in favour of the large operator. We need to encourage systems whereby younger farmers can work off the land to subsidise their incomes in order to promote living on the land and ensure young people will find it lucrative to remain in farming, even if they have off-farm income.The challenge now facing the Minister is to protect agriculture while setting the scene for gradual change that will give a new look to farming without damaging the quality of life or the acceptable level of income for farmers. It is most important that we deploy huge resources into research, development and education in farming and that these principles are not sacrificed.While there has been much comment about the Fischler proposals, we have to fire a warning shot in that regard. There has to be thorough research into the kernel of what Commissioner Fischler proposes to do. The cuts in the budget and Book of Estimates were a slap in the face for some and it is up to the Government to ensure budgetary allocations are not drastically reduced because there is little point in talking about younger people staying on the land or people staying in agriculture and making it a viable profession if the State coffers do not reflect these values and policies.I thank the Chair for his patience. I did not intend to incur his wrath the second time. That might be unusual given that I am not a member of his party but as an Opposition Member, I wish him well in the remainder of the debate.

I merely wanted to point out the convention as has been pointed out to me when I sit in the Chamber and which will be pointed out to me by the Chair whenever I transgress. It was not a reprimand in any sense. I merely wanted to point out the particular convention.

#FrancisOBrien	unknown-#FrancisOBrien-party	unknown-#FrancisOBrien-dob	unknown-#FrancisOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward. I denounce the Fischler proposals and commend the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, for the courageous stance he took last week at the meeting of farm Ministers. He joined the grouping known as The Friends of Farming in the Council to formally reject the Commissioner's package. The group, led by France, has the backing of at least five other states, including Ireland, Spain and Portugal.The Fischler reforms are unnecessary and not in accordance with stated EU policy objectives in respect of the European model of agriculture. They are entirely contradictory, ill-timed and will cost the Union money it does not have. I see no reason for the EU to embark on any significant reform at this time, still less to undertake the most fundamental reform since the CAP was established. These proposals will damage many Irish farming families. I am very concerned about their implications for farmers and their families in Monaghan, as they have been through a lot in recent years with the foot and mouth disease problem and other crises. The implementation of these proposals could prove to be the death knell for large areas of rural Monaghan. I see no course of action other than rejection of the proposals.The cuts will impact more severely on Ireland than on any other member state. The proposals to cut direct payments to farmers receiving over €5,000 per annum cannot be justified. We should be sure we know where we are going with decoupling before we consider getting involved in this. I was interested to read last week that Mr. Pat O'Rourke, President of the ICMSA, said he was convinced that if imposed, the Fischler proposals would undermine farm incomes by 45%.Irish farming has changed over the past 20 years, largely in response to forces outside the farm unit. The current annual exodus from farming runs at 3,000 people per year. We need to promote farming. These proposals are not in accordance with stated EU policy objectives in relation to the European model of agriculture and will cost money we do not have. We have no option but to object to the proposals. I wish the Minister and his team all the best in negotiations with his foreign counterparts when he tries to achieve the best possible deal for Irish agriculture.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I support Senator Coonan's amendment, despite the fact that it was criticised as lacking in substance by Senator Dardis. I remind Senator Dardis of the second line of the Government motion, which states the House "notes with approval the stated intention of the Minister". Every farmer in Ireland realises what those stated intentions are regarding agriculture. They represent inaction and the total demise of the industry.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, and regret the departure of the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh. I was going to endorse Senator Callanan's congratulations to the Minister on being recognised in Europe for his contribution to agriculture. Apart from the personal recognition of the Minister, this is shown by the fact that the Minister has toed the European line and followed the European agenda slavishly. The result is the crisis in agriculture today.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	350	He is the longest serving Minister for Agriculture in the history of the State, but I never thought I would see the day when a Minister for Agriculture would say in the Oireachtas that in order to avoid the abandonment of land, with resultant environmental problems, recipients of direct payments will also be obliged to maintain their land in good agricultural condition. What message does that give to young people who intend to continue in the traditions of their parents in agriculture? It is one of the most appalling statements ever made and anyone responsible for such a statement at a time of crisis in agriculture must consider his position in the context of his commitment to agriculture.Senator Dardis threw out a challenge earlier, saying everything we said was negative and that we were putting our heads in the sand. That challenge was taken up by the Minister. I throw out a challenge to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take a leaf from the book of his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. That Minister knows there is a crisis in education and he has initiated a review and restructuring of every section in his Department. We hope that review has a positive result and I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to undertake the same review in his Department.Whatever is necessary should be done in order to get positive thinking back into agriculture. This Government has been in power for 12 of the past 15 years but when has it ever come forward with an example of forward thinking for agriculture? It has come up with nothing of the sort and instead we have had responses to crisis after crisis and ad hockery. The result is that farmers are totally disillusioned. That is why a tractor cavalcade from every corner of the country came through Dublin, as Senator Coonan said. Farmers abandoned their homes to impress upon the Government the need to respond in a positive way.What did we get? The budget saw a doubling of the levy and a withdrawal of the promised arrangement. That was done by a former leader of the Irish Farmers Association, who said he was going to revoke the roll-over regarding compulsory purchase. Today we see that farmers are to be penalised a further €18 to €20 in order to dispose of offal in meat factories.If the Minister for Agriculture and Food thinks there is nothing wrong in agriculture today, where are we going? Can he not see the need to reintroduce some confidence at a time of crisis?I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. He can see in east Galway that Teagasc, because of cutbacks of €15 million, has had to close Mellowes Agricultural College, even though it was teaching organic farming as an alternative method of farming.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The reality is that Teagasc has had to reduce its budget by €15 million. Two out of every three future appointments to Teagasc have been frozen. This is the only advisory service in the State and that is what the Minister has imposed on it. The Minister denied that €150 million was returned as unspent under the REP scheme because of the failure of farmers to get involved. They are leaving the scheme.The Minister will be remembered positively because foot and mouth disease was kept out of the State. The Department, the agricultural agencies and, in particular, the hard work of the farming community won the day for him.The lobby that ensured in May that the Minister was restored to the Department of Agriculture and Food did a disservice of monumental proportions to agriculture. We need a change, we need new thinking and we need a forward plan for agriculture. This Government, and the Minister in particular, has provided nothing of the kind in the last 12 years. Does the Minister ever aspire to introducing change? I hope so. The Department of Agriculture and Food must be changed. It should be moved from Dublin to rural Ireland and there it will see the policies that have failed.Will the Minister verify that the forestry premia and grants under partnership contracts will be revoked? If that is the case, what will be the consequences? I want to see change and I want to hear the Minister respond.WP leading adjustment

None of us has any doubts about the extent to which the whole sector has been affected by many vagaries recently.As a result of the self-assured, decisive manner in which the Department and the Minister have come through these crises, I have the utmost confidence in his ability to shepherd the agricultural industry through the latest challenge it faces, the proposals by Commissioner Fischler. It is a difficult job for the Minister and Department and it would be good to see cohesion in the sector and across the political divide. I will not speak for the agriculture sector but I expected a greater level of co-operation tonight than the political in-fighting and mud-slinging at Ministers over what they have and have not done.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The Minister's determination to oppose the proposals is well founded. Commissioner Fischler's draft proposals have not changed to any great extent. Since then not only our Government but a number of other member states have lobbied the Commissioner, presenting strong cases for change. Examining the final proposals, however, it is obvious that many of the draft proposals have not been taken into account. The devil in the detail will only be worked out by virtue of the negotiating skills of our Ministers.The idea that we should simply introduce decoupling, a major concern for all of us, is ludicrous. By basing the single payment to farmers on the 2000-02 level, many farmers will find themselves in very difficult circumstances, particularly those in transition farming. I spoke to some farmers from County Clare today who were concerned that, having changed from dairy farming to suckler cow production, they are between enterprises, without having reached the required production levels in the new area. The detail has not yet been thrashed out and consideration must be given to the plight of farmers in transition from one area to another.Independent reports suggest that the national beef herd will drop by some 30% if these proposals come into operation, particularly if decoupling is put in place. I believe the Commissioner's argument is that this shortfall in output will, in some way, be offset by a price increase associated with an increase in demand.My concern is not only with the juggling of prices and the implications of the WTO talks. There are concerns in that regard tonight, with the chairman of the modalities committee of the WTO, Mr. Harbison, throwing a spanner in the works and being at odds with many EU member states. My concern is on a wider basis in relation to the whole production sector, in which there are very many jobs involved. No doubt, Senator O'Toole will have a view in relation to the trade union dimension and the number of jobs involved. We must be very careful that, in trying to assist farmers as we all wish to do, we do not throw the baby out with the bath water, as it were. We must also be concerned about the many people working in the agricultural processing sector.Unfortunately, in the time available, I cannot deal with other issues I would like to cover. I wish the Minister of State and his colleagues well in the EU negotiations at this difficult time. I support the motion.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Of course there is an agenda. I have defended the CAP reform proposals of the then Commissioner MacSharry against Fianna Fáil in this House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	376	Yes, against Fianna Fáil. There was a similar situation earlier tonight when Senator O'Brien had a go at his party colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I also defended the then Minister, Ivan Yates, against Fine Gael in this House.It has been a consistent issue for me that farmers were never told the truth by the leadership of Irish society. It was as clear as could be from 1990 onwards that, by the end of the 1990s, farmers would be paid the world price for beef but nobody had the courage to tell them, apart from a few of us who knew relatively little about it. The same position now applies in relation to the WTO, which will have a serious impact on farming in future. Somebody should get down to outlining the implications of that to farmers.The Fischler proposals are not acceptable but, on the other hand, can anybody convince me that we can continue with a situation where direct payments are not decoupled from production? They will be decoupled and there is one very good reason for that – we have trained a whole generation of farmers to be unproductive, being paid more for producing less.Incidentally, it is farmers who have briefed me on the situation. They have been paid for putting land into set-aside and various schemes over the last ten years. In every way, they have done things in the opposite way to every previous generation of farmers. Formerly, the more farmers produced, the more they were paid. We have moved away from that situation and we must get back to it. Our farming community also needs to be told that profit is the difference between buying price and selling price. It is not about the final price, but rather the difference between the two prices.In terms of where we are going, there are things which need to be done and said honestly. The decision in the last budget on the roll-over tax on farmers is grossly unfair. It does not make any sense. No honest, fair-minded person could agree with it. If people have their land taken from them and then have to replace it, it is unfair that they should lose out on the transaction in terms of taxation. They should not be taxed on the purchase of land to replace land which was compulsorily acquired from them. We should say that is wrong and ensure that some commitment is made by the Government to change it.In relation to the animal disease levies, it is utterly unfair to impose an extra €10 million on farmers at this time. The Government should sit down with farming representatives, examine the situation, work through it and give some commitments. Other speakers referred to the rural environment protection scheme, REPS. If some 70,000 farmers are to join that scheme, the Department of Agriculture and Food will have to convince them to do so. That will necessitate a review of the situation whereby, since 1995, the rate of REPS payment has not increased by one cent. Irrespective of who was in Government since then, the scheme is still operating on the basis of an annual payment per farm of around €5,500. Farmers need to be encouraged to join the scheme. If farmer participation in the scheme reached the 70,000 figure to which I have referred, we would have solved three-quarters of the problem in relation to the EU nitrates directive. The farm waste management proposals should also be presented in a manner which is attractive and supportive to the farming community.I fully agree with the concept of special areas of conservation, SACs, as any reasonable person must. However, in defining the areas, consideration must also be given to the farmers who are trying to make a living in those areas. They need to have fair levels of compensation. It would help enormously if those issues were addressed and an effort made to deliver on them. There are cost issues involved and we have to deal with them. I am not sure what is the best approach but it is very clear that those issues are currently impacting on farmers.In relation to the issues arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis with regard to accurate measurement of the sheep population, farmers will have to agree to an objective method of measurement. It need not necessarily be the method currently favoured by the Department of Agriculture and Food – there are other ways of doing it and those alternatives should be explored.The inclusion of commonage in the determination of farm size may meet European demands, but it has a serious impact on stocking rates per acre for the purposes of various agricultural payments. That matter should be reviewed with a view to softening the blow. There are many other issues to which I would like to refer, if time permitted, and I wish they could be addressed one by one, with Members having an opportunity to express their views. It is not a matter of one Government being better than another. I believe all Ministers for Agriculture with whom I have dealt have been fully committed to their work. I consider that the former Deputy Ivan Yates did a superb job during his term as Minister. The current Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, is doing as good a job as he can. We should get our act together on both sides of the House, define the issues and put pressure on Government to deliver on them.As was said earlier, I do have an agenda. I believe that if the farming community and pillar are outside a national agreement, they will be the big losers and that will simply reinforce the split between urban and rural areas, something which I deprecate and oppose. There is a great deal of work to be done in this area. We should gear ourselves towards doing it properly, identifying objectives, making progress and reaching conclusions. We should show our support for the farming community in a practical and honest way.

It concerns not just the particular matters that might be written into the programme but also the ongoing dialogue on problems arising in farming.I disagree with the Senator's statement about productivity and production. I believe the agricultural statistics show that that has been well maintained. He is correct in saying that the REPS is an excellent scheme and is one of the keys to the future of farming.We are fortunate in having an excellent Minister for Agriculture and Food and an excellent negotiating team who are, literally, veterans of European negotiations. I was with them in Berlin where they emerged with a fantastic result. Irish Ministers for Agriculture and Food have a high standing with the farming community and with Government, unlike certain other European countries where Governments have little regard for farming or have ideas that are rather destructive.Farmers involved in the recent "tractorcade" represented a rather elite division. They did not correspond to the image of the half-starving farmers which was presented here. There are some drawbacks to macho politics. It is important to be in there and to be involved. The health of the economy is vital to farming. Few of the budget measures will have any serious impact on overall farm income, however inconvenient or distasteful they may be.Senator Quinn is quite wrong about the CAP. I wish he would sometimes stay when he has made his criticism and listen—

It costs very little in overall terms of GNP. It is vital as a security.My reservation about decoupling is that over time it will de-legitimise support for the CAP. There will be people who will abuse the ease and facility of the system and the media will get in and use it to discredit support for farming. It is dangerous and that is well recognised.

A critical situation has arisen in Ennis. This business was established in 1984 and produced high quality products for the printing sector. It ran successfully and employed approximately 50 people. A couple of years ago a new company, Graham and Heslip, which had some Northern Ireland connections was established.Last Friday at 2 p.m. some of the representatives of the Belfast company came to the plant in Ennis, notified the people there that they were closing down the operation and gave them an hour to remove their personal belongings from the premises, which have since remained closed. The 50 people employed there were left without the balance of their wages and received no final entitlements. Repeated attempts by the union to make contact with the management have not yet met with success.When the business was taken over, there were a number of meetings with the industrial development agencies. Even though approximately €300,000 was paid in grant assistance over a number of years, there is existing approval for an additional €100,000 for plant, machinery and training which has not yet been drawn down. The overall prospects, according to executives in the industrial development authorities and Shannon Development, were good. The company seemed to have a good product and a good customer base throughout the country. There were prospects of consolidating the company and safeguarding the jobs of the 50 people employed there.This has been a devastating blow for Ennis, which has suffered a number of closures in recent times. The fact that the company closed down so quickly, with no prior notice and with employees given just an hour to vacate the premises, is unprecedented and unacceptable. Perhaps the Minister of State will draw the attention of the development agencies to this situation and seek an alternative industry. Can he also seek clarification or an indication from the persons involved in the company as to what their proposals are for paying workers their wages and entitlements and the future of the company? Concern has been expressed by Ennis Town Council. Its chairman, Mr. Peter Considine, was here this afternoon and there will be a special meeting of the council tomorrow evening to discuss the matter.I ask the Minister of State or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to investigate the situation and endeavour to come to Ennis as soon as possible to meet the council and the people of Ennis and give an indication of how they propose to resolve the issue which is causing widespread unease in the current climate of industrial uncertainty. It is disturbing that a company which seems to have a venerable product, a good customer base and record since 1984 closes its doors without any explanation. We are not satisfied with the way its employees have been treated.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-02-12 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am aware of the sudden closure of the company in question which came about on Friday and, as the Senator said, without prior notice. Shannon Development, the industrial development agency with responsibility for the company in the mid-west region, immediately advised the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.This was a long-established company in Ennis. It was established as Thermofoil Print Limited in 1984. In early 2001 it was acquired by its present owners through a subsidiary company taking a 75% shareholding in the original company and one of the founders of the original company retaining the other 25%. It received considerable financial assistance from Shannon Development during the years.The company designed and produced specialised products for the domestic market. Its main product areas were greeting cards, packaging, annual reports and promotional colour printing. I understand it had a good reputation as a specialist in a range of printing options, including full colour printing, embossing, watermarking and carton manufacture. A substantial number of employees had been with it for a number of years. Traditionally, it had been regarded as a stable source of employment in Ennis.Shannon Development had a review meeting with the company last summer, at which stage the feedback was positive. Therefore, the news of the closure was surprising. It was a greater shock to the employees of the company. In recent days Shannon Development has tried to contact the company to discuss what is happening. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also contacting the company with a view to alerting it to its statutory obligations.There are certain provisions in employment legislation which must be complied with. Under the terms of sections 9 and 12, respectively, of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, an employer who proposes to undertake a collective redundancy is obliged to consult the employees' representatives and give the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment written notice of his or her proposals at the earliest opportunity at least 30 days before the first dismissals take effect. The Protection of Employment Act provides for significant penalties in the event of non-compliance by an employer with the relevant provisions. Furthermore, there are provisions whereby employees can refer to a rights commissioner complaints regarding non-compliance with information and consultation provisions. In addition, there are statutory provisions relating to minimum notice and redundancy payments which have to be complied with.It is difficult to speculate at this stage on the future of the company and it would be unwise to do so. Until contact has been established with it, we cannot take the matter forward. Efforts to speak to it are ongoing but they have not been successful as yet, which I find surprising. I share the concerns expressed by Senators Daly and Dooley about this most unfortunate situation. Every effort is being made to unravel it. I hope to have a further report to give to Senator Daly before tomorrow evening and will be happy to travel to Ennis to meet representatives of the town council and the company on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to see if there is anything we can do to help.The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 February 2003.
