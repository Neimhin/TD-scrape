Has the private company operating the NCT service faced any sanction under its contract due to these long delays? Are the staff who have been temporarily transferred from Spain qualified to the same standard as their Irish counterparts?

The statutory responsibility for roadworthiness testing lies with the Road Safety Authority, RSA. However, I am very much aware of vehicle owners' concerns over delays this year in securing test appointments. I have emphasised to the RSA the importance of reducing the test backlog and my officials are meeting weekly with the RSA to monitor progress in reducing delays. My Department will continue to keep the situation under close review while supporting any appropriate requests from the RSA for assistance. Work is under way to increase test centre capacity and restore the average appointment waiting time to an acceptable level. To date, a priority waiting list has been established for motorists to avail of cancellations. The contractor is providing 22 vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation and the RSA has approved a pilot for additional inspection personnel in automated elements of the test. These measures are in addition to the 53 new staff employed by the National Car Testing Service, NCTS, earlier this year and a significant increase in staff overtime that allows eight tests per tester per day instead of seven. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy English, with my Department's assistance, is allowing recruitment of up to 100 non-EU testers. Some 44 additional testers are expected before the end of the year for test centres with the most significant delays. The NCT service contract is held by the RSA. As Minister of State, I do not have a role in its administration. Contractual sanctions are a matter for the RSA and penalty clauses apply where the contractor breaches key indicators. The RSA has confirmed that contract mechanisms have applied where service levels have not been met. The contractor is disputing these, however, and further discussions are planned in the coming weeks. With regard to qualifications, I can confirm that the temporary vehicle inspectors from Spain are qualified to Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 5, which is the standard in many EU member states and the UK. Until 2020, the QQI level 5 certification was considered the appropriate minimum requirement for vehicle inspectors in the State. This was changed in accordance with apprenticeship changes in Ireland as well as to align with the commercial standard.

In the first instance, I am not entirely convinced. There is a job of work to notify people about the priority waiting list and the mechanism they should use. I try to find people an appointment in my area, but they will wait until 3 May next year in Kells, 18 May in Navan and 7 June in Drogheda. At Northpoint 1 and 2, they will wait until 7 June or 31 May. Therefore, six-month waits are not unheard of. This is my first question by way of follow-up. What is the commitment from the contractor to reduce those waiting times? If there is an average waiting time of 24.5 days and the target is 12 days, when will the contractor deliver on that? Will it do it through additional staffing, additional hours or additional tests? How will it do it, and when will it happen?

This will include overtime and recruitment in Ireland and abroad. As I outlined earlier, we are working with the Minister of State, Deputy English, to allow the recruitment of up to 100 non-EU testers. Some 44 additional testers are expected before the end of this year. To directly answer the Deputy's question regarding motorists, I strongly urge vehicle owners to allow plenty of time to book their tests. The regulations allow a car to be tested up to 90 days before the due date without affecting the expiry date of the certificate issued. Appointment slots are released continuously across all test centres with many also becoming available through cancellations or rescheduling of appointments. Therefore, when motorists are unable to secure an NCT test date before their certificate is due to expire, they should contact the NCT customer service directly and ask to be added to the priority waiting list. The majority of those on the priority list will be provided with an appointment within 30 days.

I would appreciate if she could expand on it here. I am hearing from unions - SIPTU, in particular, has been in contact with me - and workers that there is a real concern that in the rush to address the backlog, standards are being driven down and new recruits or internal transfers within the company are not qualified to the same standard. Traditionally, it has been the case that the inspectors would be qualified motor mechanics with additional experience and intensive training. The Minister of State pointed towards QQI level 5. That is not the standard in Ireland that it might be elsewhere. How exactly are standards being maintained? Does the Minister of State accept that these new recruits are not qualified to the same standard?

This was changed in accordance with apprenticeship changes in Ireland as well as to align with the commercial standard.Testers in Ireland are currently required to hold QQI level 6 qualifications, but the RSA has confirmed that local applicants with QQI level 5 will be considered for a temporary period and has indicated that on-the-job training will be provided to bring testers to QQI level 6 standard. The RSA has assured my Department that the highest testing standards that we expect from the NCTS will not be compromised in any way as they work to increase testing capacity and deal with the backlogs.

The NTA is developing plans to introduce 12 new sustainable transport corridors, which will encompass 93 km of bus lanes and 112 km of cycle lanes across the city. Investing in a sustainable future for Cork is vital for supporting the city's growth over the coming two decades. Following two earlier rounds of public consultation, the NTA launched its new design for the Cork metropolitan bus network in June, with consultation closing on 3 October. Submissions received during that process are now being considered by the NTA and a further round of public consultation on the revised proposals will take place next year.  The new network is intended to transform the public transport network across the whole Cork metropolitan area. The new network will involve the creation of new bus routes and improved bus frequencies and will provide an increase of over 50% in bus services across the city, helping to transform the public transport system to meet anticipated growth and future travel demand in the region. To date, no decisions have been made regarding how services will be secured. The NTA has a directly awarded contract with Bus Éireann for bus services in Cork and this contract may be varied as a means to provide some services. Alternatively, the NTA may elect to seek an operator or operators by public tender. In either case, the NTA will ensure that providers of contracted services comply with all relevant Irish and European law, including employment law.

Key to making public transport more attractive is to slash fares, even going so far as to make fares entirely free. Given this, I am disturbed that the Minister's reply holds open the real possibility that 12 strategic transport corridors could go out to tender. If they do, the Minister and I know that private companies which pay lower wages will have a competitive advantage and could end up operating at least some of those routes. Cork city has never in modern times had key bus routes run by private operators on a for-profit basis. Privatisation would be a big step backwards and potentially is being facilitated by BusConnects Cork. I ask the Minister to comment further on the matter.

This is challenging because it requires giving road space and priority for buses at junctions. I know there is a lot of concern in Cork, particularly around whether any trees or front gardens are affected. That became clear during the consultation process. The experience of going through a similar process in Dublin may steer us in the direction of giving even stronger priority for buses within the existing road network as a way of meeting the desire to improve bus services without affecting the local environment. I hope the Deputy and other parties and representatives will engage. We need to do it quickly. I do not agree on the idea that it would be a free service. We need the funding for the additional services that are going to be provided. The issue of contracting is not being decided in this consultation process. There is a European regulation from 2007 and a directive from 2004 which mean the NTA is obliged to introduce competitive tendering for public service obligation, PSO, contract services. How exactly that is done is a matter that the NTA has to consider. There are various examples, and the Deputy cites Dublin as one, of recent tendered services. Bus Éireann provides the service in Waterford as a single supplier. There are different options in terms of how this can be delivered.

Dublin certainly is an example that people in Cork need to look at very carefully. What percentage of the routes have been privatised in Dublin? Go-Ahead Ireland has control of 10% of the routes, I think. Fines were announced the other day for falling down on service provision. Dublin Bus was fined €1.5 million and Go-Ahead Ireland was fined €850,000. I would expect that if Go-Ahead Ireland had 10% of the routes it would get 10% of the fines, if its service provision was of an equal quality to the public company. They did not have 10% of the fines; they had nearly 40% of the fines. Going by fines, the service was nearly four times worse on the private routes. That is a warning to the people of Cork. They need to raise their voices to stop the threat of privatisation of bus services in the city. The Minister has not excluded that as a possibility. He has said that there are various options but by citing the European directives he has given a very clear indication of what road the NTA is likely to go down. Can he clarify when the NTA will provide clarification on this question?

I am just stating what is obvious and what exists. As a member of the EU, we exist within the European legal system. I do not disagree with the Deputy's comments about the real problems we have seen in Dublin recently for all the bus companies in terms of getting drivers and getting service reliability. We have to address that. It was a good start when the companies apologised to the Oireachtas committee yesterday. I would have to say on comparing Cork and Dublin, and one never does that at the best of times, that in my mind the real problem in Cork is that the bus service is not extensive enough. It is not good enough as it currently is. I mean no disrespect to the bus drivers in Bus Éireann or the company. The service is not good enough. This project provides for a 50% increase, with two new 24-hour services on major lines running from Ballincollig right through the city to Mahon, and from Carrigaline through the city up to Hollyhill. It provides for services seven days per week, with buses coming every 15 minutes.

We need to get that really high-quality service. The biggest problem we have is political and public support locally for the changes to make that happen. If we do not get that right, we will be stuck in the current system. Cork does not have a good enough bus service, and upper Glanmire, Waterfall and Kerry Pike do not get bus services. They will come in with this new system.

When will the full review of the national ports policy be commenced?

Upon its finalisation a full review of national ports policy will commence later this year which will look at the overall ports policy framework. The first stage in this review will be the drafting of an issues paper and it is anticipated that this will go to public consultation in early 2023. Pending this review, I have published a policy statement on the facilitation of offshore renewable energy by commercial ports in Ireland, making it clear to the offshore industry that we are committed to the provision of port facilities in Ireland for offshore renewable energy, ORE, developments. In Ireland, the contribution from the Government to the ORE industry will be embedded in the offshore renewable energy supply schemes, ORESS 1, ORESS 2 and later auctions, where guaranteed income for the electricity produced will enable the wind farms to be financed and cover the cost of required port infrastructure and services. In relation to funding, our State ports operate as independent commercial bodies. Under national ports policy, no Exchequer funding is provided to them.It is envisaged that like all port infrastructure, the ORE facilities will be funded through a combination of: port revenues, including from the ORE industry; EU funding; and borrowing from the likes of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other financial institutions. My Department is already engaging with the various institutions, including the EU Commission, on the availability of funding for ports in providing the ORE infrastructure to meet the EU's and Ireland's ambitions. In line with the policy statement, a number of ports are progressing plans for the delivery of port infrastructure to facilitate ORE deployment activity, including the ports named by the Deputy in this question. These are all trans-European network for transport, TEN-T, ports and, as such, are eligible to apply for Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, grant funding. The Department is assisting, as appropriate, eligible applicants in the application process.

To capture the full potential of the opportunity of offshore wind and to deliver it within the best possible timeframe the investment in our ports needs to happen now, not in conjunction with the development of our offshore wind farms. It is almost putting it back on offshore wind farm developers to do this. We know the sector has prepared reports into the infrastructure deficit and has pointed towards direct funding but the Minister of State also mentioned the ISIF, the EIB and low-cost loans. How tangible are they, how quickly can they happen and how advanced are discussions at an EU level?

The policy statement recognised that existing ports in Ireland, or entities within ports with development plans, such as Rosslare Europort and the Port of Cork, can play a significant role in providing the required large-scale port infrastructure for those deployments. The policy specifically mentions, for example, Shannon Foynes Port and the Port of Cork, or entities within those ports. They can also play a significant part in the provision of the required large-scale port infrastructure for floating ORE. In order to maximise the EU funding opportunities the Department has engaged extensively with the Commission to advocate for the inclusion of funding for port infrastructure required for ORE under the CEF. Ports are again engaging and applying for that funding and the Department is working with them. This is a competitive process and it is generally oversubscribed but the Department assists the eligible applicants with this application process.

As the Minister of State has said, it is competitive. They have applied and they have been unsuccessful. We know that time is ticking and that we have a huge infrastructural deficit in our ports, which is within the responsibility of the Department, albeit we know they are commercial operations. There needs to be a mindset shift and the Department, the Minister of State and the Minister need to look at every option. The national ports study from the sector was good and useful and the Department has its own work ongoing on the ports policy but time is of the essence. I want to see the Minister of State outline what the investment will be in 2023, in whatever shape or form, to get the ball rolling on this because time is of the essence.

From engagements with ports and industry it is known that ports and private entities are engaging in their own commercial discussions with ORE project developers to underpin the business case for port infrastructure developments, progression of the projects and timelines. It remains subject to the results of the auctions. On the CEF funding, this is significant now that it has been included. Again I want to commend the officials in my Department for including ORE and for fighting the fight at European level to ensure the CEF funding will include offshore renewable energy. The successful applicants can obtain grant funding of up to 50% of eligible costs for studies and 30% of infrastructure work costs. While Irish port projects were unsuccessful in 2021 in the CEF call, ports are preparing new applications for the 2022 CEF call. It is a competitive process and the Department is assisting those eligible applicants where appropriate. A lot of work is happening between the ports and industry, which is crucial. The funding must go to the right places and it must be guided through that engagement with industry.

I was pleased to participate at the Climate Change Advisory Council's and OECD team's launch event on 5 October, alongside the new environmental director at the OECD and the chair of the advisory council. My Department engaged collaboratively with the OECD team over the past year in the preparation of its review. The perspective in this report, that our transport system fosters growing car use and emissions by design, rightly reflects a systemic challenge that will require a systemic response. Our everyday transport and mobility patterns have been deeply embedded through a legacy of our past dispersed and low-density settlement patterns and policies and long-engrained mindsets that have established the primacy of private car usage over accessibility and more sustainable modes of travel. The report's key findings are clear. The most impactful and transformative measures we need to scale up and accelerate to achieve our highly ambitious emissions targets in transport are increased road space reallocation, the mainstreaming of on-demand shared services and enhanced communication strategies to encourage and support the required behavioural change in how we travel. All of these measures are reflected in our ambitions as set out in the Government's national sustainable mobility policy, SMP, and through the work of our SMP leadership group and pathfinder programme, which I launched recently. The wellbeing lens approach that the OECD team has used in the report will be key to ensuring that policies to decarbonise transport are framed in terms of the wider benefits to be achieved in terms of quality of life and health benefits. While electrification of our car fleet will remain an integral part of how we will achieve our 2030 emissions targets, we cannot rely on technology alone. We need to move away from systems and policies that continue to engender car dependency and hinder the possibility of efficiently managing our public space and thereby diminish public wellbeing. We must instead provide quality access through more sustainable and healthy transport modes. The findings and approach set out in the report will greatly inform the direction of travel in the transport chapter of the next climate action plan and the further work in delivering the sustainable mobility action plan.

However, this is being ignored west of the Shannon in the expansion of our rail services by Irish Rail. While I welcome the additional morning service to Mayo, why was the Galway to Athlone rail line ignored? This is despite Galway city being choked with traffic and despite the outer ring road in Galway being long-fingered again. This is despite the Government allocating €3 million to provide a passing loop at Oranmore railway station 18 months ago and despite the existing services from Athlone and Ballinasloe into Galway city being more akin to an Indian rail service than an Irish one because of the overcrowding on it.

I agree with that. That is why, yesterday, Government announced a significant and important decision on the investment of €170 million in Waterford to improve the rail service and put in a new sustainability bridge. That is why we are investing. The first top-line of our Recovery and Resilience Facility funding from the EU went to metropolitan rail services in Cork. That is why we are starting the process of reopening the Shannon Foynes line and committing, in the pathfinder projects, to put in new stations in the likes of Moyross to give communities these new services. I agree with the Deputy that Galway and the west has to be part of that as well. He mentioned the passing loop in Oranmore. There is also potential for further improvements to be made around Céannt Station and for double tracking and improving the overall level of service, particularly from the likes of Athenry or Athlone into Galway, so that people can commute by rail rather than by car, which is the curse of Galway's transport system at the present time. There is no restriction to the political side-----

I want a commitment from the Minister that we get our fair share of the 41 new carriages that are coming on track. I want a commitment from him, in the first instance, that we will get two new rail sets based in Athlone, the city-designate that everybody seems to be forgetting about, including one that shuttles between Galway, Ballinasloe and Athlone, connecting passengers with the Dublin-Mayo rail services, but also providing commuter rail services into Galway city. The second set should be used to shuttle between Mayo and Athlone to connect the Roscommon and Mayo passengers with the Galway-Dublin services. Those two sets alone would dramatically transform rail services throughout the west, connecting counties Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Westmeath for the first time since the foundation of the State and providing the type of transformation that the OECD is calling for.

There is huge potential in the services he mentioned. The allocation of those ICR carriages is a matter which Iarnród Éireann is going to have to decide on an operational basis.

What is interesting, and what I hear from the company, is that since we as a Government introduced a 50% reduction in fares for those under 24 and a 20% reduction for all passengers, there has been a massive increase in demand, particularly for the rail services outside the greater Dublin area. I do not disagree that where we provide high-quality public transport services, the people respond by taking them up. Another example that can be referenced is the reopening of rail services to Ennis from Limerick. People said it would never take off, but it has been hugely popular. I do not disagree with the Deputy on the potential for those shuttle services or ICR services from Athlone either up to Westport or down to Galway. That is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann.

My Department provides grant assistance to local authorities under the regional and local road grant programme for a range of targeted programmes, including the safety improvement programme. Applications are sought each year from local authorities under this programme for consideration for funding in the subsequent year. In this context, funding can be sought for traffic calming measures. When making an application, councils are asked to submit schemes in order of priority. I understand that Louth County Council has included traffic calming measures at Bellurgan National School in its 2023 safety improvement programme application. The 2023 allocations will be decided following consideration of councils' applications by the Department and the allocations will be notified to councils as part of the general grant allocation process early next year. As regards speed limits, the Road Traffic Act 2004 sets out default speed limits for the road network. Local authorities have the discretion to decide on varying these limits through special speed limit by-laws for roads within their administrative area. The making of such by-laws is a reserved function of the elected members of the council. Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, amended by section 86 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, sets out the range of special speed limits that may be applied through by-laws. To assist local authorities in the application of special speed limits, my Department's Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland is available on www.speedlimits.ie. This applies to all public roads and provides guidelines to local authorities, as the roads authorities in their administrative areas, on how to decide appropriate speed limits. In addition, I launched a speed limit appeals process in December 2021 that allows members of the public or interested parties to appeal an existing speed limit to the relevant road authority, with an option to escalate the appeal to a regional panel, should the applicant be dissatisfied with the road authority's decision. Further information on this process can be obtained on www.speedlimits.ie/appeals.

The parents have been out campaigning before school starts and alongside elected represented and others, to a degree, stopping traffic and more generally making a point of highlighting the dangers that are there. In fairness, the Minister has set out a number of options. I believe the local authority needs to be more proactive on this issue. There will be a need for me and others to deal with the community. We will have to look at reviewing the speed limits. I would like to think that the traffic calming measures would be considered favourably by the Department. This is a necessity. Beyond that, there probably needs to be an overall review across the board of that entire stretch of road and the run out to the Cooley Peninsula from Dundalk on the R173, which the Minister might know.

I know the character of the road. I see the need for measures to be taken. Just to provide details which might be useful for the Deputy in his own work on this issue, there are a number of grant headings under the safety improvement programme. One is for works costing less than €200,000 and there is a specific grant programme for works costing in excess of €200,000 and less than €5 million. It is open to local authorities to use their own resources as well to fund such measures. Specifically with regard to the Bellurgan National School, I understand that Louth County Council is seeking funding for the provision of traffic calming measures under the safety improvement programme for the school as part of its 2023 application. It will be considered for funding under that programme. Local authorities are asked to list proposed projects in order of priority on their applications.Louth County Council's safety improvement application was received on 26 October. Bellurgan traffic calming was listed among the 24 measures included. My Department's engineering inspectorate will review the overall application before recommendations on allocations are made.

I accept that the Minister is aware of the stretch of road in question. Perhaps we must look at the modalities and protocols by which we deal with wide stretches of roads with a considerable volume of traffic because of an increased number of people living nearby. Schools in the area are thriving and we must ensure they are safe places for parents, children and all others. I know that Councillor Watters attended a recent meeting in respect of the Bush Post Primary School in that region. The issue there relates to traffic calming and safety measures. I will follow up with the local authority. We need to ensure we can deliver a solution for these parents and children.

It seems that the right thing to do would be to try to manage the traffic issue when the school is being redeveloped. Traffic is an issue on that entire road. It is a wide road on which vehicles travel at high speed. The volumes of traffic are increasing. Change is needed.

The primary aim of the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2021-2030 is to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on Irish roads by 50%. As stated at the launch of the strategy in December 2021, this means reducing deaths on Ireland’s roads annually from 144 to 72 or lower and reducing serious injuries from 1,259 to 630 or lower by 2030. This will be the first step in Ireland’s journey towards realising Vision Zero, the international strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries, while increasing safe, healthy, equitable and sustainable mobility for all by 2050. Implementation of this ambitious strategy is supported by a comprehensive set of 186 high-impact and supporting actions. The strategy will be delivered over three phases with action plans for each. I am happy to reassure the Deputy that my Department, in conjunction with stakeholders and associated Government agencies, is well under way in the delivery of phase 1 for 2021 to 2024. The subsequent phases 2 and 3 of the strategy and their associated actions will be developed in the six months leading up to the launch of each of those phases. This development will, in each case, take account of a review of the action outcomes of the preceding phase of the strategy. As I have no doubt the Deputy will agree, the delivery of an ambitious strategy such as this requires a robust governance structure, and I assure him that this is currently in place to support and enable what is essentially a transformative road safety programme. At the top of this framework sits the ministerial committee on road safety, which I chair jointly with the Minister for Justice. A senior officials' group, comprising senior figures from the key bodies charged with implementing the published road safety actions for each phase of the strategy, known as the road safety transformation partnership board, stands below the ministerial committee. This cross-departmental, multi-agency partnership board provides executive accountability, advice and quarterly updates to the ministerial committee on the delivery of the Government’s strategy. Both the ministerial committee and the road safety transformation partnership board meet quarterly. Supporting the road safety action owners charged with implementing various aspects of the strategy are a number of cross-agency enabler groups, including a legislative enabler group.

We have a strategy and the Minister of State outlined the activity relating to it, the various groups and enablers involved. When it comes down to it, we are going in the wrong direction. We know that to be the case. Instead of decreasing, the number of accidents and near-misses is increasing. Most regrettably, the number of fatalities and serious injuries is increasing. We are told time and again that the biggest deterrent is, understandably, the fear of being caught. Over a two-year period, there has been a 5% reduction in the number of roads police while there has been a 14% increase in fatalities. Is that priority number one for the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice? Will it be addressed immediately?

The chairmanship of the high-level ministerial group is shared by me and the Minister for Justice. I am equally concerned with the number of road deaths and serious injuries on our roads. I acted quickly during the summer as a result of the increase in serious injuries and deaths on our roads to bring forward regulations. We are also working on legislative proposals but the regulations allowed for an immediate response. The real killers on our roads are speed, people using mobile phones while driving, not obeying traffic wardens outside schools and not wearing seat belts. People ignoring basic rules of the road is causing a considerable number of serious injuries and deaths on our roads. I doubled the fines in respect of such offences. I absolutely agree that enforcement is key. The role of enforcement lies with the Garda, which is represented on that committee. The Garda has rolled out extra speeding enforcement points throughout the country. We have an ongoing collaborative engagement with the Garda and if more needs to be done, it will be done.

That analysis could be done more frequently. There needs to be a focus on this issue and policing makes a serious difference, as we know. This is something we can and should do. There are a number of other measures to consider. We have seen an increasing number of people caught with poly drug use. There is a need for enabling legislation to allow for sanctions in that regard. Is that something the Minister of State will bring forward? There has been a consistent call for an online portal to allow people to upload footage from dashboards or helmet cameras. Will she consider that? On a related issue, the road hauliers have raised an issue in respect of the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 relating to the national fleet database. Will the Minister of State meet with that group in advance of the remaining Stages of that Bill?

The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is also represented on that high-level ministerial group. Those areas were considered in the road safety strategy and we are making progress in that regard. I am in regular contact with the Irish Road Hauliers Association, IRHA, and the Freight Transit Association of Ireland, FTAI. Those organisations know that my door is always open for them to raise any issues with me. That is no problem. The Bill the Deputy mentioned is currently going through the Seanad. It has been approved by the Dáil and has passed Second Stage in the Seanad. We hope to proceed to Committee Stage as soon as possible. More enforcement measures are included in the Bill, which regulates e-scooters and e-bikes. It aims to eradicate antisocial behaviour related to scramblers through increased Garda powers and the seizure and banning of the use of scramblers. Those are just a few of the relevant measures. Work is progressing on the legislative process.

Enhancing and decarbonising our public transport systems forms a key pillar of the Government's climate action strategy. Investment in public transport has increased in line with Government policy to encourage modal shift and planned capital expenditure under the national development plan favours new public transport schemes over road projects on a 2:1 ratio. The Environmental Protection Agency's provisional 2021 emissions data demonstrate that public transport is responsible for less than 5% of Ireland’s overall transport emissions. When considered in terms of land transport emissions, road-based bus services, which carry the majority of public transport passengers, are responsible for approximately 7% of total road transport emissions. Climate Action Plan 2021 set out our target to have 1,500 electric buses deployed in our public service obligation fleet and an expansion to the network of electrified rail services. Over the past year, my Department has been working with transport modelling teams on the identification of a pathway to achieve a 50% reduction in transport emissions by 2030 and these public transport measures are estimated to deliver 0.4 mega tonne of the total 6 mega tonne annual emissions reduction that is needed by 2030. This transition has already begun. Last year 250 new hybrid buses for PSO bus fleets were delivered, which has been followed by the first orders for fully battery-electric buses which were placed in July 2021 and March 2022. That will see these 45 single-deck buses and 120 double-deck buses, respectively, delivered by end year. We have also engaged in the purchase of the first battery-electric rail services, which will have a significant role in improving the public transport service. Thirteen five-car battery-electric units and six five-car electric multiple units were ordered in December 2021 and I expect to do more. I look forward to the Deputy's feedback. That on its own will not be enough. As I said in response to a question from Deputy Naughten earlier, we will need to go further with a range of actions to meet our target. I would happily discuss that further with the Deputy.

I could not sum together the numbers, but it sounded that 0.4 mega tonnes would be less than one third of the impact of public transport. It sounds like we have some way to go given the decisions already taken. Can we quickly move to a path? For example, we could move fairly rapidly to achieve an electric taxi fleet in our key cities. It would need minimal roll-out of EV charging networks to support them. Are we now dependent and new technologies like hydrogen to achieve 51% within the fleet? Could we have a very clear pathway for each of the elements of the fleet within 12 months just to see how we stand and what more do we need to do?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	47	The Deputy is absolutely right on the taxi fleet. That is one area where we can make significant changes. Because taxis are used extensively, as well as the vehicles themselves if they switch over, the kilometres they do as a percentage of our overall kilometres is significant. In that regard there are encouraging signs showing we can change. We introduced very generous grants for the switchover. Already 1,177 fully electric taxis, 3,300 hybrid taxis and 40 plug-in hybrid taxis have been introduced into the taxi fleet, representing 24% of the fleet. The taxi drivers using them realise that their running costs and maintenance costs which are important for the taxi industry are a fraction of the fossil fuel alternative. Regarding the fleet, I agree we need to look at the technology, but we also need to look at the usage particularly of buses. Part of the problem is that those buses are caught in traffic just like all other vehicles. Traffic in Dublin was intense yesterday for a variety of reasons. We need to give buses the space. It is not just the technology, but also their turnaround speed. The efficiency of passenger kilometres because of the buses being used more often is key.

It would justify a significant initiative by the Department to pull together all the interests in that area - the providers, drivers and various agencies that support them - to make a concerted effort in that area. It may need more public money to prime the pump. I also agree that high utilisation of our bus fleet and the wider public transport fleet is crucial. Is there any innovative thinking on how we can get higher utilisation from our fleets apart from the congestion charge, which would obviously help? A very substantial fleet of buses remains idle for most of the day. Is higher utilisation and finding new more carbon-efficient public transport vehicles a potential avenue?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	49	This was discussed in an earlier question. The OECD report, commissioned by the Climate Change Advisory Council, provides the model for how we do this and it requires systemic change. Central to that is the reallocation of road space to provide the priority bus lanes which get efficiency. The more frequent services we have, the more people will use it. That also benefits the taxi fleet which has access to the same bus lanes and will get the same prioritisation. They are in a sense part of what the OECD argued for - a move towards a much more car-sharing system. Taxis, in effect, provide that in a very useful way. The key question for local authorities and Members is whether we are willing and able to make the fast reallocation of road space possible to get our entire transport system working, not just for decarbonisation but because the current system with the roads clogged with cars does not work for anyone. The gridlock witnessed in Dublin city centre yesterday evening cannot be solved other than by improvement in public transport services and active travel.

One of the best ways of introducing people to that and giving them flexibility is bike sharing. What are the Minister's plans for station-less bike sharing schemes in Dublin and other cities?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	51	I will again refer to the OECD report I just mentioned, which sets out a requirement for large behavioural change in the direction of sustainable modes, travel reductions and shared mobility. Along with road space reallocation and communication efforts to address car-centric mindsets, it identifies the mainstreaming of on-demand shared services as one of the policy areas with a high transformative potential to reduce car dependency. My Department's national sustainable mobility policy, SMP, was published in April. It sets out a strategic framework for promoting active travel and public transport in line with targets under the climate action plan. Action 87 of the SMP seeks to "expand shared car, bike and powered personal transporters (PPT) services at transport hubs and interchanges" and has an output to develop a strategy for the roll-out of expanded shared services next year. The NTA, which is leading on this action, has confirmed that it is undertaking a study into the provision of shared station-less e-bike schemes in the greater Dublin area and how it is expected to evolve over the coming years. This study will examine issues such as licensing and management to ensure an equitable distribution of shared e-bikes across the greater Dublin area. The report is expected to be completed in the first quarter of next year. The SMP recognises the need to promote the adoption of shared mobility schemes and the integration of newer modes, such as electric scooters, with other modes and our public transport system. While Ireland already has examples of shared car and bike schemes, mainly in the five cities, policy and market development in the area of shared mobility continue to evolve, particularly the expansion of on-demand micro transport services. My Department regularly engages with key stakeholders in this area and is planning further engagement through the delivery, next year of a national sustainable mobility forum. The real beacon of hope is what we saw in Finglas - the Deputy attended its opening - where Dublin City Council put in a shared e-bike, car-sharing and charging system on council land. We might look to replicate that model across the city and other cities. I would be interested to hear the Deputy's experience of how that is working and whether it could be replicated across other areas in the city.

I served for ten years on Dublin City Council and I am passionate about bike sharing because I saw how Dublin Bikes worked and how much the people of the city love it.I am often asked when it will expand. We know the technology has moved on and we are moving towards to stationless bikes. We also see a worrying trend in other cities where bike sharing companies are withdrawing from the market. I would like to see a model similar to that which we operate for buses. Let the NTA own the fleet and buy the 5,000 bikes we need in the city, after which we could issue a tender for existing companies to provide that service. That would ensure interoperability. It would also ensure that the State had control if any company were to encounter financial difficulties and ensure universal coverage. There is the matter of picking and choosing where parts of the city have this service and others do not.

Dublin City Council led it out and the public loved it. I also agree that we now need to look at the next stage. I am speaking about Dublin and the supply to other cities to make sure bike schemes expand into other areas. It is confined and relatively restricted at the moment. I am interested in having that concept included in the study and the ongoing discussion. We do not want to interfere with what is for many people a successful working model for a number of different companies. We must be careful not to lose the good services we currently have. There has been significant roll-out. On the issue of the stationless system, that has worked and we have found that it is a viable model. This is a matter of striking a balance between making sure we do not lose what is working and looking at expansion.

We need to work with existing companies but many of them are telling us that the capital costs of providing e-bikes across the whole city are significant and the State should be involved. They are, however, happy to be involved in the operation and delivery of the service. That would give the State control and provide stability in the city as people would know the bikes were owned by the State but operated by the different companies. The existing companies are open to dealing with the NTA and I have written extensively to the NTA on the matter. It says the capital expenditure is there but it needs a small budget allocation for the operation of such a scheme. I know we have done it in other cities and I think we could do it in Dublin.

I mentioned an example in Finglas where Dublin City Council had installed and facilities for e-car and e-bike charging. That was attractive and it could be an opportunity to provide access to a variety of different providers. I am looking at the climate fund to see if we could support such infrastructure being rolled out on a much more widespread basis in our five cities as a way of encouraging private operators into this space. The municipal authorities could provide some of the physical infrastructure, particularly for e-car charging. That will not be a small project but it could be done in an open way. That is one example that I am keen to look at as a way of giving a real stimulus to e-bike sharing and e-car sharing systems.

It provides a useful profile of port infrastructure and the proposed development plans of the port companies for both fixed and floating installations. Ireland has ambitious plans with regard to the development of offshore renewable energy in the seas around Ireland. This report aligns with the Government policy I published last December on the facilitation of offshore renewable energy by Irish commercial ports in identifying that a number of port facilities will be required for deployment activity and that multiple ports will be needed for operation and maintenance operations. Delivery of the necessary infrastructure is ongoing in ports to address the requirements of industry. Ireland will potentially need to build on a phased basis four or five standard offshore renewable energy port facilities, each of which should be capable of building 500 MW of offshore renewable energy annually that will act as construction and deployment points over the next 25 to 30 years. In addition, a number of smaller ports will be required for offshore renewable energy operations and maintenance activities. A multi-port approach will ultimately allow investments that are commercially viable in the long-term to progress without undermining the ability of any port to meet its primary obligations in relation to the facilitation of international trade. Officials in the Department have engaged with Wind Energy Ireland in relation to the study and the association along with Marine Renewable Energy Ireland. They made a presentation last month to the offshore renewable energy port's co-ordination group which is chaired by the Department of Transport. In relation to the study recommendations directed at the Department, arrangements are already being made to facilitate a more regular exchange of views and updates between the Department and industry representative associations. With regard to funding, it is envisaged that like all port infrastructure, offshore renewable energy facilities will be funded through a combination of port revenues, EU funding and borrowing from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, the European Investment Bank, EIB, and other financial institutions. My Department is already engaging with the various institutions, including the European Commission, about the availability of funding for ports in providing offshore renewable energy infrastructure to meet EU and Ireland's ambitions. In relation to other recommendations, significant work is ongoing at official level across a number of Departments to accelerate a drive delivery and to capture the longer term potential in this area.

I am particularly interested in the west. Galway and Limerick have a major role to play as we develop our offshore resource. This is strongly linked to the development of rail. This issue is not just a matter of offshore renewable energy but about shifting rail freight from east to west. There is a fantastic opportunity in the Minister of State’s neck of the woods with the western rail corridor to bring that infrastructure down the coast. We have good news on the Shannon Foynes line as well. There is a fantastic opportunity for the west coast. I am concerned by the language used about developing on a phased basis. I echo the Taoiseach’s words from COP27 that we do not have a minute to lose. We need to go full steam ahead to develop this infrastructure as fast as we can. We need to move from the thinking that we develop the east coast first, then get to the south and then move to the west. We need to develop all our infrastructure as fast as possible.

I know that all ports across the country, many of which the Minister and I have visited, are working on their own plans to tap into the opportunities in operation and maintenance in the west, for example, in Galway. With regard to Shannon Foynes, the Minister attended the launch of the port's Vision 2041 strategic review. I congratulate Shannon Foynes Port Company and Bechtel on their report, which sets out the opportunity in the Shannon Estuary as a hub for facilitating the development of offshore wind along with the production of clean fuels, including green hydrogen, ammonia and methanol. This is a multi-port approach and our ports are positioning themselves. They are working with the Department and looking at funding opportunities, for example, the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, to which I alluded earlier, which is potentially capable of providing funding for studies and infrastructure across our ports. There is, therefore, substantial work taking place between industry, the Department and the ports examining what is required, particularly in the run-up to the approaching auctions.

I encourage the Government to leave no stone unturned in developing all our ports as quickly as possible. An important point to make about the development of these sports is that they are keystone projects in realising a wider and positive vision.We in this country can be accused of siloing many of our challenges, but the ports unlock a great deal of potential for the country to shift from being a carbon-intensive society. I talk about my neck of the woods much of the time, but I will speak about the wider vision for a moment. If we can develop Foynes as an offshore hub and start to develop the west coast resource and towns like Foynes, Askeaton and Adare as well as Limerick city, the benefit will extend all the way up the west coast. The offshore renewable potential is an opportunity to achieve balanced regional development, something that the State has not achieved since its inception 100 years ago.

Every port has its role to play, for example, Shannon Foynes in terms of larger infrastructure development and Galway and smaller ports in terms of operations and maintenance. I am encouraged by the engagement between our ports and industry on working towards potential funding opportunities at EU level, for example, from the EIB and the ISIF. This is a very large endeavour and is ambitious, as it has to be. As the Deputy and I both know from living on the west coast, its offshore renewable energy potential is the new oil reserve that we need to tap into. Everything that can be done is being done. Industry must work with the ports and the Department and we must ensure that our ports are best placed to tap into funding, which will be done through their engagement with industry. It is about having the right infrastructure in the right place to tap into our offshore renewable space.

To support the timely delivery of park-and-ride sites and a cohesive overall programme, the NTA established the park and ride development office, PRDO, in February 2020. The office provides design services to assist in the delivery of park-and-ride projects across the State. Regarding Galway, the PRDO has undertaken site option analyses and feasibility studies and is currently preparing a park-and-ride strategy for the Galway metropolitan area. The PRDO engaged with Galway city and county councils to discuss potential park-and-ride sites. A draft strategy was presented to Galway City Council on 10 October and a similar presentation will be made to Galway County Council this December. The draft strategy includes proposals for three bus-based strategic park-and-ride sites, the upgrade and expansion of the rail-based park-and-ride site at Oranmore, and two further possible future park-and-ride sites. The PRDO is continuing detailed site option analyses and feasibility studies of each of the zones identified and these are expected to be completed in the coming months, taking into account the outcome of the strategy consultation with stakeholders. It should be noted that the development of particular sites will be aligned with the delivery of other supporting infrastructure, in particular bus corridor infrastructure. The NTA expects that the planning consent processes will commence in mid-2023.

Park-and-ride facilities have been in its development plans since 2005 and we are now in 2022. The one glaring error in the Minister's script was the statement that the NTA had "long recognised the importance of high-capacity park-and-ride facilities". No one has recognised it except the councillors in Galway and the people who included such facilities in the city development plan in 2005. Management and the NTA have failed to roll them out. They are only one part of the solution to the traffic congestion in Galway - clearly, the other part is the beginning of a feasibility study on light rail - but the development of park-and-ride facilities will stretch into 2023 or 2024 and there is no consideration of such facilities on the west side of the city at all. The Minister is committed to public transport. People want to use it. We have a city choked by traffic because all of the eggs went into the basket of an outer bypass, which I never had any time for in the first place and which has gone down another cul-de-sac.

The specific locations of the park-and-ride sites, the details of which I presume have been shared with Galway City Council, are at the likes of the M6-N6 junction on the way into the city, the N83 north of Claregalway and Oranmore railway station. For them to work, bus services must be prioritised. If we are going to install park-and-ride facilities for public transport, which is the right approach, then that public transport also has to work. One of the reasons we have included the cross-city public transport link in our Galway pathfinder project is that those public transport services have to be delivered in the next two years. We have set that as a 2025 target in all of our pathfinder projects. Integration of any park-and-ride service with a wider upgrade of public transport and active travel systems within the city is critical. This has been one of the main issues. I heard what the Deputy said about Galway councillors being supportive, but we must also make difficult decisions on the likes of the N83 and the other approach roads to ensure that the bus priority that we would be depending on worked. That is probably one of the most critical issues alongside the question of how we deliver park-and-ride sites.

Management and Government policy has gone down the route of an outer bypass and pursued no other solution. All of the other solutions are premised on the outer bypass, which is about to be quashed by An Bord Pleanála. A decision will have to be made on whether to send the proposal back to An Bord Pleanála after the board ignored what management in Galway city and county councils called a technical or narrow issue, namely, climate change. That is the mentality that is in charge of transformative action. It is not possible to get transformative action with that kind of mentality. We need leadership. Park-and-ride facilities cannot work without lifting traffic from the roads. Traffic can be lifted from the roads in a myriad of ways, for example, light rail, park-and-ride facilities, school transport, etc. Today, I heard that the council was finally going to consider a new road for the R336 separately from the outer bypass. It has taken 20 or 30 years for the council to see that it should be considering that route independently.

I believe in the cross-city link. There is an opportunity for us to show that we can develop alternative public transport systems that work for the people of the city more than anyone else. Visitors are also critical, of course. We need public transport services, active travel and other measures that allow us to meet the climate change targets. The Deputy is correct, in that the scale of change needed to meet the 50% reduction in transport emissions and to reach net zero within three decades is beyond compare. Doing nothing is not an option. Ignoring climate change is not an option. That is not because of national law or European law, but because of the health, wealth and well-being of citizens in Galway. This will be a better system if we go with low-carbon, high-quality public transport, active travel, park-and-ride and other services. It is not impossible. It is a question of political will at local and national levels. I believe the political will exists across all parties, but now we have to deliver on it.

Has the Minister plans to implement a new public transport security strategy and will he include An Garda Síochána in any discussion on such a strategy? My view, which I will outline when I speak again, is that there has been an unhelpful stoking of the issue by some in politics, but the matter can be resolved through increased regular staffing and better co-ordination with An Garda Síochána.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	70	I agree that the safety and security of public transport passengers and staff are critical matters that first and foremost must be managed by every transport company, working with An Garda Síochána, where appropriate. There are currently no plans to develop an overarching public transport security strategy. My Department and the National Transport Authority engage regularly with the public transport operators on the issue of security and ensuring the safety of passengers and staff. The NTA has established a working group on antisocial behaviour, which meets monthly to discuss any developing trends and share best practices. Further, each of the operators has its own safety and security policies in place to deal with issues such as antisocial behaviour and they have introduced a number of initiatives in recent years to help combat the issue. These include increased investment in CCTV, text alert systems and joint initiatives with An Garda Síochána such as Operation Twin Tracks. There has been a 50% increase in spending on rail security in the past five years, from €3.7 million in 2016 to €5.7 million last year. Additionally, as part of my Department's sustainable mobility plan, the NTA has committed to develop and publish an annual public transport passenger safety and personal security report, and to implement measures where appropriate. It should also be noted that the NTA meets regularly with An Garda Síochána and operator security managers to improve the security measures across all public transport services. The combined interventions implemented to date across all public transport services have substantially helped to tackle antisocial behaviour. This issue will, however, require ongoing monitoring. As such, I am committed to working collectively with all stakeholders to ensure the safest possible travel environment for members of the public and the safest possible working environment for the employees who provide our valuable public transport services.

Over the years, we have made a virtue of having staffless rail stations. This has been a problem. If we had the traditional stationmasters as well as workers present on platforms, who have authority by virtue of being public transport workers, it would go a long way towards increasing security so people can feel safe on our public transport system. We used to have inspectors on Dublin Bus. We need to go back to a system where we have inspectors. They are not there to throw their weight around but to provide passive security and passive surveillance. If we do that, along with measures such as CCTV and so on, which are already in place, it would help. That is where we need to go with regard to security.

It is important that we address whether that is key, one way or the other. I recently visited a new control centre being built by Iarnród Éireann. It is an amazing facility behind Heuston Station. There we are seeing co-location of An Garda Síochána services with the Irish Rail management system. That this points in the right direction. We should have a continuing close connection between Irish Rail and An Garda Síochána. That co-location will further improve and develop that. I had a meeting yesterday with our rail safety commissioner whose job it is to assess safety and review any accidents in the rail service. I asked him his view on whether we would be better off with a separate service. He firmly said "No". He felt that, as the Deputy said, the better operation of the existing systems would give a better return. Last year, the NTA produced a significant report, Travelling in a Woman's Shoes, which addressed the issue of a wider sense of safety. The report stated, as the Deputy also said, that it is often design, presence, lighting and other basic safety features which are very important. It is not just about policing. It can be about presence, the local environment around public transport stations and so on. Following the recommendations of that report is a key and integral part of making the system safer for everyone.

I do not agree with having a separate transport police or the private outsourcing of security. I do not like the level of security on the Luas because it adds to the degree to which people feel unsafe. Rather than increasing security measures on public transport, I would rather see traditional staffing levels improved across our public transport system in line with a stronger, more rigorous and more visible Garda presence, where and how appropriate. I ask that we get to back to first principles in the context of staffing and having a presence on the platforms and also, where we have difficulties in peak hours on certain services, that there is a Garda strategy in place that people can understand and people can see. We will not have gardaí on every bus, and nobody is saying that. We need to move towards having a system where we can have traditional transport workers who are visible to the public and making them feel safe. That should be the first measure in improving the security and safety on our public transport system.

We talk to different people and they give us different perspectives, while the situation for passengers and workers on public transport continues to deteriorate. We do not have much rail in my county but we have a lot of buses. Navan services in particular have been pointed out by the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, as having real challenges. Rather than backbench and Opposition Deputies talking around the houses on this matter, the Government needs to come up with a strategy and a plan. Sinn Féin has put forward proposals, not for a separate transport police but for a unit within An Garda Síochána. If that is not the right solution, I ask the Minister to find the right solution to make public transport safe for people to use and work in.

I agree that we do not need a separate policing service but from my long experience on the Luas, I believe that company's system, which is often about fare evasion as much as is policing, provides a welcome and secure presence. Those workers and that company do a good job in that regard. I do not believe gardaí will check for fares and so on. I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that it is an issue also for bus services and in particular spots or areas. As we all know, there are times, especially late at night, when people can feel very insecure. I agree that this requires further action and real attention. It is vital that people feel safe. The report, Travelling in a Woman's Shoes, points to the safety aspect, which applies to all of us - men, women, children and older people. Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are taking real action on that. They recognise the issue for the safety and security of their drivers as well as for passengers. This will require further fitting of CCTV cameras. It is also critical that they have an ability to use radio and other systems.

There are horror stories about the failure of buses to turn up at all or on time, in particular Go-Ahead buses. We have had similar complaints at the transport committee, at which Go-Ahead and Dublin Bus appeared today. I put it to the Minister very simply that the reason this is happening is the inability of bus companies to recruit and retain bus workers. That is because the pay and conditions for bus workers are so poor and because of the pressure of competitive tendering imposed by the NTA, the Minister and successive of Ministers for Transport.

I am acutely aware of the service issues currently being experienced across the public transport network in Dublin and the negative impact it is having on the travelling public. I reassure the House that I and my officials have met with senior management from the National Transport Authority in relation to these service issues and we are keeping the situation under close review. Unfortunately, many operators are experiencing staffing difficulties at present, both as a result of Covid-19 related absences and also in relation to recruiting new drivers. The NTA is working closely with operators to try to mitigate the impacts of these staff shortages through recruitment campaigns in recent months, engagement with the RSA to expedite the testing and licence process and working with operators to minimise service cancellations. Further, in instances where operators have failed to meet the performance standards agreed in the public service obligation contracts, the NTA has applied financial penalties to those operators. The steps being taken by the NTA and operators are positive ones but it is the case that different sectors of the labour market are experiencing recruitment difficulties post-Covid 19 for a variety of reasons.My Department has engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with regard to the potential inclusion of bus drivers on the critical skills and ineligible occupations lists which determine roles that are in critical short supply or ineligible for employment permits. I firmly believe we need to expand our public transport offering in Dublin and across the country. We are committed to funding further expansion of public transport services next year and the details and phasing of that expansion are currently being considered. The right pay and conditions for workers are vital so that the system works for them, just as it will then work for passengers. We are committed to that as part of the overall solution to making the switch in the transport system we need to make.

I think it is the third most stressful job you can have. With traffic congestion in Dublin and so on, that is made even worse. Competitive tendering is creating a race to the bottom and Go-Ahead Ireland is the worst offender. It haemorrhaged bus drivers over the last year because pay and, particularly, conditions, including lack of work-life balance and long shifts, were so bad. That is also causing problems for Dublin Bus. When Dublin Bus workers rejected by 85% an attempt to further deteriorate their conditions, work-life balance and shifts, what was the main selling point of the company in trying to ram that deal down their throat? It was the need to compete with Go-Ahead Ireland. That is what they said. Go-Ahead Ireland is leading the race to the bottom. Competitive tendering and privatisation are creating the conditions where bus drivers do not want to join these companies. People do not want to be bus drivers because the pay, conditions, work-life balance and shifts are so flipping awful. That has to be addressed and privatisation is an obstacle to that. Go-Ahead Ireland exacerbates it and the ordinary user of bus services faces the horror stories I have in front of me concerning the 175, the 17, the 75 and the 114 not turning up, turning up hours late and so on.

Mortgage interest tax relief was phased out on a gradual basis from 2009 to 2020. The decision to abolish mortgage interest tax relief was taken in the wake of the financial crisis, with the cost of the relief being one of the influencing factors. Mortgage interest relief cost over €700 million in 2008. In the recent budget, the Government introduced measures, including a large range of one-off measures, which will help families and households with the increasing cost of living. These measures included a tax package of over €1.1 billion. Therefore, I do not have any plans to reintroduce mortgage interest tax relief at this time.  Prior to its curtailment and eventual abolition, as was pointed out by the 2009 Commission on Taxation, in 2005 the top two income deciles accounted for close to half of the tax forgone through mortgage interest tax relief. As the European Central Bank, ECB, has changed its monetary policy since the summer, the average interest rate on new Irish mortgages has broadly held steady and the difference between here and the Eurozone average has declined.

I am fully aware that the interest hikes are yet to be felt by all mortgage holders. Hopefully the bank will continue to absorb these hikes. Time will tell, but it is likely that some of that will change. For those on trackers, there has been an immediate impact. Those with an outstanding balance of €200,000 will see their repayments increase next year by more than €2,000. That is a big jump for anybody who is already under pressure. The Central Bank has noted that 54% of outstanding mortgage balance is in variable mortgages and says we will likely see an immediate increase in mortgage interest costs when rates rise. There is capacity. The Minister gave a figure but there are other figures, depending on the rate at which mortgage interest relief is introduced and at whom it is targeted. In one year, for example, it cost just over €50 million. There is scope and capacity for a targeted, tailored and time-bound form of mortgage interest relief. Does the Minister not recognise that households that have seen their repayments increase by over €2,000 in six months are looking to the Government to help them deal with this shock with a tailored measure that targets mortgage interest relief?

I have outlined what the cost was in 2008. The most recent data, from the end of June, indicate there are currently 720,000 mortgage accounts with an average outstanding balance of €137,100 at an interest rate of 2.5%. Assuming mortgage interest relief was granted at a rate of 20% on the average interest payment, such a reintroduction would cost in the region of €500 million per annum. In seeking to understand the background to the Deputy's proposal, I sought the budget proposals Sinn Féin published before budget day but they have been removed from the Sinn Féin website and are no longer available. The Sinn Féin alternative budget for 2022 is available but that for 2023 is no longer on the website. Will the Deputy explain to the House why that is the case?

For people struggling with gas, electricity, food, petrol and diesel prices over the last six months, to be told they have to pay an extra €2,000 in mortgage repayments on a typical family home with an outstanding balance of €200,000 is a huge wallop. They are looking to the Government to support them. There are ways in which it can be done. We are working with the Central Bank and the office of parliamentary costings to cost proposals. For example, we can look at the cost of the increased interest rate. The Minister is talking about the old measure brought in before the financial crash, which looked at all interest paid. What is needed is a targeted, tailored measure that deals with the shock households have faced. The Minister can dismiss as this suggestion, as his Government has done, but he has form in this regard. He dismissed a renter's tax credit; now he is forced to introduced it. He dismissed an eviction ban; yet he has been forced to introduce it. I ask him to look at this in the interests not of who is bringing it forward but of those individuals impacted by these increases.

However, those hard-pressed households, the citizens of Ireland who are experiencing such strain, also have an expectation that any proposals that will be brought forward will be affordable, will make sense and will not create new risks for our country. The Deputy's party is now advocating that the State pay a share of increasing mortgage bills in the time ahead. His party has said it wants the State to pay each renter a month's rent. It has advocated a proposal in respect of energy price caps, which the Government in the United Kingdom is committed to ending.

If I want to find out about its proposals for the budget we are debating, they are gone. Why are they gone? The reason they are gone is that the proposals Sinn Féin brings forward will be a source of risk and undermine our public finances. By doing so, and by the party's pretending there is money available for everything, it runs the risk of making the problems I know our country has even worse. I therefore ask the Deputy again: why are the budget proposals Sinn Féin lauded so much in the run-up to this budget gone from its website?

Markets expect the ECB to continue raising rates until the middle of next year, with a peak of 3% anticipated. Tracker mortgage holders, as we know, have already felt the impact, and variable-rate mortgage holders are next in the firing line. Has the Minister's Department carried out any assessment at this stage of the impact of rising rates on Irish mortgages? Will the Central Bank require any more tools, in the Minister's view, to help to protect vulnerable mortgage holders in the time ahead?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	95	I thank the Deputy for raising that point. Yes, of course we are monitoring the impact that rising interest rates are having on the cost of living and on families, households and businesses. The Central Bank has not approached me looking for additional powers or tools to deal with the consequences of that impact. As the Deputy will be aware, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears already sets out the provisions under our consumer protection code to help borrowers in borrowing distress. We recognise the great difficulty that is there. As Deputy Nash will know, however, in February 2017 a number of increased protections for mortgage holders were brought in. Those measures were then provided for in an addendum to the consumer protection code of 2012. That brings forward measures that aim to improve the level of information provided to borrowers on variable rates annually. It also indicates the responsibilities that sit upon banks when dealing with mortgage holders who find themselves in the position of distress to which the Deputy refers. I appreciate the seriousness of this matter. I believe that the consumer protection provision we have in place is adequate. I do not believe that bringing in new changes to our tax code is appropriate at the moment. I believe that the cost of doing so would be very high and that the measures we have in place in our protection code for consumers, for our citizens, are adequate. They will always be monitored and kept under review.

I have never requested that. That is not what my question seeks to do. Thankfully, the main lenders in the market have held off raising their variable mortgage interest rates to date, but I think there is a certain inevitability that those rates will rise over the coming period. Figures released by the Central Bank yesterday show that the average rate for new mortgages fell by six basis points compared with the figures in August, and that is a good thing. We are moving now towards more of a European norm in respect of variable mortgage interest rates. That said, the reality is that we will probably move back to where we were over the past few years when banks inevitably increase mortgage rates over the coming period. There are 250,000 people on trackers. After the most recent ECB hike, a couple with about €200,000 left on their mortgage could end up paying the equivalent of three weeks' wages more in mortgage repayments later this year. Loading those kinds of repayments on already stretched households could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. I ask the Minister to keep a watching brief on this with the Central Bank.

As I said, we will continue to monitor the adequacy of the consumer protection code that is in place. I believe, however, that it is robust and that the Central Bank and other authorities will take very carefully their responsibilities to ensure that borrowers who find themselves in positions of distress receive the necessary information and are made aware of the options available to them. I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of some of the changes that have taken place in our mortgage market recently. It is worth noting that the differential between the Irish and the average euro interest rate for new mortgages declined from 1.4% at the end of 2021 to 0.4% at the end of August of this year. I hope that this kind of narrowing will play a role in moderating what I know will still be considerable difficulty for many households and for businesses. We will monitor the code that is in place, but I believe it is fit for purpose to deal with the challenges that could develop.

The perverse reality is that the environment we are in at the moment, as interest rates go up, means that bank profitability will go up as well. I would like the Government to send a signal, and this House should send a signal, that banks should, given the climate at the moment, absorb as many of these interest rate rises as they possibly can and avoid passing them on to variable-rate mortgage customers, especially at this really difficult time. Given the normalisation, if we can call it that, of mortgage interest rates in Ireland at this point in time, the likelihood is that we will go back to the point at which we had been, with the second highest rates in the eurozone over the last few years, when interest rate rises are passed on, and in the context of the fact that Ulster Bank and KBC are exiting the market. It is inevitable that the mortgage lenders there at present will take advantage of and exploit that and exploit their advantage in the market.

I agree, however, with one of the Deputy's points, that is, that in the time ahead it will continue to be important to monitor competitive changes within our marketplace. He is correct in acknowledging that because of the move in Ireland from a five-bank model to what will become a three-bank model, there will be a reduction in the number and diversity of mortgage offerings as the number of banks in our country begins to change. For all those reasons we will continue to evaluate what happens. I go back, however, to the earlier and the important question the Deputy put to me about our consumer protection code and my belief and judgment that it is adequate.

We heard at a meeting of the finance committee from experts, including the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and those impacted by the mica scandal, that the sum impact of the levy will lead directly to increased building costs and challenge the viability of housing projects. Those are not my words; they are what the society is saying, what the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, is saying and what those affected by mica are saying. Is there any chance of the Government reversing this decision?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	101	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. As he will know, the decision on the defective concrete products levy arose from the decision of November 2021 to respond to the great harm that has been caused to so many people, including many of the Deputy's constituents, due to the presence of mica in their homes and buildings. As part of the work undertaken on the impact the levy would have on the construction sector, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage commissioned a bottom-up scientific analysis, which was carried out by an independent construction economics cost consultant, to help to identify the likely impact of the levy on construction costs.This report was produced in September 2022 and took account of the prevailing relevant costs in the construction sector as they applied at the time they were prepared. The costs set out in the report are for the third quarter of 2022 and account for inflation up to that point. Revised figures have not been prepared since, given that it has only been a short time since the report was prepared and published. The report was on the impact of the levy as announced in my budget 2023 speech and is a cost assessment based on a levy of 10%. As the rate of the levy published in the Finance Bill 2022 has been reduced to 5%, the costings in the analysis can be reduced by approximately 50%. These are the hard costs of between €400 and €800 for a typical three-bed semi-detached house and of between €375 and €550 per apartment for a typical six-floor apartment block with a basement carpark. When soft costs are added, the figures move ahead of those given. The percentage increases are approximately 0.2% to 0.45% for a typical semi-detached dwelling and 0.15% to 0.2% for a typical apartment for both hard and soft costs. I continue to believe this measure is appropriate.

The impact is very clear; it is negative. It will be negative for those struggling to rebuild their homes in Donegal and right down the coast. It will be negative for the victims of the mica scandal. It will also be negative in respect of the viability of housing projects, as the Construction Industry Federation and Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland warned the Government. It is time to go back to the drawing board. As a result of construction costs rising, the viability of certain projects is already at risk. We know the price of concrete has already risen by 37% in the past year alone and housing projects are under threat. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland made it clear that the cost of a semi-detached house will increase by €1,200 under the Minister's measure. This will be passed on to customers. At a time when we should be trying to drive down house prices, why does the Minister believe increasing the cost of a house by €1,200 is the appropriate measure?

I ask him again where it is now. I am asking him this because it concerns a key point. The reason I am making a case for the levy – conscious of all the risks the Deputy referred to, because I accept they exist – is that the greater risk would be to pretend to the country that there is money to meet every vital need, including the mica need, and that no consequences or risks would flow from this. I stand with the Deputy in wanting to rebuild the homes and make a difference for those families who have been afflicted by the mica problem. I need to be honest, though, about the need for us to pay for this. I put it to the Deputy that he does not recognise in his budget proposals the choices that must be made and that is why his alternative budget is no longer available.

He should not deflect from the reality or the real issue like he did when he abandoned those who are seeing massive increases in mortgage interest and the victims of the mica scandal, who came to this House and whom I know. I have sat in their homes and have seen the cracks in the walls. I have seen the water running down into open plugs and sockets. I know these people feel abandoned by the Government. Worse, they now feel the Government is now going to make it harder for them to rebuild their own homes. The Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, not Sinn Féin, said €1,200 will be the price increase on an ordinary home given what the Minister is planning. The Construction Industry Federation has told us this is wrong. Barra Roantree from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has said this is a wrong decision. It is not just Sinn Féin that is saying it. The Minister can talk about honesty and dishonesty all he wants but he should listen to the experts, who are telling him the wrong decision has been made. The Minister asks what the alternatives are. I put it to him, and will put it to him when we deal with the banks Bill, that he should not be cutting the levy on banks, as he did last year. He has cut it by nearly €80 million, which is twice as much as he would get from actually charging homeowners to rebuild their own homes.

It was welcome that he did announce a tax, but it was impossible to understand the rationale for setting it at merely 0.3% of the value of the home. Can he explain to us the rationale for setting it at that level? On what basis did he set the figure?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	122	I thank Deputy Shortall. I am aware that she has been raising this issue for some time. I have little doubt at all that if I wanted to have a look at her budget proposals, they would be freely and publicly available. The vacant homes tax, VHT, is a new measure announced in budget 2023 that aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand. Further detail on this measure is set out in the Finance Bill, which was published on 20 October. As stated in my budget speech, this measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase, rather than raise revenue. In developing a new tax, an important consideration is clarity. It is important to ensure that the tax is easy to understand and administer. This is why I chose to set it at a multiple of a property's basic local property tax, LPT, charge as the LPT system is well understood. The purpose of the VHT is to encourage behavioural change. Accordingly, the rate should be set at a level that will influence property owners' decision-making. A tax charged at three times a property's basic LPT charge represents a considerable financial penalty to those who leave properties vacant and will incentivise property owners to bring such properties back into use. Let me bring this to life by way of an example for the House. The rate means that, for example, the owner of a vacant residential property valued at €250,000 would face a VHT charge of €625 in addition to the annual LPT charge of €225. The owner of a property valued at €400,000 would face a VHT charge worth €1,215, in addition to his or her annual LPT charge of €405, while the owner of a house valued at €500,000 would face a VHT charge of €1,485 in addition to an annual LPT charge of €495.

Did he take advice on the likely impact of a tax set at such a low level? Was any research done on it at all? The other side of this concerns what is happening to property prices. We are aware that in the year to last August, property prices increased by 12.2%. In the context of somebody being able to leave a property vacant for 12 months, with it increasing in value by 12%, how on earth is a tax of 0.3% going to influence what that person will do? There is no incentive. It is a perverse incentive, actually. There is no incentive whatsoever to sell or to let that property. Could the Minister give us some idea of the supporting evidence on which he worked? This just does not make sense on any level whatsoever. We know that there are 90,000 houses available.

In deciding what the rate was going to be, I did, of course, consult with my colleagues and my officials on it. My judgment, based on the engagement that I had with them, was that a new charge that is multiples of an existing tax, is a proportionate and sufficient charge for the harm to the common good of homes that could have somebody living in them but do not. This must be seen in combination with other measures that are being brought in, for example, the Croí Cónaithe towns fund, which will provide grants of up to €30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence. I do not believe this is in any way a dereliction of duty in response to a serious matter. I believe that the multiple charge that is being put forward here will have the desired effect.

In the context of a situation where somebody can continue to sit on a vacant property, which will increase by, say, 10% to 12%, over a year, how will a tax of 0.3% make any difference? Could he be straight with us? What exactly is his rationale here? Has he based his belief on any evidence whatsoever? The other point I would make in regard to this tax is that it is flawed. It does not apply the proposed tax to derelict properties. Little or no action is being taken by local authorities because of the way the derelict sites levy operates. A person can allow his or her property to become derelict and he or she will avoid the tax. There is a serious responsibility on the Minister and the Government to unlock the significant number of vacant homes that are available for use in the context of the serious housing crisis. I cannot understand why the Minister will not do the rational thing and unlock them by having a meaningful tax.

I look forward to hearing the Deputy make the case on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. Regarding the charge she made about the level of vacant homes in the country, as she will be aware, the recent census indicated that there are 166,752 vacant homes nationwide. This is 7.8% of the housing stock. Many other studies indicate that the appropriate level of vacancy within any kind of functioning housing market is approximately 6%. The idea that there are many tens of thousands of homes available that could be immediately brought back into use is at odds with the figures that are there. To answer the Deputy's question regarding the cost of inflation and how it will impact on the vacant property tax, that will be reflected in the valuation of the property. As Deputy Shortall well knows, as inflation goes up, the property will be revalued accordingly and then the vacant property tax will go up as well.

I also accept there are issues relating to EU state aid rules, but what flexibility is there and is there anything more that he can do?

As she will be aware, the details of the new TBESS are set out in the Finance Bill, which will begin Committee Stage later today. The scheme will provide support to qualifying businesses in respect of energy costs relating to the period from 1 September 2022 to 28 February 2023. The TBESS will be available to tax-compliant businesses carrying on a trade or profession, the profits of which are chargeable to tax under case I or case II of Schedule D where they meet the eligibility criteria. It will also be available to certain charities and approved bodies who, but for specific exemptions, would be chargeable to tax under case I or case II. The scheme will be operated on a self-assessment basis. Payments will be made on the basis of 40% of the amount of the increase in eligible electricity or natural gas costs between the bill amount, which is the subject of the claim and the bill amount in the corresponding reference period in the previous year. Payments are generally subject to a monthly cap of €10,000 per trade, increasing to a maximum of €30,000 in certain circumstances. In line with the EU temporary crisis framework, there is also an overall cap on the amount that an undertaking can claim. The scheme will be open shortly. I recognise the important point the Deputy made, which is that even though she broadly welcomes the scheme that is being introduced, she questions the adequacy of the cap and the help that the measure will provide. I believe the scale of the measures that we have brought forward will provide a real help, but I am also aware that a change in the cap in any way could have a significant impact on the overall cost of the scheme. What we should do is get the scheme up and running first, see what the cost is and how it is helping businesses.

He has to look after the money, as it were. We already know from many businesses that they are in trouble. The Minister knows that in his constituency, as I do in mine, businesses are closing. A very well-known butcher in Sligo closed one of its shops yesterday. They said it was because of increased electricity and operational costs. They are just one of many. We know now it is not going to be enough. I know the Minister has certain constraints around state aid rules, but is there any flexibility or anything else he can put in place to help businesses that are struggling? It is not just the huge increase in energy costs; it is the cumulative increase. We know that public liability insurance costs are still far too high. I support the increase in the minimum wage, but it adds significantly to the costs of businesses, which are cumulative.

We can help, in particular with the energy costs, but no government should give the indication to the people of Ireland and the economy that we can cover or insulate any business from all of the cost changes that are going on at the moment. I know the Deputy recognises that. While she was perhaps not calling on me to do it, she was putting the energy costs in the context of all of the other prices that are going up as well. I know the butcher's shop to which she referred. People will have been working in the shop and families will have been dependent on it who now find themselves at a tough moment. I am sure they are worrying about where the next job will come from. I fully understand that. We are trying to help. I believe we are using as much flexibility as we can under the state aid framework, but I reiterate that we should get the scheme up and running, and understand what it will cost and what impact it is having. The Government will keep this matter under review. I do not believe a change is currently merited.

The Minister will be very well aware that even though he is bringing in this scheme and he decreased the VAT rate, the VAT payments on energy bills for most businesses is now greater, even at 9%, than it was a year or two ago. He has extra money. I want him to look at the reality of business and to think in terms of how flexible he can be.I asked the Tánaiste about this a week or two ago and he indicated that if businesses are not viable, the Government can step in to support them where other businesses cannot get staff. The truth is, however, that many businesses that were viable three, six, nine months or a year ago are no longer viable because of increased energy costs., and many are small businesses. Will the Minister keep this in mind?

I see this in small shops and businesses in my constituency, Dublin Central, and throughout the city of Dublin. I was in Mullingar on Friday evening and met many amazing local business people who employ so many people and are confronting the very kind of pressure the Deputy referred to. Of course, we will keep the scheme under review. The Tánaiste has also brought forward many different proposals and policies to help other energy users and I expect other Ministers will do likewise to help some sectors that are not part of this scheme. We will keep it under review, but I want to be candid to the House in saying this scheme, at €1.2 billion, is the single biggest measure in the budget, and I have a duty to the Deputy and the businesses she represents to ensure that any scheme we bring forward will be one we can afford if we need to sustain some measures for longer.

As he will be aware, consumer price inflation picked up sharply over the past year and in October stood at 9.6%. Almost every advanced country in the world is in the same position with, for example, inflation throughout our neighbours within the EU, and in particular among those countries that share the euro with us, reaching a record 10.7% in October. That our rate of inflation is slightly below the EU area average is going to be of precious comfort to the businesses and households the Deputy is concerned about. As he will know, the key driver of these pressures is the sharp rise in energy, food and other commodity prices as a result of the war in Ukraine. Spillover effects from higher energy prices are also being felt in other sectors, such as food and consumer goods and services. We are acutely aware of this, however, and the Deputy has been good enough to recognise the value of the measures we have brought forward. In addition to our day-to-day budget, which was at the high level of €6.9 billion, we are also bringing forward a set of one-off measures amounting to more than €4 billion. I will not list what they are, given the Deputy knows what they are, but they are all designed in different ways to help households and businesses with the rising costs and inflation and the impact that is having on living standards, our ability to live and the viability of businesses. Many citizens, who have come through the wearying tunnel of Covid and have finally got to a better point in that regard, have now been hit by the surge in prices, with all that that means for their lives, and we understand that very well. With the measures we are bringing forward, we are doing our best to offer help without creating new risks in the future.

To what extent are efforts being made across Europe and in this country to identify specific issues that might have a disproportionate impact on inflation throughout the EU and in this country, and has anything been identified? For example, various issues are suggested from time to time as being the cause of the rising inflation. In some cases, investigations carried out by individuals have indicated the figures are not accurate. One of them relates to a builder who was importing steelworks for his construction company. He travelled to Europe and Turkey with a flat-body truck and brought the stuff home at a fraction of the cost. Something is going wrong somewhere.

The focus at European level is on trying to reduce the cost of energy, which, as the House will know, is an exceptionally complex and sensitive matter at a time the supply of energy in the first instance is so constrained and so low. That is the focus of considerable collective efforts within the EU because any change in the price of energy will have a significant impact on the rate of inflation we face. In Ireland, of course, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment will monitor what is happening throughout our economy to be confident that the change in prices that is happening will not give the opportunity for unwarranted price increases. For now, the level of challenge so many businesses face due to the rising cost of their inputs indicates that the rising prices are driven by the global forces I referred to.

In the various economic forecasts we conduct, which we will again revise in April, we will continue to monitor clearly where we are with inflation and what that means for our economy overall. While we expect a decrease in inflation rates in the economy for next year, it will be a decrease to only 6%, which, unfortunately, will have an impact on the living standards of our country and the ability of businesses to remain viable and to continue to employ citizens. It will be carefully monitored as the year goes on. For now, that which will have the greatest impact on trying to reduce inflation will be the collective efforts of the EU with regard to the price of energy, and I hope more progress can be made on that in the time ahead.

In the budget, the Government failed to adjust the relevant PRSI bands to account for the increase and to ensure the full increase would go into the pockets of those who benefit from the national minimum wage increase. There are no Committee Stage amendments to the Finance Bill to rectify this problem, although it may be addressed in, for example, the social welfare Bill. I have tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill on the matter. The Minister might first respond to the question and we can take it from there.

Budget 2023 included a significant personal income tax package, estimated to cost €1.13 billion. Overall, in all the measures contained in that tax package, it is expected 2.1 million taxpayers will benefit in different ways. It is important to bear in mind, however, that tax measures form only one component of the budget. The Department’s analysis shows that the gain in the top five income deciles is mainly from direct and indirect tax measures, while welfare measures and the energy credit are responsible for most of the gains in disposable income for households in the bottom five deciles. With the increase in the national minimum wage from €10.50 to €11.30 per hour from 1 January, those on the national minimum wage will be better off in overall net terms.In addition, the ceiling of the band for the 2% rate of USC is increasing by €1,625 to €22,920. Similar to previous years, this policy measure is to ensure that a full-time worker on the minimum wage, who will benefit from the increase in the hourly minimum wage rate, will remain outside the top rates of USC. As the Deputy acknowledged, policy matters regarding adjustments to PRSI are dealt with in the social welfare legislation and are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, I will pass this on to her.

It is something we intend to raise in the context of the Finance Bill and probably more appropriately, the social welfare Bill. Our own analysis, which has been confirmed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, shows that in terms of the national minimum wage, a worst-case scenario could see many full-time workers on the minimum wage lose more than 30% of the 80 cent per hour increase because no adaptation is being made with regard to the PRSI threshold. That diverges from what policy has been over the years. In 2015, for example, significant moneys were made available to address the USC issue, which is being addressed this year as well. Money was also used to address the PRSI cliff-edge problem. This can, therefore, be rectified. I hope the Minister will use his good offices with the Minister for Social Protection to seek to do that. There is an issue here that needs to be addressed. The principle that as much as possible of the increase that goes to a full-time national minimum wage worker should be taken home is something everybody should accept.

I have made great efforts in changes I made to the USC to deal with the issue he identified. As he will know, changes in PRSI have other consequences of which the Minister of Social Protection will be aware. I have no doubt at all that she will give a clear and justified account of what is happening from a PRSI perspective. However, the reason we did make the changes in USC is to ensure that somebody sees his or her wages go up due to a change in the minimum wage and is not worse off as a result of an unchanged level of USC.

The threshold for those earning below €424 is not changing. There will, therefore, be an impact. More than 30% of the increase will be swallowed up because the kinds of PRSI adjustments that ought to be made are not being made. We will continue to argue for that. That is frankly an injustice given that we know the bottom two deciles will be worst affected by the impact of inflation, notwithstanding the measures that have been introduced by Government. It is important, however. When we look at budget 2023, there is a bit of sleight of hand going on. There is an effort by Government to include the one-off measures and the measures of budget 2023. It describes the budget as being ethical and progressive but when we strip away the one-off measures, that is not necessarily the case for low-paid workers.

The one-off measures should indeed be temporary in the hope that the cost-of-living pressures about which we are all concerned begin to change and moderate, and offer an opportunity then to change the level of support we have in place if things begin to improve and prices begin to moderate. I would, therefore, make the case to Deputy Nash that it is appropriate that in evaluating the progressivity of the budget, we include the one-off measures. As I told the Deputy in my opening answer, many other measures are contained in budget day that aim to make a difference to low-income citizens who need additional supports. They should be identified as well and we should not just focus on tax in isolation.

Under certain circumstances, however, when a company buys its own shares, this charge does not apply. In fact, the stamp duty only applies when a share buyback takes place by means of a stock transfer form. In the other two cases, when they are purchased through a direct contract or through security settlement systems, no charge applies. Will the Minister close the gap to ensure that a charge applies to all forms of share buyback?

However, I am advised by Revenue that the stamp duty treatment of share buybacks depends on the form in which the shares are held and the method by which the buybacks are affected. Share buyback refers to the practice whereby a company purchases or buys back its own shares. For shares held in certificated or paper form, the shares may be bought back in two ways. The first is by means of a standard stock transfer form. The second is where the shareholder and company enter into a contract or share purchase agreement for the sale of the shares, following which the shareholder hands over the share certificates to the company. For shares held in uncertificated or electronic form, the shares may be bought back via an electronic settlement system.  Shares bought back by means of a stock transfer form are chargeable to stamp duty. Where a company enters into a contract or share purchase agreement, Revenue accepts that there is no stamp duty chargeable on the transaction by virtue of section 31(1)(b) of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. For shares bought back via an electronic settlement system, it has been a long-standing Revenue practice to confirm that stamp duty does not apply to such transactions. Revenue estimates that based on prior year transactions, the revenue forgone on share buybacks is between €5 million and €20 million in each calendar year. However, Revenue is unable to gather comprehensive data on share buybacks that occur and are not subject to stamp duty as companies have no obligation to report this information. The wide variation in the estimated annual yield forgone is because share buyback programmes are implemented on an irregular basis by a limited number of companies.

Share buybacks have become a popular way for companies to drive up their share prices and enrich corporate executives and shareholders. Irish publicly-listed companies are on course to spend more than €1.9 billion buying back their own shares each year, including retail banks and large developers. However, share buybacks can often be at the expense of the company or, indeed, the broader economy. Money spent on share buybacks to benefit corporate executives and shareholders is money not spent to reduce prices for consumers, increase employee wages or invest in the company itself. If we look across the Atlantic, that is the reason the Biden Administration is introducing legislation to apply an excise tax on share buybacks. In practice, few and only small private companies perform share buybacks through stock transfer forms where the stamp duty applies and, therefore, this gap should be closed in legislation. I ask the Minister to consider closing this gap with an amendment at Report Stage of the Finance Bill.

I did evaluate it, however. In evaluating and consulting with my officials on it, the view I have reached is that a change to it at this point could limit the ability of our capital markets to operate. Those capital markets are important for providing funding and investment to companies based in Ireland. I did give consideration to it. I have decided that at this point, more risks could be associated with this change than benefits. I will not be bringing forward a Committee Stage amendment in that regard. The Department of Finance will continue to monitor this matter, however.

It is online. We have asked the Department to make a clear signal to him as to where he can access it. However, let us deal with the issue here. The Minister talked about how we need to pay for stuff. Up to €20 million in foregone tax is lost here. The loss is difficult to justify, especially when the transactions in question are of limited value to a company and the practice can lead to corporate executives and shareholder enrichment at the expense of the company, investment in employee compensation or lower price for consumers. It is clear that share buyback regulation deserves attention. The opportunity cost of share buyback is considerable. As I said, resources could be used to lower prices and, indeed, increase productivity or workers' pay.The Minister's own officials make it clear, stating that as there is a transfer of the beneficial ownership to the shares from one person to another in exchange for valuable consideration, there is clearly a conveyance of transfer on sale of the shares and therefore a charge of stamp duty at 1%. That is not being applied because the law has a gap. There is no rationale for allowing such a large volume of share buybacks to slip through the net without the 1% stamp duty being paid. The Minister can deflect all he wants. This is a sensible proposal that could benefit the State by up to €20 million. That is what we are talking about. Why will the Minister not introduce this measure? Why will he not close the gap that his own officials have identified and believe there is justification for?

I am only too happy to answer the Deputy's question. We did indeed consider this matter following the publication of the tax strategy group paper. As I said to the Dáil, we are going to continue to monitor this matter. It was the view of my Department, and I assessed the matter myself, that any change in the current regime could cause unintended consequences, including conflicting with European and domestic capital markets, and might raise potential issues for Irish companies that are accessing US markets. That is the reason.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	166	I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 146 and 159 together. This new charging mechanism was legislated for in 2019. It is not a result of anything that was contained in this budget or the current Finance Bill. We indicated in 2019 that these changes were to come in. I appreciate why the Deputy is raising this matter and the impact it may have on some of his constituents. I recognise that. However, this is a change that has been very clearly flagged over a number of years now, recognising that it could well create a cost, in particular to company car users who are using their cars as a very important part of their daily business, for example, sales representatives or people who need to use their cars to visit customers. This measure has been indicated now for a number of years and is not due to any changes that are contained in this budget. Government policy has focused on strengthening the environmental rationale behind company car taxation. Until the changes I brought in as part of the Finance Act 2019, Ireland’s vehicle benefit-in-kind, BIK, regime was unusual in that there was no overall CO2 rationale in the regime. This is despite the fact that a CO2-based vehicle BIK regime was legislated for as far back as 2008. In the Finance Act 2019, I legislated for a CO2-based regime for company cars from 1 January 2023. From that date, the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car’s original market value and the annual business kilometres driven, while new CO2 emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted or surcharged rate is taxable. The number of mileage bands has been reduced from five to four. The rationale behind the mileage bands is that the greater the business mileage, the more the car is a benefit to the company rather than its employee, and the more the car depreciates in value, the less of a benefit it is to the employee as the asset from which the benefit is derived is depreciating faster. Mileage bands also ensure that cars more integral to the conduct of business receive preferential tax treatment. Reforming the BIK system to include emissions bands provides for a more sustainable environmental rationale than the continuation of the current system with exemptions for electric vehicles, EVs. This will bring the taxation system around company cars into step with other CO2-based motor taxes as well as the long-established CO2-based vehicle BIK regimes in other member states. In addition to what I have outlined and in light of Government commitments on climate change, budget 2022 extended the preferential BIK treatment for electric vehicles to the end of 2025 with a tapering mechanism on the vehicle value threshold. This BIK exemption forms part of a broader series of very generous measures to support the uptake of EVs, including a reduced rate of 7% vehicle registration tax, VRT, a VRT relief of up to €5,000, low motor tax of €120 per annum, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland grants, discounted toll fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging.  I appreciate the importance of the point the Deputy is making but I ask him to consider that this measure has been flagged over a number of years. My concern, given the importance of this measure in changing the carbon emissions from our private car fleet, is that if we were to indicate at this point that it is not going to happen, I am not sure whether or when it would happen. I believe many other companies have now made investment decisions in anticipation of these changes coming in.

It is a financial hit on people now more than ever due to the pressure from the cost of living and fuel prices. The electric car charging network has not been rolled out as we would have liked. Someone travelling around the Cork and Kerry region, or anywhere in the country, will be under pressure to find public charging points. I appreciate the Minister's point about the measure being flagged. Is there an opportunity at this point to delay it and give people some further time to change over? Cathal, for example, is down €44 a week. He drove throughout the pandemic servicing supermarkets as an essential provider. The cost now hitting people is very challenging. Is there an opportunity to delay this?

I have no doubt that constituents are contacting him about the matter and are concerned about it. I respectfully make the case to him again that we have been flagging this change for a number of years. My concern is that if we were to change or defer a significant change in BIK that has been very well flagged at this point, there could well be other car users who have already made decisions in anticipation of this coming in. I have to be conscious of them as well. We will certainly monitor this matter and keep it under review. As I have tried to indicate to the House throughout this Question Time, I am very much aware of the impact of the rising cost of living on our constituents. We are doing what we can to lessen the blow that many are facing at the moment.

As households and family businesses are experiencing the cost-of-living crisis, credit unions are providing vital services to help people get through. However, they are still constrained by an outdated policy framework that is limiting their capacity rather than helping them serve their communities.I appreciate the work the Minister has been doing in this area but when will the necessary reforms be brought forward?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	170	I want to recognise the huge work the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has done in this. He has put incredible energy into assessing where we are from a policy perspective with a part of our economy he understands well, namely our credit union movement. He regrets that he cannot be here to take the Deputy’s question but he is representing us on Government business in Brussels. The Government recognises the importance of credit unions as a provider of community banking services. The programme for Government contains clear commitments to review the policy framework, enable and support the credit union movement to grow support credit unions in the expansion of services and enable the credit union movement to grow as a key provider of community banking services. The review of the policy framework has been completed and in July the Government approved the drafting of legislation to implement the proposals. The legislation has received priority status for publication in the Dáil’s autumn session. The policy proposals contained in the review address a number of different and important objectives. Cumulatively, the desired outcome of these objectives is to strengthen the role of credit unions as a provider of community banking and to enable them further to focus on priorities that will better position the sector to face the challenges and opportunities of the future. In developing this important work, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has met the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association, the National Supervisors Forum, the Registrar of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Advisory Committee, the Credit Union CEO Forum and collaborative ventures. As I do my work across the country I find that virtually every credit union I meet has met the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming. He has done huge work on this and the proposals he has brought forward are very meaningful. I know they do not deliver all that the credit union sector wants but they are capable of making a difference. The Government will do its best to legislate speedily for them.

Are the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, looking into what measures they can bring in immediately to allow them to take advantage of the place of credit unions in the community and their balance sheets? I realise the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, are pursuing larger policy reforms, which is so welcome, but are there any aspects of that which could be accelerated now to help the sector and communities in the more immediate future? Some 77 credit unions offer current accounts, including Access Credit Union and First South Credit Union in Cork South-West. With the closure of bank branches and entire banks that service will be increasingly important, especially in rural areas. What steps is the Minister taking to help more credit unions offer those current accounts? The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has 19 credit unions engaged as SME lending partners. That is a welcome development to support and enhance the sector. Could the Minister clarify how he is helping other interested credit unions to enter that arrangement?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	172	The Deputy is dead right. For example, in the early part of 2021 some 19 credit unions participated in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. It was great to have those individual credit unions participate in that scheme. Beyond that, five credit unions were announced as participants in the Brexit impact loan scheme. If I look at the participation of the credit union sector within our lending landscape, the SME lending they are engaged in has grown by just over 15% year-on-year at the end of June. I am seeing positive signs taking place in that and overall some 77 credit unions are approved to provide current accounts. On the measures we are bringing in, the Deputy asked if there are any that will make a quick and immediate difference. What we are bringing forward are measures that will be of help in the medium term. I continue to encourage credit unions to engage with their regulators so they can broaden the range of services they want to provide. I am encouraged that so many of the credit unions I meet have an increasing desire to do so. So many of them at local level represent the opportunities that are open to people as we see other regrettable changes take place in the supply of banking services in our country.

The Minister will be aware that the credit unions have again topped the customer experience ranking for the eighth year in a row and they have even improved on their scores in the process. They are also continuing to innovate and adapt to changing circumstances. For example, the cultivate programme offers loans for things that farmers need, such as machinery, improving farm buildings or helping with cash flow. In west Cork the Bantry Credit Union recently bought the former Bank of Ireland building, which is symbolic of the changing retail and financial landscape, especially in rural areas. Those are just some of the positive and dynamic things associated with credit unions. I ask the Minister to imagine all they will be able to do when the financial regulations allow them to provide increased services and competitive loans to families, farms and SMEs.

I know the building the Deputy is referring to and I can only imagine that will have a positive impact on the presence of credit union services to her constituents. We will continue to work within Government with the sector to try to support it, in an appropriate way, in the development of its services to our economy. There is a rare opportunity ahead for this movement, which many of its members appreciate, in the changes they are making. This is in two different ways. First, as the cost of living becomes more intense for many communities the services our credit unions offer members will become even more needed and appreciated. Second, as the Deputy has shown in her example from Bantry, as other changes happen in the provision of banks, credit unions are taking their places.

The Minister and his colleagues in the Department were exceptionally supportive of those businesses during that time, ensuring that they remained viable, and in doing so they protected thousands of Irish jobs. As we emerge from that tunnel we are seeing businesses again faced with additional challenges. One of those sectors is agriculture and our farmers. How does the TBESS as it is currently designed intend to support the farming sector in particular?

Farmers will be eligible for payments under the TBESS in the same way as any other business that is carrying out a trade which is taxable under case I of Schedule D where they meet all eligibility criteria. A person engaged in a trade of farming who has suffered an increase of at least 50% in the average unit price of electricity or natural gas for the relevant billing period in 2022, as compared with the average unit price for electricity and gas, or both, for the corresponding reference period in 2021, will be eligible under the scheme. In line with the temporary crisis framework, there is also an overall cap on the amount that an undertaking can claim. The cap that currently applies in relation to farmers is €250,000. If any amount charged on an energy bill for a claim period is not expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of the farming trade, then this amount must be deducted from the relevant energy bill amount for the claim period for the purpose of calculating the eligible cost. We have done this in recognition of an issue we felt could develop. That issue is where, for example, you could have a single electricity connection and that is supporting the farm activity and also domestic life. In an effort to get ahead of that developing as an issue, we will include the provision for the deduction of energy for domestic purposes. The short answer to the Deputy's question is that by using the approach of case I trading income I am confident that many of the farmers the Deputy is referring to will be able to participate in a scheme that I know they need.

On the categorisation of eligible farmers, we have heard of many instances in the last few days of small retailers, butchers in particular, who have unusually large energy consumption. I assume that most of them are registered as sole traders. Indeed, any of our farmers who are registered either as tax-compliant businesses or sole traders will be eligible to access this scheme. Will the Minister clarify what exactly are the categories within which farmers can gain access to the scheme?

I will provide that full clarification when we are debating the Finance Bill. As I have said, if businesses have a trading relationship with the Revenue Commissioners under case I, they are included in the scheme. There are some positive signals on the design of the scheme. The feedback is that the number of businesses that are not participating in it at the moment is less than it was when we were bringing forward other similar schemes during the Covid era when, as the Deputy will recall, our time was consumed as much by the businesses and sectors of the economy that were not in the scheme as it was by those that were in it. Clarity in relation to trading income should allow the inclusion of many of the businesses and retailers to which the Deputy has referred. I expect the vast majority of them will have the opportunity to enter this scheme.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has informed me that the draft maps indicating the land that falls within the scope of the RZLT were published by all 31 local authorities in respect of land within their administrative areas on 1 November 2022. These maps are available on the websites of each local authority concerned and in their public offices. They are also centrally available at www.gov.ie/rzlt. Landowners may now make submissions or observations to the relevant local authority by 1 January 2023 where they consider that their land does not meet the criteria for inclusion set out in the legislation. In addition, other interested parties may make submissions regarding the inclusion of land which they consider falls into scope but was not included on the draft maps. Landowners may also, until 1 January 2023, make a submission requesting that the zoning of their land is amended to remove it from the scope of the tax. I appreciate the Deputy raising the question because it will be very important in the time ahead that landowners check the status of their land on these maps. We will launch an advertising campaign shortly to draw attention to these maps and give ample time to landowners to make their case for either a change in zoning and to find out the liability they could face for the use of the land if it is not changed. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I have agreed some advertising supports with our officials to draw the public's attention to these changes, so that there is a higher level of awareness of them. Given the scope of what is now proposed and will take place and given the number of maps that are being published, it is important to make landowners more aware of the tax liabilities they may have in the future.

It is very positive to hear of the advertising campaign because this tax will have implications for farmers and landowners in rural areas throughout the country. Hundreds of farmers could be hit with an annual tax of 3% of the market value of their zoned farm land. Looking at the interactive draft maps, which I have analysed for County Mayo, the volume of land zoned as liable under the tax in certain market towns and small to medium-sized towns is significant. In other areas there is little land zoned. We need to come up with an approach. What I would like to hear is that there will be a mechanism for farmers to appeal these types of decisions. What engagements has the Minister had with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the issue?

In fairness to the Minister, he raised the same issues the Deputy has just raised a year ago when we were designing this new tax. He raised the issue of land in smaller towns that could be owned by farmers and is zoned for residential use. Our judgment - the Deputy will know this better from a local point of view - is that the overall amount of land is a low share of the total amount of land that will be taxed under this new measure. That will be of little comfort or perhaps relevance to the owners of this land. The tax that is being introduced provides for a process to change the zoning of the land through which landowners can ask for it to have non-residential status. That is really what needs to happen. Given the housing needs that we have, where land is zoned for new housing, we want to build on it.

Only one sixth of land zoned residential is activated. This will be an important mechanism going forward.

I reiterate that I do not anticipate, nor do I want, An Bord Pleanála to have to become involved in this process. It has other matters that we want it decide, rather than this.

As the Deputy is aware, significant changes have now occurred with regard to that. The tax strategy group, TSG, published a paper earlier this year outlining some of the options now available for Ireland and other member states to consider. I suspect the one the Deputy is most aware of is that concerning solar panels and the potential for a lower rate or zero rate of VAT for them. I did not believe it was appropriate to introduce the measure in this budget, but we will continue to look at this as part of the future TSG process. I will share with the Deputy the rationale for our decision that this change could not be made in the budget. There is flexibility in this regard and I have used it elsewhere, for example, in applying the zero rate of VAT to defibrillators, which was needed.

Taxation, VAT in particular, is one of the levers we can use to drive environmentally friendly business. That is not only for things such as solar panels. It can be a tool for businesses that will facilitate, reduce and reuse, even before we get to recycle, in terms of preventing waste and emissions. In February of last year, the Minister spoke to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and said he was engaging with the OECD and European Commission to ensure a best practice approach. Can the Minister give any information about progress that has been made in that regard and in supporting green business that, as I say, will help to reduce and reuse waste instead of creating it?

We have been engaging with the European Commission, particularly in respect of the VAT directive that was introduced earlier in the year. The engagement we have had with the OECD has concentrated on other areas of taxation rather than the area to which the Deputy has referred. As I said, this is a new area of flexibility that has been granted to us. We are going to ensure in the work we do in preparing for next year's budget, which may seem far away but will be upon us quickly, that we think through these matters and evaluate them clearly. We have made other tax changes that have been recognised as playing a valuable role in supporting our efforts to achieve a lower carbon future.

On Tuesday night, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage claimed there is not a housing emergency. I am sure that anyone who heard that remark was aghast at the suggestion we do not have a housing emergency in this country. Yet, the Taoiseach thinks he is doing a great job. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is the only Fianna Fáil Minister the Taoiseach has guaranteed will stay in his post, despite him repeated failing in that post. Rents and house prices are rising and homelessness is at record levels but the Taoiseach thinks the Minister is playing a blinder. This is the level of delusion that surrounds housing in the Government. It is not just me saying that. I want to share with the Tánaiste some of the stories from young people who have contacted us in recent days to illustrate the reality of the housing crisis and the impact it is having on people's lives. One said:I am living with my parents who are close to retirement age. Living at home in my mid-30s puts a strain on our relationship and a strain on my mental health. It seems for my entire adult life there has been a recession or a housing crisis in this country. Another person stated: I am 32-year-old. I work as a clerical officer and have been saving for years with my boyfriend and we cannot afford these high house prices. Another person stated:I'm 29, my partner is 31. We're both in good, full-time jobs and we have saved a thirty thousand euro deposit for house. We cannot get a mortgage. We're now considering moving to Canada. Another person stated:I love my country and I wish I could stay. It's just sad I can't afford to stay in the country I was born and raised in.That is only a sample of the young people who responded to our recent housing survey. These are people who are living through the reality of the shambolic approach to housing the Government has taken for more than a decade. Those are the words of real people who are living in the real world unlike the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage who says there is no housing emergency and the Taoiseach who think his Minister is playing a blinder. An analysis carried out by the Irish
Daily Mail shows that the Government's housing targets are too low and pent-up demand will outstrip planned supply. Sinn Féin has been telling the Government that for years. We have repeatedly brought forward proposals to deal with the emergency we face. The Government cannot even meet the embarrassingly low targets it has set. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, promised over 26,000 new-build social homes by the end of 2022. So far, less than half that amount have been delivered. We were promised 4,100 affordable homes by the end of this year. To date, only 925 affordable homes have been delivered. That is why house prices are going through the roof. It is why rents are soaring and homelessness is at an all-time high. Does the Tánaiste accept there is a housing emergency? Does he agree that the so-called Housing for All plan is not working? Will he commit to ensuring a new plan is brought forward that gets to grips with the crisis in housing and is delivered within timeframes that are acceptable?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	191	I thank the Deputy. I agree there is a housing emergency and have said so in the past. I agree there is a housing crisis, which is a term I have used in the past. However, competing with each other to find new and more dramatic words to describe the housing challenge does not build any houses or solve problems for any of the people the Deputy mentioned in his contribution. What we require is housing action, and that is what we are doing, led by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. We are implementing Housing for All, which is a good strategy that I believe is working. I will give the Deputy a few reasons why I think that is the case. We will exceed our targets for building new homes in Ireland this year. Roughly 28,000 new homes will be built in Ireland this year. That is not numbers; that is 28,000 families who will be living in a house this Christmas that did not exist last Christmas. It was not long ago that only 4,000 or 5,000 were being built in Ireland per year. We have seen a dramatic increase in the number of new homes being built. It is not enough, however, and we need to go further and higher in the years to come. This year, we will provide more new social housing than has been provided in any other year in the history of the State. People often talk about all the homes that were built by councils and housing bodies in the 1920s, the 1950s, the 1970s and the 1980s. There is not a year in the history of the State that we will have built and provided more social housing than this year. That is a significant achievement. However, it is not enough and we need to do much more. Many people do not know this but it is really important. In the past 12 moths, 15,000 first-time buyers, mostly couples, have bought their first homes. That is the highest number in 15 years. That is significant but it is not enough and we need to build on it and do even more. When it comes to helping people with the cost of rent - I agree it is a real challenge for many people - we are bringing in the rent tax credit, which the Deputy has advocated for in the past. That will mean €1,000 for a single, tax-paying renter and €2,000 for a tax-paying renting couple. That will put the best part of a month's rent or more back in people's pockets. That is something for which the Deputy has called and that we are making happen. It is actions that matter, not the words used. As long as a year and a half ago, I said that we should aim to build 40,000 new units per year. That target is contained in the Housing for All plan. We want to ramp up as quickly as we can to 40,000 units per year. We acknowledge that since those targets were set, the population has increased faster than we thought. We have welcomed 62,000 Ukrainians to Ireland. Many of them will stay and more will arrive. Our economy is growing faster than anyone expected. New households are forming all the time, particularly smaller households. We are absolutely going to review those housing targets with a view to increasing them next year. Let me be clear about the targets. We are going to exceed our new housing target this year through the building of 28,000 new homes. However, we do not congratulate ourselves for exceeding a housing target. It is a not a matter of meeting a target, ticking a box and thinking it is great. We need far more housing in Ireland. We probably have a deficit of 70,000 or 80,000 homes. If we could build them overnight, we would. There is no lack of money being put into the area. There is no lack of political will. However, we are dealing with real constraints, including the availability of labour, materials and serviced sites. No matter who is in government, they are going to have to deal with those real constraints. There is no lack of money, effort, care, compassion or political will. However, there are real constraints with which anyone would have to deal.

As we now approach the end of 2022, house prices have never been as high in the history of the State. Rents have never been as high. Homelessness figures, which include 4,000 children, have never been as high in the history of the State. Thousands of people, who are contacting all of us, are locked out of homeownership. People cannot afford to get by. They are seeing rents increase over and over again. The Government continues to refuse to bring in a rent freeze. Is it not now time to accept, after nearly three years in government, that the plan is failing? House prices, rents and homelessness have gone up. I do not know what the Tánaiste is using to measure success but to my mind, that is failure.A whole generation is locked out and is desperate. It is time to look at real delivery and bring forward a plan that actually expedites the delivery of social, affordable and cost-rental housing. The Government is blatantly failing to meet the targets. Less than half of the social housing that was promised by the Government, and only a quarter of the affordable housing, will be delivered this year. This is failure on any scale. Is it not time to stop defending a Minister and his failed plan, and instead come up with a better plan that actually delivers and listen to what we in the Opposition have been putting forward?

My party has been in office for the past 12 years. In fairness to Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, they have not been in office for so long - only three years. However, there is no party in this House that has been in office on this island more than the Deputy's party. Sinn Féin has been 20 years in office on and off in Northern Ireland, with a Sinn Féin finance minister, a Sinn Féin housing minister and a Sinn Féin joint head of government to use its own terms. What is happening in Northern Ireland? House prices are going up and rents are going up. To use Sinn Féin's own figures, 20,000 people are homeless. If we have failed, surely Sinn Féin has failed worse and for longer. What are Sinn Féin's criteria for failure? Does it apply one standard for us and another standard for itself? That seems to be its metric and its approach to everything - one standard for the Government and a different standard for Sinn Féin.

In a statement last night, he said he had been cleared of "any breach of ethics or standards". I can understand why he said that, but it would be much more accurate to state that SIPO has decided that it does not have the authority to investigate this matter. SIPO noted that the Tánaiste had said his leak of the contract was done in his capacity as Taoiseach and it stated that it has no remit to inquire into "the extent of the powers of the office of Taoiseach". It also important to mention that was not a unanimous decision by SIPO. Two of the commissioners were of the view that they could investigate the Tánaiste and a sixth recused herself. While the Tánaiste views this decision as good news for himself, it raises a number of very important questions. For a start, does SIPO have the power to investigate complaints about the actions of taoisigh at all or does the office of Taoiseach protect its inhabitants from scrutiny? It appears that if a Minister had opted to leak this document, there would have been a role for SIPO to at least examine it. As the Tánaiste was Taoiseach at the time, the majority view was that it could not look into it. That raises fundamental questions about the powers of SIPO and its ability or lack thereof to hold politicians to account. It is not the first time that those questions have been raised. As the Tánaiste knows, the Social Democrats have long called on the Government to give the State's ethics watchdog some badly needed teeth. Most recently, the controversy surrounding Deputy Troy's failure to fully declare his property and business interests in the Oireachtas register of Members' interests revealed SIPO as more lapdog than watchdog. Deputy Troy resigned as Minister of State, but this was entirely discretionary. SIPO was unable to impose any sanctions on him for repeated breaches of ethics legislation because there are no penalties for failing to accurately complete the register on time. Of course, Deputy Troy is not the only Deputy or Senator to escape penalty because of the deficiencies in the legislation which effectively muzzles our watchdog. For nearly two decades SIPO has repeatedly called on successive governments to increase its power. Those pleas have always fallen on deaf ears My questions are as follows. Is the Tánaiste satisfied that SIPO is sufficiently empowered to investigate the decisions of taoisigh when necessary? When can we look forward to amended ethics legislation being published that significantly enhances SIPO's powers of both investigation and enforcement?

I am totally in favour of that and that work is being done at the moment led by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath. I anticipate that we will see legislation next year to enhance and strengthen the role of the standards commission, which is something I strongly support. I was part of the Government that banned corporate donations, taking business money out of politics. I was part of the Government that brought in the Regulation of Lobbying Act. I was part of the Government that strengthened the freedom of information legislation. I am very much in favour of strengthening legislation on standards in public office. I wish to be very clear. In 2019, I disclosed a Government document - it was not a contract - to somebody using an informal channel. I should not have done that. I have apologised for that. However, I did so under the authority of the Taoiseach, entirely within the law and in the public interest. I committed no crime and I did not breach the ethics Acts, the standards Acts or any code of conduct. Three bodies investigated this for two years and they more or less came to the same conclusion. It is ungenerous of the Deputy not to acknowledge that. I think it is quite petty. There is a question I would ask of the Deputy. She was very active on radio - I think it was the "This Week" programme - and I remember it very well. She said that just because I was under investigation at the time - I am not under investigation by anyone anymore, by the way - she did not think I was fit to be elected Taoiseach or to serve in Cabinet. That is fine; that is her view. She is entitled to that view. Does that view extend to Sinn Féin? If any Sinn Féin politician is under investigation by a public body when the next election comes, will the Deputy apply the same standard to them? Will she say the Social Democrats will not allow such a person to serve in Cabinet or does she have a different standard for them than she has for us?

I also asked when we are likely to see the publication of updated ethics legislation. I remind the Tánaiste that this legislation goes back many years. We have been promised this updated legislation for a long time. There was a draft Bill in 2015, which went into committee in 2017 and ran into the sand. Since then, it has been clear that Fine Gael is simply not interested in having updated ethics legislation. It seems there is no appetite within Fine Gael to bring us up to date with our ethics legislation. I ask the Tánaiste to answer the questions I have asked him. Does he think the powers of SIPO in respect of the actions of taoisigh are adequate at the moment? When will we see the legislation to update the powers of SIPO which it has sought for the past 20 years?

That is a different thing. Ministers are responsible to the Dáil for political decisions they make.

I am disappointed the Deputy did not answer my question because it does belie what I suspected.

Have a job. Pick a desk. Unions? No need for unions here. No need for workers’ organisation. Yes, we are a company, but we are more like a family, so welcome to the family”. Behind hype, there is always a reality. Some of the realities behind this industry’s ruthless billionaire owners’ hype have, unfortunately for the workers concerned, become increasingly clear in recent weeks. In this country, it seems that 350 jobs are to be lost at Meta, 250 jobs are to be lost at Twitter, 80 jobs are to be lost at Stripe and maybe 30 more are to be lost at Zendesk. A total of 700 jobs have been axed or are to be axed and the number is rising. Of course, tens of thousands of jobs are to be massacred in the name of profit internationally. At Twitter, workers were locked out of their jobs and received notice of sacking by e-mail. Despite the fact that unionised Debenhams workers were also sacked by e-mail, one national newspaper commented, I think correctly, that, "The manner in which people are being told of their redundancy has turned a harsh light on the tech industry's union-free labour practices". I want to offer my sympathy and my solidarity to tech workers who have received blows in recent weeks. Tech workers now need to challenge the industry’s union-free practices. Tech workers need to organise. Any tech worker who wants to discuss organising is free to contact my office and I will offer whatever help and advice that I can. The union-free practices of the tech industry and the billionaires who own it have been greatly facilitated by this Government and its predecessor, and perhaps by no other Minister to the same degree as the Tánaiste. He is the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but despite the fact that in nearly all European countries there is legislation in place that came about as a result of pressure from below which provides for mandatory trade union recognition, there is no such legislation in place here. The Tánaiste says that legislative changes are on the way, but will they amount to full mandatory trade union recognition? Given the events of recent weeks, will the Tánaiste accept that Governments have facilitated these union-free practices and the poor treatment of workers seen in this country in recent weeks and that now is the time for far-reaching change and for mandatory trade union recognition?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	249	I want to say at the outset that my main concern and that of the Government is for the staff and family members of the staff who are affected by the recent announcement of job losses in the tech sector. It is something that I have been working on with my colleagues very extensively in the last couple of days, as I am sure the Deputy can appreciate. I can give those staff the reassurance that their legal rights will be protected, there will be 30 days of information and consultation, they will receive statutory redundancy payments and, in almost all cases, they will receive enhanced redundancy packages and exit packages. I also want to reassure them that the Government will help them out as best we can, for example with jobsearch to find new opportunities. It is good to hear today that Microsoft, for example, is still hiring. It was good to hear yesterday Virtuous Technologies is creating additional jobs in Dublin 8. This sector is still hiring, even if some companies in the sector are letting people go. We are there to help anybody who wants to set up their own business, wants to return to education or training or needs to know what their welfare rights are. I want to give that assurance particularly to all those staff who are getting bad news this week. There will be further layoffs in other companies in the coming weeks. We are not aware of the details of that, but it is likely to happen down the line. It is important to acknowledge it is the case that, generally speaking, people who are members of trade unions have better pay, terms and conditions than those who are not. However, the tech sector, which is largely not unionised, has better pay, terms and conditions again. These are some of the highest-paid sectors, some of the best-paid jobs and some of the best benefits. In one company, four months of paid paternity leave are provided, which is a positive thing. It is important to put on the record that these are good companies and good employers. They pay well. They have terms and conditions that are much better than would be the case in the average employer. This is one of the good reasons we welcome their investment in this country and we want it to continue. In relation to legislation for collective bargaining, as the Deputy knows I published a report on that matter in the last few weeks. It derives from an EU directive on minimum wages and the need to increase collective bargaining coverage in the State. That report has been published and we anticipate being in a position to respond to it and to publish legislation next year.

He argued that the tech sector is non-union and goes higher again. Of course, one of the reasons it goes higher again is precisely to keep out trade unions. The Tánaiste gave various reassurances to tech workers, but he did not give them the reassurance that I asked for. Although we will have legislation next year, as the Tánaiste said, I asked for legislation that provides for mandatory trade union recognition. Of course, the actions of the tech bosses raise the question of whether this industry should be run by billionaires in the interest of profit in the first place, or by society in the hands of society. It also raises the question of the cosy relationship between right-wing government and those companies. To that end, I have a supplementary question. Press reports this summer told us that European Court of Justice hearings were expected by Department officials to take place this autumn, paving the way for a final ruling next year on the Apple tax case. Incredibly, the Government is still objecting to the State being awarded nearly €14 billion in taxes owed to it. Can the Tánaiste update the House on the position now with regard to the timing of those European Court of Justice hearings?

I do not have an update on the timing in relation to those cases. That matter is handled by the Minister of Finance rather than me as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Let us state the facts here. The European Court of Justice decided against the European Commission. The European Commission, or at least one directorate of the European Commission, alleged that 20 years ago, long before either of us were involved in the Dáil, the Irish Government at the time had a special tax arrangement for one particular company. The reason we contested that case was because it was not true. It was not true and truth does matter. The European Court of Justice heard the arguments and ruled in favour of Ireland. Yes, we have a low-tax regime and low taxes on company profits. We encourage research and development. That is absolutely the case. The allegation, which was a false one, was that we had a special arrangement with one company. The court decided in our favour and now it is on appeal.

At our last meeting, one of the project co-ordinators raised a serious issue that will impact on Turas Training, the project on which he is a co-ordinator. It is based on Old Naas Road in Dublin 12. Turas Training was founded in 2000 is funded by the HSE under section 39 and by the Department of Social Protection. It is a registered charity that rents a 3,500 sq. ft premises and delivers a comprehensive day programme for people in recovery from addiction. Given that the lease renewal was due, he had written to the landlord advising that the Department of Health was making funding available to assist voluntary organisations like his with utility bills in light of increases in the cost of living, including energy prices, but that the HSE had said that it had not been provided with any detail of Government support. The reply he received from the landlord was shocking. It stated:The last time we renewed the lease we estimated the electricity usage to be around €6,000 per annum which was factored into the rent and based on an expected usage of c.36,000 kWh of use during the source of the year, 16.5 cent per kWh…. over the past 18 months with the one year fixed rates exceeding 60 cent per kWh. It is difficult to estimate what the average cost will be over the next 12 months given the volatility of the market.Notwithstanding the above our current rate is c.54 cent per kWh which would equate to c.€19,500 based on the estimated usage for the unit, which I feel is a reasonable guestimate of the kind of levels we can expect. The cost of electricity has increased from 16.5 cent per kWh to 54 cent per kWh and from €6,000 to €19,500 per annum The €6,000 was paid for from core funding. If that core funding does not increase to meet the estimated increase of €13,000 to €14,000, the service will be in significant trouble. There is no fat in the service's funding to cope with this and it cannot be met by cutting programme or training costs or anything else, as its audited accounts show. It has upgraded the heaters and lights in the building to reduce power usage. Without additional funding, though, the service has no way of meeting the increased cost of high energy prices. This service is just one example of the projects facing the energy and cost-of-living crises. The situation will impact on many other projects and voluntary organisations. The service is not a business. A number of Deputies have raised the plight of businesses, including hauliers, nursing homes, etc., but these projects are unique and working off fixed budgets to support the most vulnerable in our society. What finance has the Government put in place to support these section 39 projects and voluntary organisations with the massive increase in their energy bills?

It will create the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which will help businesses with the increased cost of electricity and gas. However, she is correct to point out that the scheme will only apply to businesses. It is run by the Revenue Commissioners and operates in the form of a tax credit. We acknowledge that we will have to help out non-businesses with the high cost of energy. These include sporting organisations in some cases and community centres in others. They may also include addiction services, such as those the Deputy mentioned. We set aside a fund for that in the budget. I am not sure if the question of how that will be deployed has been fully worked out yet, but we accept that we will need to help out those bodies with their high energy costs because if we do not, they will not be able to provide the vital services that they do. The Minister of State with responsibility for drug and addiction services, Deputy Feighan, is just behind me. He would be happy to follow the matter up with the Deputy directly to see if we can assist in any way.

They cannot afford to fail and the Government cannot allow them to. No organisation whose core funding comes from the HSE can afford an increase of €13,000 to €14,000 in energy costs. It is not practical. There must be full cost recovery for section 39 projects. I hope the Government will ensure that happens. There is no fat in these organisations and the Tánaiste knows that they have been cut to the bone over the past ten years. They are running on air and, therefore, it is important that a commitment be given to all projects. Many projects around the country will be in crisis if they do not get a commitment from the Government that the full cost will be met.

I am sure that, if I check into it, I will find that funding for those services has been increased year-on-year and will increase again next year. Leaving that aside, I agree with her fundamental point that energy prices are rising for everyone - households, businesses and voluntary bodies. We have acted to help households with rising energy costs. We are acting at the moment to help businesses with rising energy costs, and that new scheme should be available to them in the next few weeks. We also have to act to assist voluntary and community bodies and some sporting bodies with higher energy costs. We will do that.

I have lost count of the number of times his Governments have made and repeatedly broken promises. According to Children's Health Ireland, CHI, 149 children with scoliosis or spina bifida have been waiting six months or more for surgery, with 117 of those waiting for more than a year. The Minister for Health has said that the promise will again be broken this year. This means that those children will be facing another Christmas living in agony, waking up in the middle of the night because they are in so much pain or left in tears because they cannot do what other children their age, including their friends, can do. No child should be waiting in such an awful situation. No child should be waiting for an operation that can change his or her life. These children and their families need a straight answer. I will ask a question on their behalf. Has the €19 million in additional funding that was announced this year been spent and, if not, why not?

The waiting list, therefore, is coming down.

In 2021, the Labour Party introduced the Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill in the Seanad. If passed, it would allow a woman who experienced an early miscarriage leave from the workplace of up to 20 days and up to ten days of paid leave to any employee who needed time off work to undergo IVF or other reproductive healthcare treatments. The Government assured us in the Seanad that it would co-operate with us on seeing the Bill pass. Eighteen months on, though, we have not seen any progress. On Tuesday, my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, tabled an amendment to the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2022 to provide for this issue at no cost to the Exchequer, but it was disallowed. The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, indicated that research into this issue was under way at UCC, but I am hearing every day from women and couples who are experiencing the trauma and grief of early miscarriage and pregnancy loss and of having to take significant time off work for IVF treatment. Can we see a Government commitment to introducing legislation?

The redress scheme for survivors of sexual abuse in schools only came about through the bravery of Louise O'Keeffe who went to the European Court of Human Rights. The scheme, however, is intentionally restrictive and even with last year's changes it is designed to exclude many, as it is only open to those who had begun legal proceedings prior to July 2021. The Government is fully aware that many cases were dropped or even not initiated following the Supreme Court ruling against Louise O'Keeffe in 2009. This cruel restriction needs to be removed to enable all survivors of abuse to claim redress. Also, there is a glaring need to establish a commission of investigation into sexual and other forms of abuse in our schools.

It arose in Haggard and Ramsgrange and travelled to Balliniry and from Balliniry it went to Milltown and Ballycullane on to Clongeen and finally to Foulkesmill, leaving destruction in its wake for more than 40 families. Their homes and their properties were damaged beyond recognition in many cases. On inspecting the scenes their homes and properties resemble Armageddon. What was equally hurtful and possibly more damaging for the Government was that the 5,000-strong community of south County Wexford believe there was no support from the Government and no recognition of the event. The term that was used was:"If there was breeze in Donnybrook it would make headline news". I am afraid that the people feel very let down by the Government. I have visited many of the homes and have spoken to other affected householders on the phone. The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, did visit. When he was asked what the families were to do, he told them to do nothing until they heard from him. If one is sitting with 40 families who have had the roof ripped off their house, which is probably the minimum of damage-----

I want to know the cost of this ridiculous proposal. It is the Saturday before Christmas. Has the Government any respect for the staff here, or the ushers or anybody else? It is a special sitting just to massage the ego of the Tánaiste and the ego of the Taoiseach. It is on a Saturday, which is not a working day. People are entitled to their rest days. It is a charade but it is an expensive charade for the people of Ireland and for the taxpayers, with all of the problems that are there. People are trying to live, get food to eat, and go to work.

In Ireland, the average proportion of previous earnings that maternity benefit accounts for is 25.2%. It is one of the lowest rates in the OECD and the EU. During the pandemic, people were coming off pandemic payments of €330 per week and being reduced to €250 because they had just had a child. That is a penalisation of women for having children. There will be a proposal coming to the Cabinet soon to realign unemployment benefits with previous payments and with what people were being paid before they became unemployed. Will there be a similar alignment of maternity benefit with average pay? People's requirement to pay their mortgage goes on. Many families are now two-salary families to pay the mortgage. It will be a disincentive. Would the Tánaiste, at the very least, support this being addressed?

Work currently being done by the Minister for Social Protection in moving towards pay-related benefits is not just about jobseekers; it could also apply to maternity benefit, paternity benefit, and illness benefit to better reflect the fact that if people are out of work for a temporary period, the money they get should better reflect what they earn and how much they are paying into the PRSI system. The Deputy referred to maternity benefit. That is the minimum payment. A lot of employers pay more, including in the public sector and the State, and sometimes those international comparisons do not take into account the fact that our system is different. Many employers top up maternity benefit and pay a lot more than that minimum amount.

She has been refused the medical card because she receives a net income of €1 per week on top of her pension for the rent of a field. Her next-door neighbour gets €11 per week more by way of a contributory pension yet qualifies for the medical card. This is all because the income limits for the medical card have not increased since 2005, when the Tánaiste was just 26. By January, the basic rate of social welfare will have gone up by €71.20 over the past 17 years but Una, with an additional income of €1, is deemed too well-off to get a medical card.

I take the criticism that there is some inconsistency when you index means tests in some areas and not others.

They are part of the Not Our Fault campaign and were announcing the major public conference on Saturday, 19 November in the Plaza Hotel, Tallaght. These people bought their apartments or duplexes in good faith, did everything right and now face bills of up to €68,000. This is not their fault but that of successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments that allowed a system of self-certification to reign and of the cowboy builders who jumped through it. There are up to 100,000 victims of that system. The Tánaiste will be Taoiseach again shortly. Will he give a commitment that any scheme introduced will be retrospective? Will he accept the only just and workable solution is 100% redress, with the State then pursuing the builders responsible?

I agree with the Deputy that it is not their fault. We can argue about whose fault it was, but it is definitely not their fault. That is why we need a scheme to help them and the Government intends to have that scheme in place in 2023. I cannot make any promises or commitments about the detail of that but the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is working on it and I can give the commitment that this is something I care about. It affects many people in my constituency. We will do everything we can to get the scheme up and running next year.

This happened across the country and across Dublin and, since the ending of the emergency phase of the pandemic nine months ago, we have seen these steadily return.One part of the capital, however, namely Leopardstown, Dublin 18, in the constituency the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and I represent, is still under-serviced in this area. In Leopardstown there are no developmental checks and the public health nurses are not making those visits. Instead, new parents have been told to go to their local GPs. The GPs are absolutely swamped. They do not have the capacity. Will the Government intervene to provide these new babies and their parents with the basic level of care needed in developmental checks?

There may be a particular issue with staffing in one or two parts of the country. There is a difficulty recruiting public health nurses at the moment. We are definitely working on that.

That is a really important measure. Many people are waiting for it, particularly because of the benefits of the better energy warmer homes scheme, but the Department is indicating that the payments will be made in the first quarter of next year and backdated to 1 January.

In that context I wish to raise with the Tánaiste a very serious issue, that is, the fact that five male republican prisoners who are on remand in Roe House, in Maghaberry Prison, are being strip-searched twice a day and being brought to and from court. That means over 100 strip-searches or, as they are called in the jargon, full-body searches, are being carried out on these men over a 12-day period. The prison authorities have the technology to obviate the necessity of doing this. I believe that it is unnecessary and purposely degrading treatment and conflicts with any decent human rights code. It seems to be directed solely against republicans. It is also worth noting that two women co-accused prisoners in Hydebank prison are, very thankfully, not being subjected to this treatment. Will the Tánaiste assure me that urgent representations - and I mean urgent because these hearings are going on day after day - will be made to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and to the British Prime Minister to stop this barbaric treatment from happening?

I am pleased to bring the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022 before the House. This is a significant Bill that will update our existing legislation on incitement to hatred and provide for hate crimes for the first time in Irish law. The development of this legislation has been long awaited by many and is a key commitment in the programme for Government. In introducing this Bill, the Government will deliver on its commitments: to introduce hate crime legislation based on an aggravated offences model and create specific offences to ensure those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic are identified as perpetrators of hate crime; and, in order to ensure that those who seek to encourage and incite others to hate minority groups can be prosecuted, to revise and update the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, taking account of the public consultation conducted in 2019. Members of minority and vulnerable communities have spoken time and again about the horrendous and unacceptable prejudice, contempt and hostility they face daily. They have been targeted and subject to horrific abuse, and attacks, simply because of their identity. When we hear about these incidents, the victims are commended for their courage in speaking out and drawing attention to the discrimination and hatred that they face. However, it is no longer good enough to give people a pat on the back. These communities deserve to be protected, to have their identities and cultures celebrated and to live without fear of victimisation simply because of who they are. Many individuals in our country live their lives hiding a part of themselves, modifying their daily routines and changing the way they dress, speak and present themselves to the world, all in order to avoid being targeted. This is not the vision I have for this country, nor is it that of many others. It does not reflect the tolerant society we want to live in. This new legislation will contribute fundamentally to allowing everybody in Ireland to live without fear as they live the most authentic version of themselves. The Government's vision is of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland. We want to build stronger, safer communities. An inclusive Ireland is one where crimes motivated by prejudice, hate or bigotry are not tolerated and where everybody feels safe and is safe. We want perpetrators of this vile behaviour to know they will be punished for spreading hate, prejudice and division. In developing this legislation, my Department carried out an extensive public consultation process. It began in 2019 and comprised surveys, stakeholder consultations, a call for detailed submissions and focused group work. Seven independently facilitated discussion workshops took place around the country. A series of meetings were held with interested groups, organisations, academics, law enforcement personnel, professionals and other experts. Several representative groups against hate crime have worked on this. I thank everybody who was engaged in getting the legislation to this point. This engagement resulted in vital insights from the communities and, in particular, individuals most impacted by hate speech and hate crime. The often moving and distressing testimonies of individuals and groups recounting their lived experiences of hostility and abuse provided the imperative to ensure that the new legislation would be victim-centred and effective. The findings of this public consultation process, along with analysis of qualitative data gathered in the stakeholder workshops and research by my Department into hate legislation in other jurisdictions all informed the report, Legislating for Hate Speech and Hate Crime in Ireland: Report on the Public Consultation 2020. The conclusions drawn in this report underpin the legislation before the House and are grounded in the reality of what minority and vulnerable communities experience and need under the law.  Let me turn to the Bill itself and outline what is proposed. Part 1 is standard. It gives the Title to the Bill and provides definitions for the many important terms used throughout.This part also sets out the protected characteristics for the purpose of the Bill, which are race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origin, descent, sexual orientation, gender, including gender expression or gender identity, sex characteristics and disability. These protected grounds have been expanded from those set out in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 and now include descent, gender, disability and sex characteristics. The protected characteristics represent those most frequently mentioned by individuals throughout the course of the public consultation and in the submissions made to the Joint Committee on Justice when conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation. The list of protected characteristics will be kept under review and if evidence emerges of hate offences or hate speech targeting an identity characteristic not listed in the Bill, it may be added at a later date. This section will also repeal, in its entirety, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which is being replaced by updated provisions that I will summarise shortly. This Part also contains a standard commencement provision and standard expenses provision. Part 2 deals with incitement to violence or hatred, or hate speech. The principal purpose of this Part is to provide for a new offence of incitement to violence or hatred that will replace the provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989. While in some respects, the 1989 Act was ahead of its time 30 years ago, regrettably, it has not been effective in securing more than a few dozen convictions over the intervening period. As a consequence, I have directed that the incitement offences be updated to ensure that they are more effective, clearer and more reflective of the current context. The new legislation will lower the threshold for criminal incitement to violence or hatred to include "recklessness" and in so doing, will mean that prosecutions are more likely to be secured. This means that a person must either have deliberately set out to incite hatred or violence, or at the very least have considered whether what they were doing would incite hatred, concluded that it was significantly likely, and decided to go ahead anyway. This change from the 1989 Act to include "recklessness" was welcomed in submissions to the pre-legislative scrutiny process. It means that any intentional or reckless communication or behaviour that is likely to incite violence or hatred against a person or persons because they are associated with a protected characteristic can be criminalised. The Bill also provides for criminalisation of the condoning, denial or gross trivialisation of genocide and other crimes against humanity by creating a new offence as required under the European Council Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia. A new, separate and lesser offence of preparation or possession of material likely to incite violence or hatred has also been included in the Bill. This will apply to individuals who create hateful content with the intention of communicating it in order to incite violence or hatred, but have not yet communicated it publicly. I am aware that there has been much attention and interest in how the right to freedom of expression is reflected in this legislation. This right is enshrined in our Constitution and in the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the right to free speech is not absolute, and limits may be placed on it by law to protect other fundamental rights. I am confident that this Bill strikes the correct balance in protecting freedom of expression with the rights of minority and vulnerable communities to be protected from hate speech. The Bill expressly provides that a communication will not be taken to incite violence or hatred solely on the basis that it involves discussion or criticism of matters relating to protected characteristics. I want to stress that this legislation is not about enforced politeness, or political correctness - it is about providing protection to those who need it and those who currently experience extreme forms of criminal hate speech. While individuals can hold and express opinions that others might find offensive or shocking, I want to make it very clear that it is extreme forms of hate speech that deliberately and recklessly incite or stir up acts of hostility, discrimination or violence that will be criminalised. People may hold different views and opinions, and we do not intend to criminalise them. Such people will not be liable to conviction for hate speech. There are defences available for reasonable and genuine contributions to literary, artistic, political, religious, scientific, or academic discourse that are made in good faith. A "reasonable and genuine contribution" will have to be shown to be a contribution that is considered by a reasonable person, including a judge or jury, as being reasonably necessary in the context of a debate or discussion involving a protected characteristic. We are all aware that online hate speech is an increasingly insidious problem that our current legislation is not equipped to address. This is not surprising given that the 1989 Act was not drafted with the online world we live in today in mind. The new provisions of this Bill have been crafted carefully in order that they operate effectively in both an online and offline context. I acknowledge the very important work of the Department of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, in this regard. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, which is currently making its way through the Houses, will play a pivotal role in regulating and managing hate content online and will dovetail with the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022. Through the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, an online safety commissioner is being appointed to oversee the development of legally binding online safety codes. These codes will govern the operation of social media companies, many of which have headquarters in Ireland, and will ensure that they take appropriate action to remove any hateful, or otherwise illegal, content promptly from their platforms. My officials have been working closely with officials in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to ensure that the operation of these two important pieces of legislation is in tandem. Part 3 relates to hate crimes based on an aggravated offences model in line with the programme for Government commitment. This model involves creating new "hate crime" offences where specific offences are aggravated by hate of a protected characteristic. The Bill as published provides for 12 new specific hate offences. The reason they have been chosen is that they are the most commonly cited crimes against people on identity grounds. The aggravated offences will attract a higher penalty than the ordinary form of the offence, unless the ordinary form already attracts the maximum penalty possible. There is a safeguard included whereby if there is not sufficient evidence to convict a person of the "hate crime" version of the offence, they may still be convicted of the "ordinary" form. This is to encourage the prosecution of hate crimes and avoid any risk that the entire prosecution will fail if the hate element cannot be proven. If a person is assaulted, there can still be a conviction for assault. A person is guilty of a hate-aggravated offence under this Part if he or she commits one of the core offences and in doing so he or she is motivated by hatred of a protected characteristic, or demonstrates hatred based on a protected characteristic at the time of committing the offence. For all of the offences in this Part, hatred may be based on the victim's actual or presumed membership of a group associated with a protected characteristic. As I indicated, these offences include both a motivation test and demonstration test as the test of proof. As initially drafted, the general scheme provided only for a motivation test for hate crimes. However, in the course of drafting the Bill, it became evident that a motivation test alone in proving hate offences sets too high a threshold and would likely be unsuccessful in securing convictions. Relevant stakeholders, including academics and those representing minority groups, advocated for inclusion of a demonstration test in their submissions to the Joint Committee on Justice during the pre-legislative scrutiny process. The committee included this as a key recommendation in the subsequent report. A demonstration test hinges on the perpetrator demonstrating hatred towards a member of a protected group or characteristic at the time of an offence being committed. This would involve, for example, the use of hostile or prejudiced slurs, gestures, other symbols or graffiti at the time of offending. The primary difference between a demonstrative model and a motivational model is that, under a demonstration test, the prosecution must prove the demonstration of hostility, but no subjective intent or motivation is required; it is an objective test. Conversely, a motivation test requires proof of the defendant's subjective motivation for committing the offence, which can set a higher bar to secure a conviction. Following the recommendation by the justice committee, my Department carried out extensive additional research and consultation, including meetings with representatives from neighbouring jurisdictions in the UK where the demonstration test has been in operation for many years, and with An Garda Síochána, the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and the Attorney General. On the basis of further research and consideration, I made the decision to include the demonstration test in the legislation to ensure that it would be successful in securing convictions where they are needed. I am pleased to note that this decision was welcomed by representatives of many of the groups that have engaged with us. In concluding these opening remarks, I am certain that all sides of the House appreciate the need for this legislation and the positive impact that its enactment will have on the communities and individuals most affected by hate speech and hate crime in our country. It will encourage victims to come forward and report hate-related incidents to An Garda Síochána. More than 350 Garda diversity officers are trained, developed and supported to engage with and attend to the concerns of our minority, diverse and hard-to-reach communities right across the country. They provide reassurance, build trust and extend the accessibility of the Garda service to these groups. In addition, the Garda national diversity and integration unit monitors all incidents recorded on PULSE that have a discriminatory motive.It advises, supports and assists gardaí who are investigating incidents that may have a discriminatory motive attached. Once enacted, the Bill will ensure hate-motivated offences in our communities can be investigated and prosecuted as such. This will help to deliver a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland. I look forward to Deputies' contributions and will be happy to address any concerns or questions they may have regarding certain aspects of the Bill. In summary, it seeks to ensure that people in this country who do not feel safe and who do not go about their daily lives in the way they should will feel comfortable in coming forward where these types of incidents, whether acts of violence or incitement to hatred, happen, and to support the Garda in ensuring there will be criminal convictions. While we need to protect individuals' right to free speech and must not stifle debate, there is a line and where it is crossed, we must be clear as a society that we will not tolerate that.
#PaDaly	unknown-#PaDaly-party	unknown-#PaDaly-dob	unknown-#PaDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	335	We welcome the intent behind the Bill and the effort and work that has clearly gone into addressing the needs of people who experience hatred on account of who they are. As the Minister said, people need to feel safe and we accept that the current Act is not effective. We have received, as I am sure all Deputies have, many submissions on the Bill, even after the pre-legislative scrutiny concluded, and there seems to be an attempt to get it through as quickly as possible. We agreed that the amendments deadline, which was yesterday, should not usually fall before Second Stage but, in fairness, the Joint Committee on Justice has examined and dealt with more legislation than any other committee. While it is not exactly on all fours with the Bill, there were recently some disturbing events in my constituency where certain elements have claimed that there are examples of no-go areas in the county and suggested gardaí have said this. Senior members of An Garda Síochána have stated this is rubbish and totally untrue, yet a number of people have contacted me about it, some of whom are perhaps naive while others are not so. The agenda of these content creators who trade in hate is to divide communities and stir up tensions. As for the Bill, we support its intent and our primary concern is for it to strike the right balance. Submissions from the likes of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and academics from the University of Limerick have sought clarity on a number of areas within it. There seems to be a difficulty, according to some of the submissions we received, with the definition of "hatred", perhaps suggesting the definition as outlined will act as a sort of a stalking horse inviting amendments on a later Stage, and I think it will probably be amended at some stage. It seems to be circular as defining “hatred” as hatred towards a group or individual based on protected characteristics, and perhaps this needs to be fleshed out at a later stage. While I understand the need for a simple definition, there are alternatives, and the ICCL recommended that this definition be replaced by one provided by the Council of Europe’s European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance and endorsed by the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. That definition states:Hatred shall mean a state of mind characterised as intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation towards the target group.Of course, we believe in the fundamental right to free speech, but this core right should not be allowed to be abused to incite hate, prejudice or violence against others. Freedom of speech is not a one-way street, and the vulnerable must be protected and feel that they are safe and protected. No one has the right to shout "Fire!" in a crowded theatre. The Bill, as outlined by the Minister, contains three major provisions, namely, creating the new offence of incitement to hatred, making the denial or gross trivialisation of genocide a crime and creating aggravated versions of the existing offences where hatred was a motivating factor. It represents a major reform of existing laws and amounts to a single statute for crimes relating to hatred. I commend all the work that has taken place on this. A single statute on hate crime is something we support in principle. It can go some way towards offering a proper means of recourse for those who have suffered as a result of hate crime. Nevertheless, we need to be careful about using the criminal law without addressing the root causes of prejudice in society. A concurrent action plan on reducing hate crime is required and should be prioritised by the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. At a general level, inequality also fuels prejudice and there must be a wider effort to address poor housing, unemployment and inadequate healthcare. These failures affect working people no matter whether they are born here or are fleeing Russian aggression in Ukraine or discrimination and war in other parts of the world. We have a long and proud record of opposing divisions in this Republic. We want to build an island free of divisions of any type and we stand for all workers and families no matter what else is said. The rationale and grounds for the inclusion or exclusion of aggravated offences should be clarified as the Bill moves through the House. A defence of free expression, as outlined, is in principle a good idea but, again, there must a clear definition. The notion of a contribution towards discourse can be subjective - one person's hate speech can be another person's debate - and the subjectivity of what constitutes a fair remark may be difficult to ascertain in practice. What consequences the criminalisation of the distribution of materials may have on free speech should also be clarified. Indeed, we need clarity on whether there is a fallback within the legislation where a non-aggravated version of the crime has taken place if a jury finds the hate element has not been proven. The general provision on hatred as an aggravating factor should, perhaps, also be amended, as has been recommended, to include presumed membership of the protected group. In terms of policy provisions backing the implementation of the Bill, the use of restorative justice in these offences should be examined. Judging by some work carried out in the North of Ireland, many victims simply want to avoid a repeat of the bad behaviour, and restorative justice may be appropriate in those circumstances. This will avoid some of the inevitable issues that will arise from the use of criminal law to combat prejudice; it cannot be done on its own. The consequences of conviction for an offence are, of course, serious. It is arguable that although many of the Bill’s provisions envisage that cases will be prosecuted in the District Court, a conviction in respect of hate crime should be taken only in the clearest circumstances and should not be clarified as a minor offence fit to be tried summarily. Another criticism of the Bill relates to the equating of offences, and the Minister spoke at length about the demonstrable side of things. Some criticism has come from academics in regard to equating the offences without motive with those that were planned in advance. For example, under section 18, if a person, at the time of the offence or immediately before or after doing so, demonstrates hatred and if that hatred is on account of presumed membership of a group, there is a demonstration test. This has come under some criticism from academics, which is all the more reason the allegation in cases should consider education and de-escalation along with addressing the general inequalities in having a role to play in delivering justice. That is not to excuse what is said in the heat of the moment, but equating the types of offences has been criticised given the serious consequences. The justice system must ensure it will not create any further divisions. I look forward to moving amendments on Committee and Report Stages and hope we will be allowed further time for a full debate.

I ask the Minister to consider his amendments. We are acting in good faith to work with the Government on this because we believe that providing for a single statute for hate crime is appropriate. We have some concerns with the Bill and these need to be heard, but what we want to see is an action plan for implementation. For too long, vulnerable cohorts in our society have felt as though they have no protection. We need to send a clear message that targeting people because of their race, sexuality or gender is not acceptable and will not be tolerated. I pay homage to the Traveller Visibility Group and the Traveller Women’s Network in Cork, which have done wonderful work in promoting the rights of members of the Travelling community and combating those who target them. These groups, alongside Cork City Council, have held some very positive events in recent years highlighting the history, culture and way of life of the Travelling community. Events like this are so important in reducing stigma and learning about those around us. We still see a lot of racism directed towards Travellers. For many, it is the last acceptable form of racism. I want to be very clear. It is wrong, it is unfair and it must be stopped. Alongside this, we acknowledge the stigma that is faced by those in the LGBTQ+ community. We passed the marriage equality Bill four years ago but there is still huge work to be done for that community. This legislation will also give them the protections they so desperately need and want. We should also recognise those who are working to combat racism. In my constituency, St. Vincent’s Secondary School, which my daughter attends, has been awarded the yellow flag. I say well done to all the students, teachers and parents for their work on combating racism and promoting inclusion. In her eye-opening report, Afrophobia in Ireland: Racism Against People of African Descent, which I encourage everyone to read, Dr. Lucy Michael discussed the everyday racism faced by people of African descent in Ireland. This was in 2015 and we would like to think we have moved on. However, I am not sure we have moved on to the degree we would like to have seen. That is really disappointing. As the crises in housing and health get worse and successive governments refuse to take the blame, people look to put the blame somewhere. Pitting vulnerable people against each other is exactly what failing governments want. It is wrong. We need to fight this every step of the way. When children sleep in hotel rooms tonight, we must not look at our neighbours and friends or try to blame other communities or groups. That is not where the blame lays. We certainly should not be blaming those who are fleeing war. We should be putting the blame where it belongs, which is in this Chamber. These policies should have been addressed. The crises of housing and health should have been addressed. We are now seeing those policies allowing the rich to get richer while the vulnerable become more vulnerable. As the housing crisis worsens and despair deepens, people begin to lose hope and anger builds. My worry and that of many people is where that anger is put. I believe the wrong people are being blamed. We must be clear; this is not right. In 2020, people came out and voted for change. They voted for a positive vision of this island where every child has a safe roof over his or her head; a caring society in which people have full bellies and open arms. That change is going to happen but unfortunately, it will take a while. We must not let those with hidden agendas tear us apart while we strive for change. Today’s legislation is a positive step. It recognises that there is no space in our society or communities for hate. I again ask the Minister to consider the amendments tabled by Deputy Daly, and work with us and with those of other parties and none to make the strongest possible Bill we can bring forward to combat hate in our society.

I am very privileged to represent an incredibly diverse constituency. I genuinely believe the diversity we have in Fingal is a massive strength for my area and for our communities. I encourage the Minister to engage with her Government colleagues and remind them of the leadership role they have and must embrace within our constituency. There was a house fire in my area recently. I will not identify where it was. A woman and her young family were traumatised by the destruction of their home. The site was still warm with smoke still rising from it when some of the Minister's Government colleagues went on the airwaves to speculate about the fire and whether there was a racial element to it. There was not. They would have found that out if instead of picking up the telephone to one of those shock-jock types, they had actually bothered to go and talk to the family. They would have known that was just a horrible accident that left a family traumatised. Then, piled on top of that was this speculation and rhetoric. It really did not help. That fire was an accident. The message people got from the Minister's colleagues was no accident, however, and they heard it loud and clear. They should have gone to that site and talked to the people in the community. I am really hopeful that as we go through the debate on this legislation we will have a mature discussion, just as we did with the eighth amendment when everybody stood in this Chamber and said we must have a respectful debate. Many people changed their minds and learned because we were able to have a respectful debate and a good discussion. There were people who tried to interrupt it. The same people will probably try to interrupt this but we need to be absolutely steadfast. We must deal with facts. We must be mature and responsible but must also acknowledge the leadership role we as politicians must have. I want to use the remainder of my time to pay tribute to those in my community who work really hard to combat racism, hatred, homophobia and misinformation, because that is a huge part of it. It is fuelling much of what we see. The hatred that we see online is fuelled by misinformation and people deliberately misrepresenting the facts. Sometimes, the message is picked up and repeated by politicians. That has to stop. We need to be sure of our sources but we also need to know that when we speak, we have a responsibility to all of the people in our communities. I want to recognise in particular the work of Fingal Communities Against Racism. I cannot name everyone but they are doing fantastic work. I want to say a special word of thanks to Dr. Lucy Michael for her work, not just with Fingal Communities Against Racism but also in challenging racism and championing equality, diversity and inclusion. We need to have that balance as we go through the debate on this legislation. It is not just about challenging the racism, homophobia, hate speech and disgusting vile language; it is also about presenting that positive message. Fingal Communities Against Racism is a group of people doing what we can to help in our area. Sometimes, that means gathering up clothes and supplies to bring to people who are living in direct provision centres that are inhumane, which I think is the kindest way I can put it. Sometimes, it is about helping out with a language resource or some supports for new members of our community. There is always something to be done. I will be honest; it is usually not me doing it. It is other people. However, I try to do a bit if I can. I encourage the four other Deputies in my constituency to get involved. I am sure they are aware of the work Fingal Communities Against Racism does. It would be great to see them there. I remind them again of the leadership role they have. They need to take that seriously. It needs to inform their work and also their activism. If they had been in touch with the people in Fingal Communities Against Racism, they would not have been as quick to contact the shock-jock. They would not have been as quick to judgment and would not have caused all of the hurt that could have been avoided within my community. I also want to touch briefly on the racism experienced by Travellers in this State. It truly is the last acceptable form of racism in our discourse, so much so that in this Chamber in the Dáil and in the Seanad, several of the Minister's Government colleagues and others have had to apologise publicly for their use of racist language with regard to Travellers. Indeed, they have celebrated publicly their opposition to Traveller housing. It is absolutely disgusting. It is good that they have apologised for it, but it would be better if we could say with certainty that it will not happen again. Travellers in this State have the lowest levels of life expectancy and the highest rates of death by suicide compared with the general population. If that does not scream at us that we have a problem, I do not know what will. I hope that this legislation will go some way towards combating the racism experienced by Irish Travellers. There is so much for our Traveller friends to be proud of. My colleague, an Teachta Gould, mentioned the yellow flag scheme. Some of the schools in my area have the flag, including St. Oliver Plunkett's National School in Balrothery. It is a great example of positive work being done. We have said loads of times that people are not born racist; they are taught racism. They hear racism. When they hear it from people who are here, who are elected, that has an even stronger message. That is why we need to be really careful. There is so much good work being done yet a recent survey tells us that 55% of people would not want Travellers living in their community while 85% would not have a Traveller as a friend. When we talk about populism and populist language, those on the Government benches need to check themselves. That is the language they use. They are very quick to say this is populist and that is populist. They should look at those statistics and see what they are doing. Leadership is what they should be providing. It takes a bit of bravery to do it, absolutely, but it is the right thing to do and it should be done.  Rose Marie Maughan, a very well known human rights activist, says in a tweet about this legislation: "Lets hope it will be a law that will help everyone from hate crimes including Irish Travellers." I very much echo that sentiment.

We have been campaigning for it for many years. Previous Ministers for Justice said there was no need for it because of the 1989 Act which, as the Minister has just admitted, was ineffective. We welcome this debate and opportunity and we welcome the legislation, which we have to get right. I want to start on a positive note. I have just come from the Irish Traveller Movement Yellow Flag Awards in the Ark in Temple Bar. I saw all the children. If any of us wants to have any hope for the future, we should go to a school engaged in the yellow flag process and see what those children are achieving together and what we can learn from them. It was so inspirational and emotional to see children from all parts of the country coming together talking about their learnings and living in an Ireland which is so much more rich and exciting than the Ireland I grew up in. The Ireland I grew up in was stale, old and failed and everybody wanted to leave it. Now we have a country which is full of families who have come here to become Irish, to be Irish and to share this international experience. It is facilitated by the Irish Traveller Movement. I see Bernard Joyce is in the Gallery and he is so very welcome to witness this debate. It is striking, however, that the teachers of these children do not look like the children in their schools as much as they should. The first interface of a child with the State is probably in their primary school, maybe in junior infants. Far too many of our teachers are not as diverse as the children they teach. We need to challenge that and rectify it. There are reasons behind it. We do not need to flesh them out here. It has been said that hate comes from somewhere. Hate comes from ignorance and fear. It can come from poverty but not always. Some of the most closed-minded people I have ever come across are those who have most. Those who have most sometimes are most worried about losing what they have. They have this perception that equality is about taking from them the privilege they have and have always had. We need to challenge that as well. On the legislation, I have great misgivings as to how this is being done and how the Bill is being managed. We were asked as Members of the Oireachtas to submit our amendments yesterday, before the Second Stage debate which was due to happen yesterday and is happening today. That is not the way to do business. I raised it on the Order of Business yesterday. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform admitted that it was not best practice as did the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I have written to the Ceann Comhairle to express my disappointment and to make clear that if we are trying to amend legislation that we have to get right, because we have waited so long to get it right, we have to do it in the proper way. To demand of Deputies to submit amendments to a Bill before the Second Stage debate is not the best way to go about it. Leadership has been spoken of. I accept what other Deputies have said about political leadership, yet within these Houses we have had voices who have not helped. We cannot pretend that all of this hatred comes from anonymous online groups. We have to call it out for what it is wherever it happens. It happens in this Chamber. We have a Deputy of this House who has said that asylum seekers are freeloaders, hoodlums and blackguards. We have another Deputy who speaks in this Chamber and who has said that asylum seekers and immigrants need to be deprogrammed. We have members of the Minister's own party who have said that they will not deal with black Africans. We have had the most disgusting, violent, appalling things said about the Traveller community for as long as I have been involved in politics and people generally get away with such statements. They may have a small period of suspension from a political party but there is always a readmittance. That has to be called out and it has to stop. All of us in our own political entities, groupings and organisations have an absolute responsibility to call out hate and racism wherever it comes from. It is not good enough for us in the political system to stand up and make speeches about how much we agree with ourselves on how hate is terrible, but at the same time sit in committees and chambers with people who are well versed in using language to punch down on vulnerable communities when they know they can get away with it. One of the Minister's own colleagues, who just happens to be the Chair of the education committee, only two weeks ago described people in addiction as "druggies". He was speaking from about two rows behind the Minister. We all have a responsibility in how we manage the way we speak. We have an issue with hate. We have to understand hate, define it and work to eradicate it. We have to understand where it comes from. Criminalising it is one way of doing it but education is another aspect of what we have to speak about. If somebody is guilty of an offence under this Act, we have to meet what everybody wants to happen and what the victims of such a hate crime want to happen, namely that this individual will not reoffend and it will not happen again. We have to ensure that there will be a process by which this person can understand how their hatred has led to a situation of such destruction, unhappiness, anger and pain. We need to reflect on that. What we do not want is for somebody who is convicted of an offence under this legislation to double down on their hatred. There absolutely will be bad actors out there who will convince an individual who may be guilty of an offence that this is political correctness gone mad and that they have been criminalised for something that was in their head and that this is what happens when progressive politics goes too far. They will double down and potentially commit themselves to a lifelong venture of hatred. We need to be mindful of that. We have received submissions from academics, and particularly from the University of Limerick. I give great credit to Dr. Jennifer Schweppe and Dr. Amanda Haynes for the work they have done over more than ten years advocating in this space. When someone who has advocated for hate crime legislation for so long points out deficiencies in the Bill, we really have to take notice of what they are saying. We are anxious to get this legislation passed but we cannot rush it. If we get this wrong, if we make a mistake or if there is a false line in what we produce or pass, there are well-organised and well-financed groups that will pick holes in what we have passed and use that to politicise and radicalise young men in particular. The Ireland that I grew up in was made for people just like me. It was made for white, middle-class, able-bodied, heterosexual men. It was made for us. We have always run this place. We see ourselves everywhere. When I was growing up I saw people just like me in positions of power. The teacher, the garda and the person on television all spoke like me, all looked like me and all sounded like me. Such figures tended to be white, middle-class, able-bodied, settled, heterosexual males. If we walk around the halls of this esteemed building we generally see people who look just like me. If someone does not come from the background I come from and does not have that experience of seeing people just like themselves in positions of authority, they need the political system to work for them. It was interesting listening to the children this morning and to the presenter, Emer O'Neill. She is from an African background; her father is from Nigeria. She said she came to the conclusion when she was six that she just wanted to be different. She was dying to be different from what she was; she was dying to be the same as everybody else, because she was half African. That is such a heartbreaking thing to hear any child think. I am coming back to the point about the legislation and how we have to be so sure that if somebody falls foul of it, it is not something that is going to hang over them forever but offers potential for them to redeem themselves and think differently about themselves and their conduct. There is a difference. We have to concede that there is a difference in respect of a premeditated action of somebody who is hate-filled and decides to organise a hateful action of violence against a group or individual that they hate because of their identity. There is a difference between that and somebody in the course of a criminal action who is heard to utter something that is discriminatory. Those are two different things and if we treat them similarly we are making a grave mistake. We are possibly losing that second person for good by making them a hate criminal in so much as they are now equated with the individual who did something that was premeditated and organised. We need to reflect on that. That is why we feel so strongly about the amendments we have put down and why we are determined to work with the Minister and to ensure that this Bill, which has long been sought, is successful. Let us learn from the children. We had our chance. This is the country we have effectively shaped at this point in our lives but they come from a different Ireland to the one I came from. Their Ireland is so much more exciting, fresher, richer and has so much more talent. I am envious of the Ireland they and our children are growing up in versus the failed country and state I grew up in. I want them to grow up in a country that reflects them so that when they see people in power, people of influence and role models in their communities, they look just like them. We have to reflect on how many people of different backgrounds are in An Garda Síochána, politics, the teaching profession and other professions. How can we empower people to do that? We have to reflect on the comments that are made in chambers like this. It is quite rightly said that anti-Traveller sentiment is given free rein in too many political chambers. It is the last bastion of hatred which is almost given social acceptance. That has to be challenged and we have to do it in chambers such as this. Those who will punch down need to be challenged in political chambers. As we move forward it is not good enough for us to produce legislation in which, while doing the right thing, we make a mistake in labelling somebody for saying something stupid in the course of a criminal action, versus a person who has, over a period of time, demonstrated their hatred and organisation around that hatred. We have to be mindful of that and restorative justice has been mentioned. With all those things in mind, this is what a republic does. This is not about limiting free speech or thought policing. This is about ensuring that every child who grows up in this country can feel at ease and be themselves. Being themselves should be enough and no child at the age of six should ever have the heartbreaking thought cross their mind when they look in the mirror and wish that they were not what they were. We have to ensure that every child we have can grow in a country in which they are respected and that if there comes a point where an organised hate group or an individual decides to undermine them, the law is there to protect them and root that out. We have our responsibilities as well and Members of this Oireachtas need to know and be put on notice that we will be calling them out.

I welcome the Bill and I am grateful to the Minister for Justice for bringing it forward. Since her time in this office she has relentlessly pursued this much-needed and long overdue Bill and that is a phrase that will be used by most contributors at this stage; it is long overdue. It is a difficult Bill in some regards but it is the most basic and easiest Bill in other regards. This is about stopping the spread of hate in whichever form it comes, particularly when it is premeditated hate that is directly and centrally organised and when it is used, as we have so often and sadly seen, as part of a wider process that sadly leads to the worst possible consequences. I have been extremely concerned about some people outside of this Chamber who have raised opposition to this Bill. They have tried to bring it into a wider debate and fit it into some sort of culture war they want to talk about when they say free speech is constantly under attack, that the Bill is preventing the right to offend, or that it is preventing the right to poke fun and everything else like that. However, it is quite clear that this Bill does not seek to do that. This Bill comes from a far better place. Sadly we often see that the people talking about the defence of free speech and saying they will not let themselves be cancelled are the first people to try to shut down an argument and baulk at the fact that they are being challenged. I welcome this good legislation but I raise my concerns about how we can ensure it works best to prevent hate speech and protect the victims. As Deputy Ó Ríordáin said, when it comes to those who may be found guilty of a hate crime the intention must be to ensure it does not happen again, not just by cancelling or punishing them but by rehabilitating them and ensuring that it is policed properly. One area that will be raised by pretty much every contributor is the ongoing concern, that is topical this week due to a different issue, with the platform that is being used most widely and perhaps freely to spread hate speech in social media. This is nothing new; hate speech has always existed over time and people have always found the most contemporary and accessible platform to spread hate. Those people are in a severe minority but they exist, they deserve to be called out and they are not always acting ignorantly or with less ulterior motives. There are a couple of areas that need to follow on in tandem with this legislation or that are directly strengthened by the legislation but I would like to raise the following matter first. This is something I have raised with the Minister during the last two budgetary cycles, namely resources for An Garda Síochána to tackle and monitor things online. That does not just come down to hate speech. We have subversive organisations and criminal entities organising online and using online platforms to communicate and exchange information and arrangements. That is an area that is constantly evolving and providing a constant threat when we look at the area of cybercrime and cyber-attacks. On a smaller scale we must ensure the ICT resources of An Garda Síochána and other agencies of the State are constantly funded, improved upon and evolving because one can never stand still when it comes to something like this. Equally and in tandem with that there has to be an approach of working hand-in-hand or in a directed motive towards the social media companies that are acting as platforms and publishing agencies for so much of the hate speech we seek to tackle in this Bill. Every Member of this House has been attacked online at one point or another and has been a victim of hate speech. There are different degrees of this. The majority of Deputies in the Chamber at the moment are women and they get it far worse than men. If we fail to acknowledge that as men we fail to identify what is a clear societal problem that needs to be tackled through education and that also needs strict legislation on hate speech to ensure such carry on cannot continue. We see it regularly when it comes to race, religion and personal appearance where it is not just poking fun but directing hate and these online motives sadly lead to more difficult situations in the real world. It is often hate speech that makes the vocation we have all chosen to enter so unappealing to so many people, and that has such worrying consequences. That is why I fundamentally agree that the continuing practice of anonymity online is one that is truly worrying. The fact is that multiple accounts can be continually set up by the same entity or individual in order to allow them to continue to pursue a clear campaign of hate. You can use any sort of anecdotal evidence to this that you want or you can use the direct evidence that shows the serious amount of hate crimes that are happening in this jurisdiction. The fact is that the vast majority are consistently going online on social media platforms that do not care. How many times have we had to report to various social media companies about comments and threats to ourselves, other people, our family members, organisations we work with and people we advocate on behalf of as public representatives, only to see the constant spewing bilge of uneducated nastiness that is pure premeditated hate?The social media companies say the actions do not violate their terms and conditions. It is a phrase that turns me blue in the face every time I hear it about ten times a day when returning to my office, to the extent that I think they want us to stop reporting things.  We must ensure that we have legislation, which I believe we have, that is flexible and watertight. It must ensure that a responsibility is placed on these social media companies to actually live up to their end of the bargain and their obligations under law. The ramifications for companies that do not abide by the law of this jurisdiction must be real and must be demonstrated to a population that is becoming increasingly concerned and worried about entering into the public fray or debate due to the fact that the response of co-ordinated hatred is so willfully allowed by too many platforms.

My colleague, an Teachta Daly, has met with several relevant stakeholders, such as the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, ICCL, and has tabled a number of amendments to the Bill. Sinn Féin will work constructively with the Government, other Opposition parties and Independents to strengthen the legislation and improve it to ensure it strikes the right balance between protecting vulnerable groups and persons while also protecting the right to free speech. We believe that while well-intentioned, it is poorly drafted in some areas. For example, we need to be clearer on the definition of "hatred". To say that hate means hate is not clear enough. We support a single statute on hate, but it must strike the right balance. We have tabled an amendment to ensure that offences are proven beyond reasonable doubt. There should also be an element of restorative justice, an effort to address prejudice and to educate to prevent reoffending. The prioritisation of a carceral-only approach may not have the intended results, and the Minister should endeavour to bring forward measures that educate the wider public and reduce the incidence of hate crimes in the first instance. I commend the work of the Far-Right Observatory who are doing great work to tackle the growth of far-right ideologies. We must tackle those who take advantage of vulnerable people to further their hateful agenda. Likewise, we must support, assist, and educate persons susceptible to this hateful messaging. Unfortunately, social media amplify their message, and there must be stronger protections in place to address this. I acknowledge that inequality can fuel prejudice. The failure of successive Governments to fix the housing crisis or deliver a fit-for-purpose health system has left many people angry and let down. Others are using these crises to blame minority groups, such as Travellers and people seeking asylum. Yet, we, on this side of the House, know exactly where the blame for these crises lies. Most people know it is the treatment of a roof over our heads as a commodity to be bought and sold for profit that created this crisis. Members of our Traveller community make up 1% of the population but 12% of our homeless people. This is caused by the failure of successive Governments to ensure that enough Traveller accommodation was built. We are all human, we all want the best for our families and we all want a roof over our heads.  Finally, I would like to remember Declan Flynn today, a 31-year-old man from Dublin who was chased and killed by a gang of teenagers in Fairview Park in 1982 on the assumption that he was gay. Thankfully, Ireland has come a long way since then, but some people are still living in the past inside their heads. A short film has been produced and I urge anyone who can, to contribute to the project on greenlit.com. The story must be told so that we can all learn from the past and help build a better future for all.

We know the negative impact of hate speech and incitement to violence. We also know these are often targeted at vulnerable or minority groups. While I welcome the Bill, it would be wrong to think that it can eradicate the disgusting beliefs and attitudes that lead to hate speech. It is important that as we bring in much-needed criminal law for this serious matter, the Government must also commit to a programme of outreach and education on a national scale to tackle the root causes of hate offences. Without a commitment to raising awareness about the beliefs and attitudes that lead to hate crimes, the legislation only fights half the battle. We must treat the disease, not just the symptoms. There is a glaring need for a suite of measures to understand the complexity of hate speech if we are to undermine it. The ICCL has called for greater levels of monitoring, reporting and recording data of hate incidents to help make the legislation effective. While we sit and discuss how best to fight the scourge of hate speech and hate crimes, people around the country are being targeted by it. For that reason, Government must also commit to improving victim support throughout this process and after its conclusion. The last thing victims should feel is that they are suffering while we debate over several months. Hatred is defined in the legislation as "hatred against a person or a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their protected characteristics or any one of those characteristics". Here, hatred itself is left undefined, which is a cause of concern. Hatred is ever-evolving and newer, more covert methods of conveying hatred are emerging every day. We see this prolifically online, where certain communities founded on vile intent codify hostility and develop so-called dog whistles that are not easily identifiable as hatred. They are unscrupulous in their methods, wrapping contempt and venom up as seemingly legitimate positions. These actions are intentionally difficult to identify, meaning they can often slip through the laws that should protect individual and groups against the harm they cause. The vagueness in the legislation leaves too much debate about what qualifies as hatred and, therefore, needs further research and specification. The ICCL recommends aligning the definition of "hatred" with the Council of Europe Commission Against Racism and Intolerance's definition, which denotes "hatred" as "a state of mind characterised as intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation towards the target group". This definition would be more useful in terms of purpose, clarity and precision. Similarly, the protection of freedom of expression must be clarified. A lack of detail in the legislation leaves the section ripe for manipulation. Without clear frameworks and a precise definition of "hatred", there could be a chilling effect on the critical discourse nationally. There are organisations in Ireland with publically-stated positions that can objectively be deemed to be homophobic, for example. However, without greater clarity, this law could be used to suppress criticisms of those organisations. The law must distinguish between objective civil discourse and media freedom and actions with hateful and harmful purposes. In the case of an offence relating to the constraints of the Bill occurring, the legislation notes a defensive proof that the behaviour in question was "a reasonable and genuine contribution to literary, artistic, political, scientific, religious or academic discourse". There is a high risk of misinterpretation of this defence, making its misuse likely. Just because someone on Twitter or in a debate on the radio believes that their contributions are reasonable and genuine and relevant to the above discourses does not mean that they have not incited hatred. All people, no matter who they are, in all discussions, no matter which topic they fall under, must adhere to the same standards. Just because you might believe you are contributing a valuable addition to a debate does not mean you can be hateful. Whether you are in this Chamber, on television or on the radio and social media, whether a contribution is reasonable or genuine is a subjective consideration. Even those words themselves require further explanation. We cannot let vagueness shield those who intend to incite violence or hatred. For example, Scottish legislation provides greater detail by stating: "In determining whether behaviour or communication was reasonable, particular regard must be had to the importance of the right to freedom of expression by virtue of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, including the general principle that the right applies to the expression of information or ideas that offend, shock or disturb." If clarity is provided in a way similar to the Scottish legislation, the defence for particular discourses could stand and function effectively and ethically. I am glad that descent and sex characteristics have been added to the list of protected characteristics.In the future, it may be necessary to make the list longer. Keeping an open mind regarding the nature of hatred is vital when approaching legislation of this nature. Section 8 relates to the offences of the condonation, denial or gross trivialisation of genocide, etc., against persons on account of their protected characteristics, which is a welcome provision but nationality and gender have been omitted from the list of protected characteristics referenced in the section. The omission does not align with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and lacks foresight in respect of future offences. This should be rectified. In respect of the list of aggregated offences, it is incredibly important to realise that different communities suffer hate crimes in a myriad of different ways. Theft, fraud and blackmail have been excluded from the list even though some individuals and groups can be subjected to these offences as a result of prejudice. The Government must provide a clear rationale for the inclusion of these 12 particular offences and not others. The legislation should reduce incidences of hate crime but without an holistic approach, it will fail. The Government must pair this legislation with a nationwide awareness campaign to educate communities on its effects and on hatred generally. We are swimming against the tide. Incidences of hatred online that are hate crimes continue to grow exponentially. As social media platforms, new and old, embed themselves even further into our society, we must be ready to tackle hate speech comprehensively and firmly. I hope Members have educated themselves on the realities of partaking in digital life these days. The abuse that particular groups receive online is intense and nothing short of disgusting. If we do not wholeheartedly commit to making this legislation future-facing, its efficacy will not last.

It is something that many stakeholders who work with minorities have been talking about for years. It is important to note some of the criticisms and concerns around the impact of the Bill on people's rights to freedom of expression. My party has reservations too. It is important that we get this Bill right and do not rush the process. We have seen significant changes since the heads of Bill were published. It is far from perfect and needs a lot of clarity in places. This is about finding a balance between people's freedom to express their views and people's rights not to be subjected to hatred because they are from a minority community. We have recently seen the rise of hateful rhetoric towards people from minority ethnic backgrounds and those in the LGBT community. People have a right to live their lives without fear of being targeted as a result of who they are, where they come from or the faith they follow. Section 3 is in line with the Equal Status Act 2000, which is good to see. Section 7 creates the new offence of incitement to violence or hatred but we need more clarity from the Minister as to how intent and motives are going to be weighed up in a court of law. There were more than 4,000 submissions from stakeholders on the Bill and I believe many of their concerns remain. Sinn Féin supports a single statute in respect of hatred but we must allow time for detailed scrutiny of the legislation on Committee Stage. We want to support it but we will need to see many improvements before deciding whether we are in a position to vote for it.

This is landmark legislation that will strengthen our law when combatting hate crimes in Ireland. I commend the Minister and the Department on delivering on this key commitment in the programme for Government. Considerable work has gone into the Bill, which is a significant step forward. In a country that has been defined by economic and social progress in recent decades, it can be easy for our society to become complacent and think that things will only continue on that trend. However, that is not always the case and the forces of division and extremism are relentless in their efforts to pursue an alternative agenda. Other Deputies will probably agree that during the pandemic, a certain element of denialism crept into society. It has increased significantly since then. I am sure other Deputies have received emails in recent weeks from some of the same constituents who voiced concerns about lockdowns, masks and vaccines, among other things, and who have now turned their attentions to this particular Bill.  I welcome the fact that changes were recently made with regard to how the Garda records and identifies hate crime. The statistics for 2021, published recently, were the first published statistics for a full year since those changes were made. The figures show 400 hate crimes reported by the Garda, more than half of which were motivated by race and almost one quarter related to sexual orientation. The remainder of the cases involved a number of other motivations, including nationality, religion, gender, disability and so on. These changes to the recording method of such incidents will allow us to build up a better picture of the situation for many of the minority groups in Ireland. However, we must also note that many of these incidents go unreported, which is a challenge for us all. We must not only build faith and confidence in the system but we must also build trust between minority groups and the State authorities, such as the Garda. This is easier said than done as many minority groups, for a myriad of different reasons, have historically had a strained relationship with the State. The Government should undertake an educational campaign aimed at the public on how to identify discrimination, hate crimes and incitement to hate and, in doing so, give the vast majority of decent people the tools to identify and highlight to others when they cross a line. Importantly, the Bill will create new aggregated forms of certain existing criminal offences where those offences are motivated by hatred against a protected characteristic or where the perpetrator demonstrated hatred at the time of committing the offence. The protected characteristics for the purpose of the legislation are race, colour, nationality, religion, national or ethnic origin, descent, gender, sex characteristics, sexual orientation or disability. These are important steps that will allow the Garda and the legal system to prosecute perpetrators and send a clear message to minority groups that the State and the relevant authorities are on the side of their efforts. As the Minister said, the Bill, taken in conjunction with other legislation, most notably the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, shows that we are making progress in pushing back against those who wish to sow discord in our society. The online Bill will abolish the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and establish a new regulator, the media commission. It will also provide for the appointment of an online safety commissioner to oversee the new regulatory framework for online safety, something that many of us have been working towards for some time. Indeed, when I was chair of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, that was one of things we were trying to push the Government to deliver. I am delighted that work is ongoing. Social media companies will be governed by legally binding online safety codes under the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. Breaches of these codes will lead to serious financial sanctions. These online safety codes will deal with a wide range of issues, including measures to be taken by online services to tackle the availability of harmful online content, including hate material, on their services. There will be those who will criticise the Bill, as some have done. Some people have claimed it subverts an individual's right to freedom of speech. I, frankly, believe that to be a fig leaf in the context of this Bill, particularly with regard to the incitement of hate crimes. The Bill will not limit free speech or shut down public debate. However, individuals who deliberately or knowingly put other people in harm's way because of their statements and views will be committing a crime. Fundamentally, free speech does not entitle a person to cause harm to another. There has been growing anxiety among a number of minority groups in Ireland regarding hate crimes, and it has been increasing in recent years, in particular. Many people have experienced increased fear in their daily lives. This legislation, therefore, has not come a moment too soon. It reaffirms the Government's commitment to the delivery of equality at all levels of society, the stamping out of criminality and the protection of victims. I was only recently appointed to the Joint Committee on Justice and, unfortunately, did not get to participate in the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill. However, I have read the report of the committee and the observations of many NGOs, advocacy groups and Oireachtas Members.I look forward to the passage of the Bill and I thank the Minister for the work she put into it.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	344	I apologise for missing my slot. Things moved very quickly. I acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the member organisations of the Coalition Against Hate Crime Ireland - organisations and networks like Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Movement, the Irish Network Against Racism, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the Transgender Equality Network. They all have a proud track record in fighting against the many forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression. In December 2020, People Before Profit worked with many of those groups to launch the Le Chéile coalition. Its goal is to work together to counter the rise of the far right and the potential rise of fascism in this country and to prevent it from gaining the kind of foothold that we have seen in other European countries such as Italy, Sweden and France. People Before Profit is completely opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, Islamophobia, antisemitism and all the other forms of prejudice and oppression. We condemn hate speech, threats, harassment, intimidation and violence against anyone purely on the basis of the colour of their skin, their gender identity or sexual orientation. Unfortunately, this discrimination, oppression and prejudice has become more common in recent years and far too little is being done about it. The latest annual report from the Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, records 14 racist assaults in 2021, 39 cases of racist harassment and 13 threats to kill or cause serious harm. In one case, a mixed-race woman in a supermarket was asked by a stranger about her background and then sexually assaulted, which is horrendous. In another, a black African woman was verbally abused and threatened with a 30 cm knife held to her throat after she asked a stranger to respect social distancing in a bus station. The psychological impacts on victims can be devastating, making them too scared to go out at night or let their children go out to play. One parent quoted in the report said, "My youngest son is getting scared to go out my door and play in case of being called names." None of this should be happening in our society and action must be taken against it. We support the Coalition Against Hate Crime Ireland's call for a national action plan against hate. This must include much greater Government funding of education and outreach to combat hateful attitudes and to make protected groups aware of their rights, better data gathering on hate speech and hate crimes, and better victim support. The best way to combat hate crimes is to prevent them from happening in the first place. For us, as socialists, that means tackling the extreme inequality and oppression that are part and parcel of the for-profit capitalist system and written into its DNA. It is in the interests of capitalists and this right-wing Government to pit men and women, migrant and non-migrant, black and white, straight and LGBTQ+ against each other and have them blame each other for their problems rather than to have them unite as workers and demand better wages, better public services and a better life for all. Refugees and migrants are not to blame for the housing and homelessness crisis or for low wages and poor working conditions. The ones to blame are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and the landlords, bosses and vulture funds they represent. We need to target our anger not downwards but upwards against the rotten system of capitalism that oppresses and exploits us all, not the people most marginalised and oppressed by it. That is also how we will combat the far right. Turning to the detail of the legislation, I strongly support the original idea behind the Bill which is to protect groups that are discriminated against and oppressed in our society from hate speech and hate crimes. However, People Before Profit is very concerned about how this Bill has been drafted by the Government, in particular the lack of clear human-rights based definitions and the insertion of problematic new clauses relating to hate speech that are wide open to abuse by individual District Court judges and gardaí. It is mainly the sections on hate speech in Part 2 that we find problematic. We agree with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that hate speech should not have been bundled into the same Bill as hate crimes, as the Government has done. However, we also have some issues with the manner in which less serious crimes can be treated as hate crimes in Part 3. The definition of hatred in section 2, which applies throughout the Bill, is "hatred against a person or a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their protected characteristics or any one of those characteristics". That is a tautological definition. Its effect, as the ICCL has pointed out, is to effectively say that hatred is hatred. I do not understand why this definition was used rather than more precise language. There are many international examples of more precise language. For example, hatred could be defined far more clearly as "a state of mind characterised as intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation towards a person or group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their protected characteristics or any one of those characteristics and that involves bias, prejudice, contempt or hostility".  Regarding the protective characteristics in section 3, because of the shoddy way in which the Bill has been drafted by the Government, we have concerns that the inclusion of religion as a protected characteristic in exactly the same way as the other grounds could create a chilling effect on legitimate criticisms of the Catholic Church. This could even potentially discourage people from criticising the church's promotion of exactly the kind of sexism, homophobia and transphobia that the Bill seeks to address. It could also potentially be used to level bogus charges of antisemitism and antisemitic hate speech against pro-Palestinian activists. Section 11 on freedom of expression is also problematic. It protects "discussion or criticism of matters relating to a protected characteristic" but it fails to clearly defend the rights to express information or ideas that may be offensive, shocking or disturbing to some. Using again the example of the Catholic Church, it is clear that strongly worded criticism of paedophile priests and the church's institutional cover-up of clerical sexual abuse would be protected, especially if a case came before a religiously minded District Court judge. I do not think it is clear that that would be protected. On the other hand, we are concerned that the general defence provided for that the objectionable speech or behaviour "consisted solely of ... a reasonable and genuine contribution to literary, artistic, political, scientific, religious or academic discourse" could turn into a carte blanche or religiously motivated homophobia or transphobia. Again, this problem could be addressed with a proper definition of hatred and a better definition of freedom of expression. I now turn to the sections of the Bill that are totally unacceptable from our point of view and should be taken out in their entirety. Section 10 criminalises preparation or possession of hateful material "with a view to the material being communicated to the public or a section of the public" even where the material has not actually been published. That seems to amount to a form of thought crime. There is no actus reus here. There is no act of actually publishing. It is simply someone having this material in their private home. Section 10(3) states that where "it is reasonable to assume that the material was not intended for the personal use of the person", the onus will be placed on the accused to prove their own innocence by showing that the material they prepared or even just material they possessed was never intended to be publicly communicated. That makes section 10 a dangerous reversal of the fundamental principle of being innocent until proven guilty by reversing the onus in terms of proof as well as effectively legislating for a thought crime. That should be removed. Section 15 allows a District Court judge on the say-so of a garda of any rank to issue a search warrant for any premises, including people's homes, on suspicion that hate speech is being published or prepared for publication there. This grants the Garda wide-ranging powers to search electronic devices and linked electronic devices, to demand passwords for people's phones, etc. No safeguards appear to be in place to prevent this from potential abuse by politically motivated judges or gardaí. It applies equally to offences under section 10 as to actual published hate speech or genocide denial. Part 3 deals with hate crimes.We support the idea that serious crimes like assault, threats to kill or to cause serious harm, coercion, harassment and endangerment, should be treated as aggravated offences if hatred is a motivating factor. However, we are concerned about the manner in which the Government is seeking to apply the same rationale to more minor offences. I fear that the way the Bill is drafted would mean that some of the public order offences, which are covered under section 18, in particular threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place, could be used as a weapon to stigmatise legitimate protesters by politically motivated gardaí. The Government's decision to use a demonstration test as evidence of hatred, rather than the usual test of a criminal motive, heightens the risk of political abuse of this section. This means that rather than having to prove that hatred was a motive for abusive or insulting behaviour in order to gain a conviction for abusive or insulting behaviour aggravated by hatred, all a Garda would have to do is to say under oath that someone used a racial or sexist slur during or immediately after abusive or insulting behaviour. As was shown, for example, in the Jobstown trial, the media and the courts would be likely to take their word for it unless there happened to be, as there was in that case, video evidence to the contrary. The risk of political policing is further increased by the inclusion of wording that, "It is immaterial whether or not an accused person’s hatred is also on account (to any extent) of any other factor." That means that protesters with legitimate grievances could be stigmatised forever as hate criminals, simply on a garda’s say so. Legal experts in this area, Jennifer Schweppe and Amanda Haynes, point out in their submission on the Bill that the demonstration test is not used in hate crime legislation anywhere else in the world apart from the UK, Singapore and Malta. Ironically, it can actually lead to a disproportionate level of convictions of people from oppressed minorities for hate crimes. This happened with black people in the UK. They also show how being convicted of a hate crime creates a stigma and can prevent people from finding employment, which means that wrongful convictions for any form of hate crime have very serious and lifelong consequences. For all these reasons, People Before Profit-Solidarity will unfortunately be unable to support this Bill as it is currently drafted. It is a real pity that the worthy goal of protecting oppressed groups from hate crimes has been dealt with so badly by the Government, including by tangling it up with provisions that grant excessive powers to the gardaí without including effective safeguards. We will be tabling a range of amendments to the Bill on Report Stage, including for the complete deletion of section 10, the deletion of the demonstration test and for proper definitions of hatred and freedom of expression.

The importance of this issue cannot be overstated. However, it is an extremely complex area and my focus in relation to this issue and indeed the Bill is straightforward, namely, does it provide adequate protection to those who are or who may be subjected to hate crimes while at the same time protecting a fundamental right to free speech. The world is changing faster now than it has done in history. The Ireland that we see today is very different to the one that we were all born and raised in. With the more connected world that has emerged comes the responsibility not only to talk a good talk but to back it up by our actions. No longer can we remain a step removed from the injustices that others face, nor can we continue to ignore them. An onus is on us to do what we can to assist those who are denied a voice or who are denied rights that we take for granted. That is why I support a single statute on hate and why I feel that more needs to be done to tackle those who foster and spread hate, especially when the spreading of such hate leads to violence against others. The Irish people are renowned for our compassion but unfortunately the same could not have always been said about this State. Compassion is comprised of tolerance, understanding and empathy. I believe that rights and protections that we take for granted should apply to all and should exist in compatibility with freedom of speech, disclosure and expression. That is why it is important that a Bill such as this is worded carefully and reflects and addresses current challenges, attitudes and the progression of ever-developing societal make ups. Take, for example, the definition of a “protected characteristic”. We have to ask ourselves if a Bill such as this accurately encompasses and protects those who need protection. The intricate nature of each individual and community makes this a complex and sensitive task. While I want to give my support to this Bill, it is clear that it needs perfecting or strengthening. We will be tabling amendments to it and I hope they would be taken onboard. We cannot allow for vagueness, whether that is in clarity about the laws concerned or in the ability of constructive disclosure. We need more. We need to see an action plan to tackle and reduce instances of hate crimes that currently exist or are taking place. Our record towards the Traveller community needs improvement. They are often treated as the other. Their life expectancies are lower and instances of depression are higher. This is well known but it still needs addressing. Action needs to follow words and, for the Traveller community, that action is long overdue. We also need to ensure the equality of treatment for people with disabilities. The recent revelations about the assessment of needs process and the High Court findings are a case in point. We need laws and we need leadership to accompany those laws. Indeed, we have needed that leadership for some time, not a system that finds ways around obligations, such as was done with the standard operating procedure. I look forward to further debate on this. I re-iterate my support and that I will work with the Government, other Opposition parties and stakeholders to improve what is before us on Second Stage. A holistic approach to tackle the spreading of hate is needed.

A Republic is built on the idea that all citizens are equal. Aontú opposes all forms of discrimination and we oppose all incitements to violence. We believe that incitement to violence is wrong, that it is a criminal act and that it should be treated as such. Words do matter. Words matter a lot. Words can cast light, they can educate, they can build up and they can get to the truth. Words can hold people to account and words can inspire. Words are the framework of thought. Our thought processes are built on words. Words are the vehicles of ideas and these ideas can make change for good and can change for bad. A liberal democracy is built upon allowing ideas to compete with each other so that we as a society can test, challenge and measure the value of those ideas. It is only through the free and respectful articulation of these ideas that we can allow them to compete. It is through that competition that we can empirically choose the best solutions for our society with regard to the problems that we face. In a citizen's Republic, each individual has and should have an equal right to that articulation of views and the equal articulation of speech. In a civil society we need to do that respectfully. That is important. One of the biggest jobs we have to do in this country is to raise our children with the idea that, yes, we question, we challenge and we test, but we do so in a manner that does not cause hurt to others. It amazes me at times though, especially when looking at social media, that we often see that the people who dress themselves up in the colour of love and inclusivity are often the people who are involved in shutting down debate and in stopping those ideas from being discussed. I have seen debates happen on social media, as I am sure the Minister has as well, especially with JK Rowling for example, where many people who dress themselves up in the idea of inclusivity have been involved in threatening to beat, rape, assassinate and bomb the likes of JK Rowling for having certain views. These are views that they do not believe she should have. These are views that they think is hate speech because she holds them. The fears held by people in terms of this Bill that the Minister is proposing are not theoretical fears. These are real fears. The cancel culture and the censorship culture that exists at the moment is on steroids in many ways. People fear that is encroaching into the realm of honest, respectful debate on real issues that affect people. The history of censorship does not end well in anyway whatsoever. Censorship is an authoritarian act. It deletes the liberty of citizens, and it deletes the competition of ideas that we discussed earlier. It reduces people's ability to challenge and test the prevailing ideologies within a society. Not only does it erase the rights of citizens in terms of the articulation of their views, but it radically prevents people from stopping the significant swings that can happen in a society in relation to whichever ideological wind is blowing at a certain time. It used to be the case that censorship was a tool of the political right.The left fought censorship and demanded that we support the individual's right to articulate views. In many parts of the world now, though, that is not the case. Many people from that political viewpoint have become distracted by the culture wars and identity politics and have forgotten about the bread and butter issues that are affecting the people they are meant to serve. Many even admit that these tools can be used to help them engineer the society they want to achieve. I remember speaking to former colleagues of mine in Sinn Féin in years gone by. I was one of the many who opposed section 31 because it censored people's views about what happened. As such, I am amazed to hear Sinn Féin say that its members will support a Bill that will encroach on people's ability to speak freely and respectfully about issues of real importance. It also amazes me that we have come from a society where, in the 1950s especially, we were probably one of the most censored societies in the whole of Europe. The negative consequences of that were significant and are clear to us today. Seventy years later, though, the mirror-image instincts are in many ways manifesting themselves in some of these debates. I wish to mention the importance of pluralism in a liberal democracy. We know that tolerance of plural outlooks in society is necessary for cohesion and the competition of ideas. Pluralism means that we must allow for mutually opposing ideologies to exist simultaneously. To quote a sentence attributed to Voltaire, "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it." Does the Minister not agree that this is a foundation stone of a pluralist society? Her version of the quote is: "I may not agree with what you have to say, and I may put you in jail for actually saying that." That is the opposite of what pluralism means. Words can defame, inflame, divide and destroy, they can rob a person or an organisation of a good name, and words can and do lead to violence and death. In our modern society with its social media, those words can be amplified like never before. Damage can go viral in minutes. There has to be a balance of rights, though. We need to be able to have a society where we have the freedom to articulate, challenge and hold to account. We also need to protect the reputations of people. Opponents of this Bill are not absolutists in terms of freedom of speech. Most ordinary people would support the prohibition of incitement to violence and violence on the basis of hatred. However, what this law does goes much further than that. It damages the balance. One of the Bill's major problems, which has already been mentioned, is the lack of clarity in its definitions. The Minister needs to proof those definitions against whatever judge might be sitting in whatever court at some time in the future. We know that views and ideas on many of the issues being discussed today are fluid. In five years' time, for example, many people will have different views and ideas. The ICCL has stated that the definitions relating to incitement to hatred and the protection of freedom of expression are not clear enough. The ICCL has also stated that the creation of an offence of preparing or possessing materials with your views in your home with a view to making them public goes too far and is an infringement on privacy. The ICCL has stated that possessing material in your home without the clear intention of ever making it public should not be an offence. It is an incredible idea that gardaí could be going into people's homes to search them on that basis. I agree with a previous speaker that this enters into the realm of thought policing. The Minister tells us that hatred is a key reason for the Bill, yet the word "hatred" is not defined anywhere in it. I absolutely oppose hatred. Calling for violence against people is hatred and should be illegal. However, others would define "hatred" as saying that a woman is a female adult. This is not a theoretical issue. In Britain, police have arrived at the homes of citizens under hate speech law because they tweeted the sentence, "A woman is a female adult". The definition of "gender" in the Bill is not a definition at all. According to the Bill, the definition of "gender" is what the individual decides it to be. Some people say that there are 72 genders. Others say that putting a limit on the number of genders is itself wrong. These can have serious consequences for people's lives. In many ways, a large number of our debates are occurring in a political and media bubble. Most people in Irish society would adhere to the scientific understanding of gender. Most people would believe that a woman is a female adult, and most people would believe that that sentence is not transphobic. A group of women spoke on Joe Duffy's "Liveline" show a number of weeks ago. They articulated their fear about potentially allowing men - not people who had real issues in terms of gender identity - to use the opportunity of identifying as women for their own reasons, etc. They were fearful that women's safe spaces would not continue into the future. They articulated that view respectfully and calmly on the show. It was a wonderful opportunity. "Liveline" is one of those few opportunities where real people get a chance to discuss the issues that are important to them. Most of the radio and television shows that we listen to have on them people from the bubble in which we in politics and the media live. After that calm and respectful articulation of their fears, however, there was a significant backlash against their views. Many people said that the views were transphobic and hate speech. Incredibly, Dublin Pride left its partnership with RTÉ on the basis of the show. Does the Minister believe that women saying that a woman is an adult female is transphobic and hate speech? Is it possible that a judge might in future have those views and implement the Minister's legislation on the back of those? These are important questions for us to debate. There has recently been a significant shift in the political bubble concerning these ideas. The Government has taken on a policy of gender affirmation. I spoke to a teacher recently who told me that he had attended an in-service day where a person from his department told him not to use the words "mother" and "father" in class any more because they were not inclusive. The website of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, provides resources for teachers to deal with these issues in school. One of its pieces of advice states that teachers should not call the class to attention by using the phrase "boys and girls" because it was not inclusive. Recently, the Government deleted the word "woman" from legislation. Obviously, it was put back in because there was an outcry across the country at the bubble - the bubble did not understand how angry people were - and the Government responded to that. The HSE developed leaflets about cervical cancer that spoke of women as people with cervixes. Many women do not want their identity to be deleted in that respect. This ideology is at the heart of Government policy at the moment, but many people are fearful that this Bill will be used to delete people's opportunity to speak respectfully and openly against that ideology. I have mentioned the political class's focus being distracted by the culture wars and identity politics instead of being on bread and butter issues. I have been looking at the Bills that have come out of the Minister's Department recently. Many of them focus on the former instead of the real bread and butter issues that people are dealing with at home. I recently submitted a large number of parliamentary questions to the Minister. The reply to one stated that 2,100 gardaí had been physically assaulted in the past ten years, 400 had resigned in the past five years, only 24 people had started Garda training college so far this year, the Garda Reserve was nearly at an all-time low, Ireland had one of the lowest numbers of police in Europe, and the Minister's constituency had the lowest number of gardaí in the country.There are districts in the Minister's constituency that had zero detection rates for the first six months of this year for certain types of crime. Many people believe that the job of the Minister for Justice is to actually focus on the safety and protection of citizens, which is the real bread and butter stuff. That does not seem to be happening. People would feel safer at night if there was more focus on these issues by the Minister's Department, as well as on the other issues. I urge the Minister to rethink this Bill. I too want a society where citizens can engage respectfully, with empathy and with generosity with views and ideas that they profoundly disagree with. I believe this can be achieved culturally within society by trying to raise our children with respect, and in many other ways, but I believe that this Bill takes away human rights of citizens. It reduces the liberty and the freedom of citizens to express themselves democratically. So-called definitions under the Bill are so ill-defined that they are wide open to misinterpretation and abuse. Like many others, I feel this would inhibit the ability for honest democratic discourse. As a result, it would weaken society's ability to grapple with the real and significant challenges that we face. This Bill is a threat to the democratic function of our society in the long term. The Bill is out of step, in many ways, with the views of people. It is also out of step with the most recent scientific and medical practice in relation to some of the aspects the Minister seeks to protect in the Bill. I urge the Minister to withdraw the Bill. With the few seconds I have remaining, I wish to raise a matter on which the Minister might have some influence. Tomorrow there is a planned rolling protest about the closure of childcare facilities, including early childhood care and education facilities. The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has introduced a core funding plan which will make it impossible for thousands of small childcare facilities to survive. Hundreds of these businesses have closed already, and hundreds more will close in the coming months, unless the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, provides a fair amount of funding. Those owners will be protesting at five locations in Cork, Mayo, Ennis, Tuam and Dublin tomorrow. They will close their facilities. Tens of thousands of parents will be discommoded because they will not have any place to send their children tomorrow. This will be the first of a number of rolling closures. I will ask the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to meet these business owners as soon as possible, with a real plan to make sure their businesses can function.

It is a sad reality of modern Ireland that hate crime is a real and lasting problem. Ireland has become one of the most diverse and inclusive societies in recent decades. Irish people of different races and religions, Irish Travellers, LGBTQ people and persons with disabilities have all become much more visible and engaged in our communities throughout Ireland. This diversity is now a core strength and one we must all work together to encourage and expand. There is no place where this is better reflected nowadays than in rural Ireland, especially in my area in County Longford where per capita we have one of the largest numbers of new Irish communities, all of whom are thriving and making a vast difference to a modern, inclusive and progressive county. We would like to think in Longford that we are a richer and much more vibrant society as a result of all these new people and new cultures that have come to join us. Sadly, not everybody has welcomed these changes. In fact, some people see this very strength as a threat and are willing to engage in verbal or physical violence in order to continue the perpetration of exclusion. It is simply unacceptable in modern Ireland that anybody should be the victim of a crime simply because of their skin colour, country of origin, asylum status, religion, disability or sexual identity. The current legislation on hate crime is no longer fit for purpose and needs to be modernised. The Bill is an important step in fulfilling two commitments made in the programme for Government: to introduce hate crime legislation and to update the prohibitions in the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989. The Government is committed to ensuring the Bill is signed into law before the end of the year. As a Government Deputy, I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Bill. I commend the Minister on her work in bringing this to the floor of the House, and on doing so in such a timely fashion. I want to share my remaining time with my learned colleague.

As I have said, we are a much better society for the changes we have seen. We have seen a radical change in Ireland over the past 20 to 30 years. This is very evident in our schools, communities and sports clubs. In County Longford and in Longford town, we have companies with diverse workforces. There can be anything up to 17 nationalities working on the factory floor. All of these people live in the town, contribute to the town and make it a much more vibrant place to be. They are fiercely proud of their nationality. They are extremely proud that they have found a home, employment and a future for themselves and their families here in Ireland. As Irish people, we are aware that we travelled all over the world. We were welcomed in the UK, we were welcomed in Australia and we were welcomed in America. It behoves us to extend the hand of friendship that met countless generations of our people from the time of the Irish Famine when we went in our coffin ships with little other than destitution to accompany us. We found homes and we found opportunity on far-flung shores. As a society, it behoves us always to be a warm and embracing country for anybody who wishes to come and join us. Unfortunately, the advent of social media has made hate crime and verbal abuse much easier to perpetrate. It is often done under the obvious cover of darkness but behind a keyboard, and all too often with anonymous accounts. It is a piece of work in itself to try to come to terms with that, and I am aware the Minister is working on it. We have seen a shift in society in this country where people believe it is much more acceptable to harangue and abuse people and encourage others to do so. It is the ugly dimension that is emerging in our society and one that all political parties need to stand up to, whether they are on the left or on the right. We may differ on many things but one thing we should never disagree on is the fundamental right of everybody to have a fair, equal and decent life in this country of ours. It is particularly evident in the progress we have been making in our schools. We see the diversity right across all of our schools. Even in our most rural schools we are seeing this diversity now. Children are growing up not knowing any differentiation in people. They are ready and willing to embrace alternative cultures and alternative lifestyles. The great educators in many respects have been the young people. They have brought this message home to their family homes the length and breadth of the country. They have played a huge part in this process, and have probably played just as much a role as this legislation is now playing. It is important that this is seen for what it is. It is landmark legislation but it is also setting an example for the rest of Europe. This is very important. In the short lifetime of this Government so far, on several occasions we have been prepared and willing to grapple with the big issues of the day. We have been willing to prepare landmark legislation and bring it to the floor of this House. This is very much an example of such legislation. When the Minister was appointed to her role, she said that this was one of the key planks of legislation she wanted to bring to fruition in the lifetime of the Government. I am happy that the Minister will meet her timeline and that we will have the legislation on the Statute Book before the end of this year. That in itself is a momentous achievement and will hopefully be one of many defining footnotes in the Minister's long political history.

I know that my constituents have received abuse and physical assault because of hatred.This is not a new phenomenon. Hatred has been in our communities for much longer than we are comfortable acknowledging. There is now, thankfully, a broad consensus that hatred needs to be reflected in law, that incitement to violence and hatred needs to be held to account in a court of law and that those who perpetrate it need to be held to account. That is a concept I support. However, key to any such law is that it be effective and enforceable. In that regard, this Bill is weak. Substantial work remains to be done and serious issues need to be addressed. The terminology contained in this Bill appears sloppy or not well thought-out. For example, the line "'Hatred' means hatred [...]" reads like an advertising tag line as opposed to a clear, unarguable definition. It is far from the clear definition we and those of the protected characteristics need. It is substandard, even below the standard of what is classed as hatred on An Garda Síochána's website. Because of that lack of clarity, the Bill will be ineffective. It will be unenforceable and will place an unrealistic expectation on the Garda and the Courts Service. I draw the House's attention to an excellent article in The Irish Times by Dr. Amanda Haynes and Dr. Jennifer Schweppe, associate professor of law. They are co-directors of the European Centre for the Study of Hate, based in the University of Limerick. Deputies should read that article. It is fantastic and sets out why we need this Bill, as well as setting out clearly why this Bill needs to be saved. Hate threatens the societal fabric we hold dear. The level of physical and emotional harm it causes to individuals needs to be held to account, but we also need to recognise the wider impact it has on all of our communities. To do that, we need to get the balance right. That is not easy but that does not mean that we do not try or that it is not possible to get it right. I thank and acknowledge those in our community who stand up against hatred and with those who experience hatred, particularly our younger people. We have all been there when it is easier to say nothing than to call something out. I commend and congratulate them and hope they continue to do that because hatred has no place in our society.

It is an important piece of legislation. The Minister and Department have spent considerable time in preparing it; similarly, this House should give it detailed consideration. Much legislation goes through this House that most of us are confident will not be subjected to much judicial scrutiny. However, anyone who has spoken on this Bill will know the strong likelihood that in the not too distant future judges in the superior courts, probably the Supreme Court, will be considering it. Legislation such as this is always difficult and it is important that we scrutinise it properly when there are conflicting constitutional rights. Here we have heard much about freedom of expression and the right to equality, which I will talk about in due course. They are on one side of the scale; on the other side - and the political motivation behind the legislation - is the constitutional protection afforded to the person under Article 40.3.2. The State is trying to follow the constitutional command to protect the person by recognising that groups in our society are targeted because of certain characteristics. It is a constitutional requirement, as well as an obligation under the European decision, for us to bring forward legislation to this effect. Where there are conflicting constitutional rights, a balancing act needs to be performed. It is our job to try to get the balance right. When we come into this House, we look at legislation from the point of view of our political objectives and what we want to achieve politically. That necessarily involves us promoting one constitutional right at a particular time. We need to recognise that when it comes before the courts, they will understand the desire of the Oireachtas to protect the constitutional right of the person under Article 40.3.2, but will ask where the conflicting constitutional rights are protected, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to equality. I am pleased to say I think this House, if it enacts this legislation, will pass that test as we do take into account the conflicting constitutional rights.  We need to be realistic about what this legislation can achieve. Its primary objectives are, first, to repeal the 1989 Act, second, to provide updated and more modern legislation for the offence of incitement to hatred and violence and, third, to transpose into Irish law the Council decision 2008/913/JHA concerning hate crime. We need to recognise that simply enacting this legislation will not mean the problem of hatred and incitement to violence in our society will be resolved. It will not. Laws can be drafted every day of the week but they may not be able to resolve society's problems. It is important that the laws reflect what we as a society and as a House of the Oireachtas believe should be the law of the country. We also need to recognise that it is a function for society and people in society to ensure our behaviour changes. I do not suggest it should be the objective of society for people to try desperately to get rid of hate. Hatred is an emotion and will exist no matter where we are and in what society we are. This legislation is not trying to change people's personal opinions or the personal hatreds many people may have, though it is a wasted emotion. The legislation is designed to deal with public utterances which are designed to incite hatred or violence against certain groups. The legislation sets out ten protected characteristics. It is important to point out those characteristics are of universal effect, or certainly nine of them are. Race, gender, sexual orientation and colour are things that apply to us all. It is important to recognise this legislation is not for the protection of one or two groups but that of society as a whole.  The principal provision is contained in section 7, which sets out the new offence of incitement to hatred or violence. I commend the Minister on the recognition in that section that it shall be a defence against any such prosecution for a person to show the behaviour:consisted solely of— (a) a reasonable and genuine contribution to literary, artistic, political, scientific, religious or academic discourse.I do not think the concerns Deputy Tóibín has will arise as a result of this legislation. People are perfectly entitled in Irish society to call for the repeal of the Gender Recognition Act 2015 or any other legislation. That does not make that a hate crime. Section 11 expressly refers to protection of freedom of expression. The draft Bill takes into account the conflicting right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the constitutional command on the other to protect the persons of individuals. An area worth examining again concerns Part 3, which sets out that there shall be a new offence. I will take the example of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, which deals with assault or assault causing harm. In respect of each of those offences in that legislation, there will be a new offence of aggravated assault as a result of an act of hate. I mentioned the principle of equality under the Constitution because I suspect that when this comes before any court, it may come in on the basis of the principle of equality, where a person convicted of an aggravated crime, including aggravation through hate, will compare themselves to another person convicted of the same crime that was not aggravated through hate, but the appropriate comparison of the two will result in scrutiny. That is something of which the Minister needs to be conscious.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	359	I am sorry for distracting you earlier, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I was just inquiring about speaking times. The Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022 proposes to legislate for hate crimes by creating new, aggravated forms of certain existing criminal offences where such offences are motivated by prejudice against a protected characteristic. The Bill also proposes to amend the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, including by making provision in respect of online hateful content. While I appreciate we must deal with issues of online content, I do not know if this Bill is the right way to go about it. The Bill, as expected, includes provisions on the burden of proof by adding a "demonstration test" in addition to the "motivation test" as set out in the general scheme of the Bill. The demonstration test would require only that the person committing the offence demonstrates hatred at the time the offence was committed, while the motivation test requires proof of a person's subjective motivation for committing a hate crime. The Bill also seeks to create clearer and simpler offences, in the Department's words, of incitement to hatred than those contained in the existing legislation, setting the threshold for criminal incitement to hatred as intent or recklessness, while also providing for safeguards for freedom of expression, which is what I am concerned about. The ten protected characteristics listed in the Bill are race, colour, nationality, religion, national or ethnic origin, descent, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, gender, including gender expression and identity, and disability. Subsection 3(2)(d) of the Bill reads:"gender" means the gender of a person or the gender which a person expresses as the person's preferred gender or with which the person identifies and includes transgender and a gender other than those of male and female.Confusing? I think so. Clear? Certainly not. If this subsection is meant to give a definition of "gender", it falls far short. There is no coherent attempt to define a term X as possibly including X in the proposed definition. If, however, this subsection is not meant to define gender, that leaves us with another problem since gender appears to be defined nowhere else in the Bill. There are worrying and unclear sections of the Bill. For example, section 3(2)(d) appears to pick out three items to give a determination to gender. They include, uimhir a haon, a person's gender; uimhir a dó, a person's expressed or preferred gender; agus, uimhir a trí, a person's identified gender. In all three cases, we appear to be told gender can include transgender or a gender other than male or female. Nonetheless, the Bill does not provide a definitive explanation as to what gender is, what transgender is, or what a gender other than male or female might be or how many such genders there might be. I heard a colleague of the Minister's who used to represent her constituency recently express the view that there might be up to nine genders. The Bill does not provide a definitive explanation as to how many of the three listed gender items differ from or relate to one another. For example, could a person have three gender types simultaneously? That is a legitimate question. The Minister should provide clarity before the Bill proceeds. Clarity is needed on many aspects of this but it is definitely needed here because it is not clear in any way. An offence under section 10 shall be committed where a person: (b) prepares or possesses such material with intent to incite violence or hatred against such a person or group of persons on account of those characteristics or any of those characteristics or being reckless as to whether such violence or hatred is thereby incited.Subsection 10(4) goes on to state:A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable—(a) on summary conviction, to a class C fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or both.I am very concerned about that because there are so many areas in the Minister's Department, one or two of which I raised yesterday. We had so much pressure for years with the lack of gardaí and everything else that we brought in an electronic tagging system for prisoners on release. In reply to a parliamentary question from me, the Minister told me that the practice had been discontinued due to the high cost associated with it. The response further revealed that only 151 persons had been electronically tagged during a certain period - it may have been from 2007 to 2017 or 2018, when the practice stopped. Deputy McEntee has been the Minister for Justice for some time, and I wish her well. That is only one area. She went on to refer to the Garda budget. She did not answer the question at all yesterday. I say this just by way of illustration, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in case you think I am straying.

I am just saying that other legislation was quietly parked without a word about it. That is only one area. We had significant public consultation and a huge effort by this Oireachtas to try to get that done. We are all happy when legislation is done and dusted. Maybe that is why we should have a review of all legislation. If it is not working because of the expense involved, what are we doing here making these laws? Do we have any idea about a cost-benefit analysis of this legislation, the cost to the State and, above all, who will police it? The Minister heard Deputy Tóibín tell her that in some areas of her constituency this year there has been no detection of crime at all. Either it is a very safe place or there are no gardaí to do the job. The latter, I presume, is the case. Gardaí are in a bad situation, and it is awfully worrying to see only 20 duine in the college in Templemore. We had promises, and this is very relevant to the Bill in the context of enforcement. It is very worrying that we are not recruiting people. We used to have thousands. A taxi man picked me up here one night the week before last. He told me he tried six times in the 2000s to get into An Garda Síochána, and now we cannot fill the places. There is something radically wrong. We are not supporting our gardaí in the way we should. We are not remunerating them and it is not an attractive job any more. We know things have gone horrible, dangerous, nasty and pernicious in many ways. I support the Garda 100% and always have done, but we keep piling on this legislation and there is nobody there to implement it. It looks great but it is a total distraction from reality. I have huge concerns about the Bill and I will not support it. Some in my group will not either. We have not made a group decision on it. We are Independents, as the House will know, but I certainly will not support the Bill. As I said, there are many areas of it that are unclear. I listened intently to an Teachta Jim O'Callaghan because he is a legal brain and man of the law who understands legalities and technicalities a lot better than I do. With regard to the reference to a fine or term of imprisonment not exceeding two years, or both, the jails are full. Gardaí tell me that when they bring prisoners to the various prisons from the court in Clonmel, County Tipperary, they are sent home again the same evening. What are we doing? We need major reforms in the justice system. That gardaí must bring home prisoners who are charged and convicted is a farce. This is going on under the watch of the Minister.  Added to this, we have legislation introduced here that is half-baked, half-cooked and totally lacking in clarity. It is lovely and panders to certain parts of society but many in society have grown tired of all the legislation of this kind. Number one, it does not put bread and butter on the table, nor does it help anyone to get a job or pay the ESB bill.  The legislation could lead to someone facng a jail sentence of up to two years for having in his or her possession a book or magazine that contains material that is subjectively deemed by the State to incite hatred against another person. That is very loose and broad. It is subjective for any member of the Garda or member of the public to make a complaint. It is a dangerous place to go. I certainly do not believe the people want that. I do not want it, and many of the people I represent do not want it. We recently had a furore over a sermon given by a priest in Kerry who was quoting the Scriptures. Would he fall under this legislation? Would he be hauled off before the courts? This is a legitimate question. I am not saying anything about the rights and wrongs; he was quoting from the Scriptures, which have been around a lot longer than any of us. Do Members of Dáil Eireann want to support such a far-reaching provision, which is anything but clear? Could it lead to someone carrying a book by a leading academic such as Jordan Peterson facing a period in prison? I believe it could. Simply by virtue of the contents of a book you are carrying, you could fall under the subjective provisions of this legislation, which the Minister is pushing through today. I have never made an apology for campaigning on pro-life issues or to keep the eighth amendment. We are all in danger. We have noted the furore and hassle regarding people protesting. People protest in good faith. We must have the right to protest, obviously with respect for everybody. We can never take that away from the people. My advice to the Minister is to make haste slowly. What publications and materials will be on the banned list? Who will decide? Will we be back to cases such as that of Salman Rushdie? Will we have the valley of the squinting windows? Will we drive underground people who rightly have opinions and values they want to espouse and in accordance with which they want to bring up their families? The Department of Education is already totally overreaching into the education system, with the resistance to homeschooling and Tusla's involvement in bringing parents and guardians before the courts. People want to do what is right for their children, as we all do, but we cannot police families in their homes. I see this happening. In this regard, we have heard from Deputy Tóibín, in particular. I have heard about the matter from teachers, múinteoirí scoile, and they have said they are shocked at the contents of books. On page 11 of a maths book for national schoolchildren, there is material about sexuality. Something has gone really wrong. The pushing has gone way too far. There are many areas of legislation to be dealt with in the Minister's Department and manpower is required to follow up on them and review their impact. The preferred option here is simply to get the Bill through. Let me refer to the definition of "hatred" in the Bill. The Bill states "hatred" means hatred against a person or group or persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their protected characteristics or any one of those characteristics. Again, is this meant as a definition? It fails miserably if so. It does not meet any bar. If the definition of "hatred" is not the only one, could the Minister please inform the Dáil where there is a clearer one? My researcher and I cannot find it. There are large areas of the Bill that are not clear. Words and intentions are included in the hope they will work away and give carte blanche to certain people to decide certain things. Section 10 deals with creating new offences for preparing or possessing material likely to incite violence or hatred against persons. Whose thinking is this? It is totally subjective. Where is this going to stop? There are no clear definitions. An offence under the section shall be committed where a person prepares or possesses material that is likely to incite violence or hatred against a person or a group of persons on account of their protected characteristics or any of those characteristics with a view to the material being communicated to the public or a section of the public, whether by himself or herself or another person. Therefore, many elements of this Bill are totally unclear. Every person in this State deserves the protection of the law. All our newcomers and guests who come here, for whom we try to do the best we can, should be protected. I refer to the ones who come legally, not those who, according to a response to a parliamentary question I got from the Minister recently, come in with no paperwork from many countries. We have to have a way to deal differently with those who arrive in Dublin by plane with no paperwork. Our people, above all, deserve protection in their homes and businesses and on the streets. The Government is failing miserably to provide this. The Minister has quoted numbers to me. She met the deputation in Clonmel and they laid the matter out bare for her. They also told her about their fears that someone will be seriously harmed, or worse. That is a desperate situation in 2022.  The Government has been in power for so long and is meant to protect the people, but it is not doing so. Neither is the Garda Commissioner. I have raised this issue with him. I salute the members of the Garda but wish to state explicitly how perilous the situation is. We do not want to give information to people who might use it for something else. The Minister knows how bad the situation is, and she is camouflaging it. This is a total camouflage. Deputy McEntee is creating a total diversion instead of doing the duties she, as a public representative for her constituency and, more important, a Minister appointed by the Taoiseach to a very important Department and acclaimed by this House, is supposed to be doing to protect the people, and by churning out legislation like this.I am opposed to it, and I will vote against it. We must return to dealing with legislation to look after people, that has served us well and not have people cowering and frightened in their home. Earlier, my colleague, Deputy Cahill, told us about a woman in a house outside Thurles, who was sleeping in the barn because she had been so violently assaulted and robbed and she was afraid they would come back again. Do we want that in a modern society? Meanwhile, we churn out all this legislation here that looks good and sounds good, but it is not even properly framed, nor does not contain proper definitions. I am fundamentally opposed to it.

My party introduced hate crime legislation in the Seanad. It is long past time for proper legislation in this area. Hate crime is real and has real impact. In 2021, An Garda Síochána recorded 448 hate crimes and hate-related non-crime incidents. I pay tribute to An Garda Síochána on its work. I am always asking the Minister about Garda recruitment. I know how important a role the Garda plays. It is important that we have as many gardaí as possible. I compliment the gardaí. I listened to a few radio programmes during the week and the term "wishy-washy" kept coming up in the context of the legislation. That troubles me a bit, in the sense that the ICCL has also asked the Minister to take on board its recommendation that the definition of "hatred" should be better defined. I urge her to take this on board. These are issues that we must examine. The ICCL has also suggested that the defence of "freedom of expression" should be clearer and more detailed. Irish people of different race or religion, Irish Travellers, the LGBTQI+ community and persons with disabilities have all become more visible and engaged - rightly so. To ensure everyone is treated equally, we must show zero tolerance for any kind of hate speech or hate crime. It is unacceptable today, here or anywhere, that anyone should be the victim of a crime because of their race, colour, nationality, religion, sexual orientation or disability - visible or invisible. What we have right now in terms of legislation must be changed and this is one way we are tackling that. Having said that, I welcome the Bill. I want us to ensure there is sufficient time for meaningful democratic debate on the Bill. There is evidence of many revisions in the drafting of the Bill. We must make sure, going forward, that we have good legislation that works on the ground and will be enacted. The inclusion of a demonstration test can show that a perpetrator demonstrated hate towards a member of a protected group at the time of an offence being committed. This might involve, for example, the use of slurs, gestures, other symbols or graffiti at the time of offending. This is a welcome change to better support prosecution in this area. I strongly recommend that we include a requirement for review of the legislation and robust monitoring of its implementation. I have listened to previous speakers. I know the work the Minister has put into the Bill. This legislation must be enacted as soon as possible. It is important for us all that this happens. I stress that we must get better at communicating. Communication is such an important issue. I know the Minister is aware of that. We need an action plan to educate and dispel false information. We must tackle hate crime and hateful beliefs and attitudes that may ultimately give rise to further hate and crimes. I am fully supportive of the Bill. There are some issues that need to be addressed, and I will speak to the Minister in person about them. I thank her again.

The area of the Bill that I would like to focus on is the offence of condoning, denying or grossly trivialising genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes against peace. I am just back from a week in Palestine where I saw the apartheid system at first-hand. I travelled with the Shamrock & Olive Tree boxing project and we were subjected to threats and intimidation by Israeli soldiers. One young man from Belfast, who is aged 22, was singled out by an Israeli soldier just because he had the audacity to smile. Since when has smiling become a crime. Our bus driver, a young Palestinian man called Allah, was treated even worse, simply because he was Palestinian. Being denied the right to go from A to B in your own country by a foreign occupying force is an attack on liberty. It is a crime against humanity. Allah lived less than 50 miles from the Dead Sea, but he has never seen it. Israeli soldiers refused us entry at two checkpoints just because our driver was Palestinian. We finally got through at the third checkpoint and Allah, who lived less than 50 miles from the Dead Sea, got to see it for the first time. He was understandably emotional, but he was also angry that he has been denied this opportunity all his life. The Government's refusal to recognise the state of Palestine could be seen as denying crimes against humanity and crimes against peace. On Tuesday, the Irish Embassy in Israel welcomed the announcement of a direct flight between Tel Aviv and Dublin. How can this be welcome while 2 million Palestinians are held in an open-air prison in Gaza by the Israeli apartheid system and are denied the right of freedom of movement? It would have been much better if the Irish Embassy was in a position to welcome a direct flight to Ramallah, Nablus or Gaza, but that is impossible as Palestinian people are denied the right by Israel to have their own airport. Instead of celebrating direct flights to Tel Aviv, why not call out the obvious blatant apartheid and human rights abuses in Palestine? Israel's apartheid against Palestinians is a cruel system of domination and crimes against humanity. Massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system that amounts to apartheid under international law. The Government must recognise the state of Palestine. Failure to do so is denying crimes against humanity and crimes against peace.

I had an opportunity to look through the Bill. Like many previous speakers, it seems to me that many aspects of the Bill are quite confused and confusing and perhaps ill-thought out. The Long Title demonstrates to some extent the purpose of the Bill.[A]n Act to amend the law relating to the prohibition of incitement to violence or hatred against a person or a group of persons on account of certain characteristics…and to provide for an offence of condoning, denying or grossly trivialising genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes against peace and, in doing so, to give effect to Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA.There are several significant differences between the framework directive and the Bill as drafted, certainly with the offences concerning racism and xenophobia. That is the exclusive focus of the framework directive, which it is proposed to implement. It refers to "publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin". Whereas, when we turn to the Bill, it goes a lot further. It includes race, colour, religion, national or ethnic origin and, like the framework directive, also includes descent, to cover people who are descended from persons who are identifiable on that basis, but where that may no longer be present.The Bill goes on to include gender, sex characteristics, sexual orientation and disability. I have a question on the protected characteristics. I do not fully understand what "sex characteristics" refer to. "Gender" is clearly defined and means “the gender of a person or the gender which a person expresses as the person’s preferred gender or with which the person identifies and includes transgender and a gender other than those of male and female”. "Sexual orientation" and "disability" are defined by reference to the Equal Status Act, but the Bill states that “references to sex characteristics shall be construed as references to the physical and biological features of a person relating to sex”. I am slightly confused about what that is intended to cover, particularly in the context of the Bill. The Bill goes far beyond the purpose of the stated intention of the framework directive in dealing with gender and sexual orientation. What I am most concerned about is the idea of motivation. The framework directive states, “Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that racist and xenophobic motivation is considered an aggravating circumstance, or, alternatively that such motivation may be taken into consideration by the courts in the determination of the penalties.” That brings us to the crux of the Bill and the definition of "aggravating circumstances". There is an article on this by University of Limerick academics in The Irish Times today, which I do not need to go into because many previous contributors referred to it. It is not just motivation that is an aggravating factor but also what that is accompanied by, and that is problematic to an extent. I understand the reason the Minister has chosen to go down this road, because of the difficulty of proving motivation, but there are downsides to that, as those academics and previous contributors have pointed out. In other elements of the Bill, such as section 7, with regard to the offence of incitement to violence or hatred against persons, intent will still have to be proved and, therefore, I do not see how that difficulty is not surmounted with regard to the offence of incitement to hatred given the definition of the offence requires that the person communicate material to the public that is likely to incite violence or hatred against a person and that he or she do so with intent to incite violence or hatred. Likewise, to be guilty of the offence of possessing material, a person must have prepared or possessed material that was likely to incite violence or hatred against a person and prepared or possessed such material with intent to incite violence or hatred. That is the crux of it. If we are required to prove intent with regard to the incitement of violence or hatred and if that same requirement to prove intent is an element of the offence for the purpose of possessing material, I am not entirely convinced as to what is achieved by defining it as an aggravating circumstance given the downsides, as have been pointed out. I look forward to the Minister elaborating on that and on the definition of "sex characteristics". What exactly is it hoped to capture by that and how is it hoped to improve the framework directive by specifically including sex characteristics? Those are my concerns and I look forward to having them addressed.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	369	It is clear this is a complicated issue for legislation to deal with, as all the Deputies who have spoken made clear by pointing out the complexity of meeting some of its requirements. The Minister outlined the extensive procedure her Department went through in the form of public consultation, with many meetings and a number of independently facilitated discussion workshops that took place throughout the country. She indicated that a series of meetings had been held with interested groups, organisations, academics, law enforcement professionals and other experts and that this engagement rightly produced many insights, as legislation such as this requires. Nevertheless, Second Stage is being taken on a Thursday, the deadline for Committee Stage amendments has passed and Committee Stage will be taken next Tuesday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice. Why is there such a rush to get the Bill through the Houses given it took such a long time, rightly, to conduct the consultation and the hearing of views in advance? We are now going to fly through all Stages in the Houses and very little discussion will take place here, and that is wrong. This leads me to think that perhaps some of the concerns regarding the legislation are well founded and perhaps that is why the Government wants to rush it through the House in order that they cannot be teased out with an examination of what the Bill’s impact will be. It is a matter of just getting it enacted and saying everything will be grand once it is on the Statute Book. It is as though all will be rosy and it will be "job done", but I think that is wrong. If proper scrutiny takes a further six months, so be it. It took a considerable period up to now and that is the way it should be. For it now to be rushed through on all Stages in the House is wrong. I agree with submissions made by the ICCL and others that expressed concern about the proposed steamrolling of the legislation through the legislative process. That body called on the Government to ensure there would be sufficient time for meaningful democratic debate to take place. How can we have sufficient time for meaningful democratic debate when the deadline for Committee Stage amendments has passed? The fact Committee Stage is scheduled to take place next Tuesday is wrong and the Minister might address that in her concluding remarks. Perhaps she is not in control of the process; I do not know. Alternatively, if the House is in control of the process, it needs to address that because something is badly wrong when legislation is being rushed through in this way, after the appropriate process it went through. It is very worrying. Legislation of this type is necessary. The UN Secretary General stated, “Hate speech undermines social cohesion, erodes shared values and can lay the foundation for violence, undermining peace, stability, sustainable development and the fulfilment of human rights for all.” Similarly, the European Commission stated, “Hate speech and hate crime affect not only the individual victims and their communities ... but also society at large”, and there is no doubt it can have that impact. Rushed legislation, or legislation that does not serve its intended purpose and where there might be concerns, can have an even greater impact.There are concerns with regard to this. We need to legislate to ensure minority groups are protected and people are not targeted because they are members of those groups. That is vitally important. Every Member with a proper sense of right and wrong will agree that is correct and true. I do not know whether this Bill will achieve that, however. That is the danger. This legislation may have additional impacts that could have a more serious effect. It could actually limit the right of people to have thoughts and to speak, which is very important. It is a difficult piece of balancing to get this right. It is interesting to see that "hatred" is not defined in the legislation. That is worrying given that it deals with hate speech. There are bodies of which the State is a proud member, in which it has a long history of participation and which it has used to defend citizens. I have in mind the Council of Europe and other such bodies, which have introduced legislation that we should take on board. The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a Council of Europe, states that
"'hatred' shall mean a state of mind characterised as intense and irrational emotions of opprobrium, enmity and detestation towards the target group". There are definitions that could possibly be used. We should have been using all those bodies of which we are members to help inform and formulate this process. There are other aspects of the Bill. We talk about different standards for different bodies and people. Politicians can have a different standard in terms of a more lax standard. Politicians can fuel hate speech. We have seen it in this House at times. Maybe it is not hate speech but it is definitely speech that is very wrong and could cause upset to people. Why are we treating politicians differently? In fact, we should possibly hold politicians to a much higher standard than the public. Politicians should have more responsibility because we can stand up in this House and our words can be broadcast all over the country and on the Internet. We have a bigger responsibility to act properly and speak with restraint. That is vitally important. Overall, some form of legislation is necessary but I have severe doubts about whether this particular legislation is necessary because I have serious problems with it. I doubt very much if the so-called democratic process we have in this country will be able to deal with the issues arising from this Bill. For this reason, I am very concerned about the possibility that this legislation will go through, what it will mean for people in the future and whether we will provide the necessary protection we are talking about. That is vitally important. We should ensure we get workable legislation passed rather than legislation that will be left on the Statute Book and probably not used.

We have had a considerable amount of conversation on this Bill. We all realise the issues we have in society with regard to hate. I, like many of my Sinn Féin colleagues, welcome this legislation in principle but there are question marks over it. Many Deputies raised the issue of speed and haste. We need to make sure we carry out the due diligence that is necessary. We have here the idea that an incitement to hatred offence and aggravated versions of existing offences with hatred as a motivating factor can be a hate crime. I cannot see anyone having a great difficulty with the denial of genocide being a crime. Having a single statute dealing with hate crime is a good idea, commendable and necessary. We all probably wanted to be at this point earlier. Questions have been asked about having some clarity on the definition of "hatred". I accept there will be a huge amount of scrutiny of this legislation. It is vital we do not get caught up in not having the necessary clarity. We all accept there are huge issues with regard to race, gender or particular views people have. We know there has been a huge amount of oppression in society. Many speakers spoke about an element of hate speech, including online, that some people in this Chamber have had to deal with. A considerable number of female Members have sometimes had to deal with far worse than their male counterparts have. None of that is defensible and all of it must be dealt with. It must be called out where necessary and we need to make sure we have the legislation to deal with it. Like others, I believe that, where necessary, we should also have education. We should be able to use restorative practice if we are dealing with scenarios where we can dissipate a problem. All of us inside and outside this House must be far more careful about what we say. That is not to take away from the point of view that people will make mistakes and be stupid at times, whether they are young or old. We have all had our moments. At times, however, people and groups can also be hateful and utterly determined in what they are doing. We need to be able to deal with that. We talk about issues of prejudice and deal with people who are suffering oppression, whether that is on the basis of colour, gender, creed or whatever. We know this can be fed by some of the inequalities that exist in society. Those are what we need to tackle. We have had an explosion in the far right across Europe. People like Ms Marine Le Pen and others have been able to latch on to this. Some of that has been a failure to deal with some of the people on the periphery who feel they do not have power or that nobody is looking after their interests. That is not, for want of a better term, to liberate them from going down wrong roads politically and all the rest of it. As a protection of democracy and good values across the board, however, we need to ensure we deal with the issues, whether it is housing, poverty or the drugs that are rife, particularly in working-class communities. We must look at all these particular issues. I will reiterate what many have said today. This is a very different world and it is also a very different Ireland from the one in which I grew up, where everybody had the same type of second name and looked the same. "If I can see it, I can be it" is a famous line, which I have probably misquoted. We need to ensure we do that piece in society. We must make sure all those who are part of our society now can see themselves, whether it is in the media, in this Chamber or across all those places that seem to matter in society. We need to make sure all the agencies and elements of society represent the society that is out there. It is a very different society and we have difficulties but in many ways, it is much richer. We need to ensure we put protections in place and we must do as best we can in this legislation. There are, however, much wider issues that need to be dealt with.There has been considerable commentary about the online world. In fairness, there has been a considerable amount of legislation at European level and also domestically to try to deal with some of these issues. I am thinking of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the Digital Services Act. That is the idea. When we are talking about particular tech companies this week, obviously a large number of people have got bad news about their employment. There has been some disgraceful undermining of workers' rights by particular firms. That will have to be called out and dealt with at domestic, European and possibly even a wider level. We know there are people who have been able to use online platforms. We know there have been groupings, loosely. There have been state and non-state actors who have been able to weaponise messages of hate. We really need to make sure that we put those pieces of legislation in place so that we can deal with Twitter, Facebook and everyone else as publishers. Beyond that, we must also be able to make sure that algorithms are not in operation, as we know they are, that can actually allow for the selling of hate. We need to ensure this is dealt with from technical and legislative points of view. I get that it is difficult. We have a changing world not only in demographics and how wider society is but also from a technical point of view. It is very difficult to ensure that legislation catches up but we have to do it. In respect of the issue of dealing with cyber crime and all that, within this State and on a wider basis we also have to deal with the idea of directed spyware. People may have heard of Pegasus and Predator. Predator is produced by a firm that has a connection to Ireland. It is something that we need to look at. What we are talking about in respect of Predator is not malware or spyware as we understand it in the sense of literally trying to just hit any machine, device or phone that will work. Generally the people who purchase these are what I will call states that would not have a particular interest in human rights but would have a particular interest in ensuring that they can maintain control of their populace and whoever else. It would be about targeting what they would term high-value targets, be they politicians, journalists or whoever else. I think that is a question that the Minister and others within the Government need to look at. I am talking particularly about Predator and the companies situated in Ireland that are associated with it. This is an issue that needs to be dealt with. To get back to the legislation, we need to make sure we do due diligence. I would like to think there would be a considerable amount of interaction with Opposition Deputies with the aim of getting as much of this right as possible before it ends up in the courts for the wrong reasons. We must ensure that we are providing another weapon for dealing with that element of hate that is out there. Obviously we are talking about a wide spectrum. At some points we can be talking about hateful language that can be incredibly hurtful to those who receive it, but beyond that we can be talking about absolutely organised acts of hatred and violence that can have a really brutal impact on people's lives. We need to make sure we do this properly.

I will deprive Deputy Ó Murchú of the pleasure of being the last speaker. I do know if I would use the word "pleasure" at this point. In any event, I welcome the opportunity. There is a great need for this Bill. However, I must preface that by saying I still do not know anything about the date for amendments. It was raised in the Chamber when I was in my other role. I shared the concern about setting the date for the amendments before Second Stage. I am still not clear. I understand the time has passed. If it has passed, that is not a way to deal with legislation. I want that on the record. Certainly nothing has been clarified to me in either role that I have. I am speaking now as a Deputy. To say that amendments should be in before the Second Stage debate is nothing short of shocking and unacceptable. I thank the Minister for her speech. She set out how the Bill replaces and simplifies the provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 by creating a core offence that will criminalise any intentional or reckless communication or behaviour that is likely to incite violence or hatred against a person or persons because they are associated with a protected characteristic. One could not but welcome that. I am going to go through the background to the Bill as I see it and the issues. I will then describe the problematic aspects of the Bill and the reasons I have the most serious concerns. Although I want to support the Bill, and we need the Bill, because of the way it is being done I find myself in a position of not supporting it, which is very difficult for me. Deputy Mattie McGrath had particular opinions, I have particular opinions and other Deputies have theirs. That range of opinions in this Dáil alone brings into acute focus what the Minister and her Department have to deal with in terms of bringing forth legislation that is robust and that will protect vulnerable groups and people who suffer tremendously as a result of hate speech and hate crime, while at the same time ensuring freedom of expression. That is the part that is missing in the Minister's speech. It is the part that I find more than a little disappointing. This balancing of both sides has not been teased out. Normally I am giving out about long speeches; while the Minister is to be complimented for her brevity, on this occasion I would really have liked the Department's and her thinking on how this very difficult situation has to be balanced. The right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution and copper-fastened in various Supreme Court and High Court judgments as well as by EU and international instruments. Nowhere has that been balanced or teased out for me in the speech. Neither has it been teased out in the legislation, unfortunately, which is very problematic. I will come back to that section. As usual I thank the staff in the Library and Research Service for their tremendous work under pressure. They have produced a detailed digest once again. It sets out that there are four Parts to the Bill, 36 sections and one Schedule. It has been said on the record here that there has been a thorough consultation. That is not accurate. There was prelegislative scrutiny on one day where people came in and made their submissions, in addition to written submissions. What has to be analysed here needs a lot more than one day. The one day was for the organisations or entities coming in before the committee. They gave detailed presentations and background. I have read as much as I can of it. I have read the submission from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. I have read both submissions from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. I have read some of the other contributions as quickly as I could. All of the organisations welcome the legislation in respect of what it is setting out to do but have serious concerns about how it is being done. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has a statutory mandate to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law in practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and to examine any legislative proposal and report its views on any implications for human rights or equality. This organisation has gone to great trouble in its 55-page submission to highlight its concerns. That was in respect of the Heads of the Bill. I know they have changed, some for the better, some not.Its submission focused on the following matters, namely, "Balancing [which I have mentioned] the prohibition on discrimination and incitement to hatred with the right to freedom of expression; Addressing hate-motivated offences; and Policy measures [which have not been mentioned much at all in the discussion today] to respond to hate crime and incitement to hatred".It talks about policy measures because as the Minister well knows, criminal law has to be a last resort. This is a last resort in our battle against hate crime and comments. We are looking at the last piece, which to me is not good enough without looking at a whole framework and policy, which every submission has asked for. The submission states: "Countering racism and hate speech is imperative to the building of acceptance of diversity and respect for the dignity of all persons." I come from Galway city and we have the distinction of being the most multicultural society in Ireland. Our percentage of population of non-Irish people is over 20%. It varies a tiny bit between 19% and 21%. IHREC states, "It is important to emphasise at this stage of the legislative process that this legislation is only one strand of the legislative and policy measures which the State is required to take" under our law, EU law and international law. It goes on to point out that this legislation: "should be complemented by a broad set of policy measures" and so on. I will skip a lot of that. It points out there are no specific hate crime offences in Irish law at present, as we are aware. I want to go on to freedom of expression. The right to freedom of expression, as I have said, is protected under the Constitution as well as EU and international law. The European Court of Human Rights has found that the right is applicable, not only to information or ideas that are favourably received or regarded as offensive or as a matter of indifference but that it also applies to those that offend, shock or disturb the state or any sector of the population. It is difficult for all of us to accept that there is a right to offend, shock and disturb. None of us want to hear that but that is something that needs to be teased out. How do we allow for that and still not allow hatred or hate crime or not allow somebody to suffer as a result of that? The right to freedom of expression is not absolute. The UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression talks about a three-part test. We can restrict the right to freedom of expression because it is not absolute but we must do so in a careful manner. We do so provided by law, which is clear, unambiguous, precisely worded and accessible to everyone. Unfortunately this legislation does not do that and it is not clear, unambiguous and precise. The second point the UN special rapporteur makes is that such restrictions must be proven by the state as necessary and legitimate to protect the rights or reputation of others. Again there is a huge data gap on hate crime and hatred on the ground here, which I will come to if I have time. Third is that it must be proven by the state that the measures taken are the least restrictive and proportionate means required to achieve the purported aim. This legislation is not the least restrictive means; it is bringing in serious penalties and it is not proportionate. It is giving much more power to the Garda in search warrants and so on. The UN Rabat plan, which goes back to 2012, subject to correction, implies, among other things, that restrictions are "clearly and narrowly defined and respond to a pressing social need". There is a pressing social need to stop hatred and hate crimes but they must be: "the least intrusive measure available... [or not] overly broad, [which this legislation is so] that they do not restrict speech in a wide or untargeted way". It plan states that only the "most severe" hate speech expression should meet the threshold of incitement to hatred. The UN special rapporteur has stated that only serious and extreme incidences of incitement to hatred, which would cross the threshold test, should be criminalised. There are many more comments from various European and international entities on getting that balance right and realising that it is a difficult area but none of that has been addressed in the Minister’s speech or in any of the documents, other than the submissions made by the various entities I have mentioned. On the Bill itself, I have a serious problem with a definition of hatred that simply goes around in circles. What is hatred? Hatred means hatred against a person or a group. We are saying that hatred is simply hatred, therefore. I do not know what it means; perhaps the Government does. I do not know because I am not a judge and I do not know what a judge will make of that but there is no definition of hatred here. I understand that in the heads of Bill there was a more robust attempt to define hatred, which is now gone from the Bill. I refer to the protected characteristics, which I welcome. There are ten of them, namely, race; colour; nationality; religion; national or ethnic origin, which covers Travellers; descent; gender; sex characteristics; sexual orientation, which I understand was added after the heads of Bill, which is welcome; and disability. Again IHREC points out that other categories are left out. I am not an expert and I am simply raising this in the manner that IHREC has raised it. Civil status, family status and age have not been included and I am not sure what the logic is for including some characteristics and excluding others. At what point can new entities or protected characteristics be put in? At what point can that happen? When we are debating legislation like this - and I have only given a selection of information on the importance of balancing rights - there is an onus to explain why we are including some characteristics and excluding others. I move on to the repeal of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, which is very welcome. Why is it welcome? It is welcome because it simply did not work. That has been pointed out to us repeatedly. It has been pointed out that there were few prosecutions under that Act. Out of 44 prosecutions there were a minute number of convictions. The 1989 Act, which the Minister said was "ahead of its time", was a useless one. It did not do anything for anyone so how it can be called "ahead of its time" is beyond my comprehension. I have a serious concern with the protection of freedom of expression provision in section 11. The only time the term "protection of freedom" appears is simply in the title of that section, "Protection of freedom of expression". Other organisations with vast experience and more knowledgeable than I have expressed serious concerns about this. One little section with the protection of freedom of expression in its title has simply been put in and this has been done in a negative manner. It states "For the purposes of this Part, any material or behaviour is not taken to incite violence or hatred against a person or a group of persons... solely on the basis that that material or behaviour includes or involves discussion or criticism of matters relating to a protected characteristic." This is not a strong protection of freedom of expression. When you go back to the provisions relating to events under section 7(3) it sets out various defences, either there or elsewhere, including: "a reasonable and genuine contribution to literary, artistic, political, scientific, religious or academic discourse" and so on. I agree with the ICCL and IHREC, if they made the point, that if we had a strong paragraph on the protection of freedom of expression, we would not need to be putting in these defences because they would come under the protection of freedom of expression. Now we have diminished the freedom of expression rather than doing the opposite. I will move to the issue of presumption, which is a strong point. You are presumed innocent until proven guilty and 99% of the time the onus is on the prosecution to prove. We are reversing that and there is a presumption that has to be rebutted. We have done something similar in the legislation on tackling illegal smuggling, the title of which I forget. In that legislation we also reversed the onus of proof, which to me was shocking at the time. Now we are doing something similar in this Bill, which is a step too far for me. I will move to search warrants and section 15 has to be fundamentally changed or taken out.We cannot give that type of power to a district justice or anyone. I understand the general scheme of the Bill did not contain the provision. It reads: "If a judge of the District Court is satisfied by information on oath of a member that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence under section 7, 8 or 10 is to be found in any place, the judge may issue a warrant for the search of that place and any persons found at that place". The Bill also states that a named member can "enter, at any time within one week of the date of issue of the warrant, on production if so requested of the warrant, and if necessary by the use of reasonable force, the place named in the warrant". Have we learned nothing? I do not know how long we have spent learning to retrust the Garda. My first introduction to the Dáil was the O'Higgins report. I was nauseated reading what had happened in the McCabe case. I have read the Charlton report and the other reports. Have we learned nothing about giving almost absolute power to institutions like the Garda and the Dáil? I put myself in that category. Have we learned nothing? The issue with amendments has been clarified. I welcome this legislation and I want to work with the Minister. This legislation is vital in a functioning democracy. We have heard the comments from the UN Secretary General which were referenced earlier on on how freedom of speech is vital to democracy. Freedom from speech crime and hatred is also vital in a democracy. If we do not have freedom of speech, we do not have democracy. If there are people who are so terrified because they are the object of subject of hate speech, our democracy is in trouble. That is why a number of meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice would have been the most basic way of teasing out what we need in this legislation. There is no provision for a review. I was in the Chair yesterday and I heard a whole discussion on a review of a piece of legislation, the name of which alludes me at the moment. A review has been built into that legislation. Usually, the standard reply is that legislation is reviewed every year anyway. Last night-----

Last night there was detailed debate in relation to a review of the new Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, legislation. There is no detailed debate here on a review of this legislation. I could go back to the figures on the reporting of hate crime. It is the invisibility of hate crime and the suffering of victims that concerns me. I want to emphasise that what people suffer on the ground as a result of hatred and hate crime is simply intolerable. We need legislation to prevent that, but the balance is essential. We are doing that in a vacuum with no data. One of the documents I read stated that An Garda Síochána published its first official statistics following the introduction of its new reporting system in 2022. It was the first time this was done. The statistics indicated that 389 hate crimes were reported to the Garda during 2021, in addition to 59 non-hate crime incidences, comprising 448 in total. The Garda itself acknowledges that under-reporting is still prevalent. Indeed, the documents I have read call for alternative ways for people to report on what they are suffering. None of this, of course, has happened. Perhaps some of it has happened. The common theme from everything I have read is that we need a suite of measures to combat hate crime and hate speech, and that this legislation or any legislation is seen as only part of that, and indeed as a last resort. That is not what is happening with this Bill. We are reversing, in part, the burden of proof. We are not protecting freedom of expression, and we are bringing in legislation that is wide open to abuse in terms of the search warrants issued to the Garda and people being targeted on the ground for their views. I will finish by noting that we heard the latest from the priest in County Kerry in the news. In my opinion, counter-narrative is the answer to that. I also note the recent attack on Salman Rushdie, who is still suffering as a result of the book he wrote. Of course, we are also familiar with comments that are more than comments we receive when we dare to speak out on what Israel is doing in Palestine and call it apartheid. We receive letters threatening us for what we are saying. That is all part of this picture. I am over my allotted time, so I will finish there.

People have different views, but in the round they support the need for this legislation and want to see it passed, but they want to see it done right. There will not be any attempt to rush this through without listening to views and opinions. We will ensure that we have the legislation right. I want to be very clear on that. On the point about education and other policy measures, I fully agree that the legislation cannot be the one and only solution. We must ensure that we are engaged in education in our schools and that we get to the root causes of these crimes. At the same time, we are dealing with a criminal justice matter in the Department of Justice in this legislation. The victims of these types of crimes need to know that there is justice at the end of the day. We do not have hate crime legislation, and it has been clearly pointed out that the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 simply does not work. We are here and we are dealing with the legislation before us, but I fully agree that further policies and developments need to be introduced in education to make sure that we can deal with the underlying issues. Victims need to know that there is justice at the end of the day. That is specifically what we are talking about here.  On the issue of demonstration versus motivation, which has been raised today, I know articles have been published on the various ways of looking at it, saying there is a difference between a premeditated crime and one that is not. Whether or not a person sits at home and intentionally decides to go out and assault another person based on who they are or a characteristic, or whether somebody who assaults a person and clearly demonstrates, during the assault, that they are doing that because of that characteristic, it is no less hurtful or damaging. It is no less difficult for the victim, irrespective of whether the crime was premeditated or not. It is important that we do not make it a lesser crime simply because the perpetrator has not spent five hours sitting at home deciding they are going to do that. In saying that, we will not see the floodgates opening with the passing of this legislation. The suggestion that we will see more cases coming before the courts is not what has been reflected in the UK's experience. Looking at the figures, of 155,000 pre-recorded hate crimes there were 10,000 prosecutions, and 86% of defendants were found guilty. It is not as though suddenly 155,000 people were found guilty of these crimes even though they were reported. It has not opened the floodgates. There have not been significantly more cases in other jurisdictions.  We do need to ensure that this legislation works. People have said, throughout the debate, that we want legislation that is effective and that works, so that the Garda and the DPP can bring prosecutions and there is justice at the end of the day.It was strongly felt, having listened to the arguments from the committee and many others, and having examined other jurisdictions, that the motivation test alone, which would require motivation to be proved, and, in that way, would involve getting into the mind of the person, would not be sufficient and that the demonstration test would assist while at the same time ensuring nobody randomly and accidentally finds themselves being targeted or prosecuted for a hate crime. In respect of free speech and freedom of expression, we have strengthened the current draft of the Bill. Section 11 deals with the protection of freedom of expression. This is taken directly from the European Convention on Human Rights. As Deputy Connolly referenced, the right to freedom of expression means individuals can hold and express opinions which others might find offensive or shocking. It is clear that one cannot stumble one's way into incitement to violence, hatred or hate speech. One must intentionally or recklessly set out to incite violence or hatred against another group of people so simply having a view or belief that I or another person might not like, and which is shocking to others, is insufficient. The definition we have set here, taken from the European Convention on Human Rights, makes that clear. That is why we have not gone any further. We had added the defences to try to make the situation as clear as possible. That is clearly set out in what we have included in that paragraph, as deemed appropriate by the European Convention on Human Rights. We need to get the balance right and must ensure that people can have genuinely held views and beliefs, even when others may not like them. It is about dealing with occasions where people intentionally or recklessly set out to cause harm to another group of people. Somebody might say something we do not like but that does not mean they are setting out to harm a group of people. They might just hold a different view from others. I agree we must get that balance right. If there are more ways to do so, I am open to suggestion but we have tried to examine the situation as carefully as possible. There were a few suggestions that the legislation will impact a person's right to protest. There is a valid and genuine right to peaceful protest in this country. I do not think it would be possible for a rogue member of the Garda to use this legislation to suddenly accuse someone of a hate crime. If somebody is not peacefully protesting and fires a firework at a member of the Garda, traps somebody in a car or does something else they should not do, that is a crime and the person can be convicted under this legislation if there is a hate element to it. However, if people are protesting peacefully, there is no reason for this legislation to impact them. This is not about becoming the thought police and preventing something from happening before it happens. A more extreme example of a similar crime is that of conspiracy to murder. Just because a person does not commit the crime or is stopped before they commit it, they are no less guilty for what they intended to do. If a person clearly intends to distribute material that is inciting hatred or may incite hatred against a person or group of people, it is important that is acknowledged. It is deemed a lesser offence in the legislation. It is not the same as if somebody actually distributed that offensive material but acknowledges there was intent that could have caused harm. That would obviously have to be proven and there are defences in that regard. A review after one year is included in the legislation. People might say that does not happen but my officials tell me they have recently conducted two reviews of pieces of legislation a year after their enactment. It does happen. That provision is set out in the legislation itself. The reason we have such a small level of instances, those 448 incidents, is because we have not had hate crime until now and we have lacked a mechanism to capture these data. That is part of the problem and that is why this legislation is so important. We will shortly have an ability to capture those data because this Bill will be on our Statute Book. We will establish hate crime as a crime and the data that will follow will enable us to design new policies on education, and to understand the incidents that take place and the people who are impacted. It will help us to deal with many of those issues. I was asked about the situation in respect of the sex characteristics. The Bill focuses on physical characteristics. That is why that was included. Male, female, intersex separate to somebody who identifies, and that is why that is included in that. There was a question about the threshold and the evidence that is required. For incitement, the threshold is intent or recklessness and the evidence is the actual communicating piece, which includes the words that are spoken, the literature that is provided or the online commentary. The threshold is that a person's actions would intentionally or recklessly incite hatred. When we are talking about a hate crime, the motivation is proof for the demonstration of the hatred in itself. I was also asked about the characteristics and how we decided on the list. We tried to engage as widely as possible during public consultation. The list is based on the most commonly targeted identities. Others can be added at a later stage and do not need to be included now. If some other types of characteristics incite significant levels of hate crimes, we can deal with it. There is an idea that has come up in a number of different quarters to the effect that some of the work I am doing in the Department of Justice is woke, which is a term that has been used previously, or deals with matters that are not the bread and butter of justice. I appreciate that for many people, justice means investing in and supporting the Garda in the work it does. The Garda is integral to the justice system. A significant part of my budget goes to supporting the Garda. A considerable amount of the work I do is intended to support the Garda and improve how it can work and do its job through investment and increasing numbers of personnel. I disagree that focusing on domestic violence, protecting women and girls, hate crime, hate speech, protecting vulnerable people and reforming our family court system is not the bread and butter of justice. We need to focus on all measures-----

I raise the issue of two girls, aged nine and 11, who urgently require access to assistive technology for the visually impaired so they can access a full education. As the Minister of State is aware from previous correspondence, despite extensive difficulties relating to their vision, both girls have a difficulty in accessing the assistive technology they require as a result of their visual impairment. These young girls have been denied the support they need because they cannot get a visiting teacher to sign off on the request for this equipment because it is being claimed by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, that these girls do not have access to a visiting teacher. When we pointed out that they previously had access to a visiting teacher, the response was that they only received that access informally. The claim is being made that the access to the visiting teacher was never officially provided.The family was never informed that this was not officially provided, and the freedom of information file contradicts this position. They have engaged with a visiting teacher on an ongoing basis and a visiting teacher had access to medical reports etc., but now when they need a signature, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is claiming the support to date was unofficial and, as a result, the vital equipment cannot now be authorised. Despite a wealth of paperwork and reports being submitted clearly showing the support provided to both children by the visiting teacher, it has been claimed this was "informal support that was given in an informal fashion". Both of these children have received access from the visiting teacher for the visually impaired since they were toddlers. The visiting teacher went to their home, carried out assessments, gave advice, wrote reports for the school and provided support in preschool. Yet they are still being asked to believe this access was informal. Even if we did accept that, which we do not, why should this in some way prevent them from accessing the support they clearly need? These children have been assessed by the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, as requiring specific technology for the visually impaired and cannot function in school without this specific support. The NCSE accepts these visually impaired children need assistive technology to function in school, but the family is being urged to accept assistive technology appropriate for children with dyslexia rather than that for children with a visual impairment. How can anyone stand over a situation where the necessary technology which would vastly improve the day-to-day school life for these children is being refused? An application for assistive technology for the visually impaired was submitted 14 months ago for visual equipment, but that application has sat there since because of the failure to sign off by a visiting teacher. The Minister of State has told me in her replies that the family can still access the support of the visiting teacher but just did not get a signature. Instead, the State is prepared to spend public money to provide basic assistive technology equipment, which is not fit for purpose for these children, both of whom have being diagnosed with a rare genetic condition. The State's failure to provide appropriate assistive technology now results in these children being unable to access the full curriculum, a basic right for every child in this country.

I know it is an issue that has frustrated him for a significant amount of time and I believe he raised it on radio on Saturday. I know he has this particular family in mind when discussing the assistive technology scheme. I will talk about the assistive technology scheme in a little more detail. I am confident there will be a satisfactory resolution to this in the coming days. I have spoken to both the NCSE and Department on the matter. I know they are in close contact with the family and with the school. The Deputy probably knows how this works in the sense that, if the school has the resources in the first instance to provide assistive technology, then it has a duty to do that, but if it does not, then it should approach the NCSE for bespoke equipment. As Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I do not believe it makes sense that equipment will be given to a child with an additional need in circumstances where that equipment is not fit for purpose. The Deputy has said these two girls, aged nine and 11, are visually impaired. They have a rare genetic disorder. There is no point in them having equipment they cannot use. I completely concur with his point in this regard. I am liaising closely with the NCSE and the Department on it. The assistive technology scheme is a very useful tool for children with additional needs. Last year, 3,766 children availed of the scheme and, to date this year, 3,293 have availed of it. We allocated an extra €2 million in the budget for 2023 for the very circumstance the Deputy outlined. There obviously is a process there. Apart from what the Deputy has said, I am not entirely clear why this has fallen through the cracks. There could be miscommunication between the various parties. In the first instance there needs to be diagnosis - the Deputy has said the NCSE accepts that diagnosis - of a physical or communicative disability, followed by a recommendation and a professional assessment. There is then a liaising with the special educational needs organiser, SENO, and the NCSE, who will review the criteria and then a recommendation is made to the Department as to the level of grant to be provided. The NCSE through the SENOs is responsible for processing the applications. It is very important to me, as Minister of State with responsibility for special education, that these children would be looked after. I know they have been working closely with the school and the NCSE on it in recent days. Last April, the Department announced the digital strategy for schools to 2027 with €200 million committed over the period of the strategy. Already €50 million of that has already been provided to schools. This approach facilitates multi-annual planning by schools to allow them to plan effectively for all their children. The NCSE, the Department and the SENOs need to work very closely together with the visiting teacher service which the Deputy mentioned to provide equipment that is of value to these children with additional needs.

I gave notice two weeks ago. This issue was selected two weeks ago for response. It is a very specific case. I gave the correspondence reference in the Topical Issue notice I gave. I expected a detailed response on this particular case. The Minister of State is correct that yesterday the principal of the school and the mother were contacted, 14 months after the applications went in. It is not good enough. It should not require me to bring it to the floor of the House for that engagement to take place, with the issue having been selected two weeks ago. I take the point the Minister of State made and I will give her the benefit of the doubt on it. I want specific progress in getting this issue addressed. The National Council for Special Education is saying there was no formal engagement with the visiting teacher. I want to put on the public record here that in February 2016, the then visiting teacher - I have a letter on Department-headed notepaper dated February 2016 in the name of the visiting teacher - produced a report for the 11-year-old girl just before she started in primary school with the diagnosis and everything. It specifically states in black and white that this young girl is eligible for the visiting teacher for visually impaired support. The second last sentence of the letter states, "I will be liaising with the school and home supporting this girl in my role as [visiting teacher for the visually impaired] VTVI who can also contact me as needed." That is not any informal engagement. These children deserve the equipment that has been recommended for them to receive and I want to see that happen.

I have personally spoken to the NCSE and the Department on this. I am encouraged and glad to hear there was a conversation yesterday with the principal and with the mother which indicates there is movement already on this. I do not doubt the Deputy's bona fides regarding the correspondence he outlined.Having such an assistive technology scheme will be of no benefit if we are not providing equipment that is bespoke to a particular child. It needs to be particular to the child who has an additional need. Having said that, there are many types of equipment already in existence. There are audiological supports for hearing improvements, there is brain equipment and there is computer equipment with modified software for physical or severe communicative disabilities. There is a range of equipment. We will need to update over the next number of years the type of assistive technology and that is under review also. There will be consultation around that from the first quarter of next year, because technology is moving at pace. Even the assistive technology that we have now will probably need to be updated in years to come in order to be able to assist children to communicate. I say this because this is a matter of communication at the end of the day, as well as of whatever additional needs a child may have. If that assistive technology equipment is going to assist them in communicating, then there is an onus on us to provide for that. The funding is there. There is an extra €2 million the budget, as I have said. I want to reassure the Deputy that I will do everything that I can to make sure that there is a satisfactory conclusion to this issue for him. I thank him for his advocacy.

I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O’Brien, is taking this Topical Issue. He might know the area reasonably well because it is on the Mallow to Killarney road. This is a dangerous junction. It intersects Kanturk and Banteer, and on to Cork and Nad. The junction has been classified at Cork County Council level as one of the most dangerous junctions in Cork and indeed in Munster. A huge body of work has been done locally to try to get a solution. Councillor Bernard Moynihan organised the petition locally. Some 3,000 people signed the petition because of the urgent need for work to be done on the junction. As I understand it, a design has been approved. An Bord Pleanála has given its approval. It went in as one of the major projects directly to An Bord Pleanála and planning has been given. It is my understanding that Cork County Council has submitted an application to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to get funding for this work. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this junction to the people of Duhallow and north Cork in particular; to the people who are crossing that junction on a daily basis in their commute from the western and northern end of Duhallow, from Kanturk, Newmarket, Rockchapel and Cork; to those who are coming from western Duhallow from the Kerry bounds; and to those coming from Kerry who are crossing the junction and going on to Mallow, Banteer and onwards to Cork. Local people use that junction on a daily basis, whether they are going in or out of Kanturk or whatever they are doing, as are people from the farming community and elsewhere. This junction has been the subject of many discussions at local authority level and indeed here in Leinster House. It is high time that we ensured that funding is made available for it. There are plans that have been approved and it has gone through the various steps in planning, land acquisition and all the other necessary statutory processes that have been earmarked. A huge body of work has been done by the senior officials in Cork County Council. They liaise with the Department at all stages, as well as with Transport Infrastructure Ireland on advancing this work. Transport Infrastructure Ireland gave funding in terms of submitting to An Bord Pleanála.  Here we are with a shovel-ready project. We cannot wait any longer to get this project done because it will save people’s lives. It will save people who are crossing the junction and who are putting their lives at peril on a daily basis. Whatever side one comes from into the junction, it has stood out as a dangerous junction. It has been heralded as that and it has been acknowledged as that.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the next steps. Does Transport Infrastructure Ireland have the necessary funding available so that work can go ahead at Ballymaquirke as soon as is humanly possible? We have all the building blocks in place.

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with TII under the Roads Act and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads will be a matter for TII in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. TII ultimately delivers the national roads programme in line with Project Ireland 2040, the national planning framework and the NDP. In the new NDP, which was launched in October 2021, approximately €5.1 billion was earmarked for new national road projects to 2030. This funding will enable improved regional accessibility across the country, as well as compact growth which are key national strategic outcomes. The funding will be provided for the development of numerous national road projects, including the completion of projects that are already at construction stage and those that are close to it, as well as the development of a number of others.  Due to the fact that a great proportion of NDP funding for road projects will become available in the second half of the decade, there was a constraint on the funding available for new projects this year. However, most national roads projects in the NDP will continue to progress in 2022. In addition, a major priority in the NDP, in line with Department’s investment hierarchy, is to maintain the quality and safety of the existing national road network. The NDP foresees an Exchequer allocation of approximately €2.9 billion for the protection and renewal of existing national roads over the ten-year period to 2030, allocated fairly and evenly across the decade.  The N72 is a national secondary road that runs east-west from its junction with the N25 near Dungarvan in Waterford to the N70 in Killorglin in Kerry. The N72 passes through a number of towns, including Lismore, Fermoy, Rathmore, Killarney and Killorglin. TII allocated €3,000 to Cork County Council for minor works at the Ballymaquirke Cross in 2022. Cork County Council has recently tendered the works contracted for the development of a new junction at this location. This may include the construction of a new roundabout and the realignment of a section of road.  The Department of Transport has been informed by TII that tenders have recently returned to the council which will now be assessed. It is hoped that this scheme will commence construction in 2023. Another NDP project on the N72 in this region is the Mallow relief road for which funding was allocated in 2022. This project, which is at planning and design stage, will improve connectivity in the north Cork area. It will also enhance the urban environment of the town of Mallow, reduce congestion and provide benefits to walkers, cyclists and vulnerable road users.

He said in his statement that it is hoped the construction will start in 2023. Have the Department or Transport Infrastructure Ireland responded to the Minister of State, giving an exact time for the construction? If there is any message that I want taken away from today's discussion in Dáil Éireann, it is the urgency of this matter. It is a safety issue. It is of paramount importance that this junction is dealt with immediately. A huge pile of work has been done and I credit Councillor Bernard Moynihan for the amount of work that he did on it heretofore. It is now time for us at a national level to stand up and make sure that it goes to construction without delay. The Minister of State said the tenders were returned to Cork County Council. Can he confirm that a contractor has been appointed or is about to be appointed and that Transport Infrastructure Ireland has informed the Department that construction will be completed in 2023?

In line with the NDP and Government policy, TII is allocating national road funding for local authorities for 2022 in a manner which seeks to achieve the following key outcomes: the protection and renewal of the existing national road network; progressing major projects in or near construction; progress of major projects that are pre-construction but well advanced in the development pipeline; and prioritising remaining funds for major projects that provide for local bypasses and compact growth in Ireland's towns and villages.Improvements such as the upgrade of the junction at Ballymaquirke Cross, while relatively minor, deliver significant safety benefits for all road users. The Department of Transport is happy to note the progress that has been made on that junction. To answer the Deputy's specific question, I do not have information on whether a contractor has been finalised and approved. Nor do I have a detailed timeline of the plans for 2023 other than that it is expected to start that year. I acknowledge the Deputy's points about the urgency of doing something about the junction, given the serious safety concerns.

This case has to do with Kill in County Kildare. The people of Kill have set a high standard down the years in terms of being innovative, of welcoming new people to the area and of providing the maximum amount of backup and assistance. That is still the case. Unfortunately, there were people in attendance at a public meeting who were not from the area and who had other intentions, so I will point out the concerns of the local people. They were a little concerned about how there appeared to be a secretive move to, as it were, dump people into the area without any consultation. While it is difficult to consult everyone to the appropriate extent, a little bit of trust and dialogue with the local community is of great importance. I strongly support the accommodation of people from war zones, as well as our international obligation to do so. That must continue. We must always recognise the difficult situations that various refugees find themselves in and have the utmost compassion for them. In this situation and if possible, giving an indication would be important. No contracts have been signed yet and I am sure that the Department is looking around for an appropriate place to bring people. Local people are concerned about local services and the need to upgrade them in areas where extra housing is required for whatever reason. They are also concerned for local people who have been on housing lists for a number of years, albeit obviously for different reasons, and the need to accommodate them insofar as is possible. If it is deemed the right thing to do in any particular location, not only in Kill, then accommodation in the area should be brought up to a standard that is sufficient for accommodating the intended people. The people of Kill have always welcomed others and have been anxious to help with any situation that has arisen in the county. Lest there be any misunderstanding, their attitude is one of ensuring that the best possible service is provided. They are capable of enhancing that in a way that would improve the country's reputation and, in doing so, would allow the placement of people who are in difficult situations and have nowhere else to go.

As the House knows, my Department is providing accommodation for more than 62,000 people. Some 45,000 of those are displaced from Ukraine and almost 17,000 are international protection applicants. This compares with around 7,500 last year. To put it in context, this is equivalent to 1.3% of the State's population. Our pre-Covid annual total population growth rate was 1%. The figure of 62,000 is larger than the population of Waterford city and is approaching the size of Galway city. It is by far the largest humanitarian effort that the State has ever undertaken. This creates a challenge for the State, but it also creates a duty on the Government and the entire political system to ensure that we can continue to support those who are seeking refuge in Ireland from a vicious war and other vicious conflicts. My Department has a Ukraine crisis temporary accommodation team, which works with the International Protection Accommodation Service on procuring accommodation. Alongside this, we have to find beds for those who are in accommodation where contracts have ended and ensure that no one stays in temporary rest centres for too long. This means that officials in my Department are potentially accommodating and moving several hundred people, many of whom are vulnerable, on a daily basis. It is a major logistical challenge and a cross-Government effort. My Department, the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Social Protection, Education, Health and Justice, and the Office of Public Works, OPW, are working together, with the amazing support of local authorities and community groups around the country. The Deputy is undoubtedly aware of the amazing work that is being done by groups across County Kildare. There has been a great welcome in County Kildare. Approximately 2% of the total number of international protection applicants in the country, or 450 individuals, reside in Kildare and approximately 2%, or just over 1,000, of the total number of Ukrainians in the country reside there. In terms of movement and notice, when we procure new accommodation for international protection applicants or Ukrainians, we also endeavour to provide briefings to Deputies, Senators and the relevant local authorities at official and councillor levels. In the case of Kill, there is no contract yet. It is for this reason that we have not provided any information - there is no contract to speak to. A number of issues and concerns have been raised. In our contract negotiations, those will form part of our decision on whether a contract is entered into. I am aware of issues around sewage capacity and flooding. Deputy Durkan spoke to the wider pressures in Irish society, particularly the pressures on our housing lists. That situation is acute in County Kildare and west Dublin. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is rolling out Housing for All. I joined him and the Taoiseach last week at the great launch of a significant new social housing development in my constituency. It is positive to see that coming online. The Taoiseach and the Minister are considering new and innovative methods, for example, modular or rapid builds, however one wants to describe them, to form part of the Housing for All solution. Regardless of what might happen in Kill and what is happening elsewhere, the accommodation solutions in this situation are temporary and should not be confused with the permanent accommodation solutions that we are looking to put in place for all members of the population who have a housing need, in particular those who have been on the social housing list for long periods. I am working on the temporary accommodation element and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is working on the permanent social housing element.

The provision of information and extra facilities, as required, is welcomed by those who may be temporarily or permanently housed there. It is important that the quality of whatever accommodation is made available is of a standard that is in keeping with their requirements and is of a sufficiently high standard to ensure that the situation does not become an embarrassment to the area or to the people living in that accommodation temporarily or permanently. It is also important that people be able to express to the Ukrainian population Ireland's willingness to do its job and accept its responsibilities in terms of international protection by responding to the demands arising from an illegal and irresponsible war that is causing havoc for the people of Ukraine and Europe more widely.I fully accept the Minister's bona fides on the provision of quality facilities that are in accord with the standards we expect today. If they are to be used on a temporary basis they could also be used elsewhere on a temporary basis. The important point is that dialogue needs to continue with the local community, which will respond and take on board what is required, and be responsible and encourage people to live in and contribute to the area. At this stage it important to ensure that the area does not reject people because of their origin, or does not in any way show any antipathy or animosity towards people who are under really serious pressure at this time.

I take the Deputy's point on the importance of standards. We will always look to provide good standards of accommodation. We must realise, however, that temporary accommodation is temporary in nature and the standards will be different from permanent accommodation. We must also remember that people arriving here from Ukraine are fleeing sub-zero temperatures coming to them in winter, are fleeing daily energy blackouts, and are fleeing drones and missile attacks to their areas. I am aware that Ukraine may not be on the top headlines of the news every day now but there remains a brutal war going on there. This is why Ukrainians are coming here. They are not coming here with the desire to be located in Kill or in Blanchardstown. They are coming here because they are fleeing a brutal war. We must always keep this in mind. We do continue to provide that welcome. I work very closely with the Ukrainian Embassy. The Deputy will be aware that in recent weeks we have had to be very honest with our Ukrainian friends about the pressure on accommodation right now and the immediate availability of accommodation that was here in the earlier stages will not be here in the future. There will have to be a more managed arrival on the accommodation side. We have flagged this with the Ukrainian Embassy and we have worked closely with them to ensure that we can continue to accommodate people who arrive here. We will also be able to accommodate those who are here at the moment and who may have to move if hotels decide later on this year or early next year to revert to traditional tourist business. It is a complicated balance and we need to do it working with communities. In the context of Kill we will continue to engage in negotiations with the provider there. We will address the concerns that have been raised. If a contract is agreed, information about that will be provided to elected representatives, to local representatives, to councils and to community groups.

I am referring to butchers specifically. Some of them have had to close branches or have had to shut their doors altogether. One such butcher in Thurles is a member of the Irish Butchers' Guild. He told me that he has been forced to close one of his branches and let go six staff. The Minister of State can imagine the impact this has on a local economy. In his letter the business owner told me that the increase in the electricity charges is unsustainable and he points out that many butcher shops have closed already this year. Unfortunately, this owner has had to close one shop and this has a major impact. He has another shop in Clonmel. All over the country such shops are in massive trouble. This type of retailer needs the highest quality of refrigeration to comply with the standards of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act and with hygiene regulations. This cannot be overstated. In anticipation of what has come to pass, they made great progress in becoming more energy efficient, including using the latest solar panels, water heaters, insulation, LED lighting and so on. In the past 18 months this owner had invested €150,000 in the shop that is now closed. Now those six jobs are gone, along with the money he had ploughed into his shop. He has another shop in Clonmel, which employs another six people, but something needs to be done and done fast so that this shop does not close, and other shops like it around. Among other things, my purpose as a Deputy is, like all Members here, to be a messenger and to bring the concerns of the public to the likes of the Minister and Ministers of State who sit here, and this is what I am doing today. The business owner has pointed out that small and medium-sized enterprises have been singled out by the Ministers' Departments and others as being the backbone of the Irish economy. They were asked to stay open during the Covid period. Now, however, with the big threat of Covid gone, they just seem to have been forgotten about again. Only 12 months ago they were considered essential. It must be galling for such business owners that they are spending that kind of money to try to stay open and they see the small schemes the Government is bringing out, and yet most of the electricity companies are making massive profits of hundreds of millions of euro in a six to nine-month period while the SMEs are being forced to close their places. The business owner told me that he sees the temporary business energy support scheme as somewhat helpful but not nearly enough to offset the overhead that he has laid out. He has described the outlays coming down the line as being astronomical. That scheme was too little too late for the branch of the business this butcher had to close. We need to have action to ensure the future viability of his other branch, and many other businesses such as locally-owned supermarkets and others who have also contacted me. The ability of the scheme to provide for businesses such as his is limited given its timeframe. That scheme deals with the winter months but more energy is used by businesses like his in the summer months. This is what such businesses tell us. We need to see measures introduced that are tailored to the specific needs of businesses and which are effective enough to give them certainty. I welcome the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill but it must be noted that due to Covid and the emergence last year of rising inflation, many businesses took on debt. There are businesses for whom this scheme will be of very limited benefit. That needs to be looked at. We must look further and we must see immediate action.

I thank Deputy Browne for raising this issue. I absolutely understand, and am aware of, the concerns the Deputy has expressed on behalf of his constituent in Tipperary. Businesses all over the island are worried about energy costs heading into the winter. As the Deputy has said, businesses need help with their energy bills. The Government has introduced a significant package to assist them. As the Deputy is aware, the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, is being designed to support eligible businesses that have experienced a significant increase in their electricity or natural gas costs. The TBESS provides up to €30,000 per month for a company with multiple branches, similar to that described by the Deputy. The scheme is currently being discussed as part of the Finance Bill and should, hopefully, be implemented as soon as the Finance Bill is passed in the House. We will then be in a position to begin supporting businesses directly. In addition to TBESS, I would also direct the Deputy to the Revenue Commissioners' website, which has a very detailed questions and answers document about how TBESS will work. There is also the new €200 million Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme for manufacturing and internationally traded firms. In addition, a new €1.2 billion State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, which the Deputy spoke on yesterday, will assist the wider business sector with liquidity and to invest in energy efficiency. Small and medium-sized businesses can currently receive an energy audit voucher from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to get professional advice on how to increase efficiency and reduce their energy costs. Other financial assistance includes the SEAI community grant and grants for microgeneration. All businesses such as those described by the Deputy can contact the local enterprise office for support and guidance on how to get through the current challenges.

I spoke about businesses that have taken out major loans, like the one that invested €150,000, in the past 18 months or so. They took them out to deal with the consequences the pandemic had on their trade. The future is uncertain for many of those businesses because they will not be able to deal with that kind of debt. More can be done. Measures can be taken to offset the cost in other ways for these businesses. I refer here to tackling insurance costs. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has confirmed a large drop in personal injury awards. It is vital that the Government press insurance companies to reflect this in premiums for businesses and that it demand it, because businesses have little or no room for manoeuvre. The Government must ensure the terms and conditions of the credit guarantee scheme are favourable for businesses that are struggling. It is imperative that a watchful eye is kept on the scheme in order to ensure that the businesses availing of it are not just those with more resources to enable them to access it. This funding needs to reach those who need it, like small businesses that employ six to ten people. I hope the Minister of State will take the concerns expressed by me and by business owners on board because every Member of this House has been contacted by small businesses like these butchers and that. I hope he does not discount what they say. This is what they experience daily.

That is why we have put in place €1.2 billion in funding under TBESS. It is explained very well on the Revenue Commissioners' website. There is also SCARP, which will give small companies time to restructure the kind of finances and loans the Deputy spoke about. The Government put in place extraordinary supports for businesses, particularly small businesses, during the Covid pandemic and will not walk away from businesses amidst the current challenges. As soon as we get the Finance Bill passed, we will be in a position to begin administering TBESS to companies like those described by the Deputy. I have accepted a meeting request with the Associated Craft Butchers of Ireland sent to me by Senator Fitzpatrick. I will be hearing from them all over the country, similar to those in Tipperary. I assure the Deputy that the Government has put supports in place, is committed to our small business and small food sector and that commitment is real.

Our members are extremely dedicated and committed to the challenges we face. Our committee is about disability matters and we are challenged to make the lives of people with disabilities better for them, their families and their communities. Each week, we have public meetings. Before I get into the nuts and bolts of the report, I must inform the House that we have heard harrowing stories from people with disabilities and their families and carers over the past two years. Sometimes on the Thursday morning you would be completely exasperated by challenges that families, communities and individuals meet every day because of their disabilities. We listen to that, and the group of people on the committee I am lucky to chair have huge empathy and a huge work rate in advancing the cases for people with disabilities and making their lives better. The team supporting the committee has done a massive amount of work on pulling together all the information we received. We started out with the now international phrase "Nothing about us without us", and we looked at going out to people with disabilities and looking for the lived experience. Somebody said at a committee meeting recently that it is not the lived experience but the living experience and people living on a daily basis with disabilities. I thank the team who bring the information to us daily and support us in a way that can only be commended. We are lucky to have them. Today we are looking at the report entitled Ensuring Independent Living and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. When we were going through that process, we had various stakeholders in. The challenges faced and the issues of people with disabilities not being seen as full people in society cannot be overemphasised. We cannot overemphasise the frustration they feel every day. In their communities and families, those frustrations are met every day.  We came with the report, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The challenges we look at concerned the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, a landmark convention. It is a fantastic document but means nothing to society or to people with disabilities unless it is implemented. The United Nations has put a huge amount of work into it. Deputy Cairns joined me on a visit to the United Nations earlier this year. There was a huge amount of talk about what needs to be done. Let us be real about it. While we can talk about the UNCRPD and the implementation thereof, it is a worthless document unless states, including this State, stand up to meet the challenges head-on. This morning at the disability matters committee there was frustration among members about the ratification of the optional protocol. A key cornerstone for us is to have that protocol implemented. While the UNCRPD is implemented, the optional protocol is going through Departments. We get advice from different people in front of us but we do not see why there should be any delay in the ratification of the protocol. A key thing we need to do is to ensure it is ratified. We seek to ensure people with disabilities can enjoy the same human rights as everybody else by integrating people with disabilities into societies, communities and economies. There are various theories and Maslow's theory gives five stages of life and fulfilment, including safety, belonging and basic needs, but also esteem, love and fulfilment. If we take that for all citizens, particularly people with disabilities, as a guiding light, we can make huge change. The word "culture" has been used constantly at our committee.There is no question or doubt but that a huge cultural change is needed in order that society integrates completely people with disabilities. Whether they are integrated into the school, the workplace or society at large, society and the world are better places for it. We have a number of recommendations, and the members of the committee who are here will probably speak to a number of them. I will give just an overview of some of the recommendations and what we can do as a State and a Government. If we are to ask private citizens to do this, what can we do that will make a fundamental difference? There has to be a quota in the public and State services for people with disabilities to integrate them more and more into society and to make sure they are in the workplace. I always used to say that if we could have Leinster House in rural Ireland, we might have more pro-rural policies. If we had more people with disabilities in the public sector and involved in the decision-making processes, policy would be disability-proofed. We have discussed housing many a time at the Committee on Disability Matters. The building regulations refer to ramps and so on. Because we are talking about the rights of people with disabilities, it is hugely important we ensure they have a choice as to where they are to live. Where there is a quota for people with disabilities to work in the public sector, it will reflect society better and it will be easier. Such regulations should be in place. We speak in the report about it being time to move on from congregated settings and about Article 19 of the UNCRPD. Slow progress is ensured by heavy reliance on emergency residential placement processes, moving individuals from large to smaller settings without their having a choice as to where to live and placing younger people with disabilities in nursing homes. One of the stark realities we heard about when the evidence was brought before us was that of young people living in nursing homes because of their disability. That is simply no longer acceptable in the Ireland of 2022. There has to be an urgency to how we will deal with those issues. It must be absolutely soul-destroying not only for the individual with a disability but also for the family, the carers and the community who support him or her to see that happening. I could speak of two or three families and individuals I talk to daily or weekly. I know the heartache and the pain that is behind their daily smiles because they are trying to get the right settings for their loved ones to live in. They want to make sure those loved ones have the opportunity or the chance to live with dignity in a home of their choice or accommodation that is suitable for them. The committee has also called for the development of a national plan for the realisation of the right to independent living, including supports for agencies, and the reconfiguring of services to support that right. That must be undertaken in conjunction with an overarching policy framework to remedy the situation of people with disabilities aged under 65 who live in nursing homes. The committee also believes that people with disabilities living at home, many with elderly parents, can be left out when it comes to choosing and accessing independent living. Measures must be strengthened to access and to address that unmet need. On that point, many families of people who come from congregated settings bring loved ones or siblings or other family members into their own homes. When it comes to the adaptation grants or the various other grants available, all the income of the household is taken into account. That debars people from getting the basic grants for the individual because the house is not in their name or because of the household income. Two pensions and an occupational pension might be brought into account, and that is simply not right. We had the policy going back 20 years that the money follows the patient or the individual. That impediment in local authorities simply has to change. These are the small things we can change along the way to make sure people with a disability can live comfortably in their own homes or with family. It should be made possible for that impediment to be taken into account. I see the Minister of State nodding her head, and I welcome that, but is it possible to look at that and to see what we could do? When a person is coming from a congregated setting - he or she may have suffered an acquired brain injury - a huge change may need to be made to the house to accommodate him or her. Then, when State support is sought, it is simply not there. Again, I thank the members of the committee. Our Vice Chair, Deputy Tully, and Deputies Ellis and Cairns are here in the Chamber. I thank them for their dedication to the work they do every Thursday morning and the compassion and empathy they show on a cross-party basis. We do not divide in one way or the other on politics. We have a job to do. We have to implement the UNCRPD. We have to ensure that when our committee has finished its work, we will have made better the lives of people with disabilities and the families and communities who care for them. I pay tribute to the members of the committee for the way they work in unison to make sure we get the best possible outcome. I have a raft of other issues in respect of the report that I would like to raise. I recommend the report to the House. I would like to see some of the recommendations in it implemented as soon as is humanly possible.

I have apologised to the Acting Chair. I thank Deputy Michael Moynihan and all his team who sit on the Committee on Disability Matters and who meet, as he said, every Thursday morning for their continuous dedication, not just on this matter but on so many other issues on which the committee is shining a very important spotlight. This is an important conversation. The committee has assisted me in breaking down many barriers and creating awareness. I am greatly appreciative not only of Deputy Moynihan and all his team but also of the secretariat and the people who come before the committee. It is a huge effort for some people to participate in its meetings. That is greatly appreciated. It helps to shape policy and is not a wasted effort. The evidence is listened to. Sometimes we might feel that the pace of this is very slow, but the committee's time and effort are noted and appreciated. As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I am wholeheartedly committed to ensuring that people with disabilities are supported to live the lives they want to live and are provided with equal opportunity and every opportunity to do so. The report being discussed is extremely helpful in advancing that work. It is comprehensive and insightful. It will help to inform the Government's approach in developing and implementing policy. Ensuring independent living for people with disabilities is a whole-of-government priority, and many of my Cabinet colleagues also have responsibilities in working towards that goal. The report recognises that challenge, and it is important we embrace the challenge of meaningful integration and participation. So much of what the UNCRPD is designed to achieve is, at heart, the independence, dignity and inclusion of persons with disabilities. Currently, the primary means by which we advance the rights under the convention is through specific legislation and actions contained in Ireland's two overarching national disability policy frameworks: the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, and the comprehensive employment strategy, CES, for people with disabilities. The NDIS contains 120 actions to support effective progress in delivering on the obligations set out in the UNCRPD. The CES is the primary disability employment policy initiative in Ireland. We are all aware of the importance of employment to living independently, in respect of not only the financial contribution that work can provide but also the social and personal value that having a job brings and the sense of meaningful participation within wider society. The programme of work set out in both of these strategies provides for continuous work in advancing disability issues and rights under the UNCRPD. It is a great credit to the committee that there is more to say about this report than my speaking time allows. However, there are certain key issues and recommendations I wish to address in the time I have. One recommendation made in the report is the immediate ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Committee members will be aware the ratification of the optional protocol is a commitment in the programme for Government. The timeline for ratification was originally anticipated to follow the conclusion of Ireland's first review period before the UN committee. Due to delays at UN level, Ireland's appearance before the committee will now be delayed. Due to this delay, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and I have indicated we are open to the earlier ratification of the optional protocol. My Department is working to scope out the requirements for earlier ratification, and this work is required due to the long-standing position of the State on honouring international agreements. As a matter of foreign policy, Ireland does not enter binding treaties until it is sure the obligations set out within can be complied with. While I would like to be in a position to tell the House this evening there is an exact date for ratification, unfortunately I cannot, but rest assured, it is a priority for me to ensure the optional protocol is ratified at the earliest possible date. Another key recommendation set out in the committee's report relates to disability awareness. There are commitments concerning awareness-raising in both the NDIS and the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities, CES. Under the NDIS and CES, my Department has responsibility for certain actions relating to awareness-raising activities. Proposals for national campaigns are being developed under those actions, and I will be in a position to make further announcements on them in due course. The inclusion of people with disabilities in the policymaking process is of the utmost importance. I note and agree with the committee's recommendation that more needs to be done on that front, especially when it comes to disabled persons' organisations. In that regard, the Disability Participation and Consultation Network was established in 2020 with funding from my Department. It continues to be an important forum in which people with disabilities, including disabled persons' organisations, can become involved in consultations that inform the development of law and policy in Ireland. I note certain county councils around Ireland do not know what a disabled persons' organisation is. Therefore, we have a distance to travel to create awareness. I am aware of the need to review continually the effectiveness of the mechanism we use to engage with people with a disability. I welcome recent publications of both the committee and the National Disability Authority concerning the participation of people with a disability in this regard. I agree with the committee's assertion that people with disabilities have a right to independent living. They also need to be empowered to make independent decisions. In that regard, I am keenly aware of the importance and significance of the reform represented by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. The Act changes the existing law on capacity forms from the status approach of the wardship system to a flexible, functional approach whereby capacity is assessed on an issue- and time-specific basis. Under this legislation, persons' will and preferences will be presumed and respected. This will empower people to take control of the decisions that affect their everyday lives. This is a clear obligation under the UNCRPD, and it is also the strong position of the Government. As many Deputies here will know, amendments are required to the 2015 Act before full commencement can take place. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022 will streamline processes in the best interest of those using its provisions. It will also strengthen the safeguards included in the 2015 Act. It is also being used to advance other legislative measures on disability inclusion issues. This reform is much needed and long overdue, and the Government is committed to commencing the amended 2015 Act as soon as possible. I fully recognise the importance of personal assistance services to people who rely on them. I agree with the report's recommendation to expand the service. During my time as Minister of State, significant progress has been achieved. The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including personal assistance and home support services. These support individuals to maximise their capacity to live full and independent lives. The National Service Plan 2022 outlines the HSE's commitment to delivering 1.7 million hours of personal assistance services to 2,587 people and 3.12 million hours of home support services to 7,326 people this year. This reflects an additional 120,000 hours of personal assistance, which is the single biggest investment in personal assistance hours in several years. I also secured funding for an additional 30,000 hours of home support in 2022 to expand and enhance supports for people to live self-directed lives in their communities. On engaging on going to work, I will need to work with employers. I will be asking the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to support me in supporting people to make the transition with personal assistants. I note the report recommends the introduction of a personalised budget model for people with disabilities. This is an area under consideration within the Department of Health and the subject of an ongoing pilot to scope out how a system for personalised budgets might work in Ireland. The personalised budget pilot is open to adults with a disability who receive HSE-funded services, including appropriate school leavers. The latter should be allowed to choose what they wish. I recently announced an extension to the personalised budget pilot until the third quarter of 2023, with the accompanying evaluation process to be completed in the second quarter of 2024. This extension will facilitate suitable applicant participation and allow time for a robust evaluation to be completed. I have removed the age barrier that determined when a person could get involved. It is important that people can have a choice in their lives, regardless of whether they are above or below 65. Regarding the report's recommendations on housing, transport and social protection, I highlight that responsibility for these lies chiefly with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, respectively. However, I note work being led by the last Minister under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies. Under these frameworks, the Department of Social Protection has committed to developing and consulting on a straw man proposal for the restructuring of the long-term disability payments. I welcome that work and look forward to its outcome. The report on the cost of disability, published by the Department of Social Protection at the end of 2021, will also inform any changes made to how the State supports people with disabilities. I note the recommendations in the committee's report on housing. The programme for Government commits to ensuring there is an appropriate mix of housing design types provided, including universally designed units, and accommodation for older people and people with disabilities. The second joint National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022-2027 was launched by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, in co-ordination with my Department and the Department of Health on 14 January 2022. The new strategy sets out the vision for the co-operation and collaboration of Departments, State agencies and others in delivering housing and related supports for disabled people over the next five years. The purpose of the strategy is to enable disabled people to live independently in communities of their choosing, with integrated support services, which affords them appropriate choices and control over how they live and with whom they live. I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Moynihan that, where a person has a disability, regardless of whether he or she is being discharged from the National Rehabilitation Hospital or another hospital, and he or she wishes to be returned home, means testing should be removed. It is one of the biggest barriers to ensuring people can be returned home. Sometimes families have to put the money together before a person can return home. The grant of €30,000 for returning people to their homes is not enough. We need to increase it to what it used to be in years gone by, namely €50,000 or €60,000.I think it needs to be increased up to that level. Given the cost of extensions and the adaptations to which the Deputy refers, we must be far more agile and pragmatic in ensuring that we do not have long stayers in acute beds that take far longer to discharge because of the barriers of means and not enough funding for housing adaptations. This is something I have raised with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. I also welcome the fact he has almost sorted the funding to ensure that ceiling hoists would be put in place in conjunction with stair lifts. People will have a choice, as we will be able to support them to live at home rather than having a medical model whereby people must be in a nursing home because they do not have ceiling hoists at home. That is something on which the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has done a lot of work and I look forward to his announcements in the coming days. I welcome the committee's findings on transport for people with disabilities. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is fully committed to strengthening public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all. In line with the UNCRPD, the Minister for Transport and the agencies under his Department are progressively making public transport accessible, including in rural areas, by ensuring that new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start, and retrofitting older legacy infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible. This requires a "whole-journey approach" which refers to all elements that constitute a journey from the starting point to destination. It also means applying the principles of universal design. The Government recognises the fundamental importance of the right of people to independent living. I again welcome the committee's report in that regard. Important progress has been made in respect of this right and I want to be able to celebrate that. However, this journey is one of continuous advancement and it will take time. I will continue to advance measures to progress rights under the UNCRPD and I will also continue to drive forward the necessary reforms over the coming weeks and months. I look forward to working with the committee, going forward, in the delivery of some of the actions set out.

The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities obliges countries to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. The committee report calls for a policy response that provides for people with disabilities and their right to live independently in a place of their own choosing, with the freedom to choose and control their lives. Our pursuit of this objective as a State means a fundamental shift in what we have achieved to date. To begin with, it is unnerving to realise that Ireland was the last to ratify the convention, which we did in 2018, some 11 years after we signed it. The committee has noted that as the ratification of the optional protocol of the UNCRPD has not been undertaken, it means that people with disabilities are effectively unable to make a complaint when they feel that their rights under the convention have been breached. When I realised this, I was left speechless. Such a fundamental provision had been passed over. Let us imagine how that makes people feel. Let us imagine not being able to contribute to such a profound aspect of a convention that is designed to reinforce one's rights. Even the matter of consultation has left much to be desired. Through its engagement with disabled persons' organisations, the committee notes that a significant level of transformation is needed for people with disabilities to be placed meaningfully at the centre of the consultation process. Policies are discussed over the heads of those for whom the decisions are being made. This must stop and the situation must be addressed. The UNCRPD must be followed. There is need for rapid progress. It is shameful to see how people have been either overlooked or just passed over. Either way, it is shameful to realise this has been the case. Housing, for example, is a key challenge at the moment. The IHREC notes in its report that people with disabilities are twice as likely to report discrimination and inequality in accessing housing and more than 1.6 times more likely to live in poor conditions. People with disabilities are over represented in the homeless population with more than one in four homeless people being disabled. Access to housing is made even more problematic for people with disabilities, insofar as the system of applying for a house and independent living supports is complex and is characterised by a lack of transparency. There is little co-operation between local authorities and the HSE. Aside from the fact that people are being let down in such a dysfunctional system, it must shatter whatever faith people have in the system eventually meeting their needs when there is little co-operation between the HSE and the local authorities. Without this type of co-operation, how can people who are in need of specific housing types ever be sure that they are even being treated appropriately within the system? The committee notes that this has resulted in people with disabilities who are accepted onto the social housing list having to wait longer before receiving housing compared to other people. These factors, alongside the other issues, such as not having an equal choice on where to live or the overall matter of independence makes it obvious that there is a lot to do. I have only scratched the surface of what is a deeply insightful and detailed report. I will finish by referring to the definition the committee provides on disability-proofing. It is a strategy that aims to make sure that people with a disability and their specific needs are considered and included in the development and delivery of all projects, policies and practices from the earliest possible stage. This must be at the heart of the measures that we as a society and as legislators must implement without delay.
#HollyCairns	unknown-#HollyCairns-party	unknown-#HollyCairns-dob	unknown-#HollyCairns-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	422	Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is one of the sections of the convention cited most often. It calls for "the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others, and...[for] appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community,". These are all principles we agree with. However, as the work of the committee has made clear, this is a highly complex area and one on which we have such a long way to go. To enable people to exercise this right requires complex supports, suitable housing and interconnected physical and social facilities. The committee's report is only possible because of the individuals and groups who volunteer to share their experiences and insights with us. It is our role as public representatives to listen and to use this knowledge for better legislation and policy. I record my thanks to the secretariat, which does incredible work in the background, and made this report possible. I also thank the Chair, Deputy Michael Moynihan, and the Vice Chair, Deputy Tully. Housing stands out as the first main issue impacting independent living. The report notes several interconnected systemic problems: the chronic shortage of social housing; high and increasing rents; a lack of universal design, inadequate housing adaptation grants; and poor support services. Inclusion Ireland explained that one of the biggest barriers faced by people with intellectual disabilities in accessing accessible social housing is the lack of availability of the support services that are required for them to live in their own home. This results in people being made homeless, being kept in their childhood home despite their capacity to live independently as adults or being forced into institutional care. We know the HSE's plan, Time to Move On from Congregated Settings, is moving much too slowly. Most pressing is the more than 1,300 people under 65 forced to live in nursing homes because the State will not support them in community settings. There is a clear consensus on the need for universal design to be integrated into building regulations to make housing liveable for diverse needs and to future-proof our homes. The Irish Wheelchair Association outlined how Part M of the building regulations only requires housing to be visitable for a wheelchair, not liveable. Alison Harnett, chief executive of the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers points out that this is not only about housing specifically for people with disabilities, it is about having universally designed housing that is adaptable as people's needs change. It is about having housing that is usable for young parents with buggies, an elderly person who might have a walking mobility requirement and that is adaptable for people with disabilities. Inclusive design and policies benefit all of society. Design must also support non-visible needs. We heard about how people with autism should have homes that reflect their individual needs. There are other barriers, rarely highlighted, such as disabled people or those with chronic conditions being denied access to housing and mortgage protection insurance, making home ownership an impossibility. Intersectionality is also important to fully appreciate this situation. A committee meeting marking International Women's Day last year showed how disabled women are often doubly discriminated against.Maureen McGovern, a disability community activist, described struggling all her life "to live in a society that discriminates against me because of my impairment and gender, be it in education, training and employment, healthcare or in social, economic and cultural life." The UN highlights that girls and women of all ages with any form of disability are generally among the more vulnerable and marginalised of society. The National Women's Council of Ireland has noted that women with disabilities are more likely to experience violence, with 40% of disabled female students reporting having experienced rape, compared with 27% of non-disabled students. Responses to gender-based violence must appreciate this alarming situation. Disabled women also experience barriers to accessing health screening services, resulting in a lower uptake of breast and cervical cancer screening. These can range from physical barriers to a lack of proper information. The Department of Health and the HSE need to take tailored approaches to these issues. My final point relates to the significance of services for children. These services are especially important because they impact on an individual’s potential over his or her life. Delays in assessment, the lack of therapies and geographical lotteries are harmful to children's capacity to live independent lives. We need to have a frank and honest conversation about this. This week, we learned that more than 12,500 children with suspected disabilities are awaiting an assessment of need. This figure, provided by the Minister of State, amounts to 10,000 more than the HSE numbers. This is a scandalous situation. Children have the right to be seen by medical professionals and therapists in a timely manner and the right to education. The optional protocol of the UNCRPD has still not been ratified and we still do not have a date. As a committee, we must redouble our efforts to push for action on this. We need consistency of services, fully staffed children’s disability network teams and the State to fulfil its obligations. This report is not the end of the process; it is a catalogue of the improvements and changes that are needed. It is up to the Government and the State to make these changes to provide these services and supports as soon as possible.
#PaulineTully	unknown-#PaulineTully-party	unknown-#PaulineTully-dob	unknown-#PaulineTully-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	423	I welcome the motion on the report. I commend all the disabled people and the DPO representatives who appeared before us as witnesses and shared their lived or living experiences, because without that we would not have been able to compile the report. I also commend the Chair, Deputy Michael Moynihan, all the members of the committee and the secretariat because, again, without them, the report would not have been possible. The report goes to the heart of the struggle for disability rights and the equality agenda for disabled people. The ratification of the UNCRPD was a milestone for the rights of persons with disabilities, but without the ratification of the optional protocol, disabled people have little recourse when their rights are denied. As Markus Schäfers, a member of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has stated, the non-ratification of the optional protocol suggests Ireland is not confident or comfortable enough to open itself up to international scrutiny. Nothing is preventing the optional protocol from being ratified today and there should be no more excuses. It needs to be ratified without further delay because if we wait until we feel as though we can deliver everything it contains, it will never be ratified. Without ratification, the rights of persons with disabilities are being denied, not least in respect of ensuring the right to independent living. The right to independent living is a crucial battle that people with disabilities are, unfortunately, having to fight. The ability to choose where and with whom to live and the ability to have privacy or to invite over friends and families are things most of us take for granted but that disabled people cannot. The medical model of disability, which seems to be still embedded within the Government's mindset and actions, must be assigned to the past. Investment in a training and development fund for disabled persons organisations to enable them to strengthen their ability to participate fully in consultation and cover the expenses they incur by taking part in these consultations is vital, and is an obligation under the UNCRPD. We need DPOs to consult the various bodies. There is also a need to transfer, without delay, people from congregated settings into community settings with the appropriate supports. The target set down for the time to move on from congregated settings has long been missed, so we need a significant level of investment, with that investment to continue year on year until everybody has moved out of congregated settings, and I do not mean just from a larger to a smaller setting. That is not what most people want. They want independent living in their community.  Similarly, disabled people have been inappropriately placed in nursing homes. That practice is continuing and it should not be. Again, they need the proper supports. As a committee, we urge the Government to review Part M of the planning and building control regulations to ensure that both public and private housing stock will be not only visitable but also habitable by persons with disabilities, including wheelchair users. The Government's national retrofit scheme is inequitable given that, currently, the same level of grant support for a deep retrofit is available for someone on the minimum wage as that which is available to a millionaire. People with a chronic illness or disability are more than twice as likely to be at risk of poverty as other adults and about twice as likely to experience basic deprivation and consistent poverty. There is a need to overhaul the national retrofit plan to ensure the resources are rapidly deployed and targeted at those living in energy poverty and in the greatest need of energy efficiency upgrades. Ensuring independent living for persons with disabilities cannot begin without tackling the consistent poverty that is the experience of many disabled people. The Indecon report places this cost at anywhere between €8,700 and €12,300 per annum, but that is an average range and the figure could be even higher for some people. There needs to be a significant commitment to addressing this. The personal assistance service the Minister of State mentioned is an essential tool to enable disabled people to live independently, and I welcome the increase in the number of hours provided. Many applicants have told me they have either been refused or given hours insufficient to make a difference. Disabled people who have a personal assistant have told me about the huge difference the service makes to their lives, allowing them to live. The Minister of State also mentioned transport, one of the key services that help persons with disabilities to participate in everyday life, obtain employment or engage in education. The motorised transport grant and the mobility allowance were stopped in 2013 because they were found to be inequitable. Instead of us addressing the issues, however, they were closed completely and not replaced, but they need to be replaced. Some people are in receipt of the mobility allowance while others are not, and that is not equitable whatsoever. The only scheme at the moment is the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme and most people do not even qualify for that. The conditions are stringent and there is no appeals board for those who have been turned down and want to appeal the decision. We need to see progress on transport to ensure both public and private transport will be accessible. On the costs of disability in the context of the cost-of-living crisis, it was brought to my attention that persons in receipt of the disability payment for social protection who have taken up a training course and been transferred to a training allowance for the duration of the course will not be entitled to the €500 cost-of-living lump sum payment they would have got if they had remained on the disability payment. My party colleague Deputy Kerrane submitted a parliamentary question on this to the Minister for Social Protection, who confirmed it is true, and I do not think that is fair. Seven of ten people on one training course left the course today because they want to receive the payment, and they had been advised by their local social welfare office to do so to get the payment. This is sending a very bad message to the disability community. Disability does not just disappear because a person takes up a training course, and the cost of living and the poverty experienced by disabled people do not vanish if someone joins a training course. This does not fit into a rights-based model of disability. In fact, some older people have told me they have a disability and receive a pension but they are not getting the €500 either. They have asked whether their disability disappears when they turn 66. Perhaps the Minister of State will speak to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the issue because it is very important and we are sending the wrong message to disabled people. It is encouraging people to leave training courses, but it is so important that we get people back into employment.

I hope that Government takes note of the recommendations and implements them to help improve the lives of those with disabilities who face many struggles and barriers every day of their lives. We have in our society a situation that is all too common whereby individuals with disabilities lack the freedom to choose both who they live with and where they can reside. The options that are available to those with disabilities may include some that are often less attractive and more restrictive such as confinement in an institutional setting or facility, which often leads to a lower quality of life. For too long, there has been a lack of focus in seeking to optimise supports for the individual in his or her home, or somewhere less restrictive than those currently being offered or available. We need to give those with disabilities the opportunity to have the same choices as everyone else. We need to give people with disabilities control over their own lives. They need to be able to make choices on an equal basis as those without a disability and be free to aspire towards those goals those of us who are not disabled often take for granted. Disabled people should have access to and be able to make choices in education, employment, housing, transport etc. The statistics for those having access to any of the above are depressing. I will give the Minister of State some examples. Figures based on the 2016 census show that one in seven people have a disability, which is more than 640,000 people. One half of those with a disability are in the labour force compared with 82.3% of people without a disability. Figures also show that this applies irrespective of whether a person is male or female if he or she has a disability. Only one in six people with an intellectual disability is in employment. Additionally, six out of ten people with such a disability are unable to work because of their disability, which leaves a large number of people who could work if suitable employment opportunities existed for them. The simple truth is that people with a disability in the labour force are less likely to be employed and more likely to be unemployed than people without a disability. In education, 13% of people with a disability have a degree or higher qualification as opposed to 25% of people without a disability. These are some important examples that illustrate the barriers those with disabilities must face. With regard to independent living, it has been shown that there are clear advantages for the individual and the health service in general in eliminating barriers to independent living for those with disabilities. Independent living gives people greater choice when they live in their own homes. It has been recognised as an important factor in helping people with disabilities lead independent and fulfilling lives. A recommendation from this report expressly asks that projects funded under the national development plan be compelled to use the principles of universal design. This recommendation would certainly align with Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, which aims to place people with disabilities on an equal basis with others in choosing their place of residence. The report also recommends that the right to independent living be enshrined in law. This is a sensible recommendation, particularly in terms of the benefits for an individual's well-being but also in practical terms, as independent and semi-independent settings are shown to have lower costs. The report highlights inherent difficulties in the process of decongregation involving moving disabled people from congregated settings to homes in the community. While such a move is aligned with the ideals of the CRPD, there is too much reliance on the emergency residential placement process without proper consultation or input from the disabled individual. For this to be successful, a number of things need to be done, including a requirement for agencies to reconfigure their services and a restructured policy framework that excludes the placing of people aged under 65 with disabilities in nursing homes. Having all the supports in place, particularly at local level, is crucial for a successful strategy enabling independent living. Without proper supports and a plan in place, an individual will find it difficult to transition to independent living. We have an obligation to ensure that each citizen has the same choices and opportunities as everyone else. This excellent report provides a pathway for Government to ensure that those in society who are disabled no longer face barriers that prevent them from making choices on an equal basis as those who are not disabled. We need to ensure that the sort of situation where a young child with a disability is excluded from her class never happens again. No person with a disability should be isolated, discriminated against or excluded in any circumstances.

As has been said, the right to independent living is at the core of so much of what the UNCRPD is about. It represents no less than what people with disabilities in this country are entitled to and expect from Irish society. As I outlined, a huge amount of work is ongoing across government to ensure that people with disabilities are facilitated in a real and meaningful way to live independent lives. They have a right to do that in an equal manner to their friends and families who do not have a disability. I am working to realise that right further. That cross-government work is co-ordinated through our national disability strategies. It stretches across a programme of legislative reform, most importantly through the work that is under way to bring the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to fruition. I also welcome the announcement from the Minister, Deputy Foley, and Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, about transition planning in secondary schools. A pilot is being put in place, which is really important. It is hard to believe that in 2022, we are now talking about transition planning, which is where the young person has the right to choose, no different to his or her peers, how he or she would like to engage or participate in his or her next level of education. It is really welcome that we are now involving young people who have a disability in the choice. They have the will and preference to ensure they can choose where they would like to have their third-level education, how they would like to see it and whether they wish to participate in day services and have their voices heard. I welcome the announcement this evening. It is part of a comprehensive employment piece so that we can skill people up. That is so important. This stretches across a programme of work to improve continuously the delivery of our disability services. This work will improve services in an explicitly rights-based manner and build upon progress to date. Over the coming period, we will see more work completed in recalibrating support bands in the Department of Social Protection. We will see the implementation of a housing strategy for disabled people and the expanding accessibility of our public transport system. I totally agree with what Deputy Ellis said about universal design, about which there is such a lack of knowledge. When we talk about universal design, everybody thinks we are just talking about housing. It is our built environment as well. So many planners do not understand what UDA+ or UDA++ is or about the different size of wheelchairs. Universal design is not all about a person in a wheelchair. It can be a person who is visually impaired or who is deaf. It can be the lady who got her hip done recently and who finds it hard to go from one footpath to another or a tactile pad for a blind person that is not in the right space. While I welcome all the funding that is coming from the various Departments with regard to active travel, we need to ensure that universal design means the existing built environment is incorporated properly into the new building that is going on, whether that is a new footpath, bus stand or bus shelter.There is that expectation if someone is visually impaired they do not realise if they are going off the new paths or the old paths. It has to be universally incorporated throughout. Some of that does not happen but it needs to happen in a big way.  I also know that there is much work still to do but I cannot lose sight of the progress and momentum to date. I want to build on that momentum and push the progress. I thank my colleagues in the various Departments where I do push the concept of universal design, whether it be in respect of housing, the local authorities or transport. They are listening. They participate in the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS. They understand. With the assistance of the committee, that awareness and expectation has been brought to a new level. That is what UNCRPD is about, ensuring the person is at the centre no matter what Department or state agency is involved. There is a lot of work yet to be done in creating that awareness and in ensuring it spills all the way down. There has a be a bottom-up and top-down approach to ensure that the person continues to be at the centre.

They are more than welcome to a somewhat depleted membership of the House at this stage of the evening. We welcome them warmly and hope they have a very satisfactory and fulfilling visit.

I thank the Members for their contribution to the debate. Deputy Martin Browne spoke about the overlooked or "passed over". It is a very good way to look at it, a very simple phrase that people are being overlooked or passed over. The Deputy put it very well. Deputy Cairns spoke about Article 19 which we have explored many times. It is a significant issue. Our Vice Chair, Deputy Tully, spoke about the medical model. That is at the very heart of how we proceed. We have looked at the medical model of care for people with disabilities. A lot of care for disability developed out of community initiatives going back 50 years to the mid-1960s when community groups came together. I think the social model has to be embraced in a whole variety of ways if we are to provide for independent living. There are many initiatives for integrating people with disabilities. They can be integrated more into the fabric of society everywhere, whether in urban or rural Ireland. They can be integrated. We should embrace the social model in a major way. Some practitioners throughout the country are still talking about the medical model as if it is a question of providing the care and shelter. I spoke earlier about Maslow's theory. If we provide the care, shelter and basic food and water, that is only part of the pyramid. There are three other parts, the belonging, love and fulfilment. Deputy Tully's remarks about the medical model are something we have to continue to reflect upon. Deputy Ellis made the point that Government needs to take note of the report. We are not providing the report just to be debated here in the Dáil this afternoon or to be debated at all. We need action on it. We have listened to the practitioners, the people with disabilities, their families, carers and communities. They have poured out their evidence to us. We need to ensure that we are listening to them. On the various issues in respect of adaptability and house adaptability we have to take note of the report. That is what we are about. I constantly say that we need to keep the drum banging. Maybe we have to start banging the whole percussion section now as well because the drum seems to be silenced and we need to get more on it.  The primary medical certificate needs to be looked at. We are 12 months in from when commitments were given in the House in respect of the appeals board and with the resignation of the appeals board, it is almost 12 months up and nothing has happened. It gives out an awful bad signal for people who have gone through the process, which is cumbersome enough. We need to have action on that. We also need to have action to ensure that whatever changes are made through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or through the Department with responsibility for disabilities make it more accessible for people to live independently and that we are encouraging more people to do so.  I thank the people with disabilities and their representative organisations for the work they do throughout the year in lobbying and looking at and developing policy. They bring to us the issues that affect their daily lives. I know that I speak for all members of the committee in saying that we truly value their lived experiences. We truly value the way they have highlighted living with disabilities and how they navigate the constant problems and through the innovations they find to try to live a better life. We listen to that every Thursday morning and we truly value it. Ireland has started on the UNCRPD implementation but it is vitally important that this process is not about putting more regulation, paper or policy within Departments. It must be about action. We will only be judged on the implementation of the UNCRPD insofar as we have implemented it and can say that the people with disabilities have got more freedoms to live, more autonomy and opportunities and that they have as many opportunities as the rest of society. It is deeply important that the public sector inclusion objective be put in place as a matter of urgency, which is for public authorities to act with the objective of meeting Article 19. We have more work to do here, also, to make the Houses of the Oireachtas themselves fully accessible for people with disabilities in every aspect and to ensure that anybody who comes into the Houses of the Oireachtas can access any part of them no matter what their disability is. We also have to be mindful, as the Minister of State said in her remarks, that there are so many disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities. It is not just about people with a wheelchair. All of that has to be factored in.  I am deeply privileged to lead this committee. It is a fantastic committee. The work rate, compassion and objectivity of people on the committee are truly inspiring. We will only be judged on whether we have influenced policy enough to make it better for people with disabilities, their families, their communities and their carers. I never got the opportunity to say this on the floor of the Dáil, but at the very start of it two years ago we went out looking for public submissions before we set our terms of reference. We were one of the first committees to do that. We were inundated with community groups and individuals and their living experience. They poured out their hearts to us in putting their documentation in front of us. They described their lives and pared it back to the bare necessities and bare challenges that they have. They put it all on paper and allowed us to have that to form the terms of reference of our committee. We are duty-bound to make sure that we keep those people at the heart of our discussions every Thursday morning and ensure that any reports that we have see implementation.  I commend the Minister of State on the work she does in the Department. I know she is fighting a battle because there are massive challenges on a daily basis. People with disabilities make up a fair segment of society and they need the same recognition as everybody else. I ask Dáil Éireann to accept the report of the committee.
