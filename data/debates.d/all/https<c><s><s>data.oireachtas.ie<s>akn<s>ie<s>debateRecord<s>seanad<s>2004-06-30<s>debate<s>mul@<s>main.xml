          <p eId="para_10">Does the Deputy Leader agree that the GAA should be commended on the report it published yesterday? The report produced many recommendations concerning the role of alcohol in sport. The GAA is the first major sporting body to have produced such a report and it is welcome. While it is easy to blame alcohol sponsorship for all our woes, including the number of teenage drinkers and the level of consumption of alcohol among young people, it must be recognised that sponsorship by small public houses and drinks companies is the financial backbone of many teams, particularly the county teams. Before we go down the road of banning such sponsorship, we should consider this issue carefully. Organisations depend on independent funding and sponsorship deals from companies such as these. It is important——</p>

          <p eId="para_13">When will the Government provide an opportunity for the House to debate the latest report from the ESRI, which casts a long shadow over the next benchmarking deal? When will we see publication of the very first deal, which originally justified the benchmarking awards? It has been tucked away in a corner and now is the time for it to be published. Most importantly, however, the ESRI showed in its report that if moneys are available for tax cuts, they should be directed towards the indexation of the tax bands. A quarter of all taxpayers paid tax at the top rate two years ago, but now a third of all taxpayers pay at the top rate. If we are to do something positive in the area of tax reform, at the very least, there should be proper indexation of the tax bands in the next budget. This issue was not addressed in the last two budgets. Will the Deputy Leader provide time during the next week for a debate on the ESRI report and related issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_14">The thing to remember about benchmarking is that it was such a success that we are now talking about benchmarking mark II. It is a bit like New York: "so good we named it twice". We might do it many more times.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The matter I want to raise has nothing to do with drinks sponsorship, although it is related to the issue of sponsorship in general. We had a discussion last night on the dormant accounts fund, which I will not reopen. There is currently a major debate taking place about sponsorship in education, including the sponsorship of schools, sporting events for young children, computers etc. Much criticism is focused on schools for seeking sponsorship from McDonald's, Coca Cola and other groups. It is time we took a stand on behalf of parents, communities, staff and principals. This is not a matter of choice for them. They are trying to provide a service and are being forced to take decisions they do not like. It is wrong to blame school communities and educational institutions for accepting sponsorship when the Government has left a gap to be filled. We should be very careful about criticising them.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">On No. 1 in today's Order of Business, I reluctantly agreed yesterday to not having a debate on it until it came back from the committee. Over the past 12 years I have time and again raised in this House the issue of the approval and recognition of local abattoirs, which would facilitate traceability. My colleague, Senator Quinn, also has views on that issue. He and I have discussed this in the House on many occasions. It is not good enough that we are told there are technical difficulties. That proves there should be debate. We all know local butchers who cannot kill their own meat. We have seen the European Union spend €1 billion on the traceability of beef and the costs imposed on retailers and supermarkets in trying to ensure traceability. This is a very important step. It also deals with the issue of the cost to the consumer. I would like a debate, however brief, or even an explanation from the Department of where we are going on this. I feel very uneasy about taking this without debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Recently I was critical of the Fianna Fáil Party for not dealing with issues before they became public. On this occasion I must eat my words. I am delighted that members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party have taken a strong line on the Aer Rianta Bill. I agree with them. There is no rush with this legislation, which was originally intended to make provision for the production of business plans and finished by providing for a group sitting around the table in Dublin to tell the management in Shannon or Cork how to do its business. That legislation is daft and is going nowhere. We should take our time until we get it right. There is no rush to get this through during this session. I hope we will not see it on the Order of Business until it has been put into proper and acceptable shape. We can deal with it in the autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">Yesterday in Istanbul, the President of the United States, for the second time in two days, attempted to interfere with the internal business of the European Union by telling us who should be a member of the European Union. I therefore propose tabling a motion in the House calling for the granting of statehood to the District of Columbia, which is the last colony of the United States whose citizens have no Senators or members of Congress and who have no rights to representation even though they pay taxation. It is grossly impertinent of the United States to tell the European Union how to do its business when it does not allow democracy within its own shores. I propose this House should, at an early date, discuss the deprivation of democratic rights from the citizens of Columbia. The United States should put its own house in order before lecturing the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Could we, at some stage, have a discussion in this House on fraud and the seriousness of using somebody else's signature as a way of persuading people to take any action, whether it be to sell goods, to buy goods or to vote for people? It is a criminal offence. If large sections of our political system do not understand that it requires more than an apology to make up for a criminal offence, perhaps we seriously need a debate to clarify the ethics and the impropriety of fraud.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I always have shivers when I hear we are not to have a debate on an issue. I have a real concern regarding the Abattoirs Act. I do not quite understand how we can deal with the Abattoirs Act 1988 (Abattoirs Licences)(Transfer of Functions) Regulations 2004 without debate. The health of our nation depends on the traceability of the food products we eat. This is so important an issue that we must ensure we do not merely hand responsibility for it over to somebody else. I am not sure what happened yesterday or why this order has been rescinded. Clearly there was a mix-up somewhere. We should ensure we do not too readily accept that an issue as important as this will be dealt with without debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I wish to raise the announcement during the week that the interconnector plans are set to be abandoned. Ireland's electricity costs are 10% to 20% more expensive than in the UK. Plans to build a €400 million interconnector have had to be abandoned. I am not sure why the Commission for Energy Regulation has done so, but it is something we should not allow to pass. It was only in February that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, announced this. That it is abandoned within months of that announcement when it had such clear benefit to Ireland should not be allowed to pass without thought.</p>

It also claimed that this country would be more appropriately served and could environmentally sustain a 250 kg. limit. This is vitally important. The Minister for Agriculture and Food should address this as a matter of urgency and should go back to Brussels to make the strongest possible case to have the limit increased to 250 kg, as Teagasc have at long last produced sound scientific evidence to sustain such a case.</p>

I say this because I think the GAA has changed its rhetoric without changing its behaviour. There is something anomalous when any sporting organisation that does great work for communities has to rely for funding on bar takings and so on. There has to be some means found of raising finance.

It is failing to deliver on all aspects of the projects under its control. Half of the projects will not be completed within the timeframe of 2006. The national development plan estimated that it would cost €7.6 billion, yet the current cost stands at €16.5 billion. One project near this House, the final stage of the M50, is 288% above budget. The Houses of the Oireachtas created the tribunals of inquiry and we now have to look into them to find out where they are going. The tribunals have generated millionaires from the legal profession. Under the auspices of the NRA, consultants are becoming the new millionaires, parallel to what is happening with the tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I am worried that many infrastructure projects, particularly those outside the Pale, will be delayed still further as a result of the total failure of the NRA to deliver. The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the lack of expertise of those in charge of the NRA. I appreciate that we do not have control of the NRA. We have created a monster that is now running wild. While the NRA is delivering some projects, none of them is on time, none of them is within cost and something has to be done.</p>

It is heartening to see that a four year project has come on stream only two months behind schedule. That is a great credit to those involved with it.

There is a serious internal problem among the Government parties, touched on by Senator Coghlan when he called for a debate on Aer Rianta. There is a serious issue here and the Taoiseach should attend the House for the debate. It is widely suspected that there are people acting for other members of the Government who are briefing against the Minister for Finance in an attempt to have him removed and sent to Europe. That would be a very serious issue for the economy, not just because Fianna Fáil backbenchers are screaming about wanting to spend money prematurely on such matters as benchmarking, as became known today, but also because the eyes of foreign investors are currently on events in the Government. Particularly in view of what has happened in the European Union in the last few weeks, attempts to remove Deputy McCreevy by weak-kneed backbenchers or people above him will have an adverse effect on foreign investment and we may not have so much money to spend in the years ahead if Fianna Fáil continues to behave in this way.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">Perhaps the Leader might arrange a debate before the House rises next week on the report of the Oireachtas joint committee on the Barron inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. I understand there may be a debate in the other House and, given the report was issued about three months ago, it is appropriate to have a similar debate here. It is incongruous that, in the debate on the Iraqi situation, people purport to fight terrorism in one corner of the world but in another will not co-operate fully with investigations into serious allegations of their forces colluding in heinous atrocities committed in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I fully support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on the report of the ESRI. On the matter of taxation, which has been mentioned by him, it is very appropriate and timely that we have such a report now. I join with other speakers who acknowledge and recognise that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, given the very significant and far-reaching changes he has made to the entire taxation structure over the last few years, has made a very significant contribution to the development of the economy and that has been a very important foundation stone for the success we have enjoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">I also support Senator Maurice Hayes in his request for a debate on value for money in the public services. We should not confine it to the capital programme, though that is an important part. Current expenditure is also important, and it is absolutely essential we get better value for money than we are achieving across many sectors of the public service.</p>

How can it get it so wrong, with €9 billion in overruns? It is absolutely disgraceful. We need value for money, as has been stated by speakers on the other side of the House on several issues. In this area, however, we need an explanation from the Minister and I call on him to attend the House, if he knows where it is having been absent from it for the last few years.</p>

It is timely, with our American colleagues here, to remember there was no discourtesy towards the President and that it was a normal journalistic endeavour by an excellent journalist working in this country.

Now that the dust has settled and, as must be acknowledged, our Taoiseach has carried out a very successful job in Europe and got his man elected to the Commission, the onus is on us as legislators, and it is our responsibility to have a serious debate on Northern Ireland in the autumn. That debate should not specifically concern the ongoing political problems there but the cross-Border opportunities towards which we can work. Many people in Northern Ireland feel they are not being represented. The members of the legislative authority in Stormont are not operating, and they feel left out. Perhaps I might give one example. The Derry to Coleraine railway line will close if we do not have a serious debate with our partners in Northern Ireland and put pressure on them. There is no point in us, on one side of the Border, talking about a railway line from Derry to Letterkenny if they are going to close the line from Coleraine to Derry. Some 100 people will lose their jobs. A greater onus is on us to do that as legislators. We should have a serious debate, and Senator Maurice Hayes as the lone representative of the Six Counties will be on my side too.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">Senators Brian Hayes, Ó Murchú, Ormonde, Maurice Hayes and Leyden raised the GAA report into alcohol and questions concerning sponsorship by firms promoting alcohol. I take the point made about small clubs and the degree to which they might rely on local licensed premises or hostelries in their activities. It is a very difficult issue. We are obviously all concerned by alcohol abuse in society. The sporting organisations have a role to play, and the GAA, as the principal such organisation, has a dominant role. The extent to which sponsorship influences consumption is questionable. The GAA is grappling with this difficult issue. The call for a wider debate by Senator Leyden is appropriate, and perhaps we should return to it in the autumn. We have debated it before with regard to young people, and I share Senator Maurice Hayes's view regarding the difference between rhetoric and behaviour, which is very evident and perhaps something we should examine.</p>

It is important, however, that we should have another debate on the National Roads Authority and these matters are appropriate for discussion in the House. On the point raised about consultants, any of us who were members of local authorities are aware of the degree to which consultants are increasingly being employed.

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_139">I am pleased to introduce the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003 to Seanad Éireann. The Bill has been amended in Dáil Éireann and I will draw Senators' attention to these amendments when I describe the Bill in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The Bill is an important step in the reform of the public service. Our public service has a major role to play in the economic and social life of the country. To fulfil that role effectively requires that a modern and flexible recruitment system be put in place. The systems which will be established on the enactment of the Bill are essential to the wider modernisation programme set out in the strategic management initiative and in Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The human resources management working group, a cross-departmental body established under the SMI, recommended to the Government that the structures governing the recruitment of civil servants should be reformed. In particular, it was considered that there should be an option for public service bodies to recruit directly from the labour market. Currently, the Civil Service and the Garda Síochána are required to recruit through the Civil Service commissioners. Innovations in the management of public service organisations will be enhanced if the recruitment system works in support of those changes. The measures in the Bill introduce a significant new element of flexibility into the recruitment system. As a direct consequence of this Bill, public service organisations will be able to recruit the staff they need, when and where they are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The measures will also ensure that the best people are recruited by requiring that best human resources and recruitment practices will be observed at all times. The institutional arrangements contained in the Bill are specifically designed to ensure that recruitment procedures are in line with best practice and will remain so as this evolves. The measures in the Bill are part of the strategic approach to the management of human resources in the Civil Service and in the other public service organisations to which it will apply. The Bill is not an isolated initiative and it must be seen in the broad context of public service reform. It is a significant element of the programme of public service modernisation which was agreed with the public service unions in Sustaining Progress. The public service unions were fully consulted about these measures and they agreed to the introduction of the Bill in Sustaining Progress. The changes being introduced are another sign that the benchmarking agreement implemented in Sustaining Progress has produced real, practical changes in the way the public service operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission and its staff have performed an important role over the years. The efficiency and probity with which the commissioners have carried out their work has been a major factor in creating civil and public services which has allowed the State to develop and prosper. There have been many examples abroad where public confidence in the institutions of Government was undermined in part because of a failure to maintain the probity of the public appointments system. It is to the credit of the commissioners that this did not happen in Ireland and, moreover, that there has never been even the slightest suspicion that the system could be compromised. This is a major achievement and it is right to acknowledge it as the torch passes to the Commission for Public Service Appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">It is essential that all institutions adapt and change to take account of the new challenges facing them. We know that the LAC was established at a time when the public service was smaller and was expected to deal with a much narrower range of functions. As society has evolved, the roles and functions of the civil and public services have also evolved. In recent years, the commission has been actively restructuring and refocusing its resources to ensure that it is best placed to provide a modern and expanded recruitment service to all its clients in the public service. In addition, it has been providing a range of services outside its traditional, more restricted remit. This Bill will enhance and accelerate this programme of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The evolution of the civil and public services demands that we change the way we manage our human resources in the Civil Service. It means giving Secretaries General and Departments the ability to manage their areas of responsibility more effectively, while maintaining the high standards of probity and the levels of expertise established by the Civil Service commissioners. In recent years, it became clear that the public appointments system needed greater levels of flexibility to meet modern labour market conditions. On occasion, the Civil Service found it difficult to recruit the staff it needed because of labour market pressures. It is imperative that the public service is best positioned to exploit whatever flexibilities are required in the recruitment environment. We must ensure that the new recruitment processes presented here will ensure maximum efficiency and eliminate any scope for bottlenecks. No organisation can allow itself to be put in the position of being unable to recruit, in a timely fashion, the staff it needs to carry out its work. The reforms proposed in the Bill are designed to modernise the recruitment system by allowing public service bodies to recruit directly and quickly under a licensing system which will guarantee good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The point has been made that the independence and probity of recruitment to the public service must be safeguarded at all costs. I know from personal experience, and as a public representative, that it is widely accepted that an application for a post in the civil or public services will be treated in a fair and impartial manner. In Ireland, people have confidence that, following the selection process, the best people are appointed to jobs. In any reform of the recruitment system, it is essential that the public trust established by the Civil Service commissioners over the years is maintained. The Government is determined to make certain that this public confidence in the probity of the system will not be undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">As I outline the details of the Bill, I ask Senators to bear in mind that many, if not all, of the new institutional arrangements have been designed to ensure that this key public value of probity is preserved. At present, recruitment to the Civil Service and the Garda Síochána is carried out by the Civil Service commissioners. Recruitment to senior posts in the local authorities and the health boards is carried out by the Local Appointments Commission. The Bill will repeal the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956 and amend the legislation relating to the Local Appointments Commission. The Bill proposes to create two new bodies, the Commission for Public Service Appointments and the Public Appointments Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The Commission for Public Service Appointments will become the principal regulator for public service recruitment. The commission will set standards for recruitment to the Civil Service and the public service and will monitor compliance with those standards. While initially the commission will broadly oversee the same range of recruitment as the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, it is intended that provisions to extend its remit to cover the full range of public service recruitment will be implemented in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">In accordance with the policy of devolution of authority, public service bodies regulated by the commission will be allowed to undertake their own recruitment. This is a departure from the current system. It will be a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the Secretary General of each Department to decide whether to avail of the opportunity to apply for a licence to recruit. If they decide to apply for licences, they will be able to recruit directly from the labour market without the requirement to use the centralised recruitment agency as an intermediary while following the standards laid down by the commission. However, the option of using the services of the centralised agency will continue to be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The Commission for Public Service Appointments will licence public service bodies to recruit, according to clear codes of practice, on its own behalf, or with the assistance of private sector recruitment agencies specifically approved by the commission. The commission will have the authority to alter or to revoke a licence, or to issue directions to a licence holder. These arrangements are designed to maintain the probity of the recruitment process. The Bill also provides for the establishment of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, as the centralised recruitment body for the public service. The professionalism and expertise in public sector recruitment that has been developed within the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners will now reside within the PAS. This body will continue to play a critical and vital role in the future of public sector recruitment and in the future development of HRM across the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The Bill is arranged in eight Parts and there are two Schedules. Part 1 provides for the dissolution of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. It also allows the Minister for Finance to appoint a day on which the Commission for Public Service Appointments and the Public Appointments Service will come into being and determines which public service appointments are covered by the legislation. The Department of Finance and the Civil Service Commission are meeting to plan the establishment of the new bodies. In order to establish the new bodies, the financial and staffing resources currently allocated to the Civil Service Commission will be divided appropriately. A director will be appointed to head the Office of the Commission and an adequate number of staff of the Civil Service Commission will be seconded to the Commission for Public Service Appointments to set that body on a firm foundation, although the commission may opt to appoint its own staff in the long term. The remainder of the staff of the Civil Service Commission will be transferred to the Public Appointments Service. It is intended that arrangements will be put in place to allow the Minister for Finance to establish the new bodies shortly after the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">On establishment day, appointments to the Garda Síochána, to most positions in the Civil Service and to certain managerial, professional and technical posts in local authorities, health boards and vocational education committees will be covered. Section 6 permits the Minister for Finance to make orders which will extend the application of the Bill beyond these appointments. However, certain appointments are excluded from the scope of the legislation and the Minister cannot make an order bringing them within the remit of the Bill. These include appointments made by the Government or President, appointments to posts established under the Constitution and the appointment of special advisers. A number of other appointments are excluded but the Minister may make orders bringing them within the remit of the Bill. It is the Minister's intention to ensure that in time the overwhelming majority of public service posts will be subject to the system of regulation established by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">There have been comments that the Government was using this Bill to gain power to appoint its advisers to permanent and pensionable posts in the Civil Service. I assure Members that this allegation is utterly without foundation. To put the matter beyond doubt, the Bill was amended in the Dáil to exclude the appointment of special advisers from the scope of the legislation. The effect of the amendment to section 7 is to ensure that special advisers cannot be appointed by Ministers, or by Government, to established positions in the Civil Service unless there are further amendments to this Bill and to the Ethics in Public Office Act. That Act requires that advisers lose office at the same time as the Ministers they serve. Taken together, these measures ensure that special advisers will continue to leave the Civil Service at the same time as their Ministers leave office.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I have already outlined the main provisions relating to the Commission for Public Service Appointments as set out in Part 2 of the Bill. The Bill was amended to provide that the Commission will be composed of five <i>ex officio</i> members, namely the Ceann Comhairle, the Secretary General to the Government, the Secretary General, Public Service Management and Development in the Department of Finance, the Chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Section 12, as initiated, provided that only three members of the commission would be commissioners <i>ex officio</i>. It also provided that up to six other commissioners may be appointed by Government. To lay to rest any concern that the power of appointment to the commission might be open to question, section 12 was amended to add two more <i>ex officio</i> members and to delete the Government’s power to appoint members to the commission. Consequently, the commission will be composed entirely of <i>ex officio</i> members and the Government will be unable to appoint additional members. These measures are intended to place the commission on the most secure footing and to dissolve any suspicion that any influence may be brought to bear on the appointment of the commission. I suggest to Senators that this is the clearest indication of the Government’s commitment to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in public service recruitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The Bill also requires that the commission establish standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness to govern the recruitment and selection of appointees and will publish these standards as codes of practice. It will grant recruitment licences but it can also issue instructions to licence holders and revoke licences, where appropriate. The commission will report to the Oireachtas every year. It will prepare and publish codes of practice setting out the principles to be observed by licence holders in recruitment to the public service. Each code will include instructions on probity and fairness, the need to ensure that candidates are selected on the basis of merit, the protection of the public interest, the implementation of best practice and the general procedures to be adopted to deal with grievances and complaints brought forward by candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The commission may consolidate, revoke or amend a code as it sees fit. Except in the case of the Public Appointments Service, which will hold a recruitment licence on the establishment day, recruitment licences will be granted for the conduct of recruitment processes only where codes of practice for the posts concerned have been published. This will ensure all recruitment processes are governed by codes of practice approved by the commission. Candidates will be selected for appointment in the order of merit as determined by the recruitment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">As an additional safeguard, this Part includes provisions, which require persons who have knowledge of an attempt to influence a recruitment process to inform the commission in order that it may take appropriate action. The commission may investigate the exercise of recruitment functions by any licence holder or recruitment agency. Licence holders, recruitment agencies and any other person who may have information which is materially relevant to the exercise of functions under the Bill must co-operate with an investigation and it will be an offence to obstruct an investigation. A person found guilty of the offence will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">While this Part of the Bill gives the commission responsibility for setting and safeguarding standards of probity in recruitment, it also provides them with the powers necessary to enforce standards. Taken together, these responsibilities and powers will guarantee the high standards of probity which have been the hallmark of the Civil Service commissioners and the Local Appointments commissioners will also characterise recruitment under a licence issued by the Commission for Public Service Appointments. As I said before, probity is essential. It is not the Government's intention to introduce flexibility at the cost of lowering standards and undermining public confidence. I am satisfied the Bill strengthens and protects the high standards that have been established in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The number of recruitment agencies in Ireland has increased greatly in recent years. These agencies have a good deal to offer public sector organisations in carrying out their recruitment. The Government wants to provide public service bodies with the opportunity to draw on this expertise in identifying and selecting the best people for a particular job. Accordingly, provision is being made in the Bill for licence holders to obtain assistance from these professional agencies. The Minister for Finance listened to the representations made about the practical involvement of private sector agencies in public service recruitment and agrees the role of private sector recruitment agencies should be limited to assisting licence holders. While he believes these agencies can and should perform a wider set of functions, he proposed an amendment which will require the licence holder to retain sole responsibility for the final selection of candidates for appointment or placement on a panel for appointment. This is reasonable clarification of the policy approach already in the Bill. The amendment met the concerns expressed without compromising the need to give flexibility to licence holders in recruitment. It will also help to secure the probity of the recruitment process by placing responsibility for final selection of candidates unambiguously on the shoulders of the licence holder.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Part 3 deals with the Public Appointments Service. The Public Appointments Service, while retaining all the expertise and professionalism of the existing Civil Service Commission, will be established in a manner that will allow it to be more responsive and to compete more effectively in the jobs market than was the case heretofore. The new PAS will be well placed to deliver a wide range of services in the area of recruitment and selection and to support client organisations across the civil and public service through best practice approaches in the area of human resource management.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The Public Appointment Service will be independent in the exercise of its functions, which will include acting as the centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the Civil Service and public service bodies where it is requested to do so; ensuring the commission's codes of practice are followed in the recruitment process, undertaking other selection competitions, including promotion competitions and competitions to posts in organisations outside the Civil Service where requested by the relevant Minister; and providing expert services on recruitment, assessment and selection matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The board of the PAS will consist of a chairperson, the chief executive of the PAS and seven ordinary members. Its functions will include considering and approving plans and strategic objectives put forward by the chief executive, monitoring the PAS in the exercise of its functions and ensuring appropriate review procedures are put in place for recruitment and promotion procedures. Throughout the Bill, the Government is determined to uphold the probity of the system. It is a requirement that the board members must not participate in political activity. This is essential to ensure there will be no suspicion of political interference in the work of the PAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Part 4 sets out the provisions relating to recruitment licences. The commission will consider applications for recruitment licences from the chief executive of any public service body which is within the remit of the commission. Recruitment licences may be granted for particular positions and each licence will also include the terms and conditions upon which the licence is held. Licence holders may delegate all or part of the task of recruitment to the PAS. In those circumstances, the chief executive of the PAS, rather than the licence holder, will be responsible for adherence to the terms of the licence. The commission may issue instructions and advice to licence holders in situations where it forms the view that an aspect of the recruitment process has been or is likely to be compromised. The commission may amend or revoke a licence if necessary. Where it is deemed necessary to revoke a licence and a recruitment process is already in train, the commission will have the power to make transitional arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Part 5 sets out the obligations applying to candidates in respect of recruitment and selection procedures. Candidates taking part in competitions within the civil and public services have important obligations, which the Government wants to set down in statute. This Part of the Bill prohibits in any public service recruitment, selection or promotion competition the provision of false information, canvassing, bribery, personation and any interference with the competition. A person engaging in such activities is guilty of an offence. If a person who has been found guilty of such an offence was or is a candidate at a competition, he or she will be disqualified as a candidate. If he or she has been appointed, he or she will forfeit the appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Part 6 deals with selection for promotion and provides that the Minister for Finance, following consultation with any relevant Minister, may ask the PAS to hold promotion competitions for civil servants or other public servants. Part 7 sets out the powers and responsibilities of the Minister for Finance and other Ministers in respect of recruitment and selection.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Part 8 contains technical provisions dealing with transitional arrangements, repeals of legislation and consequential amendments of legislation. Anything commenced but not completed before the establishment day by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission may be continued and completed after that day by the PAS if it relates to the conduct of a competition or by the commission in all other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The First Schedule to the Bill lists a number of scheduled occupations. Recruitment to such occupations is outside the remit of the Bill, although the Minister for Finance may make an order bringing them within its remit at some future point. The Second Schedule to the Bill sets out consequential repeals, revocations and amendments to Acts and statutory instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">As I said at the outset, the Bill will introduce important reforms in recruitment to the civil and public services. The management of recruitment in any organisation can affect every aspect of its work. It can affect the way its customers see it and it will affect the way its employees work. The argument that an organisation's culture can be shaped positively if its recruitment process is handled properly is particularly relevant to public service organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The civil and public services advise the Government and implement its policies on behalf of the community. Public service recruitment must continue to be open and fair, and to be perceived as such by the public. All members of the community who apply for a post in the public service must feel that their applications will be treated without prejudice. If this were ever to change, the effect on our public service would be serious. It would alter the way our public and political institutions operate and it would change the nature of public life for the worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The Government is determined to continue to modernise the recruitment system, but it will not undermine the trust and confidence, which the public has in public service recruitment. The civil and public services must be in a position to recruit the staff they need quickly and efficiently. They need to be able to compete with the private sector in selecting their staff from the best available people. Without the ability to act in this way, the quality of service available to the public will suffer. The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003 meets these requirements. The amendments made to the Bill in the Dáil copperfasten the integrity of public service recruitment and address the specific concerns, which have been raised. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_172">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. When I first read the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Bill 2003, I was reminded of the adage "If it ain't broke, then why fix it?" The current system of appointment, introduced in the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956, has stood the State in good stead.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">As the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, said, nobody can point a finger at the Civil Service commissioners. Nobody can deny that they have acted with complete probity and impartiality. There has been no need to state in advertisements, as one might have seen in an advertisement for a position for a post with a VEC a number of years ago, that canvassing will disqualify. The merest hint of representation on behalf of a candidate, covertly or otherwise, quite rightly leads to automatic disqualification. The Local Appointments commissioners operate to the same high standards. It is generally accepted that the two bodies, as well as being absolutely independent, have appointed candidates of a satisfactory quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">What is wrong with the existing regime and the existing structures? Why should the two existing bodies be abolished and replaced by two new regimes? The Minister of State has defended the Bill by saying that it will introduce greater speed and flexibility:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_175">As Irish society has evolved, the role and function of the civil and public service has also evolved. In recent years, the commission has been actively restructuring and refocusing its resources to ensure that it is best placed to provide a modern and expanded recruitment service to all its clients in the public service. In addition, it has been providing a range of services outside its traditional, more restricted remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">It is clear that the commission has considerably expanded its role, has gone outside its traditional remit and has been doing a good job. When I listened to the Minister of State, I was struck by a contrast between his comments and the Bill's explanatory memorandum, which emphasises that "the flexibilities being introduced in this Bill will support the Government in its decentralisation programme". The Minister of State did not mention decentralisation, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I do not understand how the Bill can be said to provide for greater flexibility, other than by empowering the Secretaries General of Departments, or the heads of other offices, to bypass the proposed Public Appointments Service. Such officials will be able to apply for recruitment licences to allow them to recruit their own staff directly. I am not sure if that is necessarily a good thing. What is the merit of this measure? Will it not lead to a diminution of the uniformity of the standards which apply under the existing Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission? It was right that we paid glowing tributes earlier to officials from the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach, who did Trojan work on the new treaty and the appointment of the new President of the European Commission.</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_179">Indeed. The people in question were recruited under the old system, which has stood the test of time. The Government plans to change the entire system, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The Bill's explanatory memorandum mentions decentralisation, but the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, did not refer to it in his speech. His failure to refer to the decentralisation programme represents an acknowledgement that it is doubtful that it will happen at all. The programme will not proceed not because it is a bad thing, but because of the ham-fisted and gauche manner in which it was announced and handled. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced in his budget four years ago that the Government intended to pursue a programme of decentralisation, he said that every public servant whose job was capable of being decentralised would be decentralised. The announcement was welcomed, particularly by Fine Gael. Nothing happened for some time, however, despite repeated queries from my party and others. The rabbit was finally plucked from the hat in the run-up to the European and local elections, when it was announced that over 10,000 jobs would be relocated in over 50 locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">A glaring deficiency in the decentralisation programme, which was pointed out last year by Fine Gael, is that many of the places chosen for decentralisation were not designated as hubs or gateways in the national spatial strategy. There was understandable elation in the 53 locations that were chosen, two of which, Claremorris and Knock Airport, are within minutes of my home. Secure public service jobs will bring considerable benefits to the economies of such regions. Despite the Minister for Finance's reassurances and assertions, it is obvious the decentralisation timetable cannot be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">In his rush to provide political kudos for his party and its public representatives in the Dáil and Seanad and at local government level, the Minister has overlooked a number of factors. First, from the point of view of the standard and quality of public service, we simply cannot dislodge 10,000 public servants from their centrally located Dublin offices and transplant them within a pressurised timeframe to 53 disparate locations without adversely affecting the efficient delivery of the service. Second, the long-sought interaction, cohesion and overlap among what were, until now, straitjacketed and singly focused Departments will be set back years. The failure of the Minister to enter into negotiations with the various Civil Service representative bodies in advance of the announcement has meant that the proposal is doomed to failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I welcome, at least in regard to this measure, the fact that the Minister and his Department had the courtesy to enter into dialogue with the public service unions and get their clearance on this matter. It is incomprehensible, however, in terms of decentralisation, that any Minister for Finance could not have foreseen the public service furore that would ensue. First, there is the overwhelming resistance on the part of the vast majority of the public service to being shunted to various parts of the country to which they do not want to go or with which they have no association. Second, the Minister is talking about moving people from a Department in which they have worked and for which they have been trained for 20 to 25 years to entirely new Departments with which they are not familiar. Third, there are the human factors. For example, if a husband is working in one Department and his spouse or partner is working in another Department, how can they both be accommodated within a new relocated Department, that is if they want to move in the first place?</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_185">What if the husband has a senior position within the public service and his wife is working in a bank, and both salaries are needed to pay a mortgage? How can the Minister reach some compromise that will make the move acceptable to both of them? The same applies in regard to a civil servant married to a teacher. How can she be guaranteed a job in the local secondary, community or vocational school in, say, Claremorris, County Mayo?</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The figures illustrate the reality that the vast majority of public servants do not want to move because of the manner in which this is being handled. They live in Dublin. They are settled in Dublin. They have a whole social network in Dublin. They own houses and they have mortgages. They have children attending primary and secondary school and third level colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Has the Minister not listened, for example, to the reaction of the plethora of his own defeated local authority candidates who went on the Joe Duffy radio programme on two successive days and emphasised, particularly in Dublin, that the negative factor that impacted on the Government's performance was the fact that there was no consultation regarding decentralisation and that people would be dislodged willy-nilly?</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The Minister has failed to appreciate that we are not talking about dislodging 10,000 public servants. We are talking about dislodging 40,000 people, between spouses and children. I am all for decentralisation. It is a great idea but this has been bungled. It is too much, too soon, and it is unplanned. I want the scheme to work properly but it has not been planned. It was an election rabbit that, from the point of view of the Government, has had more negatives than positives.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The justification for this Bill is in the first six or seven lines, namely, to support the Government's programme of decentralisation. It is putting the cart before the horse.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_190">This is important legislation and important public service reform. It is clear that it has been thoroughly discussed and considered within the Department of Finance but also in consultation with the social partners. What we are being presented with is well thought out and considered legislation which has broad consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I fully agree with the emphasis on retaining the achievements of impartiality, integrity, lack of bias and lack of interference with the public service, which goes back to the 1920s. It is vital to preserve and in this regard, section 13(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that the commission is to establish standards of probity, merit, equity, fairness and other principles as it considers appropriate to be followed in the public interest in the recruitment and selection of persons for positions in the Civil Service as a public service body. The importance of that cannot be emphasised too strongly or too often and not just from a moral or even a public interest point of view. International experience shows that if a country does not have integrity in its public service, it has negative economic and social consequences for the country concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">We should not kid ourselves that there are no dangers out there. From time to time all of us who are public representatives have been approached about people who are seeking appointments, whether it is in the Civil Service or the local service, and one has to explain to them that one is not allowed to canvass on their behalf and that if one even attempted to do it, it could do them serious harm; at very best it would have no effect. I have to say, however, that many members of the public do not believe that when they are told it. That emphasis is vital, and there is a strong provision in section 14 about improper interference with the recruitment process, which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">There is an ambiguity in section 15 in that it appears the offence is to obstruct an investigation into interference. It is not clear, from reading the legislation, whether the actual attempt to interfere with recruitment is an offence or merely that it is an offence to obstruct the investigation into it. I did not notice this point being discussed in the Dáil — perhaps it was — but it is an ambiguity I would like to see cleared up.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">There was some debate, which I do not think we will re-engage in here, on suggestions or fears that special advisers could somehow be parachuted into the permanent Civil Service. That charge was convincingly refuted. In any case, even if there were an attempt to create a back door it simply would not wash because the permanent public and Civil Service would rightly resist any such attempt. I have been in both and I see it from both sides of the argument. Permanent civil servants are recruited through competition on merit while the qualifications of special advisers are known to the person who appoints them. It is right to keep that clear division and not to mix them up. It is a pity the Bill does not seek to limit or regulate the appointments of special advisers. Appointments are normally Cabinet decisions at the formation of each Government. However, the early 1990s, with an element of party patronage, saw a tendency to appoint too many advisers. This system has its merits but should be kept tight so as to ensure every ministerial office is not stuffed with large numbers of advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Senator Higgins questioned the rationale behind the Bill. However, we live in a different economy where vacancies in the Civil Service arise with greater frequency than in the past. The fast turnover of staff in certain areas of employment makes it difficult for the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission to keep up and have people ready to fill vacancies as they arise. This Bill imports more flexibility, under tight regulation, to allow Departments and State agencies to recruit directly.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The question of an overall Civil Service recruitment policy was not raised in the Minister of State's speech. Bans and embargoes that were employed during economically difficult times tended to be terribly inflexible and were crude instruments utterly unsuited to the situations of certain agencies. Some State agencies fully covered their costs through fees charged, but were nonetheless prevented from recruiting when they needed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Senator Higgins raised the decentralisation programme and I am interested to know how it will integrate with this new public service recruitment policy. Decentralisation under the programme for Government is justified on its own merits and will also further justify this Bill. Contrary to Senator Higgins, I believe the Government remains fully committed to the programme. It must be achieved by negotiation, discussion and consent, and not made compulsory. However, many commentators and politicians from the Dublin area believe that most power and wealth should be concentrated in the greater Dublin region. With modern technology, that is not necessary. These voices can at best be described as conservative and, at worst, reactionary. For example, on Report Stage in the Dáil, one Deputy claimed this Bill and the decentralisation programme as "the single greatest act of administrative and political vandalism undertaken by any Government in the past 50 years". He continued in words reminiscent of the fictional Prince Charles in <i>Private Eye</i>: “we are watching the destruction of one of the greatest institutions of the State, the Civil Service.” I regard that as complete and utter conservative rubbish. Our great public service will adapt.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">In the Department of Foreign Affairs, which I belonged to, civil servants are shifted from capital to capital around the world. Gardaí have to move at regular intervals. I admit that this can be problematic for young gardaí but it is a problem shared with married couples with children who may not be working in the same location. Everyone has to work these logistical difficulties out for themselves. I regret the negative attitude in principle to the decentralisation programme. The Member I earlier quoted is a former Taoiseach, for whom I have great respect and acknowledge his great contribution to Europe. However, he insisted that the European Veterinary Office be decentralised to a village in County Meath, while most working at the office were resistant to such a move. While he remained committed to European Union decentralisation to Grange in County Meath, he describes the Government's programme as an appalling act of vandalism and destruction of one of the great institutions of State. Can we have some consistency in criticisms of the programme? The Deputy, as Minister for Finance in the early 1980s, was responsible for cancelling two modest decentralisation programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Many Fine Gael Deputies and Senators, including the parliamentary party chairman who comes from County Tipperary, are committed to the decentralisation. However, commentators tell us that it is a great idea in theory but not in practice. Is it right that up to 90% of all Irish air traffic goes through Dublin Airport? I have an open mind on Aer Rianta but should we not distribute economic activity more equitably around the State? Will Members of more leftward-looking parties agree that the redistribution of wealth is one of their fundamental ideas rather than the concentration of wealth in certain places? I look forward to hearing the Minister of State outline the relationship of this Bill to the decentralisation programme. It has benefits for both Dublin and the rest of the country. The Government should not abandon it, let alone dilute its commitment to it, just because of teething problems.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_200">I welcome the Minister of State but I am in two minds as to whether I should welcome the Bill. Since the 1920s, a system has been in place that will now be changed. The debates in the Dáil and here will be useful in questioning the need for this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">When I became chairman of An Post in the early 1980s I was told the big difficulty with civil servants was they were so conservative that they would not be able to adapt to changes in a commercial state-sponsored body. The opposite happened. Those who were conservative as civil servants were, when released from the shackles of the Civil Service, competent and capable in adjusting to the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It seems strange to initiate a root and branch reform of a system that has served the country so well over the past 80 years and I question whether it needs to be changed. The Bill makes it possible to make public service appointments at the level of individual Departments and agencies rather than centrally. That might be no bad thing. I am generally in favour of delegating authority as far down the line as possible. Most of would probably agree with that approach. It may well be that individual Departments know their own business best and are thus in the right position to choose the right people to work for that business. There is, however, a danger that when one repeatedly replicates any function one ends up re-inventing the wheel on a systematic basis. Doing business at the local level tends to cut one off from a pool of central expertise built up over the years. This cutting off happens in both directions. Individual Departments will not be able to draw on a central pool of expertise nor to contribute to a central pool. What lessons they learn will tend to stay with themselves rather than be disseminated as best practice across the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">What is true of expertise is also true of reputation. The Bill contains provisions aimed at ensuring that this delegated responsibility is delivered to the highest standards. I hope that the aspirations of the provisions will be fully realised and that they will not turn out to be meaningless rhetoric. However, even if the standards are maintained under the new system and the best existing practice is disseminated through the public service, one cannot ensure the same for reputation. One cannot transfer a reputation for integrity and independence by means of a law passed in this House. A reputation is a most valuable asset but not one that can be treated like a property. We can transfer the mechanics of making appointments in any way we like but we cannot similarly transfer a reputation. It will be up to each Department or agency to build up its own reputation for fairness and integrity in making appointments. A reputation can only be earned over time and in the nature of things some people will succeed in achieving it better than others. In the short term we will have to live without the benefit of reputation for integrity and fairness. Even in the long term, when the Departments and the agencies have built up their own reputations we will have to settle for a more spotty and uneven reputation than the one currently enjoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">All of this makes me wonder why we are setting off on this route. What is so wrong with the existing system that it must be reformed in the radical way being talked of? What is so urgent about the problem that it must be given the priority accorded it in the Government's legislative programme? The answer to the latter question is clear. It is decentralisation. There is no secret about this. In publishing this Bill the Government made it clear that its passing would facilitate the decentralisation process. This makes me more rather than less cautious about whether we should take this route. It is clear that the Government is contemplating not merely removing many of our civil servants from one place to another. The need for this Bill arises from the Government's realisation that in order to make decentralisation work it will be necessary to carry out a major shake-up in the personnel of each of the Departments to be moved. If the Government did not anticipate this need, there can be no doubt about it now in view of the quite negative reactions of the civil servants to the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Whether the Government realised it from the beginning, it is now clear that Departments to be moved outside Dublin will be staffed by a set of people radically different to those who now staff them. This would not matter greatly if the new staff were all at relatively low level but it is clear that the further up the hierarchy one goes in each Department, the less prepared the civil servants are to move out of Dublin. If the Government gets its way, in addition to moving Departments out of Dublin it will also have to replace most of the top management in each Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">What concerns me is the effect on what may be termed the collective memory of each Department. In any organisation, particularly in the private sector but also in the public sector, there is a great deal of ongoing expertise which is found not in the files but in the brains of the top and middle management. It comes from experience. This is rarely an issue, because in the ordinary way those people are not replaced at the same time. Many of them stay on to ensure continuity on a rolling basis. My experience from business is that it is hard to hold on to that, and when one loses that knowledge, memory and expertise it is very hard to replace it.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">As we learned from the widespread downsizing of organisations in the 1980s and 1990s, it can have a devastating effect on an organisation's efficiency if a large number of people are either moved or replaced. The collective memory of an organisation is impaired because there is too great a change of personnel to ensure the necessary continuity. This is what worries me about the decentralisation proposal. It is not the only aspect which causes me concern but it is the main one. The approach seems to be based on the assumption that one can replace top and middle management on a wholesale basis without any detrimental effect on the organisation's ability to successfully carry out its mission. History, including in commercial business, indicates otherwise. I doubt that enough thought has yet been given to this aspect of the change and I remain to be convinced that the present decentralisation proposals are a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">By extension, given that the Bill is largely driven by the decentralisation proposals I question that it is the wisest way to proceed. My greatest fear is that with the best will in the world we may end up destroying some of the most valuable aspects of our public administration. I have seen this happen in business, in commercial terms and in other organisations. We must consider the collective wisdom and knowledge involved. In our business we call it "sitting with Nelly". One of the ways one learns a business from the outset is to sit beside a "mother hen" or buddy from whom one assimilates knowledge. Whatever happens at the lower level, it is essential we do not lose that at middle and top management levels. I urge the Minister of State to consider deeply the implications of what we are discussing, not just in terms of decentralisation but with regard to the changes proposed here.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_209">I broadly welcome this Bill, though with reservations. Senator Higgins noted that the Minister of State's speech does not explicitly refer to decentralisation. It is interesting that his speech in the Dáil did so, at least initially. He has kicked off a lengthy debate about decentralisation in the other House which he wants to avoid in this House. He has not managed to succeed in that so far and I will not help him.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">An explicit aim of the Bill is to facilitate recruitment at local level and therefore presumably to staff offices in the 53 different locations set out by the Minister for Finance last December in the decentralisation programme announced in the budget. That is worrying with regard to a range of policy issues, some of which I will mention.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">In response to Senator Mansergh's emotional intervention on behalf of provincial Ireland, I regret we have not had enough of the opposite. I regret there have not been enough people who represent Dublin constituencies, or aspire to represent Dublin constituencies, speaking up for our city. I understand perfectly why Deputies and Senators from rural areas want to bring jobs from Dublin down the country. This is partly because people from Dublin do not want to go there and why should they? Many people have established lifestyles in Dublin, including jobs, spouses' jobs, mortgages, houses and schools for their children, but they also have a level of choice in their lifestyle which they simply would not have in provincial Ireland. Dublin offers people a choice of where their children go to school, what they do in their leisure time and whether they wish to go to the theatre, cinema or whatever, compared to many of these God awful places down the country where all one has is a choice of dingy pubs.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_214">People do not choose to go to many of the 53 towns and villages listed by the Minister of State so the Government has decided as a matter of policy to relocate civil servants to these places to get more votes. While I understand why it is doing so, I am deeply opposed to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">As a Dubliner, I have no hesitation saying I understand why people like living here. I do not think there is anything wrong with living here or having Civil Service jobs here. I understand why people from the country want to stay here. Perhaps too little of that argument has been made by those of us who represent Dublin constituencies. Those on the Government benches will be aware that many civil servants living in Dublin feel under-represented, or not represented, by what is being said on the issue in these Houses in recent months by those of us on the Opposition benches genuflecting towards decentralisation and giving way to our rural colleagues. These people want us to say that they are entitled to their choice of lifestyle and to maintain their jobs where they now have them. I would like to raise my voice in support of these people who do not feel they are being properly represented in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">It is important to address the issue at a policy level. There are real difficulties for the decision-making process in what is being proposed. I do not have a problem with relocating an administrative office down the country, wherever it might be, assuming that the IT connections and communications generally are good. However, there are problems for the decision making process. There is a need for people making decisions to talk to each other not just over the telephone or by e-mail. There is a need for senior policy makers to be in constant contact with people within their own Department, or people within their section of the Department. There is also a need for senior civil servants to be in constant touch with people at a similar level in other Departments. This inevitably will be weakened if different Departments or different parts of different Departments are located in different parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">There is a particular problem in regard to issues relating to different Departments, where different Ministers have responsibility for dealing with, for example, children. We still have not got to grips with this problem. It is 15 years since a Minister of State with responsibility for children was first appointed and there are still teething difficulties in trying to co-ordinate the activities of the three or four different Departments dealing with children's issues. It is not rocket science to project that the problem will get worse in circumstances where individual policy makers, the senior civil servants who deal with the issue, are located in different parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Looking benignly at the issue, in many cases it might not make a huge difference if decision makers or senior civil servants in part of a Department are close to the Minister and these Houses and another part of the Department is down the country. Clearly it will make a difference in some areas and the most obvious one is where people have specialised technical skills, which must be located in one place. If we are to take the Government at face value and assume this process will be voluntary, presumably some people with specialised technical skills, who are located in an office in Dublin, will be relocated in Dublin where their technical skills will be lost, if they choose not to go down the country. Presumably it would then be necessary to recruit people with these specialised technical skills who are willing to go down the country. To use Senator Quinn's phrase, this will inevitably involve a loss of institutional memory and a loss of skill. It would also involve unnecessary costs and duplication, which we could do without.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">One must wonder whether it is intended to carry out the process in a voluntary fashion. It was clear until a few weeks ago that the Government intended to put the maximum pressure to move on civil servants. I may be misreading the signs, but its willingness to put pressure on civil servants has been diminished somewhat by the experience on the doorsteps over the past couple of months. The result of this may be a much more limited programme, which may not be a bad thing. If we can get a significant group of people from agencies and Departments, which will not involve a significant loss of expertise, to move down the country on a genuinely voluntary basis, no one will raise their voice in opposition. However, if we proceed to transfer all the agencies and Departments to the 53 different locations, the outcome inevitably will be chaotic.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">It is a little ironic that this measure is being introduced at a time when it is Government policy to restrict or eliminate recruitment to the Civil Service. It was explicitly stated by the Minister for Finance that he wanted to reduce the numbers in the Civil Service. In that context, it is ironic that a whole new method of recruitment into the Civil Service is being introduced. Central to this is the maintenance of probity, fairness and independence within the Civil Service. If one takes the Bill and the Minister's statements here and in the other House at face value, one would say that is fair enough. However, there are some worrying elements, which the Minister of State has tried to address by way of amendment in at least one area. This relates to delegation and whomever is ultimately responsible for recruitment. If a particular Department or agency gets a licence, it will be entitled to delegate to a private recruitment agency. Most of them will do so because Departments which currently do not recruit are unlikely to set up new recruitment sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The constraints and standards set out in the regulation depend on the codes of practice, which are intended to be implemented by the commission. What we are getting now is different from when one agency was responsible for all the recruitment and oversaw the independence that guaranteed probity. We will now have someone regulating a licence holder who will, in turn, delegate to a private recruitment agency. I appreciate what the Minister of State has done in terms of the amendment, but I am not persuaded if he makes the decentralisation argument and says this is being done in Gort, Claremorris or wherever——</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_223">For the moment, I would like to be non-specific about the God awful places. If there is a recruitment agency in Gort, Claremorris or wherever, working to a licence holder which may be in Galway or Dublin and which has a code of practice set by the central agency, there are several different layers which do not give me the certainly I currently have, and which all of us share, that the system is being operated without fear or favour and on a truly independent basis. I worry about this aspect because I am not convinced it will work in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I am not sure how the Bill will impact on promotion and transfer within the Civil Service. It appears it is intended that recruitment to the Civil Service will be exclusively at the lower levels such as CO or EO, grades currently directly recruited by the Civil Service Commission. I appreciate this does not sit terribly comfortably with what I said earlier, but on one level that would be a pity because it is necessary to have the flexibility which involves bringing people into the Civil Service at all levels. Sometimes the deficiencies are not at the lower level, where one can usually fill appointments without too much difficulty. There was a difficulty a few years ago, but that is not normally the case. The difficulty normally arises at specialised level, where people with specialised technical skills are needed or, as Senator Mansergh said, where people need to be recruited to the Department of Foreign Affairs where there has been significant expansion in recent years. As I understand it, we do not, for example, recruit at ambassadorial level or decide we want somebody to be the ambassador to Lithuania, Latvia or elsewhere and thereby get somebody who knows those countries well. In so far as we are directly recruiting from the labour market, we could usefully do so at all levels and it is a pity we have not done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Bill has its origins in Sustaining Progress and arguably goes back to Delivering Better Government in the 1990s and the Public Service Management Act which followed that. It is reasonable to ask whether some of the measures introduced six or seven years ago have been effective as they are at least as important as the measures currently being canvassed in this Bill. I am talking, for example, of the right given to Secretaries General to effectively dismiss staff from the Civil Service. While I do not know the figures, I suspect this power is used rarely although I suspect the power to discipline is used more regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">None of us wants to see significant numbers dismissed from the Civil Service — far from it. However, we acknowledge there would be a serious effect on morale if a significant number of civil servants believed, as I think they do, that others doing a similar job at the same grade, perhaps at the next table, were under-performing or, in some cases, not performing at all. We have all spoken to civil servants in this position. There is a need for Secretaries General, or perhaps for managers further down the line, to exercise greater discretion and management skills in the way they deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The flip side of this is offering staff incentives and acknowledging when they perform well, a matter we have discussed for some years. However, it has been introduced only at the highest levels, namely, at Secretary General and assistant secretary general levels. This is a pity. If we cannot take a tougher line with those who are under-performing — I understand why we do not — the least we can do is incentivise those performing well. It is a pity the negotiations which have gone on fitfully over a number of years have been unsuccessful in producing a positive result because it is in everybody's interest that people who perform well are recognised in a tangible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">There is an interesting argument that the Bill brings to the fore, namely, the nature of the Civil Service we want. Our tradition has been one of employing generalists, those who are flexible and can be moved from Department to Department and will, likely as not, spend most of their careers within the service, getting promoted and going as far they can or want. It is not necessarily a bad thing that there seems to be a shift to bringing in staff on short-term or fixed contracts for particular purposes but there needs to be a balance between the two. There will always be a role for generalists. However, the service needs the facility to contract out and bring in staff for short periods to do particular jobs. Ideally, it also needs some crossover between the two. There should be no reason why generalists cannot do a particular job for three years, for example, and then be moved to another job. There seems to be a sense that if somebody is put into a particular job, they stay there for a long time even if the job is effectively redundant. There is not the flexibility needed in terms of re-appointing staff or allocating them to other jobs, which is a pity. We have not yet got the balance right and I am not persuaded the Bill will help us to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Bill is on balance positive. There are ways in which it could fail and I worry about some issues, including that of special advisers referred to by Senator Mansergh. However, broadly speaking, it is going in the right direction and I support it.</p>

The Minister of State was equally bemused by this, as I put the question to him. He assured me he was quite happy to debate the issue at any stage. While this is not the appropriate time to go into this in great detail, it is important to recognise that decentralisation could go the way of e-voting and dormant accounts, namely, a great idea destroyed in the implementation.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">It cannot be done in three years. There will be a significant impact on the lives of public servants, as outlined by Senator McDowell. Families, careers and life expectations cannot be broken up just by saying that in three years all arrangements will be atomised. However, some things can be done. Locations can be chosen and a presence established, and there can be an insistence that all future recruitment be to a particular location. Staff can be invited to change and, after that, as with the Act of Union, a little mealladh, breabadh agus bagairt could be used to ensure they are edged in a particular direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">It can be done but, at this stage, it seems like a good idea which is likely to go wrong. While most unions have been very restrained in their response, they have now been pushed into a position of opposition for the reasons which people heard on the doorsteps during the local election campaign in Dublin. Who can argue against the fears of ordinary people? The Government should consider a different timeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Senator Mansergh referred to IT and how it relates to the Bill and decentralisation. I regularly read the Sunday newspapers and noticed a significant advertisement in a newspaper last Sunday week regarding jobs in the public service. It advised readers to look at the <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i> website. Being the sad type that I am, and not having anything else to do on a Sunday evening, I tried to enter the website only to be told it was inaccessible. I tried again the following day but could not enter the site. As those who look after such websites are generally paid a lot of money, particularly if they do so for a Department, it was my intention to contact those in charge of the website. However, I forgot about it until I noticed a large colour advertisement in last Sunday’s newspapers, advising readers to check <i>www.publicjobs.ie</i>. I thought I would get the up-to-date version but, again, could not access the site despite trying several times. Action should be taken on this. Senator Mansergh made the case for flexibility in regard to the public service, as do I. However, this type of problem gives the public service a bad name. This morning, I again tried to access the website, which the Minister is paying for on our behalf, but could not get into it. I tried several different methods to access the site — on an AppleMac, a PC and with Internet Explorer — but could not do so. The Minister should confirm to the House that somebody does not get paid for this. The State paid for advertisements on consecutive Sundays which asked people to deal with an inaccessible website. Who is being paid for this? It is the type of situation which creates concerns regarding trust and confidence. How did it happen that nobody has checked this? It suggests that nobody is counting the hits on the website or the reaction to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The Minister of State said "a modern and flexible recruitment system" was important. I agree with his comments about the commissioners. I recently looked at some of the application forms, and I look forward to the added flexibility that will result from these proposed changes. I would like the Minister of State to confirm in his response that in all applications some space will be provided in which the applicant may sell himself for a public service job. People should not be restricted to the spaces provided in a designed application form, although the application form itself is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">In recent times I have been concerned about recruitment, which is a crucial aspect of management. One of the great problems with senior management in this country at present is that because most managers are not involved in recruitment or appointing people to positions, they are losing the skills required. They depend too much on recruitment agencies. In view of this I welcome the provision in the Bill for different groups within the public service to carry out their own recruitment. That is very important. However, as Senator McDowell said, there could be too many layers. We need to have trust and confidence in the system — there should not be any opportunity for people to interfere with it and upset the applecart. It is also important that we involve people in the appointments system.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Recently, much time has been taken up with the TELAC system of appointments. Assistant secretaries and Secretaries General have often been tied up for a week while they deal with appointments. I do not know whether there is any way around that, but I am not sure it is the best use of time. How is this regulated?</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The question of a talent drain in the public service was mentioned. The number of people from the Department of Finance who find positions in financial institutions and related areas is not worrying in itself — it is a reflection of the talent within the public service and gives the lie to those who say otherwise. The problem is that it is a one-way street. There should be a way for people to come in as well as leave. That is one of the themes that emerged from Sustaining Progress. We should all be prepared to consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">This raises the issue of pension portability. Flexibility is important. I have been involved in a number of appointments in recent years and I have found the Department of Finance to be very inflexible when it comes to allowing people into the system from outside and particularly when it comes to the issue of pensions and so on. That is a difficulty. Many quangos and State-instituted bodies need people of the best quality who have experience in the private sector. I refer here to specific cases, not the general issue, which also needs to be addressed. It is important that people with expertise may be taken into the public sector and given contracts for a number of years with terms as attractive as those to be found in the private sector. There is a view in the Department of Finance that if a person is recruited into the civil or public service for a number of years he should not be offered the pension arrangements and security provisions that apply to those who are already within the system, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">We need to consider the issue of flexibility. When I hear about flexibility, I always remember the introduction of multi-annual budgeting by the Department of Finance. It was great until the Department itself had to apply it, when it suddenly became impossible. Somebody asked what was to be done with the money left over at the end of each year and the Department said it must be sent back, although it was still required that budgeting be done on a multi-annual basis. This is a similar problem. The Department of Finance is inclined to impose flexibility on everyone else without loosening its own straitjacket, despite the fact that some of the most talented people in the Civil Service are in that Department. Perhaps that is why they are where they are. This is not an <i>ad hominem</i> argument. I am simply pointing out that there is a culture that must be changed. It has been pointed out previously that the Department was not too keen to decentralise itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Senator McDowell might be interested to know that while in a provincial town recently, I met a senior person attached to a Department who admitted, after we had had libations and were speaking freely, that he was inspecting possible locations for the 75 jobs that were being decentralised to that town. All the talk was about how nobody would move and how it would be impossible to persuade anyone to live in these godforsaken places in rural Ireland, to use Senator McDowell's phrase. I asked what he thought of the town and he said he was very pleased and liked the locations he had seen around the town. I said that was a good start and asked him, off the record, how many applications he had received for the 75 positions. I will not mention the name of the official. He said there had been 220 top quality applications. There are people who will choose to turn their backs on Dublin, although that is an impossible thought to comprehend.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_250">No. As one who was out of public life for nine years, I can tell the Minister it is a very good place. When he hears the contributions today he will realise the depth of experience of the Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I commend the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, the Taoiseach and the rest of the Cabinet on their brave decision to implement decentralisation. It is a radical move and one that could not have been taken before the advent of broadband and other initiatives in the area of communications. It would have been impossible to move a major Department to a rural area such as Knock or Roscommon when there was no proper telephone system, but that has all changed. This is a small country and there is no reason for keeping the whole Civil Service in Dublin. Out of approximately 33,000 public servants, just 10,300 are being decentralised. It is important to remember that it is a voluntary system.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">In 1992, when I was a Deputy, I persuaded the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, to decentralise the General Register Office to Roscommon. About 50 jobs were provided in Roscommon. The move was completed about ten years later. The office is currently in temporary accommodation; a building is being erected to accommodate it. The process took time. There was tremendous opposition to the move from the former Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald. He led a campaign against the idea of moving the office outside Dublin, even though Roscommon is centrally located. The Minister of State was there to witness the first sod being turned for the new building last year and I look forward to seeing him at the official opening in the near future. About 200 public servants will be located in the building. The Government also made a decision to decentralise 230 jobs at the Land Registry Office to Roscommon. Roscommon can now be titled "The Registry Centre of Ireland: Land, property, deaths, births and marriages."</p>
          <p eId="para_253">A total of 230 civil servants will come to Roscommon. This will revolutionise the town and create much activity on top of the developments that are taking place at present. Many multinationals are now coming to the area and there is much investment in apartments, houses and schools. The 230 workers will bring their families and the influx of children will mean the secondary schools can maintain their current level of teaching staff. The move is having a major knock-on effect on the town. I commend the work of the Minister of State in this regard. He is moving the project along as quickly as possible. It is difficult to predict when the process will be completed but criticism in this regard is simply an attempt to undermine the Government's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The project will be completed as quickly as possible. I commend Mr. Philip Flynn, who is chairing this, on moving it forward. It is important that decentralisation will proceed on a voluntary basis. It would not be reasonable or fair to uproot families and move them to the country for the sake of it. Future recruitment will relate to the location of a Department, whether it is Roscommon, Galway or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">This Bill will be enthusiastically accepted by this House because the current situation regarding recruitment to the public service is recognised. Every public representative would regard the Civil Service Commission as being above reproach. I understand the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission is the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann. I am open to correction by the Minister on that. Having worked as a Minister in the Departments of Posts and Telegraphs, Transport, Health and Industry and Commerce, I am aware that this country is well served by the quality and integrity of the public service. I served with civil servants in Europe as a Minister. I have seen their negotiation skills. They are the envy of every country in Europe. We have Foreign Affairs officials, our trade board and trade officials and other officials working in America and elsewhere. They are people of integrity who work extremely hard. They work closely with Ministers. They also advise them and work with decisions made by the Cabinet. We have a very loyal, trustworthy, well-qualified and well-educated Civil Service. Nothing in the Bill undermines or detracts from their position because the Civil Service Commission will remain intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I am not as happy with the Local Appointments Commission as I am with the Civil Service Commission. Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on its method of making appointments. From my experience it seems that when the Local Appointments Commission is recruiting to the higher grades, a manager, former manager or senior council official sits on the recruitment board. I came across a situation where an official was attempting to transfer from a particular county to Roscommon. Each time she applied for a transfer the manager from the county in which she worked was on the recruitment board, and each time she was turned down because the manager did not want to lose her. That must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The vocational education committees are wonderful organisations. The membership of VECs includes public representatives. I was once a member of a VEC. However, a qualified teacher must now canvass for appointment to the local VEC. That was the case up to a few months ago. I do not know whether there has been any change in that regard. It is not the Minister's responsibility. However, I regard that as offensive. One should apply and be accepted on one's merits, not on the basis of canvassing a political party. My experience of that type of arrangement is that one good deed is done in Roscommon in exchange for another in Louth or Meath or elsewhere. People get on the telephone to each other to discuss candidates on the basis of knowing the candidate and knowing he or she is from a family that has been involved in politics for years. The members of the recruitment board go into the interview knowing who they are going to appoint, and those who are not in the circle need not apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I have raised this matter because there has been a long silence about it. It reminds me of the appointment of rate collectors, a very important job in the 1950s. The appointment was based mainly on how much the candidate could give a councillor. Cheques were passed around and the appointment was made. There was a case in Roscommon where there were two applicants for the job and the chairman of the Fine Gael branch, who happened to be a clergyman, decided that his nephew was to get the job. He chaired the meeting and he put his nephew's name twice into one box so that there was a good chance that the name would be drawn. That was despicable and I am glad it has changed. It is right that the Bill provides for flexibility in appointments relating to the Garda Síochána and other organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Government is very much in favour of the Bill and I fully support it. Both The Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, are a good team in the Department of Finance. I hope the points I made regarding other appointments will be investigated by the Department with a view to introducing legislation to change the method of making appointments to the VECs.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_120" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I welcome the Minister of State. It is inevitable that there should be some change regarding public service and Civil Service appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Bill provides for the establishment of a committee and a commission. Members of this House or those nominated to stand as candidates for the European Parliament, the Seanad or the Dáil are prohibited from sitting on the commission. I note that the Ceann Comhairle is a member of the commission. How can the Minister reconcile that with these provisions since the Ceann Comhairle is nominated by a political party?</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The Bill is a very complicated measure for appointing people to the public service and to the Civil Service and it will create a bonanza for recruitment agencies who will be able to act on behalf of local authorities, health boards, the Civil Service and so on. The Bill also provides that candidates for a position may have to pay a fee. The recruitment agency may charge a fee to both the candidates and the recruiting body for whom it is acting. These complicated provisions broaden out the recruitment of civil and public servants while keeping them at arm's length.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I have no problem with tightening up some areas. However, a retrograde step was taken in the local government sector when Better Local Government was being introduced. County managers are allowed to set up interview boards for the recruitment of directors of services and for recruitment to other specific areas to the detriment of the local authority system. There are deep divisions within local authorities. Half of the members of the workforce are happy because they were promoted but the other half are unhappy because they were not. I hope a similar scenario will not develop when this Bill is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I envisage that county managers, CEOs of health boards and so on will operate different standards. In some cases local authorities will themselves recruit under licence while in other areas similar positions will be processed through recruitment agencies. That will create a double standard and it is a retrograde step. There will also be double standards regarding some positions within a specific local authority. Some positions will be filled by the county manager under licence while a similar position will be filled by a recruitment agency. That is not an even playing pitch. Heretofore, a local appointments commission was set up under the auspices of the Civil Service. Whether we liked it or not, everyone knew what was in store for them. Under the Bill different standards will apply as there will be many different recruitment agencies. There will be no even standard no matter how good the procedures put in place by the commission and the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">A good system is in place although there is no doubt that it needed to be tweaked a little. The Minister should have strengthened the procedures that were in place for public service appointments, rather than take the approach set out in the Bill. He has taken a complicated route where he will be granting many licences to different people under the direction of a commission to be set up. There is, therefore, a big responsibility on the commission to set the ground work for those that are granted licences to recruit the kind of people who did a great service to this country last week on the European stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">It is very important that the procedures to be put in place are completely independent. It will be difficult for them to be as independent as we wish because they will lead to a plethora of recruitment agencies. How will they all operate under the guidance of the commission? I am not sure it will work as the Minister intends. There is much time left to modify the Bill even further. It needs to be done. The Minister should ascertain how satisfied are the employees of local authorities with promotion and recruitment under Better Local Government over the last few years. He should then take it from there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_267">I welcome the Minister. I join those who have paid tribute to the work of the Civil Service Commissioners and local appointments commissioners over the years. They have done sterling service for this country in establishing probity and integrity of procedures, and in ensuring the quality and the independence of the Civil Service. Like Senator Leyden, I also remember the rich literature and the even richer folklore about the appointment of rate collectors when local authorities had the power to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I wonder whether all of this is needed and whether a great deal might not have been done by modernising and streamlining the structures and procedures that exist at present. There is nothing to stop provision being made for the commissions to use agencies and consultancy advice. However, I applaud the objectives that the Minister has in mind and I welcome the insistence that standards will be maintained. There are difficulties with local recruitment when decentralisation to the extent envisaged takes place. It is not an argument against recruiting large numbers of staff locally, but it can lead to a degree of inbreeding. It can also lead to the development of local patronage, which is a danger. If agency A is appointed by the licence holder to do work in a particular area, that should not mean that people who are looking for a job in that area sign up with agency A to the detriment of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">There is a difficulty where an external adviser is needed, particularly regarding health appointments. One can suddenly realise that the external adviser is the member of a very select club of people. A whole series of interlocking confidences and obligations exist that do not appear on the surface of the documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I hope the Minister encourages the possibility of lateral entry at different levels, particularly for gardaí, so that everyone does not simply come through the same hole at the bottom of the pyramid. It is a wise precaution that the commission is to be determined <i>ex officio</i>. However, the people appointed to the commission are very busy with other jobs. They therefore need to be underpinned by the capacity to monitor what is happening on the ground. They need to be supported by people who can do an audit across the system every year to ensure that quality is maintained. For instance, they can ensure that a different standard is not maintained from one part of the country to another, or from one Department to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I hope that the integrity of the public service is maintained. There is a danger that if people are recruited to a particular Department they become members of that team for life. One of the things we need to aim at in joined-up government is the ability of people to think outside the departmental frame and to move from Department to Department. The integrity and reputation of the Civil Service is something that we have all come to value. It is a great prize and no matter what is done the Minister should seek to preserve that. This will not happen unless there is constant monitoring and commissioners are put in a position to ensure that standards are being maintained and that there is consistency across the system.</p>

I have no problem with that, but I did feel that some of the debate in the Dáil centred almost entirely on decentralisation.

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_277">Senator Higgins wondered if the current system was not broken then why fix it. He also referred to the issues that I raised concerning speed and flexibility. If anything has been around for 80 years, there is a general consensus that it is time for change, not for its own sake but in order to move forward. I reiterate what I said in the Lower House. The 1999 PricewaterhouseCoopers strategic review of the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission pointed out that the regime operated under the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956, which vests all significant recruitment functions in the legal personages of the commissioners. That was a suitable approach at a time when there was little difficulty in attracting candidates to public service employment. The numbers to be employed were small in relative terms and generic recruitment to particular grade levels rather than to individual Departments or offices was the order of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">However, the generalist, service-wide recruitment regime set up by the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956 has not had the necessary flexibility to be responsive to organisational needs, which have evolved over time. In particular, competitions were run too infrequently to attract and retain quality candidates in a buoyant employment market and enable a targeted and timely response to the filling of vacancies and new posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The evaluation of the process through the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service carried out by PA Consulting in 2002 concluded that the Civil Service is a more effective organisation than a decade ago. However, the evaluation also concluded that implementation remained incomplete and that accelerated progress, particularly in human resources management, was required. In particular, PA Consulting recommended that the Civil Service should have the discretion to recruit directly from the database. In that context, it said that it supported the Bill. It also noted the need to ensure that standards be maintained in the course of any delegation of authority to balance that requirement with enhanced flexibility and local decision-making. That balance is adhered to in the Bill. Like Senator Maurice Hayes, most Senators were extremely keen to discuss the importance of probity and public trust in the Civil Service. We have gone to every length to ensure that is so. It will be essential to the credibility and work of the Civil Service that the public service has that trust. If that is not to the fore in recruitment, it will not be to the fore afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Regarding decentralisation, which was raised by most Senators, I assure Senator Higgins and others that it will go ahead. The programme announced on budget day will be delivered and the entire Civil Service is working towards that end. The Bill will support the newly decentralised offices by allowing local managers to recruit staff locally. That option has been offered in the Bill. Previously there was only one option and one had to recruit centrally. Now local chief executives of Departments or the Garda Commissioner are generally the head of the Department and that is still a very restricted and select group of people. They will have the option, if they so wish, to recruit locally. It may make a great deal of sense for a Department in County Donegal. I will not repeat Senator McDowell's comment. As someone generally so enlightened in the House, making very positive contributions, I am sure that he did not mean his reference to "God awful places down the country". That is a very unenlightened approach and he should travel a little more outside the capital to see that the dingy pubs to which he referred are quite attractive places now. I am sure that Senator Moylan would refer to some of the most popular places in his own village of Banagher, which used to be referred to as dingy but now attracts visitors from all over the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Regarding the common sense involved in recruiting ten civil servants in Donegal or Knock, in a centralised situation, of the ten people who might be selected, two might be from Donegal, three from Dublin, two from Kerry and perhaps one from Knock. That would not make any sense since they would throw their hands up in the air and say that they had no intention of joining the Civil Service in Knock and wanted to go to Dublin or wherever. The facility and flexibility that it will bring will be extremely positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Senator Mansergh referred to delivering on decentralisation. Very intense negotiations are going on behind the scenes all the time. Civil Service unions will come out and make their case, trying to get a better deal for themselves. As someone with past experience of lobby groups, I am very familiar with that. I canvassed in Dublin north and south during the local elections and came across people on the doorsteps who were in specific situations. Their spouses, they or their children had no intention of moving and decentralisation is voluntary, which in some cases will probably mean that, if the whole Department moves, the job the person was doing may not be there in future. However, their jobs will be there in the Civil Service. The grade and level of remuneration will remain the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I was shocked to hear Senator O'Toole's comments on his experiences of the CAF website. That was certainly not my experience. I am not the most computer-literate person, but I logged onto it several times and had no difficulty with it. I will check that out very quickly. I hope that the Senator was using the right name. If true, it would give a very wrong impression of the interest if people cannot get on the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Senator Quinn raised the issue of the loss of collective or corporate memory in Departments which decentralise. I assure the Senator that any restaffing of Departments and offices will be the first priority in the programme's implementation. I acknowledge that the process of "sitting with Nelly", as he called it, is very much the core method by which an organisation trains its members. There will be a period in the massive project of moving 10,000 civil servants to 53 locations when there is some double staffing. There may be a short period of reduced efficiency, but the previous experience of decentralisation has shown extremely clearly that new people in new jobs show great enthusiasm. Whatever interim drop-off there is in delivery is quickly restored with a bonus and that will certainly be the case here.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">That is not to say that the Government or the Department of Finance underestimates the challenges. On the people issues in particular, there will have to be a great deal of discourse, dialogue and listening. The most important thing of all is that it is voluntary and that people should not feel obliged. I was listening to "Morning Ireland" this morning, on which there was a discussion about Luas. An interesting article on the last tram that ran compared Dublin then and now. One of the commentators said that Dublin is now a city of 2 million people. It does not make sense that in a city of 2 million people we cannot afford the flexibility to allow just 10,000 employees of a very substantial Civil Service to relocate around the country. I agree with the comments about decentralisation that it is a very positive move for the whole country and for the civil servants. It must be implemented correctly and the Government and the Department of Finance will ensure that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">There were some concerns about the issue of private recruitment agencies being involved. Human resources is now a very highly developed science and most Departments have a very specialised human resources manager. There are substantial skills in private recruitment agencies and there is an option in the Bill to make use of those skills if one so wishes. I also know from my short experience of being involved in a Department, the Office of Public Works, that those within one have their own skills and may feel that they can do the job better than the private body. Very often that is the case. I admire that in them and they are prepared to be benchmarked with a private body on how they do their jobs. If staff in any Department feel that they can do a job better than a private recruitment agency, that is the option to have. It is an important option to include in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I believe it was Senator Paddy Burke who referred to the provision to charge people for applying for a job, which could be an option for a private recruitment agency. That provision was also included in the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956. It was used for the brief period of a year in the 1980s. We insisted on including it to maintain that flexibility. However, the intention to charge for recruitment is not there. There is also provision in the Act that, if there were a charge, the money would not go to the local recruitment agency or Department that was recruiting but to central funds. Thereby, any incentive that a private recruitment agency or a local agency might have to charge is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Regarding the other issues raised, Senator McDowell broadly welcomed the Bill. He had some concerns about how it might apply to decentralisation. I referred to his lack of appreciation of some of the provincial towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Senator O'Toole referred to a chance meeting with a senior civil servant in a town in rural Ireland who told the Senator that there were more than 200 applications for 75 vacancies. The central applications facility will report shortly and we will then get a clear indication of the interest in decentralisation among civil servants. Previous surveys gave a negative and unreliable impression of the likely response. People are considering their options and quality of life is an important factor. There will be a substantial "churn", which is a rather unfortunate term in use within the Civil Service to represent the take-up of decentralisation. Of the more than 10,000 civil servants who move, many will change Departments and this will provide them with a new enthusiasm for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Senator Leyden outlined some of the shortcomings of public service recruitment practice and Senator Maurice Hayes was in agreement on that point. There are some outrageous stories of political patronage in the past, which we are glad to leave behind, and there are sufficient safeguards in the Bill to prevent any similar occurrences in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I disagree with Senator Paddy Burke's contention regarding the complexity of the system and that it will represent a bonanza for private recruitment agencies. Most Departments and State bodies will continue to recruit centrally except where there is difficulty in a particular location or a vacancy requires a specific skill set. Even in those limited circumstances, recruitment will be mostly done internally rather than farming it out to private recruitment agencies, not least because of the cost factor for which provision may not be factored into departmental budgets. That will be at the discretion of the Department heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I have addressed most of the issues. I thank the Senators for their contributions and I note the generally positive response. The Bill will not be enacted before the end of this session but I look forward to its implementation.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_296">Molaim an Bille seo don Teach seo. I commend the Maritime Safety Bill 2004 to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The primary purpose of the Bill is to enhance public safety and amenity and protect natural and other heritage areas by strengthening the law against the improper use, in the waters off the coast and in lakes and rivers, of certain fast powered watercraft such as jet skis and speedboats. Tourism and leisure businesses will also benefit from the prevention of danger, damage and nuisance by such craft.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Part 2 is the essential core of the Bill. It confers clear by-law making powers to regulate and control the operation of craft of the types in question on the following authorities: county councils and city councils in respect of waters generally, except waters under the control or management of Waterways Ireland or under the jurisdiction of other statutory authorities, namely, harbour companies within the meaning of the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 or the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in so far as it concerns the five fishery harbour centres — Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs — and other harbours under the control or management of the Minister; and larnród Éireann in relation to Rosslare Harbour and any other harbour under its control or management.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Fines of up to €2,000 on summary conviction for offences under the by-laws are provided for in the Bill, as well as fixed payment notices or on-the-spot fines. Provision is made for the seizure, detention and forfeiture of craft involved in offences and for disqualification of serious offenders from operating craft of the types in question in the interest of public safety etc. Section 14 provides for the appointment of authorised persons by the Minister, county and city councils and harbour companies to enforce the Bill. The Garda Síochána will also play a key role in enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Part 3 of the Bill updates penalty provisions in the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968, the Harbours Act 1996, which includes a provision for fixed payment notices or on-the-spot fines, and the Merchant Shipping Act 1992. There is consistency with the penalty provisions in Part 2 of the Bill to deter a range of activities which are inimical to the proper operation of the harbours concerned and to other users.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Section 17 of the Bill consequentially repeals section 33 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992, as amended, with regard to which legal issues arose as to the powers to regulate and control the operation of craft of the types in question. The Bill addresses the legal issues which arose as to the powers of county and city councils, clearly needed in the public interest, to make by-laws as regards the extensive waters off the coast and lakes and rivers used by the public, which are not directly under their control or management. The Bill also fills a gap in the law to protect natural heritage areas and underwater archaeological heritage against damage or interference by such craft.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">A detailed explanatory and financial memorandum has been published with the Bill for the benefit of interested parties. I will be glad to provide any further clarification or information needed. The exclusion from the provisions of the Bill of waters controlled and managed by Waterways Ireland reflects the cross-Border nature of that body and the structures in place between the two jurisdictions under the North-South Ministerial Council. Waterways Ireland has powers under its legislation, notably the Canals Act 1986 and the Shannon Navigation Act 1990, to regulate and control navigation in waters under its control in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The wide-ranging new powers contained in the Bill, when enacted, will complement other recent initiatives taken by the Minister and his Department. These include the new national regulations governing jet skis and other pleasure craft, which came into operation on 3 June 2004, the recently published — for consultation — code of practice for the safe operation of recreational craft and the proposed establishment of a small vessel register.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The new Merchant Shipping (Pleasure Craft) (Lifejackets and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2004 contain national provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and wearing of lifejackets and restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs. They apply to all types of pleasure craft irrespective of their means of propulsion and replaced the 2001 regulations, which applied to only mechanically propelled pleasure craft.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The wearing of lifejackets is an essential element in staying safe on the water. For the first time, the regulations make it compulsory for all children up to the age of 16 years to wear a lifejacket while on board a pleasure craft. The public generally and parents in particular should take responsibility for safety by wearing lifejackets and encouraging others to do so and by taking other sensible precautions while on the water, especially as the holiday season is now taking off. I also draw the attention of the House and the public generally to the water safety website, <i>http://www.safetyonthewater.ie</i>, which gives important information on safety for various types of watersports.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The aim of the proposed code of practice for recreational craft is to support the statutory provisions relating to recreational craft, in addition to advising on recommended best practice regarding the safe operation of such craft in Irish waters, whether for competitive or non-competitive purposes. All interested persons are invited to participate in this important public safety exercise and to forward comments to the Department before the closing date, 15 September 2004. The draft code as well as the new regulations may be accessed on the Department's website, <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The Bill, as I outlined, contains an important suite of measures to enhance public safety and enjoyment in Irish waters and to protect important heritage against damage and interference. I hope the Bill will have the desired effect of quickly stamping out bad behaviour by certain users of fast powered watercraft, which is posing an unacceptable risk to the public, property and wildlife. I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and progressing the Bill into law at the earliest opportunity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_308">I welcome the legislation. I remember speaking in the other House, over four years ago, about the merchant shipping Bill, when it was incorporated, part of which related to jet skis. At that time local authorities were seen to be involved. I expressed reservations then as to how the legislation would be enforced. I still have reservations as regards enforcement although I know some local authorities, including the Minister of State's in Wexford, took a decision to ban jet skis from many of their beaches. That is something to which many places will probably resort. Jet skis are expensive to buy. They are glorified motor bikes which can travel on water at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. While people under 16 years of age are banned from using them a difficulty arises in that users are not required to undergo any type of prescribed safety training. There are various organisations which provide such training and those who purchase jet skis usually people in the 18 to 30 age bracket, should have to undertake safety training before using them. People who drive motorbikes and cars are required to undertake training. It is regrettable that we tend to focus on such issues when tragedy strikes. There was a sad tragedy in Youghal last year when a 15 year old boy died following an accident between his jet ski and a power-boat.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Enforcement of this legislation will rest with the Garda Síochána. However, the Garda is deployed in other activities and may not have the time to police it. Reference was also made to possible involvement by the Irish Coastguard Service. That may be the best body to police the legislation given its involvement in activities around the coast and the fact that many of its members act in a voluntary capacity. The level of tragedy in America involving jet skis, where the boom has continued for some time, is approximately eight times that experienced by European countries. There is a great deal of concern about their use.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">The Minister of State mentioned a €2,000 fine and seizure in certain cases for breaches of the legislation. Anyone who has visited the Continent will know the use of jet skis is restricted to certain areas away from beaches. The noise of a jet ski which sounds like a lone lawnmower winding up with the noise escalating out of all proportion, can disturb the tranquillity of a beach on a calm evening. They also cause a great deal of fear among people. I accept the Minister is trying to introduce controls in this area, which is an important first step in dealing with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">There has been a great deal of comment about safety training for people taking out yachts, power-boats and other vessels. It should be incumbent on the suppliers of these machines, usually to those in the 18 to 30 year old bracket, to insist on safety training courses for those operating them. If we started from that basis then those operating such equipment would behave more responsibly. The use of jet skis in Ireland is not a widespread phenomenon. However, given the affluent society in which we now live many people can afford to purchase jet skis or nautical motorbikes, as I have referred to them on previous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">While I welcome the introduction of the legislation I am concerned about its enforcement following enactment. I am also concerned about Garda involvement given deployment in other activities. It is probable that the tourism industry will seek to ban the use of jet skis on our beaches. Such a ban is necessary given that many young people use the beaches. Many holiday destinations abroad have zoned particular areas for the use of jet skis. While they are located away from beaches one often encounters the macho man with high testosterone levels speeding up towards them. The noise of these vehicles disturb the tranquillity of our seaside. I suggest that if they are not banned completely they should be restricted to areas not used by swimmers and so on. I am extremely concerned about their use in any area. I would be happier if the Minister of State recommended in the legislation that suitable safety training be introduced for those wishing to use these craft. Currently, a person can purchase a jet ski with the minimum amount of safety training in terms of the use and power of the craft and can then take it out on the water.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The legislation is a step in the right direction. Local authorities will act responsibly in this matter and will, in many cases, ban the use of jet skis from beaches. That may have to happen. One has sometimes to be cruel to be kind. If they are to be used, they should be used in controlled areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_314">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wholeheartedly welcome the Bill. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is to be congratulated on bringing forward this legislation which represents a decent effort to curb activities of mechanically propelled watercraft and which will regulate an element of our leisure sector which needs to be brought into line with modern thinking and living.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">This problem has grown over the years in part because people are looking for more adventure in their leisure time, have extra leisure time to spend and have the resources to purchase and maintain expensive craft of a wide variety of designs, from speedboats to personal watercraft, better known as jet skis. Everybody is entitled to do that but this sector must be regulated in the interests of safety and for the enjoyment of the majority given the many incidents, some fatal, in the recent past. I am not enthusiastic about regulating every element of our lives but where health and safety is concerned, where the environment is at risk and where people feel they can do what they like without regard for others, we have not only a right but also a duty to step in and make rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">While they will come within the scope of the Bill, I am not sure that those families, angling friends or boating enthusiasts, who set out regularly in the summer for a few hours mackerel fishing or exploring otherwise inaccessible parts of our coast, will have anything to fear from this measure. Anyone who currently uses common sense and has regard for the safety and enjoyment of others will have no difficulty in complying with the provisions of the Bill and the regulations and by-laws which will emanate from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The time is long overdue when a discipline which has not emerged naturally must be imposed on the use of fast, mechanically propelled craft. The sooner this legislation is put on the Statute Book the better. There are far too many people abusing our leisure waters. I will not point the finger at young or old, male or female, because this malady goes right across the board. A high percentage of people who operate these jet skis do so with little regard for others. Some put people's safety at risk with their high-powered demonstrations of macho skill while most impinge on people's enjoyment of the beach or riverside with their incessant noise.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">There is very little to recommend these machines in the close quarters in which they are often used and nothing to recommend them when they put at risk people's lives by near criminal behaviour. I hasten to add that those who engage in such activities are few enough, but in the context of general water users, they represent a reasonable percentage.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Perhaps the one vessel, which causes people most problems is the so-called jet ski or personal watercraft. Surprisingly, it dates from as far back as 1973 so regulation of its use is not before time. An increasing number of authorities around the world are meeting the growing danger and annoyance of these craft and have introduced stringent by-laws to regulate their use. Others have taken the more drastic step of banning their use in their jurisdictions, though I would not advocate such radical measures here.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">One town on America's west coast, which some might call the home of water sports, came to following conclusion:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">The ban is integral to the protection of the coast from the pollution and noise from personal watercraft. Sailors, windsurfers, bird watchers and wildlife will be grateful for this decision in years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">America is not the only country to find these craft to be intrusive. A constituent of mine who lives in a house overlooking a beach recently told me it was sometimes like having a motor-cross race in one's front garden.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">When I initially read the Bill, I wondered about the size of the recreational craft covered by its provisions, between 2.5 m and 24 m. I assume vessels above this size are already subject to regulation under other legislation. I am concerned that we should also cover craft under the 2.5 m limit. Personal watercraft may well continue to diminish in size, just like scooters and Segways, which are self-balancing, self-propelled scooters for the street that are no bigger than the space in which we stand up. I note that the definition of personal watercraft in the Bill relates to craft that are under 4 m. As advances in technology usually reduce the size of things, I envisage that recreational watercraft will soon be below the 2.5 m mark. I hope account can be taken of the likelihood of further miniaturisation of craft. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this area and to re-examine the definitions of craft and their sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">It is natural that by-laws will have to comply with the provisions of the Act. By-laws can be made to specify the areas in which such craft cannot be used, the speed that is allowed in defined areas and the times of the day when they can be operated. If one looks around any harbour, one will see as many single and twin-masted yachts as there were mirror dinghies and lasers a generation ago. When I was young, it was rare to see a water-skier in a harbour or off a beach. It entertained us for an hour or two, but that time is long gone. Water-skiers, towed by a variety of methods from speedboats to parachutes, are a regular feature of resorts and bathing places.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Personal watercraft are a relatively recent but immensely popular addition to summertime leisure activities. Such craft have made it possible for people from all walks of life to enjoy fast-paced recreation on the open water without the encumbrance or expense of a full-sized boat. They were first developed in 1973 and have kept pace with improvements in technology, increases in demand and the greater availability of resources with which to acquire them. They have got larger and more powerful with each succeeding model, increasing from 400 cubic centimetres to three times that power today. Their popularity grew rapidly until they became the largest-selling watercraft in the world. In America alone their number is growing by an estimated 100,000 each year and a proportional increase can be detected in this country too.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Although wave-runners, jet skis and other personal watercraft are relatively new to our waters, experts have told us they have caused substantial damage to nature, wildlife and the environment. Such machines endanger and disturb wildlife with their high speeds, unpredictable movements and excessive noise. Most of them are powered by highly polluting two-stroke engines, which release up to 30% of their fuel and oil mixture directly into air and water. Their high power-to-weight ratio, coupled with the fact that the personal watercraft industry advertises them as machines built for speed and manoeuvrability, demonstrates that such craft are thrill craft rather than a legitimate form of water transportation. The machines range from 800 cubic centimetres for one-passenger craft, to 1,200 cu. cm. for three-person craft. The larger craft carry a fuel capacity of 15.3 gallons, which is more than one's average saloon car. Its promotional advertising states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_327">The 150 model has been a machine that defies simple explanation. At its best, it's a pint-sized rocketship, able to reach the upper echelons of the radar scale and slice a buoy to ribbons with surgeon-like expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">If that is how they are marketed, that is how they will be encouraged to be used. We need to disabuse people of such notions by one means or another. Legislation is the best curb.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Given that we do not allow indiscriminate car racing along our roads and crowded streets, I do not understand why people feel free to use the crowded waters off popular beaches for the reckless use of personal watercraft with impunity. We insist that new drivers of cars and motorbikes should take lessons and a stringent test before they take what can be a lethal weapon onto the roads. No such requirement exists for water-based craft with the same potential, however. Jet skis and powerful motorboats have the potential to be lethal in the same way as motorbikes and cars. People need to have been on a training course to learn how to use the craft properly. They should ensure they have the right equipment, such as buoyancy aids and wet suits. It is important that they should know what to do if they get into difficulties. I do not want to go too far down the road of the nanny state, but if such regulations are needed in respect of road vehicles, they should also apply to watercraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The machines about which I have spoken are fundamentally different from traditional boats. The American coastguard has given personal watercraft manufacturers a waiver so that the craft do not have to comply with the basic safety features required on other boats. This suggests that the craft are not boats in the conventional sense, used as a legitimate means of water-based transport. All water users should be treated the same in regard to safety. Identical requirements should apply to speedy craft and what I loosely describe as family Sunday afternoon boats. The US national park service has adopted a rule that permanently prohibits the use of personal watercraft in 66 parks. Five other parks adopted permanent bans in the spring of 2002. When allowing their use, authorities in the US must develop environmental assessments and special regulations to open their waters to personal watercraft use.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">A welcome provision of the Bill is that local authorities can draw up by-laws to cover their functional areas. The imposition of blanket restrictions would not take into account local conditions and the differing topography of the coast. An area that is 30 m offshore might have a depth of several metres. In other coves and beaches, however, one can wade out a couple of hundred metres without being out of one's depth.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I welcome this measure from a political and functional point of view. There is a perception that powers are constantly being taken away from local authorities. We must promote local democracy where we can and be seen to do so. That is not to say there could not and should not be consistency between local authorities where possible. We should standardise when it is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The Bill will draw ready support among the public, many of whom are tired of having their Sunday afternoons and holidays ruined by the incessant noise and disruption of fast craft in their bathing waters. They have to be constantly on the alert not only for the usual dangers to young bathers, but also for the imminent arrival of jet skis. In the words of the promotion I quoted earlier, such craft can "slice a buoy to ribbons with surgeon-like expertise".</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Many other dangers have to be catered for in the course of a water-based holiday, or a day at the seaside. That accidents happen far too frequently was borne out in my home county in the past week, when three young men lost their lives in the waters off the coast. I extend my sympathy to the families involved. The grief caused by the passing of the men is felt by many more families than the three immediately concerned. Their deaths underline again the inherent dangers of water-based activities and how easily a light-hearted swim can go fatally wrong. Anything we can do to promote water safety, to highlight the dangers involved or, like in this Bill, to try to eliminate the reckless use of dangerous craft must be pursued. I do not hesitate in commending the Bill to the House. I know it will receive universal support.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_335">I welcome the Minister of State. I welcome the legislation, which is needed. I do not have the slightest difficulty in supporting it because it is sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I have a certain difficulty with the tone of the speeches so far in this debate. It is easy to be prissy and nannyish about such matters. I have been bothered by jet skis and power boats in places as far apart as Dingle, Dromineer and Kinsale. I know regulations are necessary. It is great to see people on the water. It is to be expected that young people, who tend to be the main users of jet skis, will act like young people. The Bill is welcome because we do not have regulations. Although we passed a law some years ago giving local authorities certain powers, this legislation makes further advances. It is welcome and necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">If one is having a glass of wine or a cup of coffee in one's boat at the marina in Athlone, there is nothing as bad as being disturbed by some youngster scooting along in a jet ski, creating enough of a wave to turn over half the boats in the harbour. It is extremely annoying, particularly for people on beaches and on lakes along the River Shannon, where one sees a great deal of this behaviour. One can easily engage in such activities in other places. If one travels a short distance from Athlone to the hotel at Hodson Bay, one will find a protected harbour from which boats can be launched. Jet skis can operate away from the harbour without interfering with craft in the harbour. We need to examine such areas and to apply the rules in a sensible manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I would hate to introduce regulations that would prevent people from going on the water. When I was younger and fitter, I skied and engaged in sub-aqua diving. We had fast boats, which we called RIBs, with big engines hanging out the back. I am sure we bothered people and I am sure we were wrong to do so. It is time to regulate this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">It is great to see people on the water pursuing healthy activities, whether sailing or using jet skis. The Bill is very measured. I do not have any difficulty with it giving this power but I ask the Minister to keep a close eye on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I want to raise a number of points about issues that are not included in the Bill. There is much reference to people found in contravention of the regulation or by-laws. That raises one issue for me in particular, namely, the registration of craft. There should be a number on every jet ski, pleasure boat and RIB to make them identifiable and allow them to be registered. If the Minister has time he might go through the stages of registering a boat in his Department and see if he can do that without going bonkers because of the weight of regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I am not an expert in this area. I have not registered my boats because I have been warned off doing so by people, but when I have taken my boat abroad and I am asked for my papers, I give them a set of papers I made up. They are not illegal. They look official. I have a number on them and so on and I just hand them to the harbour authorities. I talked to a friend who registered a boat through the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and it was torture. The problem is that all craft — I am not blaming the Department, it is just the current regulation — are treated the same but there should be an easier system of registration for pleasure craft. All it would take is for somebody to say that every properly built boat will have a hull number, which will normally be given by Lloyds if it is any type of decent craft, and a manufacturer's number to make it identifiable. Every boat in Germany has a number on it and they are all licensed. One often sees boats in Irish harbours or at sea which are numbered but they have been bought abroad. I ask that the Minister take my suggestions on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The Minister has given authority to various people and in one part of the Bill there is reference to the coastguard. I want to refer to the importance of the coastguard. We all grew up along the coast and we recognise the importance of the coastguard. In many ways the coastguard could now become responsible for marine safety, although not for implementing the Bill. Who will implement the law on life jackets, which I welcome? Who will implement these by-laws? The Minister has given authority to certain people to be the nominated persons, which is wise and necessary, but the job of the coastguard has always been to save lives and protect people. It now appears it might have a role to play in warning people they are breaking the rules as regards personal water craft, life jackets or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Where does the Minister place the coastguard in his scale of reference? They are a group of people who have much to offer. There are two categories involved. There are the full-time, permanent members of the coastguard, but there are also the other people along the coastline. I know the people in Dingle, who provide an invaluable service. We should use their expertise, allow them be part of an advisory structure and have an input into the policy of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in order to develop these areas. I would also like them to have some input to decision making. They are an extraordinary resource but they should have access to State provided training to upgrade their equipment and be brought up to date with the latest methods from various parts of the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">There is probably a need for some financial support for people in the voluntary area of the coastguard. As Tom McSweeney tells us every week, we are an island nation and in that sense we depend on these people. I ask the Minister to consider, in particular, the coastguard whose members should be properly recognised and given a status.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I am not sure if it is the coastguard, which operates the coastal radios. I am often on the radio to them but if I am on to Valentia, I do not know whether it is the coastguard in Valentia, the weather station or something else I am talking to. If one is speaking to the coastguard in the United Kingdom or other countries, one will always be asked for a call sign or number.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">That raises another issue in terms of operating boats and it is one that comes up all the time. Must people in charge of craft have a radio licence? I believe the law states that they do. I have done navigation courses over the years, although I have to say I was using boats for many years before I bothered doing navigation or handling courses. It was more a case of seeing how the theory worked in with the practice apart from anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">This Bill reflects a cultural change in our attitude towards the water. It is as important as equal pay legislation or the Equality Act 1997. It is a wake-up call, although it is important not to put too many restraints on people. I want to see more people enjoying the water, especially children, although I realise we have to tell them to slow down, not to make too much noise because it is Sunday afternoon or go a half mile offshore before they engage in some sporting activity. That is fine. Even if it annoys us it is better to see people doing that than many other activities they could pursue. We talked this morning about alcohol and last week the issue of smoking was raised. This is a healthy outdoor activity, even if it is irritating, noisy and troublesome. We need to get the balance right and we all share that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">When one considers the horrific accident in Cork Harbour last year in which somebody died, we realise these activities are about people acting sensibly. Most accidents at sea happen because people do not have due respect for the sea, the weather or their equipment. There is nothing as worrying as to see some guy from Dublin in Dingle who has just bought a big boat, with large engines, which he intends to sail back to Dublin that night despite the fact that a small craft warning has been issued. He will take on those waves and not worry about a force 7 gale whereas people born beside the sea will go for a pint and wait for the weather to settle down. I would hope to see people in charge of craft having to address these issues and at least be aware of their sense of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I welcome the legislation, which represents an appropriate balance, because we can get things done in the implementation of it. For example, the RNLI and some other groups produce checklists. One can get a safety checklist from the RNLI or from the Irish yachting association. It would be appropriate for the Department to circularise those — perhaps it does that already. However, it does not have a list of every boat, boat owner or registration information. That is where it must start. I wish the Bill well.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_350">I, too, join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House and welcoming this legislation. I have an interest in this issue. In January of this year I wrote to the Secretary General of the Department regarding my concerns about safety on water, particularly in the area of powerboats. I am pleased that the response to my letter may be in the form of a Bill, considering that I did not get an official response. I am hoping this Bill is my reply. If it is, I am very happy with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I also echo the phrase coined by Tom McSweeney that we are an island nation. Indeed we are, and there is an enormous onus and responsibility on us to ensure that we have proper legislation and that we achieve a right balance between safety and regulation in the use of our waterways. Many of the fishermen who harvested the seas around our coast were unable to swim but they had their own in-built safety mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">In recent years there has been a huge increase in the use of pleasure craft and, like Senator O'Toole, I declare that I own a pleasure craft, a powerboat, which I operate off the west coast. I have observed an increase in this activity, some of which is quite disturbing and needs to be regulated. I compliment the voluntary contribution of those providing lifeboats and coastguards that marshal and police our waters in the interests of safety.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_354">From the State's perspective a huge debt of gratitude is owed to those who do this voluntary work.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I am concerned the legislation does not go far enough. A balance must be struck between over-regulation and making the waters available for everyone's use. Unfortunately, a degree of irresponsibility on our waters is evident, particularly during the summer months, with persons with little or no experience operating high-powered engines on the backs of speedboats and RIBs. One positive provision contained in the Bill is that authorised persons, mainly harbour masters, will now speak with greater authority as it will be passed down via harbour boards and commissions. Up to now, when a harbour master attempted to stop and correct an individual's improper use of a boat in a harbour area, the boat operator more or less gave them the two fingers. With this legislation, the harbour masters are empowered to deal with this. This is a welcome development as many harbour masters are experienced with great knowledge of the competent and incompetent users of their waterways.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Senator O'Toole raised the registration of boats and I agree that all boats operating above ten horsepower should carry a licence. I am being reasonable by choosing ten horsepower as a threshold. Following Senator O'Toole's suggestion of hull registration, there should be a decal type number visible from ten metres. A system of traceability is necessary to prevent people operating illegally and improperly on our waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">A 200 horsepower engine on the back of a six metre RIB can be given as a birthday present to a 17 year old child. I am concerned that the child is then entitled to operate that boat on the water without any form of training or experience. Should further restrictions be advocated? Should the operation of a powerboat with a certain size engine be only allowed to those who hold a powerboat certificate or licence? The master of the craft is ultimately responsible. Obviously, introducing such legislation would unfairly impose on those who have operated on the waters over the years. I have taken safety courses conducted by the Irish Sailing Association. Though I had a fair amount of experience on the water, I learned much during the courses, even if it was correcting bad habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">It may be time for those authorised officers, as defined in the Bill, to be given the authority to issue licences to people known by them who have operated boats for years. Thereafter, when a new boat with a 250 horsepower engine arrives with two 17 year olds, the harbour master can insist on an operating licence and all necessary courses to have been completed. I am not advocating that the legislation be immediately changed toinclude this provision because I am conscious of over-regulating a predominantly leisure activity. However, we have a responsibility to protect and safeguard those who are operating for leisure and social facilities from cowboys and cowgirls.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_360">I welcome the Bill as it corrects inadequacies that existed. More consideration needs to be given to the responsibility of those authorised in ensuring water safety. Should third party and comprehensive insurance be linked for those who have a national powerboat and safety certificates? Should such certificates and age restrictions be linked to horsepower usage?</p>
          <p eId="para_361">These issues will be the next phase for legislation in this area. General consultations should take place in conjunction with the coastguards, lifeboats and authorised persons, such as harbour masters, to continually review this legislation. We must legislate in the interests of safety for all. It can be made a safe sport and leisure activity with a commonsense approach to safety and balanced regulation. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for moving in that direction. I hope he will take on board some of my points regarding future legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I welcome the Minister of State and this necessary legislation which was a long time coming. Several years ago, residents and users of the marina in Terryglass, a small and scenic village, a regular winner of the Tidy Towns Competition and an attractive destination in the summer months, complained to me about groups of jet skiers on the lake. It would not have been an issue if the jet skiers had gone out into the lake. However, they were used too close to the lake's edge and caused a considerable degree of noise, disruption and disorder in the area. Under no circumstances would the jet skiers listen to the pleas of the residents and visitors for some calm and peace. The area was rendered unusable for the quiet leisure craft. Subsequently, it was learned in discussions with the county council that there was little it could do to enforce regulations because legislation was required. In that context, this Bill is to be welcomed and I hope local authorities fully implement it.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Most of this activity takes place in the evenings or at weekends, including bank holiday weekends. It will mean that a local authority must have an officer assigned to places like Dromineer, Terryglass and Garykennedy in north Tipperary on Lough Derg to ensure that the regulations are upheld. Will the local authority act only on a complaint, for instance? By-laws must be discussed at strategic policy committee level before being accepted by the local authority so there will have to be a level of understanding and public consultation and awareness. I hope that will ensure the smooth operation of the Act and also that the public will be fully informed and will co-operate with the local authority or whichever body is involved in ensuring that the by-laws work in practice. The issue of the implementation of the Act arises there but in principle the regulation is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I agree with much of what Senator Minihan and others said about safety regarding these craft and specifically jet skis. We may need to consider issuing safety certificates to users. It is worrying that people can simply buy jet skis and go out on the water. We do not want to ban jet skis, nor does this legislation, but there is much to be said for designating parts of beaches or lakeshores specifically for jet ski use. Users should not be allowed near the shore, near where children are playing or near where people are using other pleasure craft in a quiet manner. Jet ski users should not be allowed create disturbance to other people. On one visit abroad I noted that jet ski usage was allowed only after 7.30 p.m. There is something to be said for that because most people would have left the beach at such a time.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The legislation is welcome. I commend the Minister and his officials for bringing it forward. The Minister of State said in his address that Waterways Ireland was excluded from the legislation but had its own codes and powers under other legislation. Can he assure me that Waterways Ireland will have the same level of control and authority available to it as he is giving to bodies under this Act? One would not want a difference in approach, or in authority and power, between local authorities and harbours on one hand, and Waterways Ireland on the other. The issue under discussion may not be so important for Waterways Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I look forward to seeing the legislation enacted. Presumably it will not be implemented for this season, since by-laws have to be passed, but I encourage the Minister and his Department to ensure that the local authorities and bodies who will have a role under the Act will implement the legislation as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_367">Tá fáilte roimh an tAire Stáit go dtí an Teach. I welcome this Bill, in which I have long been interested. I have raised it on the Order on Business on a number of occasions and I also raised it on the Adjournment to which the Minister of State responded. I thank him for giving the time to meet two deputations, which I brought here to talk to him about the measure before us. It is a proactive measure in the interests of public safety, and not a killjoy measure, which is how it was described by those with a vested interest. It is designed to ensure that the safety of all water users, whether they be swimmers, anglers, boat or jet ski users, be protected. Regrettably, the measure is necessary because a small number of people who operate jet skis and ski boats do not have due regard for the rights of other users of our waterways. They insist on their right to use our waterways but conveniently forget their obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Coming from County Westmeath, the Bill has special relevance for me. It is not a maritime country but is known to all as the lake county. We may not have a coastline but lakes are Westmeath's greatest asset, with fishing, cruising, water sports and shore amenities. There is a wealth of trout and coarse angling on the Westmeath lakes of Ennell, Owel, Derravaragh, Sheelin, Lane, Lough Ree, the River Shannon and the Royal Canal. Derravaragh is the source of the well known legend of the Children of Lir but we will not go into mythology today. Those who visit Westmeath can travel the scenic routes, the picturesque villages, Goldsmith country and the Fore and Belvedere trails, and find much more in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The primary purpose of the Bill is to improve public safety and safeguard nature and heritage areas by enforcing the law against the unacceptable use in coastal waters, lakes and rivers of certain powered water craft such as jet skis and ski boats. This will be of benefit not just to individuals. Tourism and leisure enterprises will also gain from getting rid of the risk, harm and trouble caused by such craft. I totally reject the arguments put forward that the restriction of their use will harm tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Incidents involving jet skis or high powered craft have generated increasing amounts of publicity in recent times. As Senator Kenneally noted, the jet ski or personal watercraft is essentially an aquatic motor cycle invented in 1973 by the motor cycle manufacturer Kawasaki. The use of these craft has become increasingly popular and there have been numerous reports of jet ski related injuries around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">No one can deny that for some time there has been a dangerous mis-use of jet skis in our harbours, bays and lakes. It defies logic that anyone can buy a jet ski and then travel at any speed on a lake with no regard for other lake users. If one buys a motor cycle, car, lorry, truck, aeroplane or helicopter one must undergo training in order to qualify for a licence, and one must have a licence plate. There is no comparable arrangement for certain power craft. I commend the Minister on the proposal that all mechanically propelled water craft must be registered with the local authority and have a licence plate. I also welcome the proposal to include county and city councils under this law. They will have a pivotal role to play and I hope they will be given the resources to carry out the functions, which the Minister proposes handing over to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Jet skis, can be used by people with no experience, licence or insurance. Local authorities have the power under by-laws to control their usage but they are failing to do so countrywide. Without enforcement, horrific accidents are waiting to happen, and unfortunately some have already happened. I understand that some terrible injuries have been reported over the last decade across Europe and beyond. The use of crash helmets is not mandatory despite a report of traumatic brain injury in 54% of those injured in jet ski accidents. Unlike motorcyclists, why are people who use these type of craft not obliged to use crash helmets? Some local authorities have enacted by-laws restricting their use to specific areas to minimise the nuisance to others. I recall making a proposal to that effect in Westmeath County Council, but it was not accepted because the area concerned did not have the public attention the people involved wanted. These people went to a place which was widely used by anglers and swimmers and, as a consequence, many people had to desist from using the lake, which is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Another menace posed by the "toys for boys or girls" element is a threat to the more traditional activities on these lakes, in particular, angling. The Minister of State will have heard at first hand what this involves. As was pointed out in the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> in March 2003, only 12 wild brown trout fisheries remain in Europe, including Lough Owel, Lough Ennell and Lough Sheelin. Many claim that Lough Sheelin is gone and Lough Ennell is suffering as a result of jet skis and ski boats because, comparatively speaking, it is a very shallow lake. If the regulation of these craft is to benefit, other more sedentary aquatic pursuits, that, too, must be welcomed. The Bill will mandate clear powers to local authorities to make by-laws to regulate and control the operation of the type of craft in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I am not trying to pour cold water on a drowned rat, but I believe people who operate in a manner which is potentially dangerous to the public deserve the proposed fine of €2,000 on summary conviction for offences under the by-laws provided for in the Bill. Provision has also been made for the seizure, detention and forfeiture of craft involved in offences and, in the interest of public safety, disqualification of serious offenders from operating craft of this type will also be allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I welcome the fact that the Garda Síochána will play a key role in enforcing the law. Laws have been enacted previously under the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Act 2001, which was introduced following the canoeing accident in 1995 off Dunmore East, County Waterford, when two young people lost their lives. As the Minister of State said, this legislation will complement recent measures put in place by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">This is a proactive measure and I believe its implementation and enforcement will save lives. I commend the Minister and the Department on bringing it forward.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_377">I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this Bill and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, and his officials to the House. However, the Bill is not what I am seeking. The lakes of the Shannon are not included because they come under the North-South bodies. I understand why the Minister of State could not include these lakes because of the North-South body, of which I used to be a member. The exclusion from the provisions of the Bill of waters controlled and managed by Waterways Ireland reflects the cross-Border nature of that body and the structures in place between the two jurisdictions under the North-South Ministerial Council. Waterways Ireland has powers under its legislation, notably the Canals Act 1986 and the Shannon Navigation Act 1990, to regulate and control navigation in waters under its control in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">While I welcome the Bill, I need to know precisely what waters it covers. I am concerned that it does not cover the lakes of the Shannon, particularly the inner lakes of Lough Ree, on which there is huge bravado and showing off. There is something about getting on the water on skis, which sends the blood to a young man's head, and perhaps young women's heads. If these lakes are not covered, we should send out a message to Waterways Ireland that it should get its act together and copy what is being done in this Bill. There is no doubt this measure is needed because there is something about the open waters, skis, wind and speed which fires up people and causes offence. A friend of mine has a lovely boat on which we travelled one Sunday last summer. Two of these so-called offenders passed by us with huge gusto and, while one likes to see these people enjoying themselves, they, in turn, spoil the enjoyment of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I will not be here to hear the Minister of State's reply so perhaps he will reply to me in writing. Will this legislation affect the waters I traverse, including the Shannon, Lough Ree, the canal up to Ballinamore and the inner lakes of Lough Ree, Lough Derg and Lough Allen? This aspect will not be dealt with until someone in Waterways Ireland cocks their ear. As the Minister of State takes his duties very seriously, perhaps he will contact Waterways Ireland and point out that these issues were raised in the House and Senators from the areas concerned would like to see the same care extended to these waters as will be extended to other waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">As the waters which will be covered are not named, I hope the Minister of State will list them in his reply and my colleagues, Senator O'Meara or Senator Daly, will let me know what waters will be affected. The waters Senator Glynn eulogised do not stand to be affected for the good. We need to know what the legislation covers. While it is a fine aspiration, I want to know what it covers, and how the waters, which are not covered can be dealt with under the Maritime Safety Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I join in welcoming Mr. McDonald. I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for bringing this legislation before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">As he will be aware, jet skis are a menace in some areas, particularly in tourist resorts. Last year, a team arrived in Ballyheigue with jet skis on trailors. These people drove through swimmers, including women and children, with a total disregard for the safety of the people on the beaches and those living in the area. I welcome the legislation and express appreciation to the Minister of State who has taken the initiative in bringing the legislation before the House. I assure him of our full support in implementing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">In that regard, I raise queries about the implementation aspect of the legislation. To date, there has been very little implementation of whatever regulation was put in place. People have been behaving in a dangerous and irresponsible manner on many beaches in isolated resorts in coastal regions. Some of these people travel long distances. Earlier this year, I saw a number of jet skis on an isolated beach in west Clare. I live in an area where there are miles of very safe and isolated beaches and where swimmers are suffering because of the activities of these people. Some of these people travelled a great distance from Kilkee to Dunbeg Bay and invaded areas where people, including children, were swimming. There was dangerous irresponsibility on the part of those using them. When I visited the location of this incident, I was asked by those suffering whether anything could be done to control jet skiers. However, I discovered it was a matter for the Garda, which is aware of its responsibilities in this area but has been limited in taking action except where a superintendent or garda had a particular interest. By and large, gardaí feel it is matter for the Naval Service despite the Naval Service not having a capacity to access most of the relevant areas without using its smaller vessels. In any case, by the time the Naval Service arrives, jet skiers could be miles away as they travel at very high speeds as well as acting irresponsibly and irrationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">On occasion, there has been a risk of serious accidents involving jet skis colliding, and I have witnessed six machines together in one bay, zig-zagging and carrying out manoeuvres at high speeds. Onlookers have been horrified at the prospect of collisions and bodies being washed up on the shore. There have already been incidents where lives have been lost and a young man lost his life in the past two years in the home area of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The law has not been clear on this issue until now and vigorous implementation of the legislation is required immediately passed by the Houses. In advance of the passage of the Bill, warning notices might be issued through the recognised channels to the different areas involved. The notices would designate those with responsibility, particularly inshore fisheries officers, and request them to be vigilant in detecting offenders and making them act in a reasonable and responsible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I do not want jet skis banned. It is possible to designate special areas where jet skiers can carry out their manoeuvres and high jinks and I have no problem with that. For example, several areas of the Shannon Estuary would not come under Shannon navigation rules and there would be little traffic and few people swimming or engaged in recreation. It would be simple for local authorities to designate certain areas where jet skiing could be carried out freely. Senator Finucane will be aware of areas close to Foynes where it is possible for this to happen without interfering with the leisure activities of other locals or the traffic to and from Foynes Harbour. It should be easy for jet skiers to operate without causing danger to themselves or others.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">It is a matter not only for vigilance but enforcement. Many jet skiers feel they can quickly escape from one location to another. For example, jet skis in Kilkee Bay could be quickly driven to Doonbeg Bay, around Mutton Island and on to Spanish Point. It is open season for some jet skiers. I am surprised by some of those involved in this activity, who seem responsible in other matters but who have no sense of responsibility when they get on one of these machines. They drive them in an outrageous manner, putting the lives of others, especially children, at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Previous speakers referred to the exclusion of Waterways Ireland from the Bill. This area needs to be legislated for and I have no hesitation in saying that Waterways Ireland would be irresponsible in its attitude if it did not comply with the intention of this legislation. Perhaps it might be necessary to amend the Bill to cover Waterways Ireland. I am sure the organisation has a clear knowledge and understanding of what has happened in these areas. It has overall responsibility for Shannon navigation and Northern waters, and I believe legislation in Northern Ireland covers this activity. If amendments must be made to the Bill in this regard, it should be done speedily. The exemption of Waterways Ireland should be removed from the Bill before it passes through the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">This is useful legislation. Like other speakers, I do not agree with a total ban on jet skiing and believe it possible to designate areas where it can occur. However, it is neither responsible nor acceptable that those who engage in the activity can indiscriminately enter isolated coastal areas, and some not so isolated such as Ballyheigue, Lahinch or Kilkee where I have witnessed them, and behave in an irresponsible manner, putting others at risk. The message should go out loud and clear from the House that it is not acceptable.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_144" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_391">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. Like Senator O'Rourke, I ask whether lakes in the west such as Lough Carra, Lough Corrib and Lough Mask are covered by the Bill. While I understand that local authorities have powers, do they only apply to coastal areas? This activity occurs in our lakes where people may be fishing, sunbathing and so forth, particularly during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">While jet skiing is causing serious problems for those out to enjoy themselves, I do not wish to outlaw it. I agree with Senator Daly that areas should be designated for such activities, whether on the coast, lakes or otherwise. However, those going to the coast or lakes for other activities should know that jet skiing is allowed and that they will have to take precautions. Power-boating is a growing sport on the Continent, in the United States and world-wide, and is advertised on Sky Television and other media, and it is only natural that young people would be attracted to it. Therefore, it is important the Minister considers designating areas for this type of sport to take place, whether on the coast, lakes or otherwise. If provisions are made in this regard, those who visit waterside locations will know that this activity is taking place. Local authorities or other enforcing authorities will also be aware of it and can make special arrangements to highlight it. We must live with this activity and the Bill should reflect that. It is deficient in not doing so. Although I welcome the Bill we must have control over these matters because people's lives are at risk. The legislation should provide for all kinds of activities to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Minister of State explained that the Bill makes provisions in the areas of age restrictions, the carriage and wearing of life jackets and restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs. I wonder how he intends to control the use of drugs and alcohol on boats. How will he implement this provision? Will there be a breathalyser test? How will he establish whether a person has taken an excessive amount of alcohol or drugs? Will this only apply to the person in control of the boat at the time, or will anybody who is on the boat when it is in breach of a regulation, for example, where there has been speeding, be subject to a fine if they have consumed an excessive amount of alcohol, even though they may not be causing problems?</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Minister should explain more clearly how the provisions dealing with the use of alcohol and drugs will be enforced and who will be liable to prosecution under the regulations resulting from the Bill. It is important that we know this. People who are on a boat for pleasure and have had a few cans of beer may, without realising it, be facing fines of €1,000 or €2,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the Bill. As Senator Daly said, it should fulfil our obligation to make provisions for water sport activities, if necessary by designating areas for these activities within local authority areas. We cannot outlaw that type of sport all over the country. Some provisions will have to be made.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_396">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House and I welcome this important Bill, which is, if anything, overdue. There has been a problem with jet skis on inland waterways for a long time, particularly in the midland lakes. Deputy Paul McGrath, among others, was active several years ago in attempting to persuade local authorities to restrict these activities on lakes such as Lough Ennell, where they are a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The difficulty is that there are conflicting interests. I declare an interest in that I am a trout fisherman and I fish on Lough Ennell, Lough Owel, Lough Derravaragh and other midland lakes. Unquestionably, jet skis and similar equipment are a cause of irritation and danger. Almost inevitably, it is young men who ride jet skis, as they are attracted by speed, and they seem to have a total disregard for other people. The waters in question are large enough to accommodate the various conflicting parties. There is enough room on Lough Ennell for game anglers and jet skis but they must be restricted to particular areas. That is only reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Apart from the question of safety, there is an environmental issue which might not have been highlighted in the past. Generally, the midland lakes are shallow and these craft, whether they be jet skis or power boats, disturb the bottom considerably. This has implications for the lakes' invertebrate life, which sustains the angling if not the fish themselves. I welcome the fact that there is now the possibility of controlling these sports.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In contrast, let us consider the way in which the sailing club on Lough Owel conducts its affairs. Its members confine themselves to a restricted area. These are quite small craft which travel at low speeds and do not do much damage. It has been the case for many years that the angling interests and sailing interests on Lough Ennell have lived side by side quite happily.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">As for the great western lakes, Lough Corrib, Lough Mask, Lough Carra and Lough Conn, while it appears there is enough room for everybody because they are so much bigger than the midland lakes, the problem is that they are very dangerous. Winds blow up very quickly and there are reefs and shallows. One must know where one is going. It is not a question of putting out a boat, whether it be an angling boat, a jet ski or a power boat, and heading off willy-nilly. The Corrib is marked by navigation buoys and people who stay within the navigation channels can be quite safe. There is a large area of very deep water to the north of Inchagill island on Lough Corrib which is fished very little, except on the drop-off ledges for trout. This is a place where these craft could operate safely without affecting the local angling.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">There is always the risk of accidents. On Lough Ennell, where jet skis and power boats travel at high speed, I have seen some come very close to drifting lake boats. It is a pity to have to say "I told you so" after an accident. It is reasonable that these measures should empower the local authorities to intervene and create a framework in which the various interests can be accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">There is also the question of life jackets. I was one of those who was critical of the proposal for mandatory life jackets on lake fishing boats on the big western lakes. There was also a requirement for boats to carry a large length of rope, flares and so on. I agree that flares should be available, but some of the regulations had the capacity to clutter a small boat unnecessarily and this could represent a danger in itself. Everyone taking to the water should have a life jacket, whether he is using a jet ski or an angling craft. I note that according to the brochures for angling competitions in the west, it is a requirement that life jackets be worn.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">People should be told that the onus is on them to wear life jackets. I would put the onus on the person taking to the craft in the case of angling boats. I am not talking about boats that bring people to islands in Lough Corrib, for example, which is a structured commercial operation. Where someone is going out with a gillie in a boat for the day, the safest thing to do is to take someone who is familiar with the lake. The system that existed until now encouraged people to rent a boat for a day without anyone to guide them. That is undesirable. Given our economic success, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find someone who will take anglers out in groups of two or three, but they provide an essential service and sometimes make all the difference in terms of survival. They must be encouraged through recognition of their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">It was unfortunate, not just from the point of view of angling but also for the tourism industry, that several of the large, successful and long-standing fly-fishing competitions on the great western lakes had to be abandoned over the last few years. However, the World Cup on Lough Mask is taking place again during the August bank holiday this year. This is a successful festival,which brings much revenue to the Ballinrobe and Lough Mask areas. Such activities should be encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">We need to seek a balance. I would put the onus firmly on the person going out in a boat to provide him or herself with a life jacket. I have worn a life jacket for many years, and at one time one was almost laughed at for wearing one in a lake boat. One was also laughed at for putting on sunblock. Those days are gone. It is extraordinary how many people now put on sunblock before going out even on quite cloudy days.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">This legislation is important. I am glad it has been introduced and I hope it will be successful.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach" eId="spk_146">
          <from>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_407">I welcome the former Minister for Defence, Mr. Michael Noonan, to the public gallery.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_408">I welcome the Minister of State. I have welcomed the Bill from the outset. However, it requires amendment. Where I come from in the midlands there is major concern about jet skis among people who use the inland waterways. I understand why the Minister has exempted Waterways Ireland from the provisions of the Bill. Control of our waterways must be put into the hands of local authorities. People who own jet skis must be registered, whether they use them at sea, on lakes or on rivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Senator Dardis commented on the problems of shallow water in lakes. He is correct. The people using jet skis are not too concerned about where they use them. They are out to speed on them. One would think they were out to annoy anyone using the waterways, tourists in pleasure boats, fishermen or children bathing. Jet skis are causing major problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Many people use jet skis without life jackets or helmets. The speed of jet skis is also a problem. Are there any controls on the horsepower of jet skis? They are often driven at very dangerous speeds, sometimes where there are boats moving in and out of marinas or where there are bridges. It is only a matter of time before there is a serious accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The Bill addresses an area in need of legislation. However, the problems in the waterways under the remit of Waterways Ireland, which includes the River Shannon and all its tributaries, have been raised on numerous occasions on the Order of Business by Senator Glynn and others. I thought this Bill would address those problems. However, having examined the Bill, I believe the Minister might have to rethink it in order to address the real concerns of the people who use inland waterways. On the coast where there are larger expanses of water jet skis may not be so dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">We want people to enjoy the facilities we have at our disposal. However, they must be used in an organised and careful way. Previous speakers have asked whether jet ski users have any training, whether they need a licence or whether anyone can head off on a jet ski and drive at whatever speed they like. There is major concern, which has been expressed by many Senators, but we have a caring Minister who will take on board the views that have been expressed by the Members and will modify the Bill to impose controls, even if that means introducing rules or regulations to empower local authorities. The Garda Síochána has a boat on the inland waterways in the midlands. However, it has no power to do anything about people who speed and cause a nuisance on the waterways. We must give the Garda power to control what happens on the waterways in the midland region, particularly in the Shannon catchment.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I welcome the legislation. It is high time it was introduced. I compliment the Minister on introducing it. I hope it will be modified to enable people to enjoy themselves on our waterways in a safer environment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_414">I thank Senators for their support of the Bill and for their clear message to the public to take greater care and to have greater consideration for others when using rivers, canals, lakes and waters around the coast. Many Senators called for the striking of a balance between the usage of waters by the public and the safety measures that need to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Bill considerably strengthens the law so as to deter danger and nuisance to the public or wildlife from certain high-powered watercraft, such as jet skis and power boats. The Bill increases penalties for the existing offence of careless or dangerous operation of craft in any waters and provides for seizure or forfeiture of craft as well as the disqualification of offending operators for two years or more as the court may decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">A number of Senators raised the issue of enforcement. Section 14 authorises the Minister, all city and county councils, of which there are 34, all ten harbour companies under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 and Iarnród Éireann to appoint authorised persons to enforce the Bill. Such appointments will significantly supplement the resources of the Garda in ensuring public order and safety on our waters. The Minister recently arranged for the deployment of two Irish Coastguard vessels at Howth and Crosshaven to promote safety awareness at sea, including the wearing of life jackets. Such vessels will be further deployed around the coast in the coming months for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I support the comments of Senators Minihan and O'Toole regarding the need for skills, certification and proper training. There is a clear need for all operators of watercraft to be suitably skilled. The question of training needs attention to set appropriate standards and such requirements could be imposed by the ministerial regulations under section 20 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992. For example, regulations have been made recently to require the wearing of life jackets. We could, therefore, deal with that issue by way of ministerial regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">A number of Senators also raised the definition of a craft in the Bill. In light of some of the concerns expressed by Senators, the marine survey office of the Department will review what technological developments, such as miniaturisation, can take place. Senators also raised the issue of the more active involvement by the coastguard and the registration of boats. Senator O'Toole called for young people to be encouraged to become actively involved on our waters. This area needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Senator Finucane raised the issue of safety regulations relating to pleasure craft, including jet skis and power boats. The question of compulsory training was also raised. Section 20 of the Merchant Shipping Act empowers the Minister to make regulations. The points raised by Senator Finucane and others will be carefully considered and brought to the attention of the maritime safety directorate of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The possibility of establishing a small vessel register was raised by most Senators. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has announced that the Department is considering the establishment of a small vessel register to ensure that only certified safe pleasure leisure craft are allowed on Irish waters. The register would also identify owners and operators and details of such a proposal, including the naming of vessels for identification, are currently being considered by the Department. The Minister will make an announcement on that issue soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Waterways Ireland was raised by a number of Senators, in particular the fact that it is excluded from this Bill. The important policy considerations related to ensuring public safety and amenity and heritage protection, which necessitated this Bill, apply equally to waters under the control or management of Waterways Ireland. There have been serious incidents of risks to human life and wildlife and public nuisance. Accordingly, the legislation on Waterways Ireland and its enforcement are under review by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which has responsibility for Waterways Ireland. This is being done with a view to identifying appropriate further measures that are needed. The review has to be undertaken under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, as provided under the British-Irish Agreement, and will be completed as quickly as possible. It will take several weeks rather than months to have the necessary amendments implemented. We will have the same controls right across the country, including under this legislation and the legislation on Waterways Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I again thank Senators. It was an interesting debate. I was born beside the River Slaney, although I probably spent more time playing hurling and football than boating. However, having listened to those who have experience and who have put forward suggestions, my officials and I will be looking at possible amendments on Committee Stage.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_426">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera. I also welcome this excellent legislation. However, I hope that it will be followed up with adequate resources. In five years, there has been a sea change in people's attitudes towards entitlements and needs. I first became involved in politics in 1999. When I knocked on doors, the major issues were potholes and water and sewerage schemes. They were very much related to the physical infrastructure. However, I noticed during this year's canvas with my respective colleagues, councillors and urban councillors that many of the issues raised on the doorsteps related to education. There was a sea change in people's attitudes. They are more informed and in tune with their rights and those of their children regarding education. The electorate is evolving and becoming more sophisticated. People's interest in their own families and their children's education is increasing. That was evident on the doorsteps during the local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I welcome the fact the Title has changed to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003. The word "disabilities" has been removed. People who suffer from dyslexia, for example, do not have disabilities but needs that must be addressed, something the Bill tries to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">There is some confusion with the Department for Education and Science, and perhaps the Minister of State will be able to shed some light on it. The Department announced there would be restrictions on hiring psychologists earlier this year. I assume that was in light of the fact that there was to be a new weighting system for special needs resources. I am a little confused and require clarification on how the new weighting system will impact on the legislation. Small schools in rural areas are currently concerned about the special needs services and resources they have available. They worry there might be a depletion or reduction in those resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I require clarity on how the new weighting system for special needs resources will impact on the legislation. Since February 2003 the Minister for Education and Science has received more than 8,000 applications for special educational resources at his Department. However, the vast majority of those, more than 88%, have not been sanctioned, leaving children in need of some form of assistance at school without that help.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">There is fear and worry at secondary school level. I have been speaking to a few teachers involved in the special needs sector. They want to know what will happen now, where the psychological assessment will come into play and whether it will be in-house and up to the teachers to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">A psychological assessment by a qualified professional is required in the case of a four year old pupil with mild dyslexia. The issue is access to the right psychological services at the right time. An example came to my attention of a parent who moved her ten year old son from an urban school with a pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1 to a rural school where the ratio was minimised. This child's mild dyslexia was only diagnosed at ten years of age, mainly as a consequence of the greater one to one attention he was receiving in the new school. The needs of children who are lucky enough to enjoy a low pupil-teacher ratio environment will be met but in a classroom of 30 pupils many children will slip through the net if they are not assessed at the right time.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Legislation needs the support of Government in terms of both delivery of resources and the political will to clear bottlenecks that obstruct critical services. This is the kernel of my argument. This is excellent legislation but political will is required for its implementation and to provide the necessary resources. It appears the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004, which was debated in the House yesterday, will be enacted by the Government. Some of the funds available under the provisions of that Bill could be disbursed to the Minister of State and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I objected to the methods stipulated in that Bill for the allocation of funds as the decisions will be made at Cabinet. Education and disability were mentioned as areas to which dormant account funds could be allocated and a significant portion of the fund should be channelled into the special needs sector. If the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 is to be enacted, the special educational needs sector is an area which should receive support. Some 57% of schools in the north-west have no psychological assessment provision. This means that too many schools have teachers and principals who are under significant pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">We must ensure the definition proposed in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003 cannot be used to restrict access to any service or assistance for those who need it. The remit of this legislation applies only to those under the age of 18. What protections shall be afforded a pupil with special educational needs who wishes to remain in full time schooling until the age of 19 or 20?</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Although we are not as far ahead in this area as Australia and the United States, for example, adult education has been very much in vogue in Ireland for the last ten to 15 years. What is the special educational needs provision, for such conditions as mild dyslexia, for the adult of 40 or 50 years of age who returns to education? We should follow the precedent already set in this country that education is a lifelong endeavour, from birth to death. There should be no cut-off points and every incentive should be provided to encourage people to return to education. The Government may claim that its long awaited disability Bill will protect adult learners such as these but it has stalled long enough and must produce this legislation as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Dealing with support services or State agencies on behalf of one's child can be a daunting task. Many advocacy services have been established in the adult education sector to encourage and facilitate people to return to education. What about the parent who must approach officialdom to represent the special educational needs of his or her child? There should be a conduit or advocacy service for such parents. Currently, parents are approaching their public representatives across the political divide, be they urban councillors, county councillors, Deputies or Senators, pleading for services for their children. I am neither condemning nor condoning this situation but an advocacy service is required. Some parents may have a problem with their child's school and feel uncomfortable approaching the principal or class teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Bill puts considerable extra pressures on school principals. What supports and resources will be available to both primary and secondary schools in the implementation of the legislation? Again, it is a question of resources and commitment. The Bill looks great on paper but the implementation aspect must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Minister for Education and Science must ensure that meeting the requirements of special educational needs students is a core component of teacher training programmes. Progress is evident in this matter and such special training is ongoing in many of the primary teacher training institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Dyslexia Association of Ireland has identified a need which has been met by a significant voluntary effort on the part of parents throughout the country. A dyslexic workshop in Letterkenny is based on the voluntary effort of parents. It takes place in the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which, fortunately, is not charging fees. However, it costs the parents €50 to employ a teacher for each three hour session and the total cost is €1,310 per night. The Revenue Commissioners have now stipulated that the teachers must pay tax on these earnings, which is fair enough as everybody must pay tax. However, the teachers have naturally increased their rate and from September the fee will increase from €50 to €80, which will constitute an increased fee of €500 per night for parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">There must be some kind of intervention to subsidise these parents. We have to acknowledge the effort parents make to ensure their children have access to equal educational opportunities. The parents who organise this workshop on a weekly basis are taxpayers who are forced to dip into their own pockets to access a service that should be provided by the State. Mainstream funding should be provided for such facilities as dyslexic workshops. In the interim, the Minister for Finance must intervene to provide some sort of subsidy for the voluntary efforts of these parents. They have raised money on their own initiative, including substantial funding from Donegal County Council, money from charity football matches and so on. It is not good enough that they should have to battle so hard for a service that should be provided by the State.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_440">The Minister of State will get a fair wind for this legislation and everybody in the House supports what she is trying to achieve. I congratulate her on it. It is a considerable advance on the version that preceded it. I have had a deep interest in this subject for many years as I was engaged in that policy field for some time. It is important to ensure that as many children as possible can live a normal life to their full potential and attend ordinary schools with their brothers and sisters. A wide range of conditions is involved. For some people provision will be needed in special schools, but by and large children can go to school with their brothers and sisters, their friends and neighbours. That is much better socially and educationally. It is also better for them than spending half the day being driven around the country in a bus to try to get to a special centre. It means, however, support for the schools and the teachers. It requires classroom assistants, often on a one-to-one basis, and smaller classes, as Senator McHugh spoke about.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">School enrolments will fall over the next few years. I hope the opportunity will then be taken to reduce class sizes rather than the number of teachers. I have no doubt that a smaller teacher-pupil ratio gives children an enormous advantage, particularly children with special needs. They need particular attention and dedicated teachers. When we find those we should hold on to them as best we can and try to ensure the reward system recognises what they have done and encourages them to stay in their jobs. There have been difficulties, as we have been told, about dyslexia, autism, Asperger's syndrome and various ranges of Down's syndrome. It seems there is a danger of people falling into a black hole between the ages of 16 and 18. I have heard of cases where people leave the child psychology service and do not come into the adult service until they are 18. Those types of barriers are hopeless for children with special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I have a young neighbour with median Down's syndrome. He actually designed my Christmas card for the National Forum on Europe. He is now at a further education school and it is wonderful to see how he is getting on. He might actually be able to follow some sort of artistic career. To decide that people cease to have a need or an entitlement at a particular age is somewhat fallacious. It is important, too, that parents are helped and supported in this. I am glad the Bill gives some indication of the way parents should be involved. They need support and should be helped. People who are doing innovative and experimental work in these programmes in schools should be helped as well. They are worthy recipients of any dormant accounts funds or others that may be on offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">There is a danger with falling rolls. I remember in the past when schools were full head teachers, by and large, did not want to see difficult children. They tried to get them certified out of the system. Now suddenly, because of falling rolls, the thresholds have come down as well. I applaud the fact that special needs children are being taken into schools. However, it would be a pity if they were being taken in without the support structure, the teaching help etc. they require. On a final note, I have seen many of these documents and have written some. Words are great on paper but make very little difference unless, they are backed by money and resources. While the legislature is mandating the Minister of State and her successors to provide these services to young people and their families who need them, there is an implicit commitment that it should mandate the funds, as required. I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill. I have no doubt it is enlightened and far-seeing and in keeping with best practice elsewhere. However, I return to the question of resources. There must be the will for this. It would be cruellest of all to raise the hopes of parents and children as regards a service and then tell them they are not a priority when they go looking for it, as the money is not there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_444">I welcome the Minister of State. I will start by echoing Senator Maurice Hayes's comment that it would be really cruel to have the hopes of so many people raised and not bring forward the resources needed to implement this very good Bill. I was delighted the Title of the Bill was changed, for a start, to the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003. There is a large number of people with disabilities, all of ourselves included, who did not have to have any extra resources for our education. It is much better that we focus specifically on people with special educational needs. The provision of services to this area is woeful. We have a large number of people with varying abilities who are ready to take up these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned people with Down's syndrome and autism. It is most important to recognise that we now know the abilities of people with both these conditions, which are among the main groups likely to take up these educational places, varies widely. The extent a person is affected by Down's syndrome depends on how many cells are inherited in an abnormal chromosome. While we know that about 70% of people with autism have intelligence quotients below 70, some 30% do not. This is a major challenge for teachers and schools to take on. The resources must be put in place to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I was relieved to see the Bill takes into account that when assessing the child and drafting his or her educational plan the underlying condition has to be considered. That is important and it is covered in the Bill. When we had children in special schools, it did not necessarily mean that all their needs were fulfilled by having them there. We want to be sure, as well, that their underlying conditions are taken into account when the various assessments are being made. The level of social interaction, communication and behavioural problems of some of these children will be very relevant. The amount of assistance needed within classrooms may be considerable. Some people with, for example, autism, if seriously affected, will require long-term support. That is not to say we should not give it. We must remember, as well, that there is quite a high prevalence of these conditions in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">When I did medicine one rarely saw someone with Down's syndrome over the age of 20 or 25. Now nearly everyone is 50 to 55. It is the same with autism. We did not see people with autism much because most of them were put into mental institutions. We have about five to ten people with autism per 10,000 of the population, which is a considerable number. That means this Bill will require substantial resources. We do not know the causes of autism. Numerous environmental causes have been implicated. Viruses, vaccines, medication, lifestyles, emotional trauma and chemicals have all been suggested. However, we know, without a shadow of a doubt that genetics is important in this. International studies show that in monozygotic twins, twins which are genetically identical, there is a 60% to 91% chance that each twin will be affected. The corresponding figure for dizygotic twins, twins from separate eggs, is approximately 30%. There is much international research on the epidemiology of autism. I was delighted the Minister for Health and Children attended the recent conference on the genetic approaches being taken to identify families, which may be susceptible to autism. The conference took place at the National Centre for Medical Genetics in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. Dr. Seán Ennis from the Department of Medical Genetics at Our Lady's Hospital and Professor Michael Gill and Dr. Louise Gallagher from the Department of Psychiatry and Genetics in Trinity College also attended the conference. They have formed a research group on the genetics of autism and are collaborating with the National Alliance for Autism Research, a parent-led non-profit organisation in the United States. I was delighted to hear the Minister say he would ensure co-operation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I am sure some Members saw the recent "Prime Time" programme about several families of children with autism. In one particular family, four out of five children had autism, all of whom were boys. Members will be aware autism is much more common in boys. While we are good at undertaking research, we must improve our woeful services in this area. There was another great coup for Ireland today regarding the promotion of further scientific research in the telecommunications sector. We also undertake research in genetics. Science Foundation Ireland is investing a great deal of money in areas such as neurophysiology. We must ensure we contribute largely to international research in this area. I was glad to hear of the Minister for Health and Children's support in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Senator Hayes mentioned the possibility of a gap in the legislation in terms of 16 to 18 year olds. Great care must be taken to assist children during the transition from primary to secondary school and the Bill makes provision in that regard. It is good Senator Ormonde and Senator Fitzgerald are here for the debate given their backgrounds in teaching. While the transition from primary to secondary education is hard for those who do not have educational problems, it is even harder for those with communication and social behaviour problems. We need to ensure the provision of assistance to such people when moving to secondary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I recall speaking to a nun who worked in a convent in one of more deprived areas in the city. She told me that children in their first year at secondary school would benefit from more support. Many students fall out of the system during their first year in secondary school because they become overwhelmed by it all. I hope this issue will receive careful consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">It is shameful that our facilities in the area of child and adolescent psychiatry are poor. It is not as a Minister said in this House when I raised this point before that people do not apply for such jobs — the jobs do not exist. We must first create posts if we want people to apply for them. It is sad that the Irish College of Psychiatrists estimates that approximately €250 million needs to be spent on child and adolescent psychiatry. Children attending developmental paediatricians should be referred to psychologists or psychiatrists, but we do not have people in place to treat them. Such a service could make an enormous difference to the education of those for whom we are legislating. It is widely acknowledged that the earlier problems are diagnosed and dealt with, the better off will be those concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I warmly welcome the Bill. We need now only ensure that the Minister for Finance provides the money required to implement it. I am sure great will exists within schools to implement this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_453">I welcome the Minister of State. I am pleased she is present to hear the debate on this issue as I know she has empathy with the issue given her previous background of educational psychology.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I am glad the Title of the Bill has been changed because it represents a holistic approach to education for children with special educational needs and provides us with the freedom to ensure the rights of such children are guaranteed. That is to be welcomed. I am delighted the Bill has been teased out by so many teaching organisations within the teaching profession and by bodies which represent all forms of disability. The Bill has been broadly welcomed on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Legislation in this area up to now has included many <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements and much unfinished business in terms of how we handle such problems. Everything is going well on paper. This legislation puts in place a structure on how we deal and cope with the problems which may arise. It ensures, as provided for in the Constitution, that such children have a right to education, something which has not been stated in legislation up to now. That, too, is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">It is important we aim as much as possible towards assisting such children to blend into mainstream education and, if that is not possible, that we find a way around the problem. It is equally important we involve parents at all levels in the creation of educational plans. Existing arrangements have only dealt with issues in an <i>ad hoc</i> way. The Bill incorporates an appeals system for parents who feel the rights of their children are not being guaranteed. The Minister appears to have got everything right so far. However, we must ensure we have the resources to implement the Bill, an issue raised by all speakers in this and the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I am glad the Bill provides that the Ministers for Education and Science and Finance will have a statutory duty to provide the money to enable children to pursue an education which will allow them to develop to their full potential. I have a difficulty with the notion that while the implementation of the plan will commence immediately, it will take five years to complete. When a problem with a particular child is identified the class teacher, subject teacher or principal is informed. It does not take long to do that and having identified the problem, an assessment is then organised. It has been stated that such assessments could take up to three months. I do not understand why that is so. I am basing my argument on the model of which I have experience, that operated by the City of Dublin VEC. One should not have to wait three weeks for an assessment. It could be done within a week if one acts quickly having identified the problem and calls in the psychologist and informs the parents and guidance counsellor. With such a team it should be possible to have the assessment done quickly. It would be very easy for one to get the assessment done quickly and to form one's educational plan from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">One might also have an organiser from the national council. I am not sure what the organiser, who will be part of the education plan, will do. It is easy to solve simple problems, for example, by withdrawing a child from the classroom if he or she is not fulfilling his or her normal ability. I refer, for example, to children with good ability who have pulled out of the educational mainstream for whatever reason. One can cope with that, but one has to return to the special needs council in the more complex areas. I do not fully understand how it will work on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The progress of the education plan will be monitored. If we do not succeed, parents will have redress through the courts but it is natural that we do not want to go down that road. I welcome the Minister's reference to a process of mediation. Both parties — the parents representing the child and the various professionals dealing with the situation — will be able to meet to work out their positions rather than imposing a further burden on the parents. I welcome this measure because it represents the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The need for close co-operation between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science is an important issue. It was great on paper. Throughout my educational life, we felt we could ring the Department of Health and Children when problems existed in respect of dyslexia, ADD or other issues with health implications. We failed to get co-operation on every occasion, however, and we were sent from Billy to Jack. It is important that we fill the gap if we are to succeed with integration, co-ordination and co-operation. I refer to dyslexia and autism in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Trained professionals, such as remedial teachers and resource teachers, must be employed on the ground very quickly. Backup services must be provided in schools to help us to detect where problems exist and to formulate educational plans. Class teachers will not be knowledgeable in this regard without proper inservice training. One cannot expect a maths teacher, for example, to be able to organise an educational plan for a child with special educational needs. Such people need to be trained so they know what is involved. They need a backup team. On paper, the Bill is great but I am trying to imagine how it will work on the ground. We need to tease out this area further to ensure that what we are saying is workable. I believe it can work, but it is important that the right people are employed to work on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Senator Henry spoke about the transition from primary school to secondary school. There has always been a large gap in that regard. Problems were often picked up in first year, but it was too late at that stage. Major problems affecting children should be picked up. For example, one might not be able to understand why a child is falling out of the mainstream. Such issues should be noticed before first class. The Department of Health and Children has a role in that regard. Problems begin to manifest themselves before children reach the age of two. I would like entire plans to be worked out at primary level. I maintain that it is much too late when children reach the age of 13 or 14 because the transition has been completed at that stage. It is very hard to pull it back then. The emphasis should be placed on primary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">All speakers have mentioned the cut-off point of 18 years of age. We cannot use such a yardstick for children with special educational needs because they start late. More often than not, a child with such needs who has a chronological age of 18 has a mental age of six or eight. We should be in a position to make that more flexible. Each case should be analysed. If a child is doing well at the age of 18, we should not remove him or her from a programme. If children are doing well, they should be allowed to proceed in whatever environment, other than the mainstream education system, that allows them to continue with their education plans. I am looking for a change in the section that sets a cut-off point of 18 years. I do not like the idea of a cut-off point.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Funding is a major issue. If we are to implement the Bill properly, it is important that trained professionals are employed. We have it all on paper now, but I am concerned that it will not go any further. The principals of the schools may not be able to handle education plans because they do not have the personnel to do so. If one telephones a psychologist, he or she might be unable to give one an appointment because he or she might be too busy. One might have to wait for four or five months before the psychologist can get to one's school. More often than not, psychologists represent a region and have to cover a certain number of schools in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I believe in instant plans. If I identify the problem, I want to be able to get an assessment done within a short period of time, to be given the expertise to put a plan in motion and to monitor the plan. The parents, psychologists and teachers should be able to come in to monitor it, to examine the progress that is being made and to determine how best to move forward. If we include such a measure, provide the funding and make available the professional skills, this will be seen as a superb Bill. I look forward to seeing how it will work on the ground.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_466">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera. I congratulate her and her colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on the work that has been done in respect of the Bill to date. I am aware that it was substantially amended in the other House. A good cross-party consensus on the Bill was reached by, the Minister and the Opposition spokespersons in the Dáil. It is fair to say that the Bill before the House is a good one and I wish it well. However, I do not think the problem is this Bill or the other legislation in this area. It is like many other things in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Two parents in my constituency asked me to call to their house last week to discuss their seven year old child, who was diagnosed with high functioning autism two years ago. He is falling behind in his local national school, even though he receives six hours of special needs assistance each week. The assistance, which is more than most children get, is of great benefit to him. His mother and father have been pulling their hair out for the past two years. They have consulted various agencies but nobody has taken responsibility for the child's specific need for speech and language therapy. Senator Ormonde mentioned a range of general issues, but I would like to discuss this specific case. The child's parents have known about the diagnosis for two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I have worked out that four agencies are involved in this case — the National Educational Psychological Service, which is under the remit of the Department of Education and Science; the local health board, which takes responsibility for the appointment of speech and language therapists; the child's school, its teachers and its management; and Beechpark Services, which is part of the health board but is contracted to do special work with children who present with these difficulties. I have been doing my best to contact the four administrative agencies in recent days to find out if they can come together to decide when the child will receive some speech and language therapy. The longer he has to manage without such therapy, the further he will fall behind. His parents are concerned because nobody is responsible for developing a plan for the boy, who is falling behind. His special educational requirements, as they are currently constituted, do not fit the bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I hope that some element of responsibility will be provided for when the council meets to put together plans for each child, as is intended under this legislation. I accept that it is an issue of finance, but it is more than that — it is an issue of management. One cannot tolerate the continued involvement of three or four separate players in providing a service to a child because it means that nobody is responsible for anything. The health board took great pleasure in stating in a letter to the child's parents that it is no longer responsible for the child. I have a copy of the letter, which states that the child has been moved to another service. The board states it has done everything it can and that responsibility simply lies with another service now. It strikes me that some agencies take great pleasure in moving the cases that appear on their desks each day to other agencies. They regard it as a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">This is an issue of political responsibility. If a child presents with autism, dyspraxia, dyslexia or any of the problems that arise in special needs education, there should not only be early intervention but complete monitoring of that child's educational requirements through national school and one person must take responsibility for that, not four agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">In the early 1990s under various Ministers, not from the party opposite — Members can work out who I am talking about — there was a great demand for what were called inter-agency responses. Having been in politics for ten years, my experience is that when people talk about an inter-agency response it is an excuse to do nothing or for one agency to wring its hands while the other takes the rap. When this Bill is enacted and the council is working, with all the resources in place, we must put the responsibility on one person to take charge of that child up to the age of 18. That person will then be held accountable for the services he or she puts in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I wish the Bill well. The Government's intentions are correct. I realise there will be calls for resources but I appeal for better management of the services, less foot dragging and more responsibility on the part of all the agencies involved. Why does the area of speech and language therapy come under the Department of Health and Children and not the Department of Education and Science? If we are talking about providing speech and language therapists for which, from my knowledge on the ground, there is a great need it should come exclusively from within the Department of Education and Science. That would give the Department greater control in providing additional places.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I understand Trinity College, Dublin, is the only college operating this course. Will the Minister outline when replying her Department's plans, and those of Trinity College, to expand radically the number of undergraduate courses? Hundreds of speech and language therapists are needed. They are not available currently and the two options available are to increase the intake to the undergraduate course or purchase them from abroad. There are gaps in the service because we do not have enough therapists in place. I ask the Minister to respond to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">On the issue of special needs assistants, credit is due to the Department over the past few years and in regard to the announcement made by the Minster recently. We now have many more special needs assistants in place, which is welcome. In trying to formalise this area does the Department have the view that we should have a number of designated special needs assistants assigned to each school rather than to various children in that school? Once the child goes through that school, while they get extra hours per week, which is helpful, there are other children who cannot even get that level of assistance. A school in my constituency which has six special needs assistants asked if it would not make more management sense to allocate those assistants to the school rather than to the children. I would be interested in hearing the Minister's reply in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">If a child is falling behind as a result of one of these problems, a useful practice is to encourage him or her over the summer months in particular to get extra help. A very good scheme is run by the Department where extra help with tuition is put in place over the summer months but in regard to the child I met last week with his mother and father, they have only recently been told by the Department that they can get summer tuition, which I understand is three hours a day, four days a week between now and the end of August. The parents' dilemma, however, is that they have to find a teacher to take up that offer but how many teachers would take it up in the two months they are off? Is there not a greater responsibility on the National Educational Psychological Service, or the Department, to specifically provide extra help to parents of these children over the summer months rather than putting the responsibility on them to find a teacher? Without the help of their local school, the parents in the case I am bringing to the attention of the House would not know where to turn. Even in that school environment there is no one who could provide two months' help to the child. The Department, and NEPS in particular, have a major role to play in providing extra help at key times in the year when the school is closed for holidays.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I echo a point made by Senator Hayes and other colleagues. The key time for a child is in primary school. Children with these types of difficulties can make amazing progress if the intervention is made at an early time. We must focus our efforts on giving all of them the potential to deliver their best in terms of their educational opportunities. It is about delivering opportunities for everyone. Our focus must be on primary school level and we must work to address the problem of the approximately 20% of the current cohort who either do not make it through to senior cycle or else lose out in terms of basic numeracy and literacy skills. We are all aware of the difficulties in terms of literacy skills. Perhaps I am old-fashioned but I believe the basics have to be got right first and the way to do that is to pour resources into our primary school system.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I wish the Government and the Minister every success. I have always admired the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera. She is a humble Minister. She does not highlight her achievements the way other Ministers do from time to time. She gets on with her work in a quiet and dignified fashion and I have always appreciated that fact. I wish her well in this area in which I am aware she has a keen interest. We need a Minister like the Minister of State working on the commitments that will be put in place when the Bill is enacted. It does not matter how many agencies are put in place. Unless people take responsibility for their actions and there is proper accountability in terms of the money allocated to a service, we will not get the dramatic change we need in terms of providing fair opportunities for these children.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_478">I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House. It is fitting that she is taking this Bill. I was mulling over the comments I might make when Senator Hayes recognised the tremendous qualities of the Minister of State, particularly regarding education and her capacity to think outside the box. I am aware she has made great strides in regard to funding post leaving certificate courses, which is of particular importance, and also in this area. In too many cases education is regarded as being about the points race and students getting into college. It is obvious that the Minister has a great regard for the importance of allowing everybody to achieve their ultimate goal and that the education system should be there for everybody, regardless of their abilities or disabilities and their ultimate potential. The reality is that education provided by the State should be for everybody. That will allow everybody attain their individual goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">There has been a welcome discussion of the Bill in the House. Senator Hayes indicated that there have been significant changes to the original Bill by virtue of a wide-ranging and bipartisan approach to it in the other House, which is welcome. The same trend is developing here and that is particularly welcome because no individual or party has complete wisdom in terms of all the knowledge associated with education. I welcome the good approach to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I share the views, as I know does the Minister, of many speakers particularly in regard to the funding elements. In some cases funding has not been made available to the extent it might, although within that framework much work has been done and, in terms of the funding provided, great strides have been made. There is a continued need to enhance the finance available.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Bill provides the statutory framework in which the education of children with special needs will be catered for and guaranteed as a right. It is particularly welcome that this right is enforceable in law, something that has been debated for a while. It will give great comfort to people going forward because when legislation such as this is passed, it will not necessarily be dealt with by the current crop of politicians but it sets an agenda. Regardless of who is in power in the future, the rights will be enforceable in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I am aware people have made comments, as I have, about the funding but much progress has been made. The Department of Education and Science has made tremendous progress over the past few years in this area.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_485">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_486">That Seanad Éireann,</p>
          <p eId="para_487">—alarmed at the growing crisis in accident and emergency services throughout the State,</p>
          <p eId="para_488">—noting that, by the admission of the Minister for Health and Children, over €400 million worth of new hospital facilities are lying idle because of Government failure to provide funding for equipment and staffing and</p>
          <p eId="para_489">—noting that sufficient funds are available to the Government to bring all the unused facilities into operation,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_490">condemns this scandalous dereliction of duty by the Government and demands that the Minister for Health and Children immediately provides sufficient resources to bring all the unused hospital facilities into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">No Member can debate the health service without mentioning the crisis in accident and emergency services. This motion addresses the extraordinary situation where, in the words of the Minister for Health and Children, approximately €500 million worth of capital investment in hospitals and health facilities is lying idle because the Government cannot organise the funding to run those very facilities. I am grateful to the authors of the Government amendment to this motion. Among their glowing praise for the Government's achievements, the substantial capital investment of €1.7 billion in health infrastructure spent between 2000 and 2003 is included. The equivalent of 25% of the capital expenditure is now lying idle.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I am not sure whether this debate should focus on the health services or incompetence. The incompetence spins off into the most appalling consequences for those who are sick and need hospital services. It is difficult to know how many cities and towns this spin-off affects. In Dublin city, a €100 million hospital wing is empty. In Cork city, a much touted and sung and danced about accident and emergency service is unused. In Clonmel, which I visited on my recent electoral adventures, a €30 million hospital wing is also unused. It is the same in Mayo, Letterkenny and many other places. Each of these cases impacts on individuals' health, security and sense of well-being. Each damages people's belief that they are safe if they fall ill. However, it is worse in terms of what it says about the Government's incompetence. It suggests that it cannot plan or organise, leaving gaps in the hope that in the future something will turn up. A health service based on such a premise will only turn up pain, suffering and disaster for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The Government has decided that it will not make the necessary money available to bring the health service up to a proper standard. Recently, my secretary, on my behalf, sent out an e-mail query on hospital waiting lists to EU member state embassies in Dublin. The German Embassy's reply was prompt and Germanic, stating that there are no hospital waiting lists in Germany. The Austrian reply stated that there are only waiting lists for orthopaedic and ophthalmology services. Yet, it is part of this Government's mythology that waiting lists are inevitable. The Government has actually redefined the abolition of waiting lists as having no one waiting for more than three months. Ireland has defined the lower end of its expectations at the upper end of public patients in the rest of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The Government believes that only going some of the way is sufficient. It boasts of spending €1.7 billion on capital investment, yet a quarter of that investment remains unused. Some of it is even used for offices or to keep private security firms in business as they prevent the facilities from being vandalised. In south Tipperary, a person from Clonmel at the most critical part of an illness that requires surgical care has to be moved to Cashel, a distance of 15 miles. In a good hospital at such a time, moving the person from one ward to another would require proper medical supervision.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">This occurs because someone in Government decided the money will not be spent. There are two possible reasons for this decision. The first is incompetence, which I would almost prefer to believe because incompetent people can be shamed into a modicum of competence. Underlying this is an indifference to the human suffering it causes. The second reason is the reactionary position of the Department of Finance. Today, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, re-articulated it, in classically flamboyant fashion, when he claimed every view except his on how to run the economy is wrong. He continued that if he was not Minister, the financial world would take fright and refuse to invest in Ireland. When a Minister for Finance begins to talk in those terms, it is time to get rid of him. Once anyone in a position of power believes that he or she is indispensable, it is time to remove him or her. The fundamental problem with the Minister, his Department and the Government, which is dominated by the Minister and the ideology he shares with the minority party in Government is that it is dangerously hurtful to ordinary people. It is also wrong, because wrong figures have been used.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The Government took comfort from an analysis in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> by an economist who because he did not understand health spending figures, gave a completely wrong perspective on Ireland’s comparative performance on health expenditure. He suggested that we were near the top of the league and that the problem was therefore one of incompetent management, an argument the Department of Finance loves, which is why it will not pay out the extra expenditure to open these facilities. It prefers to believe that the problem is inefficient use of sufficient resources. That is the view of the Minister for Finance and his Department and it has prevailed over the views of every other Department and over the Taoiseach. The result is that in terms of capital costs, a quarter of the facilities provided by the Government over the years 2002 to 2003 lie idle.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The trouble with the view taken by the Department of Finance is that it is factually wrong. The OECD health data of 2004, including tables and charts from a news release issued on 3 June 2004, less than four weeks ago, show that Irish health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product stands at 7.3%. The countries spending less are Turkey, Mexico, Poland, Korea, Slovakia and Luxembourg. All of the other OECD countries spend a greater proportion of their GDP on health than we do. A civilised country like Germany, where there are no hospital waiting lists, spends 10.9% of its GDP on health care. The figure for the United States is 14.6%. If ever there was an argument against the use of the private market as a way of organising health care, the United States experience of having the highest percentage of GDP expenditure and the highest growth rate in expansion of costs over the past few years provides it.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">We are seventh from the bottom of the OECD league in health care expenditure. The fundamental problem is that we will not spend sufficient money. One can have all the ideological twaddle one wants from the Department of Finance, the Progressive Democrats and that party's Minister for Finance, but while there are many problems with the Irish health service, the fundamental one is that it is underfunded to a scandalous degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The amendment lists all the alleged glorious achievements of the Government. As a percentage of GDP, in the five years of the previous Government, from 1997 to 2002, our expenditure on health increased by less than 1%, perhaps the lowest rise in the OECD. What has happened in the case of the €450 million of capital expenditure is that ideology has clashed with reality. When that happens, when one has the rigid ideology that has driven this Government, and has driven Fianna Fáil into its worst electoral disaster in 80 years, facts get lost, reality is denied and one ends up with the crazy situation of hospitals worth close to €500 million lying idle because trivial sums will not be spent on them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_500">I second the motion. Once again we return to the thorny subject of Irish health services. It will not be the last time, considering the state of the health services and the widespread disquiet and dissatisfaction with how the Government is mismanaging them. In that regard, the scandal of unopened facilities, hospitals built yet lying idle, unopened, is one of the greatest examples of the level of mismanagement of the public finances and of the health services in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Some years ago, to great noise and acclaim — attempted, at least — the Government announced spending on the national development plan and €2 billion was set aside for health capital spending. Arising from that, a number of capital projects, all of them overdue and greatly needed, were embarked on. The spending and the building began. That was welcome. The same Government, which allocated the money for capital spending for building wards, extensions and so on then said that the money was not available to staff them. Hence we have an extraordinary situation where all over the country there are facilities lying idle, facilities on which millions of euro of public money have been spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">There are related problems involving mismanagement of the health services, particularly with regard to the shortage of nurses. That is another issue, which I hope I will have time to consider. The examples of what is lying idle, along with the reasons for the situation, constitute a scandal. No sooner had the Government returned to the corridors of power after the last general election, having promised the sun, moon and stars, than the Minister for Finance announced the famous cutbacks, which he had said would never happen. This was followed by the wonderful concept of the existing level of service, which according to an extensive article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on 2 May, based on a Cabinet memo, is the fundamental reason why the tap was turned off for health spending, in particular with regard to the staffing and equipping of these facilities, for which a massive amount of money had been provided. The result of the introduction of the notion of existing level of service is a new spending policy to discipline Departments, making no sense at all, and a classic example of how not to manage the public finances and in particular how not to manage health spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Let us look at a few examples of what is not working or not open as a result of the unbelievable mismanagement by the Government. The examples from the Government's own list include a new hospital at Naas, with 56 beds; the transfer of services to the new €90 million wing at James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown; a new 22-bed facility at University College Hospital Galway; a new maternity suite in Letterkenny; a new 12-bed assessment unit in Mullingar; a new trauma elective orthopaedic service in Mayo and a new accident and emergency and medical assessment unit at Roscommon. Also due was the commissioning of a new hospital at St. James's Hospital in Dublin with 62 beds, extra theatres at Our Lady's Hospital in Dublin and the completion later this year of the long-awaited radiotherapy unit in Galway. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, put these initiatives a few months ago to the Government in order to release the stranglehold of the Department of Finance and have these facilities opened by means of a small amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The list goes on. Other examples include the development of a 90-bed community nursing unit at Birr, County Offaly, elderly care units in Cork and Wexford and the funding of almost €10 million to improve services for the homeless in Dublin, Cork, Kerry, Galway and Limerick. In the same memo the Minister stressed the urgent need within the health services to open these long-awaited new facilities but his argument clearly fell on deaf ears because nothing has happened since. I wonder when anything will happen. A housekeeper knows how to manage finances but the way the Government is managing finances in this context is horrendous. I have no doubt it will be the subject of major commentary at some stage by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">My colleague, Senator Ryan, referred to the crisis in accident and emergency services. We are very aware from media reports of the crisis in Dublin accident and emergency services. There is clearly a crisis throughout the country arising from an acute shortage of beds. Against this background, the Government wants to downgrade several hospitals throughout the country and cause an even greater shortage of beds. The same Government says it will replace these beds in new facilities in the so-called super hospitals. However, if the current service is anything to go by, that promise is not to be relied upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I would like to relay for the Minister of State a true story, which I heard during the recent election campaign when I was canvassing in Newport, which is near Limerick. I met a woman whose son seriously injured his hand over the bank holiday weekend. She thanked God for Nenagh Hospital because she was able to bring him there. I said that was interesting and that I thought she would be closer to Limerick Regional Hospital. The mother replied that I must be joking, that she would not go there in a million years because they would be waiting for three days to be treated and that at Nenagh one is treated more or less straight away. Arising out of that, a number of people from Birdhill to Castleconnell said no way would they go to Limerick; they always go to Nenagh to be treated in an efficient and caring manner. The accident and emergency unit in Limerick Regional Hospital simply cannot cope with the demand for its services. People on the ground know that the notion of downgrading accident and emergency services in places like Ennis and Nenagh is a daft and dangerous idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This is the Government we are relying on to expand services. This is the Government that keeps telling us how much money it has spent on health services. It has done us a favour in its amendment to our motion because it has set out clearly some of the resources that were put into health. It is not surprising, therefore, that the public is asking if all this money has been spent, why are there increasingly long waiting lists and increasingly long waiting times in accident and emergency units? Why is it virtually impossible to get a bed and why is the health service so mismanaged? It is a fundamental point and it was one of the major issues during the recent election campaign. People are aware that massive amounts of their money have been spent on a health service, which is simply not delivering. It is not delivering the service people want where and when they need it. People know the reason is that the investment has been mismanaged. The particular example contained in the motion is the most blatant and obvious instance of how the Government has completely mismanaged the health service.</p>

          <p eId="para_525">Since coming into office, the largest ever expansion in health funding has been accompanied by unprecedented work on planning comprehensively for the future. Each day tens of thousands of people use the health service and receive the highest quality care. A survey carried out in 2002 by the Irish Society for Quality and Safety in Health Care tested the attitudes of 1,800 patients who had been through the acute system. The results indicated that 92.9% were satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of care they received.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_528">We know what Members opposite did when they had the opportunity. The health system has had enough people pretending there is a magic remedy which will cure all our ills. People voted for Fianna Fáil because they promised and will deliver sustained action on these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Fianna Fáil is committed to a programme of investment and reform involving all elements of the system. The health strategy is the core of that programme. Since its publication, it has set the agenda for health. This is a strategy for fundamental reform, which is unprecedented in its depth and vision, based upon partnership with patients and professionals who are most familiar with the needs of the health services. The only way to deliver an effective strategy for the entire health service is to ensure that it is based on a progressive programme of research and negotiation, which was utterly absent before the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government took office in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Since coming into office, we have implemented the largest sustained increase in the history of the health service. In four years, between 1997 and 2001, the <i>per capita</i> spend on health has risen from fifth from the bottom of the EU scale to just above the EU average. The Opposition refuses to acknowledge any progress in any area. The argument is based on hyperbole, not fact. It constantly ignores and misrepresents what has happened and what is under way. Opposition Members will not acknowledge that the Government has delivered the largest sustained programme of increases in the history of our health services. They will not acknowledge that approximately 200,000 more people are being treated in our hospitals. They will not acknowledge that in the past year there was a 42% reduction in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment and a 39% reduction in the number of children waiting more than six months. They will not acknowledge that work is well under way in more than 80% of the health strategy’s actions. They will not acknowledge that a percentage of gross national product in Exchequer funding for health is the highest figure for almost 20 years, even though we have been through a period of massive growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Fianna Fáil is the only party interested in developing our health services rather than just using it as a populist football. The sole objective of our policy is to develop a service where employees are enabled to work to the best of their ability and every patient has equal access to high quality care. We have increased health spending by over 188% since 1997 and will continue with this unprecedented investment. In addition, we are carrying out the most radical programme of change for the health sector since the establishment of the health board structures in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">We are not interested in the empty soundbites perpetuated by some on the other side of the House. Of course, in recent times there has been much talk from Fine Gael and the Labour Party about a democratic alternative. The reality is that the record of the parties of the self-styled coalition of the caring, from the last time they held office, does not compare favourably to the progress of recent times.</p>

The Opposition parties were in prime position to drive the agenda of investment and reform in our health services. However, they failed abjectly on both counts. I remind Senators on the opposite side of the House that waiting lists stood at 23,000 in December 1994 when the Labour Party and Fine Gael, with Deputy Noonan as Minister for Health, assumed control of the health services. In their programme for Government, they spelled out clearly that they would continue the progress of the previous two years in reducing waiting lists. What happened? Despite their pledge, waiting lists rose by 27% under that Government from approximately 23,000 in December 1994 to approximately 30,000 in June 1997.</p>

However, it was not done. Starting from the low base left by the coalition, we have increased the health spend by over €10 billion, an increase of 188%.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I admit that while much has been done, much more needs to be done. Negotiations are ongoing between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. I am always amused when I hear the Labour Party advising us on how we should care for our health system and health professionals. A Labour Party Deputy held the position of Minister for Finance yet when parity was sought by the retired nurses who had built the health services, he would not give it to them. Not alone that, the Labour Party's then leader attempted over the airwaves to chastise the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, for having granted parity, for which I strongly commend them. Moreover, to his eternal credit, the Minister, Deputy Martin, provided funding for a number of health boards, including the Midland Health Board, to effect the out-of-hours general practitioners' service which has ensured that a quality of life never before enjoyed by general practitioners or the general community is now available. The facts speak for themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_545">The health services are a mess and getting worse. Mr. Paul Byrne from Tallaght, after a visit to hospital during which his trolley was taken for another patient while he went to the toilet, stated: "The next time I go to A&amp; E, I would rather not be breathing."</p>

          <p eId="para_547">It is a serious indictment of the health services. On 22 June last, 150 patients were on trolleys in ERHA hospitals. On 26 April, 160 were on trolleys in Dublin hospitals while on 26 February, the figure was 150. On 5 February, St. James's Hospital Dublin had to invoke a major incident plan due to overcrowding in accident and emergency. On 3 February, 207 patients were waiting on trolleys in Dublin accident and emergency units and the figure for 7 January was 179. The facts speak for themselves and belie the notion of an efficient health service. It is a mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is ironic that this situation pertained while Ireland held the Presidency of the EU. Perhaps those on the Government side are confused by the fact that the Taoiseach held the Presidency and they have been using EU figures. I am talking about the Irish figures because the Irish Presidency finished today.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_550">I apologise. More worrying for those waiting on trolleys is that while June is supposed to be a quiet time for accident and emergency, the numbers are not much better than during the winter months. This indicates that the situation is at crisis point.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Despite bumper spending of €10.8 billion on the health budget, funding is not getting through on the ground. Similar problems have been expressed throughout the year at University Hospital, Galway, Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, the Midlands Regional Hospital in Tullamore, the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick and Naas General Hospital. In April of this year, nurses at Wexford General Hospital worked under protest in the accident and emergency unit because of the intolerable working conditions they had to endure due to a lack of beds and inadequate staffing. The excessive overcrowding in accident and emergency units is resulting in staff being left in unacceptable and unsafe environments.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">In November 2002, the Minister stated in his review of the health strategy with the national consultative forum in Dublin Castle:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_553">The health strategy had promised to provide 450 public beds during 2002. By the end of the year, we are on target to have 600 in place, all of them designated for public use only. 109 more will be in place early next year. The money has been found; the money has been allocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The Minister promised that the remainder of the beds would be in place by early 2003.</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_555">How many beds?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_556">The Minister promised 709 beds but they have not been allocated. Those beds were supposed to be the first phase of an additional 3,000 acute hospital beds, which were promised on the health strategy by 2011. However, given the pace and failure to deliver on the first phase, questions arise as to whether the Government will be able to deliver urgently on any of the additional 3,000 beds. It is a serious issue that the beds promised for 2003 are not in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In tandem with the accident and emergency crisis, community services are being cut. People regularly come to my office seeking carers and various allowances. Many acute admissions could be prevented and, in other cases, early discharge could be facilitated if the community supports were in place. Despite this, valuable community employment supports are being cut. Some 200,000 extra medical cards were promised at the last general election but, instead, over 46,500 medical cards were withdrawn. Approximately 20,000 people are now on hospital waiting lists despite a pre-election promise by the Minister to eliminate them within two years. In addition, community services for the elderly are being cut back. This is having a major effect on accident and emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Approximately €460 million worth of hospital facilities are lying idle because the Government has failed to provide the necessary money to open them. Process meetings have been held all over the country. We saw what happened during the local elections. There are facilities to be opened in Dublin, Mayo, Clonmel and Letterkenny. The opening of a €10.5 million orthopaedic unit at Mayo General Hospital has been cancelled due to lack of funding. The unit was due to be fully operational from 1 July but following developments in recent weeks, people are beginning to wonder whether Mayo will ever see orthopaedic services again. Two weeks ago it was announced that out-patients would be treated in Mayo General Hospital from 1 July. A date in September has yet to be confirmed for the commencement of services for in-patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In Dublin, most of a €96 million wing of James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown has never been used. In Ballymun, a brand new health centre, worth approximately €48 million, has been lying vacant since it was finished more than 18 months ago. During this time the Northern Area Health Board has paid an estimated €5.2 million in rent for the facility. I state again that if the health service were a private company, the CEO would have to resign. It is a mess. I am surprised to see an amendment to the Labour Party motion.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_560">I thank Senators for the opportunity to discuss the health service. I am glad the amendment to the motion has been moved on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">This Government has invested unprecedented levels of capital and revenue funding in our health services. It is important to appreciate that from a very low base, we have built up and will continue to enhance the infrastructure of our health system to provide modern and accessible health facilities. I will deal with some of the points that have been made in the contributions of Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">It is important to put the provision of acute hospital services in context. Over the last two or three decades there have been numerous important advances in surgical technology and anaesthesia. These advances have greatly improved the range, safety and effectiveness of the procedures that can be offered by modern health systems. Modern medicine has allowed us to live longer and have a better quality of life. As a consequence, however, there have been dramatic increases in the demand for treatment. When people say the health service is chaotic, a mess or not working, they are wrong. By any yardstick, over the last 20 years modern health care systems have worked. They have been far more successful in the quality of their interventions and their outcomes. This is true across the OECD and also in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">We have different pressures and demands now than we had ten or 20 years ago. I recently heard Tom McGurk interviewing a man who had suffered from leukaemia. He said that if this had happened to him 15 years ago his chances of overcoming the disease would have been much less. We are making successful interventions. I will detail our progress in terms of the development of our health care system. That is not to say there is no pressure or that there are no difficulties associated with modern demands arising from an ageing population.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">To help Senators understand the complexity and scale of our acute hospital system, I offer some statistics to provide a context. The number of patients discharged from hospital having been treated as either in-patients or day cases in 2003 was more than 1 million. This represents an increase of more than 25% in the number of patients treated compared to 1997, when around 780,000 were treated, and is the first time the number has exceeded 1 million. Day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care in Ireland. Evidence shows that much of this growth is the result of technological and medical innovations such as less invasive surgery and advances in anaesthetics.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">There has been a staggering increase of nearly 80% in day case procedures between 1997 and 2003, from 245,000 to 440,000. That statistic alone proves we cannot go around saying the system is a mess or in chaos. That growth is a benchmark for a modern approach to health care. All our teaching hospitals are at that level in terms of day case procedures and volumes. This reflects the increasing ability of the hospital system to treat more patients on a day basis, where patients are admitted and discharged on the same day. Productivity has increased. Despite all the talk of a black hole that absorbs money, productivity has increased year on year. Hospitals are dealing with more people even within existing envelopes.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">In 2003, there were 1.2 million attendances at emergency medicine departments and 2.2 million attendances at acute hospital out-patient departments. This shows that as a population we are quite active in accessing services. The increasing capacity of the public hospital system to treat more patients is a product of the significant investment by the Government in health services. This year the Government has provided a gross allocation of €10 billion for the health service, which is nearly double the level of funding in 1997. One example of how this investment has yielded results is the increase in medical consultant numbers. According to the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on consultant staffing, on 1 January 2004 there were 1,824 consultant posts in the public sector. This represents an increase of 41% over the last six years. This means that more people are being treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Senator Feighan said the health service was a mess. However, let us consider the cardiovascular health strategy. There is no comparison between the quality of interventions in this area currently and that of five or six years ago. Since the launch of the cardiovascular health strategy in July 1999, €54 million has been invested in its implementation. Almost 800 new staff were appointed in the first years of implementation, from 139 health promotion officers to 113 primary care and pre-hospital care personnel. Pre-hospital care is vital, supporting prevention, diagnosis and rapid response among people in the community. This is a key issue in terms of cardiovascular health.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">A total 328 hospital-based professionals have been employed and funding for the appointment of 17 additional consultant cardiologists has been provided. This represents the largest increase in cardiologist numbers in the history of the State. The majority of these will be coming into the system this year. The number of cardiology procedures has more than doubled over a short period. An additional 109 cardiac rehabilitation staff are now in place and every acute hospital treating people with heart disease has developed structured cardiac rehabilitation services. I have spoken to people who have benefited from these services and they are enthusiastic about the difference it has made to their recovery and their return to normal life after serious heart trouble. In terms of information systems, audit and research, we have provided additional staff to improve quality and agree on guidelines and protocols for patient care.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The bottom line is that when we talk about health care in Ireland we must remember the objective of public health policy is to reduce the incidence of mortality and morbidity from heart disease and cancer. These are the major causes of death and illness in society, along with injury and accidents. People ask where all the money has gone. We have strategically allocated major resources to the treatment of heart disease and cancer in order to change the story of modern Ireland in terms of what we die from and what makes us ill and therefore reduces our quality of life. Accident and emergency services are extremely important, but they are not the only piece of the jigsaw. We must consider the big picture. We want people to, live longer, with improved quality of life. Through an aggressive, focused and strategic approach to heart disease and cancer we are achieving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Since 1997 there has been a cumulative investment of €550 million in cancer services. Once again I made this a priority in 2004, despite the existing envelope of financial provision. Although we had to live with 2003 levels of funding we managed to provide additional funding for cancer services. That has enabled the approval of an additional 92 consultant posts over the last number of years in key areas of cancer services, including medical oncology, histopathology and oncology surgery. The benefit of this can be seen in the substantial increase in activity levels in the three modalities of cancer treatment. For example, since 1996 the annual number of discharges of patients receiving chemotherapy has more than doubled, from 22,000 in 1996 to more than 50,000 in 2002. Similarly, for radiotherapy the increase in discharges reported at Cork University Hospital increased from less than 7,000 cases in 1996 to nearly 15,000 in 2002. There has been a 36% increase nationally in surgical procedures for breast cancer, with an additional 500 procedures performed in 2002 compared to 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The complexity of the care today is different. I recently opened the radiotherapy unit in the Cork University Hospital. It has a state-of-the-art brachytherapy facility and 13 professionals will be involved in the treatment of one patient. That is an indication of the complexity of a radiotherapy and brachytherapy centre, which is not often appreciated or understood by people who ask where the money is going. If we want world class quality care, that is the type of facility in which we must invest, and it must be done across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">In terms of the national development plan, anybody who is honest about the scale of development will acknowledge that progress is being made in addressing the historical deficits in health infrastructure. A range of major projects have been completed, are in planning or under construction across all health care programmes. Capital funding provided under the NDP for health services has also allowed for the commencement of important new initiatives in other health areas such as putting in place new infrastructure to support and develop the area of information and communications technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Long-term progress means long-term investment in facilities. In the past three years alone the health capital budget involved spending some €1.7 billion. The capital investment framework for health between 2004 and 2008 amounts to some €2.7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">In terms of a historical deficit, I have travelled the country and I have seen some of our hospitals and some our older community nursing units. Many of them date back to the last century and the previous one. We had a significant long-term deficit because there was little incremental capital investment in health until the NDP came on stream and an envelope for health for three or four years was given to begin modernising the plant, along with ongoing minor capital. The system lived hand-to-mouth because of economic and financial circumstances for 20 or 30 years. The concrete result of the capital investment in the health service is evident all around the country by way of new, expanded or refurbished health care facilities. For example, a major construction project has been completed at University College Hospital Galway. I invite anyone to go to UCHG. More than €120 to €200 million will have been spent by the time it is complete. What that is doing for the west is making all specialties available to public patients who heretofore had to travel to Dublin for heart surgery or radiotherapy and other specialist treatment. That is being put in place for the west in a modern infrastructure which did not exist before. Many new units in that area have been commenced. More development is needed, but much has already happened at that site. A new acute psychiatric unit has been provided at St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny. These are examples. There are others around the country. A new extension has been built at Portlaoise General Hospital. I visited that recently. There was no comparison between paediatric services in Portlaoise today and the services that were previously available. Anyone in the health service in the area will say the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Senator Feighan's suggestion that matters have got worse with all the money is rubbish. Portlaoise hospital is one example that proves that is not true. One only needs to compare the acute psychiatric unit there and the quality of the building to what was there before. One need only look at the paediatric unit. One cannot say with any credibility that the system has got worse. It has got infinitely better in terms of the quality of care in many instances.</p>

People are saying they need this and that in order to move from a very dilapidated old system to a modern facility. It beggars belief that people are making that type of demand when I would have thought there would be an enthusiasm to move to a new facility. Neither is it a question of signing a blank cheque for service providers to staff a new unit. There must be realism in terms of additionality and staffing and there must be negotiation. The idea that we will cave in and sign off on whatever is demanded is not realistic. That will not happen. That is an important point.</p>

The big issues at global level in any major international debate on health are financial sustainability, the ageing population and the health care costs of meeting the demands of an ageing population, which I accept we have not addressed properly as a society.

          <p eId="para_599">In terms of primary care, the strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, recognises that the Irish health system places considerable reliance on hospital care and that an appropriately developed primary care system can meet 90-95% of all health and personal social service needs. This strategy sets out a new direction for primary care as the central focus for the delivery of health and personal social services. It promotes a team-based approach to service provision which will help to provide a fully integrated primary care service. A properly integrated primary care service can lead to better outcomes, better health status and better cost effectiveness. Appropriately developed, primary care services can help prevent or reduce the impact of conditions that might later require hospitalisation and can also facilitate earlier hospital discharge. Overall, a strengthened primary care system can have a significant impact in alleviating demands on specialist services and the hospital system, particularly accident and emergency and outpatient services.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The motion refers to difficulties in accident and emergency. I am concerned about the current situation and the difficulties being experienced by patients. Patients should be treated with dignity and respect. The problems in accident and emergency cannot be dealt with in isolation as many of the difficulties and delays being experienced by patients reflect system-wide issues, which demand a multi-dimensional approach. In order to deal with the current pressures on acute services both in the shorter and longer term I would like to briefly outline some of the key actions I have taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">It has been widely documented that there are a number of patients in acute hospital beds who have completed their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The availability of suitable sub-acute beds is a particular problem in the eastern and southern areas. In this regard I have provided additional funding of €17.6 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and to the Southern Health Board to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospitals to a more appropriate setting, thus freeing up acute beds. This funding allows for the funding through the subvention system of additional beds in the private nursing home sector and ongoing support in the community. I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that nearly 300 patients have been discharged so far from acute hospitals as a direct result of this funding. The Southern Health Board has reported that some 350 patients from the southern region have benefited from the initiative. It is a different initiative as up until now, we have been pumping money into nursing homes to make up the slack. In Dublin, there is an historical lack of district hospitals, many of which were closed in the 1980s and early 1990s along with the community nursing units.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_605">Last year we asked the system to come up with a more innovative approach on how to deal with the discharge policy. The Southern Health Board came up with a very good initiative which the Department funded and asked to be replicated in the eastern region. It has worked more effectively in the south through the effective management of the discharge which leads to a better turnover. We have met with the hospital management and we will continue to emphasise that. Unfortunately, when 300 people are discharged, another 300 take their place. The long-term care issue is the key to accident and emergency in Dublin. The discharge of patients to appropriate long-term care settings is a critical factor. Some hospitals have come up with different approaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The system of subventions for nursing homes was introduced in the early 1990s. In 1993, it started off with €5 million. In 1997 it increased to €35 million and by 2003 it had reached €110 million. This year it will reach €120 million or higher. That gives the range and speed of the leap forward made. It also reflects the ageing issue. In Dublin there has been less investment in community care than there has been around the country. That is a historical development. The strength in community and connections to community are not as strong now in urban areas as they would have been 20 or 30 years ago. All that has impinged on the hospital accident and emergency department.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">There are now 51 emergency medicine consultant posts in acute hospitals as opposed to 14 in 1997. That is the largest increase in any specialty aside from the cancer and heart specialities. We have also invested in additional nursing staff and security arrangements in accident and emergency departments. We are being told by the hospitals that this has resulted in better clinical decision making in the hospitals in the accident and emergency departments, as well as enhanced management diagnosis and treatment of patients. There are huge pressures on accident and emergency departments but the actual quality of the management of the patient is better. Unfortunately, overcrowding repeatedly occurs because of the wider issues across the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The other issue is bed capacity. The acute hospital bed capacity national review called for 3,000 beds by 2011. We said we could provide 709. The base funding is in place for that and 589 of those beds have already been commissioned. We have exceeded the target of 450 private beds through the national treatment purchase fund, which has now treated up to 15,000 patients on the waiting lists. Many hospitals are down to six months, while some are down to three months waiting times for surgical procedures. The dedicated funding stream is eating into the waiting list. The validation by the hospitals of the lists would open one's eyes on how big the waiting list really is. We have been given a figure of 20,000 to 21,000 for the waiting list. This validation occurs when people out there are asked whether they are available for the operation. In many instances people did not need the operation, had had the operation and so on. It will be interesting to follow the evolution of the management of the waiting lists by the NTPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Emergency medicine departments sometimes have to deal with injuries and conditions, which are more appropriate to a primary care setting. General practitioner out-of-hours co-operatives have been established and are operating in at least part of all health board areas, with one health board, the North Eastern Health Board, having a region-wide project. Between 2000 and 2003, €46.5 million was allocated to the health boards for the purpose of out-of-hours co-operatives and this figure does not include the fees paid to participating GPs. An amount of €24 million has been allocated for 2004. The satisfaction rate with the GP co-operative service is very high from both patient and provider perspectives. In fact a recent survey by the Western Health Board's service, WestDoc, indicated that of the persons surveyed, 30% said that they would have gone to the emergency medicine department if the service had not been available.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">However, there is one difficulty. This is happening all over the country but not in Dublin. Dublin is the one problem area for out-of-hours GP cover. Despite our allocation and offer of funding, there has not been a take-up. There is not the same enthusiasm in Dublin for the establishment of out-of-hours GP co-operatives. Around the country, doctors are approaching us in delegations, asking when will they be provided with extra money to complete the coverage in a health board area. That has never happened in the Dublin area. The ERHA has informed me that it is working with various interests to see if it can come up with a solution for Dublin. That has a bearing on the anecdotal evidence that an accident and emergency unit at night effectively serves as a GP, where people attend the accident and emergency department as a first response. We allocated funding out in Dublin for GP co-operatives, but the ERHA was not in a position to get agreement to provide out-of-hours cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">In order to address the needs of patients presenting at the emergency department some hospitals have established minor injury or illness units. These units provide rapid assessment and appropriate treatment of minor injuries by nurse practitioners or junior doctors. The main advantages of having a separate minor injuries area within the emergency department include the better streamlining of patients and decreased waiting times. St. John's Hospital in Limerick is a very good example of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The processing of patients through the emergency services of a hospital has been greatly assisted by the use of medical assessment units. One such hospital is St. Luke's in Kilkenny where innovative solutions and a hospital wide response have improved the delivery of emergency services to patients. The consultants in St. Luke's Hospital approached us through public representatives and asked for funding for their ideas. We gave them €2 million and they took the beds off the corridors. They put in a medical assessment unit, a pre-discharge unit and made huge progress. The benefit of having a medical assessment unit on site has facilitated the rapid assessment and treatment of medical patients. Another recent development is the acute medical assessment unit at St. James's Hospital. I invite anyone to have a look at how they are doing the business there. This unit has contributed to a noticeable improvement in the delivery of emergency services at the hospital. The problems in St. James's Hospital are now exclusively of a long-term care variety. In other words, they are not in a position to discharge as quickly as they would like. They have put in a very sophisticated chest pain programme, where anyone presenting with chest pain will go directly into the chest pain facility rather than the accident and emergency department. Within 12 hours, they will have a full diagnostic process carried out and will know whether they have to stay or can be discharged. Prior to the development of that unit, a patient presenting would spend three days in that hospital. I tell hospitals around the country that, if they have innovative ideas, I will be open to supporting them. A key finding in the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on accident and emergency services was that a hospital-wide response was needed to meet the requirements of the emergency service. Improved processing of patients through the emergency department, via minor injuries units or medical assessment units, is but one aspect of the hospital-wide response needed. Delivery of the emergency service at hospital level is interdependent on the in-patient elective service, day patient and out-patient care. The effective delivery of emergency services, therefore, cannot be dealt with in isolation from the delivery of all hospital-based services.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">One of the outcomes of the Comhairle na nOspidéal report on accident and emergency services, in which clinicians were involved, was that, historically, hospitals did not take possession of such services in a hospital-wide approach. In other words, it was seen as something out there on its own. Doctors and nurses were allocated, but not everyone took possession of the ball and said that they had an obligation and responsibility. That mindset is changing, and this is critical since it is the key to prioritisation within the overall hospital ethos of a successful accident and emergency department.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I acknowledge there are ongoing pressures, the critical one being the long-term care issue rather than the acute hospital beds themselves. That is important in the context of an overall hospitals capacity to deal with elective and medical admissions. However, the nature of health is changing. The complexity and acuity of patients now arriving has by and large increased. Age is a significant factor in the presentation to accident and emergency. There is a lack of community support in some areas, particularly in the Dublin region. I know Members from all over the country are present, and I am not claiming there are no problems elsewhere. However, the problems in the east are particularly acute because of the way in which the system has evolved over time compared with other regions where there is more of a health board-wide response. In Dublin one does not necessarily have that, since many of the hospitals grew up individually rather than as part of a health board system. As a result there are many gaps in community links with hospitals, and the same is true with community care. Over the last few years we have changed that, and we must do more with that to get the right response. It will require more resources to provide the long-term care beds to alleviate the current difficulties. We are working with the hospitals to do just that. In doing so, I am careful to say that I will not simply throw money at the problem. We wish to ensure a return. The type of scheme that, we had last year got such a return, and we need more of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">I thank the Minister for his speech and welcome him to the House. No one denies that a great deal of money has been spent on the health services. No one says that he has been doing nothing over the last few years. However, in spite of all the money being spent and the effort made, we seem to have terrible problems in some situations. I agree with some of my colleagues who have said that patients' lives are certainly in danger in some places owing to what I describe as a lack of co-ordination, and the effect on staff has been terrible. Other Senators have pointed out the grave shortage of nurses, with most of them leaving within two years of qualification. That is what the Irish Nurses' Organisation tells me.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_617">I assure the Minister that I would not want to mislead the House on anything. However, irrespective of what the Irish Nurses' Organisation says, I frequently see two nurses trying to do the work of eight. I am told that it is because they cannot get other staff. I must accept what my nursing colleagues tell me, just as I must accept the fact that morale is very low — a large number of people in the health service have spoken about this before — because of such matters as the building of expensive units which are not opened. The Leader of the House might be interested to know that, during the last Leader's reign, I used to ask him every six months — as if it were a tennis match — when the new wing of Mullingar Hospital would open. Can the Minister imagine what it does to staff to see such a unit there without any access to those facilities?</p>
          <p eId="para_618">We constantly hear about the appalling situation in accident and emergency departments, and that is true. I recently went to visit a colleague who was on a trolley for days. That should not be the case. This constant problem has gone on for years. At the same time, we have a splendid unit in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. Can the Minister imagine what that does to the morale of those in that hospital, not to mind the morale of those in the other accident and emergency units? Think what they could take off our shoulders if that unit were open.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I will describe the situation in Ballymun. Last winter, the old Ballymun health centre was virtually unusable for quite some time. They had trouble with heating and facilities for patients, and they closed down for some time. I know the general practitioners who work in that health centre. One could not meet a more devoted group. I know it is not the personal fault of the Minister that the funding is not there to open the new Ballymun centre, but it is his responsibility because he is in charge of the health services. It is very serious, not just from the point of view of the patients but from that of the people who work in those centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Senator Ryan mentioned Clonmel. It is very serious if ill patients are brought by ambulance from Clonmel to Cashel for surgical procedures. I was almost a child when the trouble started between Cashel and Clonmel. I am sure the Minister had not been born then. The fact is that these things go on interminably. I presume the people who have been employed in Castlebar will have to be paid. The logic defies me. There were advertisements for staff. I know the Minister sometimes has problems with people refusing to move, but more often than not they go, and there is certainly no way that anyone who in any way obstructs a move to new facilities would have support from me; it is outrageous. There must be some sense of addressing situations that have continued for years; if it were a matter of months, it would not be quite so bad. Great efforts have been made in the psychiatric system in particular. However, it took about 20 years to achieve that, and people working in the health service look at that now and wonder if it will take the same time again.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Minister points out the good things that are happening, such as the medical assessment units, which began in Limerick while the one in Kilkenny seems to be going well. The Minister is ever so slightly optimistic about St. James's. There is no harm in this as one is entitled to seek a rosy future. However, do we really have new radiotherapy units in Cork and Galway? The last I heard, people were telling me about antique radiotherapy equipment in Cork.</p>

How long is it since the radiotherapy plan for the country was issued? I understand why Waterford and Limerick have not got going. They want to get Cork and Galway going first. However, what about the two in Dublin? Apparently no decision has been made about the two radiotherapy facilities for Dublin. Some preference must be given as to which two hospitals, north and south of the city respectively, should provide this service. People must be told and those working in the health service cannot string this out forever. Decisions must be made. I cannot recall when Professor Donal Hollywood's report was delivered but it is a long time ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">I attended that session of the committee and it was months ago. A decision must be made. I was a member of Comhairle na nOspidéal, which was frequently blamed for the delay in the appointment of consultants, but I often found that the delay was longer in the Department of Health and Children because the financing is not available for posts long before they are needed. One consultant told me that he returned from the United States to take up a position here only to find that no beds had been allocated. It is pointless to appoint people to hospitals where no provision has been made for them to perform their function. I was afraid this consultant would return to the United States even though his services were urgently needed here.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">It is a depressing situation. Having worked in the health service for so long, I clearly recognise the improvements that have taken place in procedures. I am also very aware, however, of the huge demand from patients and the attendant difficulties in provision, our ageing population, the very slow progress we are making in many areas and the dreadful effect the building of capital projects in which nobody is allowed to work is having on the morale of health service workers.</p>

        <speech by="#GeraldineFeeney" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_636">I formally second the amendment to the motion. I understood from Professor Hollywood's address to the Joint Committee on Health and Children that he was quite satisfied with the ongoing progress. As the Minister observed in his speech, the radiotherapy service is working well. The unit in Galway will open in January 2005, €80 million has been invested in a facility for Cork and extra consultants are being provided for both of those facilities. As a former member of An Bord Altranais, I should point out that there are 8,000 extra nurses in the system since 1998 and we have created more spaces in the nursing schools in the last five years. It does not make sense therefore that, for example, two nurses should be looking after a large number of patients, as Senator Henry observed.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Minister has acknowledged in his presentation that there are problems in the accident and emergency service but it is wrong for the Opposition to say that it is a problem throughout the State because it is not. I spoke to the two accident and emergency consultants in Sligo General Hospital this morning. That hospital had no accident and emergency consultants six years ago but has since benefited from the 41% increase in consultants throughout the country. Those consultants are quite happy with the service they provide and I doubt that they are the only consultants in the country who feel that way. I am glad to hear the Minister is concerned about the east coast area, as we all are. The Minister has rightly acknowledged that there are problems there, which require a multidisciplinary type of approach, and he has outlined his strategy in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I was interested to hear from the two consultants in Sligo that it is at the weekends that overcrowding occurs. We have frequently discussed in this House the phenomenon of weekend drink and drug abuse particularly among young people. These are the people who are taking up precious spaces in accident and emergency departments. Of course they must be treated and they could be any of our sons and daughters. A change in the culture regarding young people's drinking patterns is required. Tax evasion was accepted in this country ten years ago as was drink driving. Today the latter is considered the worst crime of all and is completely frowned upon. This is not entirely a matter for the Minister but some element of it is within his remit. The Joint Committee on Health and Children has just delivered a report, with which Senator Henry was involved, on the problems regarding under age drinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I am glad I can make my next point in this House before the Minister. For the last few months I have been holding my breath every time I heard it said that the Hanly report would presage the closure of accident and emergency departments all over the country. As a member of the Medical Council I can say that is rubbish. The Hanly report will ensure that accident and emergency departments remain open. It is part of my duty as a member of the council to inspect hospitals around the country and I have visited accident and emergency departments in counties Clare, Cork, Tipperary, Kildare, Monaghan and Wexford, among others. I was part of a five person group within the council which ruled that those departments should be closed. In the case of one hospital in the Mid-Western Health Board area, we gave it an alternative to closure of the accident and emergency department within six to nine months whereby the CEO of the health board came together with personnel from the Medical Council and medical staff from the hospital to make representations to the Department of Health and Children. That hospital has now been assigned an accident and emergency consultant who is ready to take up that position. The Hanly report is the way to go. Medical people agree that it is the blueprint for the future of medicine in this country and the methodology is second to none.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">There are two major hospitals in the North-Western Health Board, Letterkenny General and Sligo General. Letterkenny is ready to appoint a second consultant, for which I thank the Minister. Sligo already has its second consultant and its accident and emergency numbers are under 30,000 and we are happy with that. I was surprised by something Senator Feighan said as he lives only 20 miles from me in Sligo, although it is a different health board area. He spoke about a big black hole and maintained that services had not improved. As I pointed out a few months ago, Sligo General Hospital has a new oncology unit with 14 beds. Our cancer patients no longer have to leave the county or the region and they are absolutely delighted. The Minister is correct that the benefits are beyond belief in some areas of the country. Yes I am speaking for my own area and I am better qualified than anybody else to make this case——</p>

          <p eId="para_649">This is an important debate, but given the contributions from the Government side what depresses me is that the problem is not recognised. I listened with interest to what the Minister said and indeed read his script. I also listened today to what the Minister for Finance said. At lunchtime I felt a certain sympathy for the Minister, Deputy Martin, who sends out media signals indicating he is looking for further funding. Then we hear his presentation tonight and what his colleagues have said. It would appear that the message has not got through to Members on the Government side that there is a problem of enormous proportions. It appears that all of them were active on the local and European election hustings but did not get the vibe from the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The public believes there is a profound problem in the health service. I wonder if that message is being taken on board. If we removed the year 1997 from the records, it appears the Government would have nothing to say. We hear all the statistics about what has happened since then. Could some on the Government side reflect back to the general election of 1987 when former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, led the Fianna Fáil Party? He proclaimed to the people in 1987 that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the poor while his party proclaimed that there was "a better way". On that fabricated argument Fianna Fáil was elected to power and within weeks there was a slashing of resources in the health services and hospital beds across the country. Those bed numbers have not been returned to the service in the intervening years. It is frightening to think we have had the Celtic tiger economy since 1987, with record resources, but we have not restored the Irish health service to the position it held in terms of beds and availability of services before that year. The Senator may shake her head, but that is the position.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_652">It is frightening that she does not recognise that. The Minister spoke about the improvements. Of course there have been major improvements and technology has improved worldwide, so why should it not in Ireland? Medical procedure has improved worldwide and therefore in Ireland. I do not think anyone challenged Senator Ryan's assertion that there are no hospital waiting lists in a number of European countries, yet we are willing to accept there should be in Ireland. It is frightening that this appears to be our starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Minister continually makes the case for the defence when he refers to the enormous increase in expenditure. We recognise that sizeable money is being spent on the health service but on the other side of the equation is the desperation of people looking for hospital beds. There is also the desperation of those looking for medical cards and nursing home subventions. I do not believe, from listening to the Minister's contribution, that he recognises the scale of the problem. That worries me.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Minister asks about the signals being sent from the Opposition benches. The signal you sent in your script is that the problems——</p>

          <p eId="para_657">I acknowledge that extra resources have been pumped into the health service. There is no question about that. However, the results cannot be seen on the ground. What we see are layers of extra administration and bureaucracy as a result of the spending. One cannot see the results. Those patients who access the A&amp; E services in the Dublin hospitals cannot see them. Often they must spend days, nights and, in some instances, weeks on trolleys. What about the situation where somebody goes to the toilet and when he returns there is another patient on his trolley? This is the type of health service you are presiding over. These are the facts.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">There is no question that there is excessive overcrowding in A&amp; E departments. It results in patients, and indeed staff, being left in totally unacceptable and unsafe environments. A major cause of the crisis is the lack of beds and closed wards, as mentioned by several other speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">We have had nothing but promises from the Government. The Minister presides over reports and strategies but he is poor on delivery in terms of implementing recommendations. Some 200,000 extra medical cards were promised, yet there has been a decrease of 45,000 in the last two years. This is the type of promise and politics about which the people said they had had enough during the local elections campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Some 15,000 people walked the streets of Waterford looking for their right to equity of access for radiotherapy service.

Fianna Fáil lost three seats in Waterford county. They also lost seats in south Kilkenny and Wexford, yet the Minister is not prepared to listen to the people. He spoke about representatives making cases for people and he dished out a couple of million euro to solve problems, but he is not prepared to listen to the people of the south east. One in every four families has to travel from Waterford to Dublin five times a week for five minutes of treatment. People are dying while the Government dithers on issues.</p>

Nor did any of his Department's Ministers of State. A Minister of State attended who knew nothing about it. That illustrates the contempt the Minister for Health and Children and the Government have shown to the people of Waterford.</p>

He has outlined clearly in his speech what the Government has been doing in this and the previous term of office. There has been greater processing of patients through our hospitals as a result of investment. The Minister has acknowledged that issues remain to be resolved. Many new hospitals have been built and many more have been refurbished. I am often angered by the comments of other public representatives from Dublin West in the context of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. I was the only councillor among eight who voted for the rezoning of lands at that hospital when it was being promoted in the 1990s as a hospital for future investment on a pound for pound basis with Government. The councillors who voted against the proposal now cry crocodile tears. However, they did not make the hard decisions necessary at the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">Every councillor in Dublin 15 at the time voted against that proposal. I accept problems exist in accident and emergency departments and that we must do something in terms of how people are treated once they present there. I suggest that one area that might be examined is the junior doctor service provided at accident and emergency departments. I was told today that contracts for junior hospital doctors commence on 1 January and 1 July each year. The provision of consultants at that point might yield greater results, an issue, which is dealt with in the Hanly report. It is a positive aspect of that report, one which I hope will be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">In raising this issue last week, I hoped the Minister would deal with an issue not yet raised here this evening although mentioned in previous debates. It is often the case that sick and injured people must wait for treatment until those who have taken too much alcohol or drugs are cared for. We must examine that issue in the context of how people present themselves at accident and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The Minister acknowledged the great strides made in the area of cardiac surgery, cancer treatment and health promotion offices throughout the country. He also referred to the enormous investment in our hospitals. Hopefully the one or two issues remaining will be resolved during the Government's remaining years in office.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on this motion. Much of what has been said hurts people on a particular side of the House. However, that happens when one speaks of statistics and facts. It is no secret that our health service is at the point of collapse not because of a lack of funding but because of sheer bad management. The management shown by Government in this sector is nothing short of appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Senator Bradford rightly pointed out a worrying trend in the contributions from the Government side, namely the belief on its part that nothing is wrong. That is frightening. An accident and emergency unit at Cork University Hospital built at a cost of €16 million has not yet been opened because the Minister has not allocated funding for the appointment of staff. There is no defence in that regard. It is a little simplistic for the Minister to waltz in here and blame trade unions for it. If there is a recognition of a failing in the system surely it cannot be linked to a trade union. This Minister has presided over a sham of a health service for the past four years. When presented with proof that his lack of managerial ability fails in his own backyard and fails abysmally the people in Cork city and county, he blames the trade unions. That is simplistic and disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">A consultant hired by the health board stated that 35 staff would be sufficient to operate the unit. I understand funding for the equipment needed is on stream. However, there is no timeframe as to when funding for the provision of staff will be made available. Until such time as it is made available this unit, like others, will remain idle. This problems does not exist in Cork city alone; it is a nationwide problem. Some €460 million worth of facilities nationally are lying idle. They include a €96 million wing at James Connolly Memorial Hospital; a €24 million surgical unit at Clonmel General Hospital; a €10 million orthopaedic unit at Mayo General Hospital; a €48 million health centre in Ballymun and a €16 million unit at Cork University Hospital. That is frightening.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Senator Cummins highlighted the case, which was dismissed by Government Members, of a man occupying a trolley at Tallaght Hospital, going to the toilet and returning to find another person on the trolley. If this matter were not so serious, it would be funny. Are we now to have a waiting list for trolleys? The manner in which the Government has attempted to dress up and disguise a serious trend once confined to weekends and seasons, but now permanent is despicable and disgraceful. I am not an expert on any particular element of the health service. The Government is showing contempt to organisations such as the Irish Nurses Organisation, which has experience of the extent of the crisis. It is time for the Minister and Government to sit up and listen when it states that the situation is worse than it has ever witnessed or than people have ever experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Why are 750 nursing positions vacant? I am glad Senator Leyden has returned to the House but he missed Senator Feeney's eloquent defence of the Hanly report. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House when it is proposed to close the accident and emergency units at the hospitals in Bantry, Nenagh, Ennis and, in Senator Leyden's bailiwick, Roscommon?</p>

          <p eId="para_689">I, too, would like to speak about the new wing at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, which is lying idle. I am told by a local Labour representative that one of the local newspapers this week contained a photograph of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and a consultant for that hospital regarding the announcement of a new system which they intend to introduce before the winter.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_691">The system relates to elderly patients with chest illnesses. The idea is that these patients would be seen as out-patients, thereby freeing up beds. The article also refers to the appointment of three new consultants. That is great news, a good story and a good photo opportunity for the Minister of State. However, as Members are aware, the new wing built at a cost of €96 million, one part of which is being used following an emergency, remains idle apparently due to unforeseen running costs. The local Labour councillor has sought a comprehensive explanation for the failure to occupy the wing, but she has been unable to get one. I cannot derive much information from the replies given by the Minister for Health and Children in the Dáil because they do not say very much. It is costing money to maintain the wing that is lying idle. The hospital's staff are working in the old accident and emergency department, in bad conditions, beside the state-of-the-art wing. One of the reasons I am raising the issue is because it is the nearest hospital for people in my local area. It has great potential as a regional hospital for the area, but that potential is not being realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">If the Government learnt anything from the results of the local elections, it must have been that one can fool people with announcements and photo opportunities some of the time, but people eventually see the way things are in reality and respond suitably when they vote in elections. In a reply to Deputy Rabbitte this week, the Minister for Health and Children said the matter has to be dealt with by the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The buck stops with the Minister, however, and he should do whatever is required to sort the issue out. If the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, responds to this debate, I ask him to outline what the Minister, Deputy Martin, is doing to ensure the wing becomes active as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">I appreciate that things have improved. If the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, can get more money for the Western Health Board, I will be glad if he invests it as soon as possible. I have been a member of the board for two of the last five years. There have been significant developments in the health board area during the last five years, especially increases in day activity cases and improvements in the accident and emergency units. In 2003, we exceeded 200,000 out-patient attendances for the first time. We have succeeded in reducing waiting lists by means of a combination of waiting list initiatives and the national treatment purchase fund. I am sorry there is a waiting list, but we have to have waiting lists in certain areas. Children are not waiting longer than six months for in-patient procedures and the orthodontic waiting list has been reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I congratulate the Government on phases one and two of the development of University College Hospital, Galway. I was particularly delighted when the board purchased Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe from the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood in 2001. The hospital has a 206-bed acute unit and an eight-bed IPU complex. Consultant staffing has increased threefold and two further posts have been approved. I hope the posts will be processed soon and I am waiting for a letter from the Minister in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Senator Leyden spoke about matters relating to counties Roscommon and Mayo. I welcome the developments in those areas. Perhaps it is time for the Minister to come to the Western Health Board area to open some of the facilities that have been approved by his Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_767">The really disappointing thing is that the Minister for Health and Children came to the House to talk about everything except the nub of the motion, which is why hospital facilities worth €500 million are lying idle. What sort of incompetence means that those responsible for the management of our health services, when they are building something, cannot plan to bring it on stream when it has been finished? If the National Roads Authority left roads and motorways lying unused because it could not afford to put road markings on them, we would sack the NRA. If third level educational institutions left buildings empty, we would sack the Department of Education and Science. Apparently, a quarter of that capital expenditure has been used on hospital buildings that are lying idle. That scale of incompetence deserves nothing less than sacking, phase one of which, namely protective notice, was issued to this Government on 11 June. The final notice will issue whenever it plucks up the courage or is forced by the Constitution to face the people in a general election. The major difference now from four weeks ago is that the people have shown that they have copped on. They will no longer tolerate Fianna Fáil's nonsense. The people have said "No" to Fianna Fáil's choice of the rich against the poor and the powerful against the powerless and the real question for Fianna Fáil at this stage is what part of "No" it does not understand. Today, the Minister for Finance, the favourite Minister of the Progressive Democrats — a member of the PDs could not be better in terms of political ideology — asserted yet again that he would do it his way. The Minister for Health and Children came in here and pretended he is fighting with this Minister and accepted Deputy McCreevy's definition that the national interest is the national interest.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_835">I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and congratulate him on this historic day when we saw the reappearance of the tram in Dublin with the long-awaited opening of the Sandyford to city centre light rail line. I also congratulate the Department of Transport and the Rail Procurement Agency for delivering the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">When opening the Sandyford line, the Rail Procurement Agency decided that the first five days were to be free of charge. This is a welcome encouragement for people to use this new public transport service. I ask the Minister to intervene with Luas and the Rail Procurement Agency to ensure an equality of treatment when the Tallaght line is opened in late August. Of late, some Luas officials have indicated that the free five day concession enjoyed by Sandyford line users will not be available to Tallaght line users. Under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, the Minister has the power to direct that such a concession is extended to the Tallaght line. The people of Tallaght, Inchicore and every other stop along this line must be allowed to have a number of free day concessions when the line is opened in late August. As the House will not be sitting then, I am raising the issue now. There is public concern in the Dublin 24 area that the same conditions that apply to the Sandyford line would also apply to the Tallaght line.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">All Members encourage people to make that modal shift away from the car to public transport. However, for the past five years those living along the line have been subjected to constraints caused by its construction. They have done so in a humorous and light-hearted way and have put up with much hassle in their community for the last five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The concession put in place by the Minister for Transport and the RPA for the opening of the Sandyford line should also be in place for the opening of the Tallaght line as a small token of appreciation to the residents along the line who have had to endure difficulties for the past five years. I am sure that in his response the Minister will tell me what I want to hear and that when he opens the Tallaght line in late August, when, God willing, we will all be in attendance, the people of Tallaght will also be entitled to a number of free days' travel on the line. That is the intention of tabling this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_839">I thank Senator Brian Hayes for tabling this matter and giving me the opportunity to say a few words about Luas. I have listened carefully to what he said and I will insist on a number of free days being made available as requested. I will make a formal request to the RPA in that regard. The Senator is right in saying that the days of free celebratory travel were greatly welcomed today. It is appropriate that similar free days would be available when the second line opens at the end of August.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The congratulations offered are not so much due to me as to the Railway Procurement Agency and to all the local authorities, the Luas workers, the RPA chairman, Pádraig White, the chief executive, Frank Allen, the RPA board and all those who brought about the return of the trams to the streets of Dublin today. Special thanks are due to the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, without whose central involvement we would not be introducing Luas today. She drove the project hard over many years and can take a great deal of the credit for bringing it to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">There is a great sense of excitement about Luas. The line will carry 20,000 passengers, or approximately 8 million in any one year. The Sandyford line now has 13 stations. The Tallaght line will have 22 or 23 stations. In all, some 60,000 people will be transported daily through the suburbs to Dublin city centre. We are also looking at the possibility of a metro.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">It is entirely appropriate that the same celebratory free travel days should be made available to the people on the second line, the Red Line, which will open at the end of August.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_844">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the following issue and I thank the Minister for attending. I congratulate him too on the success of the Luas and I hope he has good news for me just as he had for Senator Brian Hayes.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Some years ago, Ballaghlea national school near Ballygar in County Galway was keen to get an extra classroom. As a former Minister for Education the Minister for Transport appreciates that there have been long waiting lists to get simple items, such as a classroom, provided and built. The board of management made inquiries at the time and understood it would take five years to build a classroom. It then took matters into its own hands, organising table quizzes and getting local sponsorship.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Earlier today the question of sponsorship in education by Coca Cola and McDonald's was referred to. Such sponsorship was not available for Ballaghlea national school but the school got other local people to fundraise. On 21 June they had a double celebration at the opening of the classroom because they also got a green flag on that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">I have been very interested in what is happening in education particularly regarding devolved grants and the pilot schemes we have seen countrywide. These have been very successful. Such grants date back perhaps to the early 1980s when former Ministers for Education, such as Gemma Hussey and Senator O'Rourke, were prepared to give some funding to schools. The Department of Education and Science should consider giving amounts of money by way of a devolved grant or a pilot scheme because a grant is due to this school. It is very deserving of what I call a retrospective grant because the work has been done. Great cost was involved but the project has not cost the Department one euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">It is very important to recognise what the board of management of this school has done and its achievement in providing a beautiful classroom. The principal teacher explained on 21 June how they went about raising the funds and providing a classroom. I hope the Minister for Education and Science can explain to us what it will do to recognise this achievement.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_849">I have not got a Luas for the Senator but in time I might have a western rail corridor for him, which would help. I have been supplied with a response by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey:</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the policy of the Department of Education and Science regarding applications for retrospective funding and in particular the application from the management authorities of Ballaghlea national school, Ballygar, County Galway in respect of works carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">In February 2003 the management authorities of Ballaghlea national school contacted the school building section of the Department and informed it that they intended erecting a small extension in the region of 75 square metres. This additional space was to include accommodation for a resource and learning support teacher as well as a staff room and disabled person's toilet. The project was to be funded locally, and the board of management wished to know if the Department could grant-aid the project retrospectively. The school building section informed the board of management that the Department was not in a position to give any guarantee that an application for retrospective would be considered but advised the board of the relevant statutory regulations regarding planning permission and tendering.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">A further application for retrospective funding was received in January this year. A circular letter outlining the Department's policy regarding retrospective funding is currently being drafted and a copy of this circular will issue to all schools and will state that funding for projects undertaken by schools, without the approval or agreement of the Department will not be funded. To do so would reward queue jumping and undermine the openness and transparency of the system, which is the essential point of publishing the school building programme. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p>
