#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I want to raise a matter that probably concerns every person in the country, given that most people come into contact with the legal profession, in particular solicitors, at some stage during their lives.  As the Taoiseach knows, a number of high profile cases are proceeding through the courts.  What concerns me is that the credibility of the profession has been diminished by the activities arising from these circumstances.  Obviously, at the end of the day, consumers will have to pick up the tab, either through higher solicitors' fees or higher bank charges.One of the features of concern to me is that the information on some of these cases was brought to the attention of the Law Society as long ago as 2002.  In that context, the matter of self-regulation is called into question.  I note that the vast majority of practising solicitors I have encountered have done their job as per the requirements of the profession and in an absolutely above-board manner.  However, cases where clients' money has been called into question, which is a no-go area for practising solicitors, do down the profession.Is the Taoiseach satisfied self-regulation is working in the way it should?  Will he comment on the report of the Competition Authority, which the Government has had since last December, which recommended that there should be an independent legal services commission to take over the day-to-day regulation of the legal services while leaving the Law Society to represent the profession?  This is a matter of genuine concern to many people who do not understand the intricacies of the law or the details with which solicitors must deal.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied with self-regulation, which clearly has not worked to the extent it should?  Does the Government intend to follow through on the Competition Authority report and implement an independent legal commission to run the services of the legal profession?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Deputy raised a number of points.  I agree the vast majority of practices in the State work well, do not create difficulty and provide a service to individual members of the public and to companies.  Self-regulatory bodies the world over, including in this country, tend to move away from this and the idea of self-regulation is seen as something from other times.  Most organisations are changing their ways in that regard.I do not dispute the fact that some of the individuals who are now the source of investigations were investigated a number of years ago and got a clean bill of health.  While I am subject to correction, one of those investigations took place as recently as five years ago.The Competition Authority has considered the profession, which was dealt with in one of the five reports carried out by the authority.  That report does not deal with self-regulation but more with issues of competition, numbers and the scale and form of companies, which is not the same area.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is examining this area and what has happened.The position of other professional bodies is relevant.  A number of years ago, the accountancy profession moved to a different administrative system whereby a body was established to examine the profession, and that is working well.  While I do not want to suggest the Government has made a decision, because we have not and the matter is under examination, the accountancy profession is an area in which such a system has worked very satisfactorily.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is considering not only recent cases but also the issue of self-regulation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Independent commissions of the type recommended by the Competition Authority already work very well in Northern Ireland, England, Wales, Australia and New Zealand, and seem to enhance the reputation and credibility of the profession.  Does the Government accept the Competition Authority report in respect of the provision of an independent legal commission to run the profession?We have had reports on the implementation of regulators and regulations that were supposed to benefit the consumer.  Despite having regulators, this clearly has not worked to the extent it should in the transport area, and we have the highest electricity costs of many countries and are way behind on broadband.Arising from the Taoiseach's response, has the Government considered the Competition Authority's report?  Does the Government accept the recommendation for the appointment of an independent legal commission to take over those duties?  I pose the question in the context that everybody has to deal with their legal representatives at some stage in their lives and the regulations should be clearly understood by all consumers.  While the vast majority of practising solicitors do their job as they should, the situation should be watertight and above board.  Does the Taoiseach accept the Competition Authority's report?  Does he agree with the recommendation concerning an independent legal commission and, if so, when will the Government act on it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The answer to those questions is yes.  The Government has examined the Competition Authority's report.  The authority has produced a number of reports and it reported to the House on this matter two or three weeks ago.  That may not be the only model that can be taken, but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is examining it.  I am not satisfied that self-regulation, as it has been operated over the years, is the best model.  We must come to a view of how best to do that.  Total self-regulation does not provide the impression that the public interest is best served in a transparent way, notwithstanding the fact that the overwhelming majority are doing a good job, as the Deputy said.There are other models including, for example, the Accounting Standards Association which supervises accountants and is regulated by law.  There is a lay majority on that body which works well on a professional and an individual level.  It was recently established by law.  There is not a huge difference between the accountancy and the legal professions.  It was thought necessary to establish such a body for the accountancy sector and that model is working.  Increasingly, both of those professions work closely together.  The Deputy has seen what is happening in the IFSC and the related legal practices.  That is a model therefore that the legal profession should consider.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is examining the position, however.  Generally speaking, self-regulation is not now seen as a great idea internationally.  Someone would have to work hard to convince me that self-regulation works, because that is not the case.  In all its reports, the Competition Authority indicated that the concept of self-regulation is not the way of the future.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	4	This morning we heard of a threatened strike in the ESB, with the possibility of power cuts.  We also heard of another possible strike in the Irish Prison Service.  Last week people walked to work because of a strike in Dublin Bus and a strike in Aer Lingus was narrowly averted for the second time in recent weeks.  In the past couple of weeks, there seems to have been a deteriorating industrial relations climate, which was the kind of thing we thought social partnership was designed to avoid, including the strikes and disputes threatened in major public utility companies.I am particularly concerned about the threatened strike in the ESB which, if it comes about and results in power cuts, will cause much hardship for householders and businesses, particularly if it occurs during the winter period.  In any event, the threat of a strike in the ESB must have enormous economic consequences, creating a degree of uncertainty and unease.  Normally, in the case of such a strike we would all be calling on unions and management to get together and resolve their differences.  The unusual aspect of this threatened strike is that it is not a dispute in the traditional sense between unions and management.  Indeed, unions and management in Aer Lingus seem to have the same view on the issue.  The issue at the ESB, however, appears to be the Government's plans for the future of the company.  In those circumstances, does the Taoiseach or the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have plans to meet the ESB's management and unions with a view to resolving this issue and averting a strike, thus preventing the power cuts that would result if a strike occurs?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	5	We discussed industrial relations issues last week in Aer Lingus and Dublin Bus and at that stage I called on workers and management to try to resolve the issues, notwithstanding the fact that in CIE's case the matter had gone through the conciliation process, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Every dispute has its own unique position and those involved should try to resolve the issues.  I would say the same concerning the ESB.  I acknowledge the significant effort put in by unions and management to resolve both disputes to which the Deputy referred.  We are maintaining a record of a low level of industrial relations disputes, which is one of the lowest by international standards.Yesterday, the ESB group of unions received a broad mandate for industrial action in the event of ESB management breaching the terms of the bilateral and tripartite agreements, which form the basis of the terms and conditions of their members and include the organisation's structural arrangements within the ESB.  A counting of ballots issued by the constituent unions to their members concluded that the members had voted by nine to one in favour of industrial action.  I understand that result must be ratified by the executive members of the unions in advance of their group of union meetings on 29 November.  Following that, the unions will request a meeting with ESB management.  That is the process that is set out over the next few weeks.As Deputy Gilmore stated, there are two issues involved that might be impacted upon by this development.  The first is the ESB assets strategy which provides for the closure and disinvestment of 1,500 MW of ESB power generation plant as a way of dealing with the ESB's dominance.  The second issue is the proposed transfer of the ESB's transmission assets to Eirgrid by the end of next year.  That is seen as a key step in securing the competitiveness of the Irish electricity sector.  We have gone from a position of having low ESB costs a decade ago to very high.  The examination of why that has happened has continued and is reflected in the energy White Paper.  Part of it is the issue of dominance and how things are done.  Energy issues affect the public so we must get cheaper, effective and efficient energy from electricity companies.  The issue is hugely important for the future competitiveness of the economy.Both of these issues are the subject of commitments contained in the programme for Government.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has made himself available to discuss these matters with the group of unions and has met them.  He has also discussed them with ESB management.  There are, however, fundamental questions about the future of electricity in this country and the price we pay for it.  It is also about the future of the ESB which is a well structured company with good pay levels.  The Government wants to see it thus, but there are issues that must be dealt with, including competition, dominance and the competitiveness of the overall economy.  Those are important issues and the Government is willing and anxious to deal with them, as the Minister has made clear.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	6	As the Taoiseach said, it is probably early days in this dispute but most people who are concerned about their electric supply probably are not that concerned about the nuts and bolts of the issues in dispute.  They want to be sure they will have a continued supply of electricity.  Does the Taoiseach agree that those who are seeking security of supply will look to the Government, given that the dispute is about Government policy, not traditional industrial relations issues about pay or conditions of employment, to ensure the necessary steps are taken to avoid a dispute?  Does he consider the deteriorating industrial relations climate is not unrelated to a perception that the Government is feathering its own nest with the pay increases it awarded itself in recent times and that the timing of the recent spate of disputes which are more frequent than we have experienced in recent years is not unconnected to the public's perception that the Government has been looking after itself?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Close liaison is being maintained with ESB management and contacts are ongoing within union circles.  The Government will bring forward a memorandum on the various aspects of the transfer of the transmission assets.  The legislation and financial arrangements will also be presented to the Government in the coming months.  The Minister and the Department will continue to liaise on the matter with all the relevant parties.  The Minister met the group of unions and will continue to liaise with ESB management and the CER.  The claim that the transfer of transmission assets will weaken the ESB commercially is not factual.  The transfer of assets will be accompanied by the transfer of liabilities and entail the movement of a small number of staff, which will help the ESB.In some ways I wish the Deputy was right about the recent disputes.  Unfortunately, some of them are so like long playing records that they would not work on the modern technology.  The bus dispute has been ongoing for ages; the ESB dispute has been ongoing for several years, while, as the Deputy said, the Aer Lingus dispute has played out three or four times.  The rule the trade union movement fought for in 1913 and has stood by since, as the Deputy will be aware, is that when an independent body makes a decision on an increase, the Government of the day should pay it.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.In reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, on 1 November 2006, I stated substantial progress had been made in implementing the recommendations of the Sullivan report.  Further progress has been made since.  Implementation of the recommendations of the report formed part of the Attorney General office's action plan under the Towards 2016 performance verification process and progress reported to the Civil Service performance verification group, with the progress reports published on the office's website.Specific developments in implementing the Sullivan report include a review by a number of advisory counsel of risk management procedures for sensitive cases within the advisory groups regular legal MAC meetings since 11 October 2006; three reports to the Government on sensitive and constitutional cases since October 2006; six secondments of advisory counsel grade III made to Departments and more recruited by the Office of the Attorney General for training prior to secondment; discussions have advanced between the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions about the transfer of responsibility for fisheries prosecution to the latter office; and the transfer of administration of the Attorney General's scheme to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from 1 February this year.The three-person panel of external experts, risk management group, appointed in June 2006 by the Attorney General made their initial report on 17 July this year.  As it is an initial report, it is not intended to publish it.  The report details 11 key findings and related recommendations arising from their review and examination of systems.  The recommendations revolve around issues of overview of sensitive cases, arrangements to identify and monitor sensitive cases, file maintenance and management, technology supports and diary alert systems, with collaboration and notification arrangements across the office.  The recommendations have been or are being implemented.  Further consultation with the group will take place as necessary.  In its 2007 annual report, to be published early in 2008, the Office of the Attorney General will report further on the implementation of the Sullivan report, as well as report progress to the Civil Service performance verification group.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Following the publication of the Sullivan report, the Taoiseach informed the House he would appoint a special rapporteur on child protection who, among other matters, would keep under review and audit legal developments for the protection of children.  Two people were appointed to carry out that function.  One of the commitments given by the Taoiseach at the time was that they would prepare a report annually setting out the details of their work, which would be submitted to the Dáil and Seanad for debate.  No such report has been submitted.  Therefore, we have not had an opportunity to debate the issue.  Have the rapporteurs made a report?  If so, when will it be laid before the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The rapporteurs are in place and have been actively involved.  References were made in the Attorney General's annual report and, as I said, there will also be an update early next year.  If the decision was that they were to present a report to the House, I will have to check that matter because I cannot recall seeing a published report, but perhaps I am wrong.  However, the rapporteurs are in place and have been actively involved but I am not certain whether they presented a report.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The A case was very controversial at the time and on 7 June last year the Taoiseach made a commitment that a special rapporteur for child protection would be appointed.  My understanding from the Oireachtas Library yesterday is that the report has not been presented.  A recommendation for the establishment of a legal MAC which the Attorney General would attend was also made.  Has it been established?  If so, how often does it meet?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Yes, it has operated since October 2006 and all relevant issues in the Attorney General's office are discussed.  The process is that cases of importance are brought to it.  While hundreds of cases challenging legislation or statutory instruments are current at any one time, the key cases, as per the Sullivan report, are brought forward to the legal MAC.   I understand the Government receives a report from it on cases of importance not quarterly but three times a year.  As Deputy Gilmore is aware, 19 measures were adopted from the Sullivan report to minimise the risk of a recurrence of that serious event.  Most of those measures related to enhanced risk assessment procedures, including external review of risk assessment procedures, and at group level assigning responsibility for risk assessment to a member of each group in respect of cases being processed by it.  They report under new management procedures, including the establishment of the legal MAC which the Deputy mentioned, to focus on the current legal issues.  The idea for the establishment of  the legal MAC was to concentrate not on the administrative but on the legal issues.  The administrative issues are clearly being dealt with in the normal way by the Secretary General of the Attorney General's office.  The legal MAC was set up to concentrate on the legal issues coming forward from the examination of the procedures, and this is happening.There was also to be further enhancement of the information communications technology system, including the provision of a risk register at case level, so that the case handler would be prompted to assess the risks in the opening of a case and at suitable checkpoints.  I understand that all these issues are being undertaken.I asked if all cases are brought to the legal MAC and, in response to Deputy Gilmore's question, not all cases are brought to it.  Currently there are 340 cases of constitutional actions against the State.  Therefore, not every case is brought to the legal MAC, only the cases it is believed merit that consideration where challenges have been made either to constitutional Acts of the Oireachtas or otherwise.  I thought the idea was that every case would come before it, but I want to be clear about that.  I checked the number of current cases and given the number it would not be possible for them all to come before it.  The main cases of the 340 current cases would be brought forward to the legal MAC.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I believe there were 19 recommendations in the Sullivan report.  How many of them have been implemented?  What is the timescale for their full implementation?Is the Taoiseach satisfied that a similar situation will not arise again?  I thought the then Attorney General, Rory Brady, was to be informed at certain stages, which did not happen.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that will not arise again?As the Taoiseach is aware, there were a number of cases where a statutory rape charge was made against a number of individuals.  Those charges were dropped because the charge in that context was unconstitutional and another charge was put against them.  What is the position regarding those persons or the charges of statutory rape, which were put against those individuals but which were not pursued in the courts because of the unconstitutionality of the charge?  Does the Taoiseach have any information on that?  How many of those cases are involved at the moment?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	16	To the best of my knowledge, there was only a small number of those cases.  I do not have the information on them but I understand most of them were brought back in under different clauses and they all took effect.  It is a number of months since I was briefed on it but, to the best of my knowledge, I do not believe there were any difficulties with them.I understand all the procedures have been brought in.  As Members will recall at that time the case was properly handled and efficiently dealt with but in terms of risk management it was not brought to the attention of the Attorney General.  There were seven phases where it should have been brought to his attention but that was only done in the first phase, which was the appointment of the legal counsel.I would like to be able to say to Deputy Kenny I would be absolutely confident nothing like that could happen again.  I was watching, as I am sure was the Deputy, what was happening in the UK overnight when the whole files of a system were put in the post.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	22	If one puts a file covering 25 million people in the post and does not register it, what does one expect?  We never know what might be happening at any time.  That is the point I am making.Seriously, all these matters have been followed through.   When I checked the position regarding the legal MAC and the number of cases current at any one time, I presumed that I would have been told there were, say, ten cases of actions against either statutory instruments or legislation of this House.  When I was briefed on this matter last week, I saw from the briefing notes there are currently 340 cases.  The huge volume of cases concerns me.  Each of these cases concerns a constitutional action taken against the State, either constitutional actions against statutes that we put in place or statutory instruments.  That number of cases shows the complexity of the work in that office and they account for only part of the work.When dealing with these questions, I checked back to the last round of difficulties we had in 1994 to 1995 and noted the figures then as against now.  The volume of litigation currently is extraordinary.  I would be naive to say that it will cease.  It puts enormous pressure on the system.  The recommendations in the 1995 report were fully implemented and the then Attorney General, Dermot Gleeson, to his credit, undertook the first overhaul of that office and subsequent office holders have continued on that work and brought in a huge range of procedures.  The volume of work and pressure in that office is enormous, given the volume of litigation.  That is proper and people are entitled to take such actions, but the volume of work is high.  Even though we have all these procedures in place, the number of cases is a concern.  We have protocols as to how these cases are handled but there is the issue of sheer volume of cases in the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We have implemented fully the recommendations of the Nally report, we have resolved the industrial relations and brought in the extra staff recommended.  A large number of staff are now working in the office but the volume of cases is huge.

I understand that the committee dealing with the referendum is about to be established and it will have to report within its terms of reference.  I understand that included in that is a projected four-month timeframe for responding.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that is the case?  Given that we will then have to go through the normal process of the Dáil and Seanad address of the enabling legislation in regard to the amendment to the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, does the Taoiseach anticipate that there will be sufficient time to allow for that proposed referendum to be held on the same day as the expected referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  Is it his intent to hold both on the same day or is he anticipating the latter coming first and a referendum on children's rights being held later in 2008?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Deputy will appreciate that is not totally within my control.  We will have to try to resolve that in the House as well.  I will give the Deputy my view and the Government's view on this.  We gave a commitment last spring that we would have a children's rights referendum within a year.  I would like to try to honour that.  We have set up a committee with terms of reference.  I understand it has come to a compromise that it will be five months before we can finalise it and that would put it back to the end of April.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, briefed me on this yesterday.  Then, there has to be a referendum Bill and in regard to the summer, that would make matters very tight.  Regardless of the other referendum, it would be very unlikely that we would have two referendums in one year or even within any foreseeable timeframe.  If this is not held in tandem with the other referendum next year, then it will be pushed back.  In the event, that would be unfair to the NGOs who are being pressed on this.  I gave a commitment two years ago that we would deal with this issue.As the Deputy knows, we have to deal with the other issue in 2008, albeit on no particular date.  I should like to see the work being undertaken by the all-party committee dealing with the constitutional amendment on children completed as speedily as possible, so that the two referendums may be held at the same time.  Our practice here has been to try to reach agreement in so far as we can on the holding of referendums.  It would be preferable to hold them together, if we can.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I have a brief supplementary for the Taoiseach.  I gather from his response that he would like to see both referendums taking place on the one day, and that makes eminent sense because, hopefully, it would maximise participation.  Is he concerned, however, given the timeframes that I have outlined in my original question, that the prospects of this being achieved are unlikely, because of constraints of time both as regards the new committee and in the context of whatever enabling legislation must be processed through both Houses of the Oireachtas?  I am concerned and would like the Taoiseach to elaborate further since his response indicates they are unlikely to be held together on the same day.  Given the pattern of referendum intervals, can he say whether there could be an inordinate delay before the children's referendum is placed before the people?  Can he be somewhat more specific and give the House a further sense of his current understanding of the situation and what steps he believes may be taken to accommodate both referendums at the earliest opportunity, preferably on the one day?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	26	That is a fair summary of what I stated.  If we are to hold the two referendums together, it means the work has to be done as speedily as possible.  It seems to me a large amount of work has been done and the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, advises me that the committee will take until the end of April.  Then a referendum Bill will have to be passed, but it is really a matter of how to schedule the timetable.  If that is not done, then the commitment of every party leader in the House will have been broken, not just mine, that this issue would be dealt with within a year.  I do not believe the NGOs, which comprise a large number of organisations from all over the country, would be upset if that commitment was broken by a few months.  However, it would be a different position if it were to be broken by a few years, and that is not desirable.  I shall do everything I can, but I need the co-operation of everybody to try to deal with these two issues together.  The fact is that we have given a commitment for one to be finished around Easter, and that is not possible.  The other we have to deal with in 2008, because of the EU implications.  Some degree of effort is therefore required from the children's committee, which I know has just started work in this regard, as well as from the House, to deal with the two issues.  It would be better if we could deal with them together.

Do his briefing notes have further information in this regard?  He mentioned a figure of 340 that are currently in hand.  What percentage of these cases actually come to trial?  More important, perhaps, how many successfully identify a breach of the Constitution in any year as regards either primary or secondary legislation?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The answer to the last question is that the percentage is tiny, but that does not impede the effort.  I do not have a breakdown.  To be honest, I was surprised there were that many cases through the legal MAC.  I had not realised the number was that high, but only a small percentage of cases are ever successful.  A fair number of them are pushed all the way, however.  The Deputy has been in the House as long as I have and knows there is an ever-growing industry, if that is the word, reviewing the legislation on statutory instruments and formulating challenges around particular groups.  That seems to grow exponentially every year.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.The programme for Government contains a commitment to instigate a review of the entire economic regulatory environment.  This review will be designed to ensure that the existing regulatory regime is operating efficiently, balancing the needs of users with the requirements of producers and is not imposing excessive costs on the economy.An interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department, has been tasked with advancing work in this area.  Arising from the group's recommendations, the Government has agreed to establish an Oireachtas Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs whose remit will include the scrutiny of the efficiency and effectiveness of regulators in key economic sectors such as energy, communications, transport, health and safety and financial services.  As Deputies will be aware, the committee will be chaired by Deputy Michael Moynihan.In the medium term, the interdepartmental group has been tasked by Government with examining a range of legislative provisions to enhance accountability and the transparency of regulators' operations.  These measures will strengthen oversight of regulators by the new Oireachtas committee.  The Government believes that we need stronger international data and benchmarks in order to assess the comparative efficiency and effectiveness of Irish regulators.  Terms of reference for such an international study are currently being finalised by the interdepartmental group.The Davidson report in Britain examined the transposition of EU legislation in the UK by the British Government.  While much concern is expressed about the over-implementation of EU legislation — or "gold plating" as it is often called — a key finding of the Davidson report was that these concerns are greatly exaggerated and, in practice, there was very little evidence of gold plating to be found in the UK.With regard to Ireland, my Department commissioned the ESRI to conduct a survey of business attitudes to regulation which was published earlier this year.  This study examined in detail the responses of more than 800 Irish companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises.  The study found that regulation ranks behind concerns over labour costs and increased competition in terms of challenges faced by business, but ahead of concerns over infrastructure and staffing issues.  In general, firms feel that the overall amount of regulation is about right.  This finding is in line with the PricewaterhouseCoopers CEO Pulse Survey 2007, which found that on a worldwide stage, 73% of CEOs see regulation as the main potential barrier to growth compared with the Irish figure of only 3%.It is important that in examining the burdens imposed by regulation, we do not diminish the protections for citizens and workers that have been put in place.  Nevertheless, it is right to see whether there are unnecessary burdens and red tape that could be eliminated without impinging on the core purpose of regulation.  With this in mind, I have tasked my colleague, Deputy Michéal Martin, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment with driving our national programme of reducing unnecessary administrative burdens.  Deputy Martin has appointed a high level group of officials and representatives of business and trade unions, to look at ways of reducing unnecessary burdens in five priority areas identified by Irish business as the most burdensome.These are taxation, health and safety, environment law, statistical returns and employment and company law.  This is in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government to ensure direct feedback from business on regulatory burdens.  The work of this group will inform Ireland's approach to meeting the commitment contained in the spring European Council conclusions to put in place a national programme to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens.Regarding the timely transposition of EU legislation into Irish law, my Department has a monitoring role through the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European affairs which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche.  The transposition of EU directives is a standing item in the work programme of the committee.Departments are required to provide regular updates on directives applicable to their areas of responsibility.  The updates assist in the co-ordination and monitoring of the transposition of all EU directives, including those counted towards the European Commission's Internal Market scoreboard.  The Commission has set a 1% transposition deficit target for the Internal Market scoreboard for 2009.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Is the Taoiseach happy with how the various regulatory bodies are operating?  Serious concerns arise in respect of a number of them.  We touched on the fact that, since we established an energy regulator, most of the companies selling energy raised their prices last year to an extraordinarily high level.  This year, having imposed huge increases mistakenly, many of which were unnecessary and drove inflation, the Commission for Energy Regulation is proposing to reduce some prices.  However, the reductions will by no means be as great as the increases.  The Irish inflation rate is now at the top end of the European scale and a key element in driving it has been the manner in which regulation has taken place in the energy sector.  This is but one example.There was recently an international credit crisis and credit crunch.  An extensive system of financial regulation was established in Ireland but it was not enough to prevent a number of spectacular collapses in the International Financial Services Centre and among companies offering special investment vehicles.  It turned out that these companies and their investment vehicles were not regulated.  Can the review about which the Taoiseach is speaking be in any way meaningful if it does not take account of the effectiveness of regulation, particularly in respect of the prices regulators allow their respective industries or service providers to charge?  Does the Taoiseach propose that the review should take account of this?I do not want to address the issue of public transport but one should consider the role of the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  I do not know when the Taoiseach was last in a taxi or whether he noted how dirty and expensive some of them were.  Our taxi fares are among the highest in Europe.  It costs between €8 and €10, at a minimum, to travel during the day between the canals in this city, a journey of less than three miles.  Many taxi drivers offer a great service and a great running commentary on the whole political system.  It is great fun——
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	31	And on me.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Taoiseach does not get that commentary; I do and it is very informative.  I do not know what the regulator does because the cleanliness of some taxis leaves a lot to be desired.  Is the Taoiseach happy with the regulatory system he has established?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	33	We have a large number of regulators, as the Deputy implied, and the review is designed to ensure the existing regulatory regime operates efficiently, balances the needs of users with the requirements of producers and does not impose excessive costs on the economy.  That is exactly what I want to see done.The regulatory system we have built has reflected international practice for the past 15 years or so.  There are regulators for different areas, including the Commission for Communications Regulation, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Commission for Taxi Regulation and the Financial Regulator.  The interdepartmental group which includes my Department is working in this area.  It has been very active in recent years and has done a lot of good work, as has been recognised by both unions and employers.  Arising from its recommendations, we have agreed to establish an Oireachtas committee on regulation that will give Members a chance to scrutinise the efficiency of regulators in all key economic areas, including energy, communications, transport, health and safety, and financial services.I agree with the Deputy's point on unregulated special investment vehicles.  When dealing with changes affecting the credit unions, for example, with which changes I have been dealing for the past few years, one can get nothing passed if it is not sanctioned by the Financial Regulator.  I have no problem with this because there is always a likelihood that someone will hit the dust, thereby causing a big problem.  A special investment vehicle allowance which can amount to tens of millions of euro can operate outside the remit of the Financial Regulator.  I have said outside the House and reiterate within it that the issue in question was broadly spread.  That was my understanding of it and I spoke about it when it arose.During the term of the last Dáil I answered questions endlessly on how the regulators per se worked.  I stated we would review them and included a proposal to this effect in the programme for Government.  We also decided to establish an Oireachtas committee to scrutinise them.  Needless to say, the regulators work hard to the best of their ability and do their jobs, yet a device is needed, whereby the Oireachtas can question their work.  This will be achieved by the interdepartmental group and the Oireachtas committee.  For the existing and new regulators, this will allow for far better functioning of the House.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I take it as given that the staff of the Commission for Energy Regulation work from morning until night, but they got the pricing of energy products seriously wrong, with a consequent economic impact.We discussed the ESB previously.  The effect of regulating the ESB and allowing competition under the guidance of a regulator was such that electricity prices were pushed to the top of the EU scale.  The Taoiseach stated less than an hour ago that electricity prices had been historically low theretofore.  The price increase imposed great burdens on consumers and particularly on industry which at the beginning of the process appeared as if it would gain.  The gain did not last.What is the point in having an oversight system for regulation if the core economic effect of regulation has been to drive up prices and inflation, a key indicator of our economic competitiveness?  How quickly do regulators who permit price increases row back and reduce them when they get them wrong?  It has taken almost one year for some of the energy price reductions to materialise.My point on financial services regulation is that credit unions are correctly subjected to much regulation, as the Taoiseach stated.  However, there was nothing to advise them not to invest in structured investment vehicles.  Very wealthy high rollers in Irish society, and others, invested tens of millions in such vehicles.  It is essentially a form of gambling and the only difference between it and Nick Leeson's on-line spread-betting operation for Paddy Power is that the average punter with Paddy Power probably restricts his bets to sums between €2,000 and €5,000.  Those investing in structured investment vehicles through the Irish Stock Exchange, on the other hand, are investing tens of millions of euro.  Will the Financial Regulator address this issue sooner rather than later?  There is a huge hole in our financial regulatory system whereby the regulator has made decisions that certain types of financial activity are outside the remit of regulation.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that this also includes the prices charged for the purchase of financial investment products sold by insurance companies.  Again, we have some of the highest prices in Europe.  When somebody goes to buy a PRSA or some other kind of financial insurance investment product, the cost of the purchase of those services is extraordinarily high in this country and seems to be entirely outside the regulation remit.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on this because we all want to bring down prices and costs and these are significant cost areas?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I do not want to get into insurance and financial regulation, which are covered by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government's position is that it has set up the interdepartmental group which will be tasked with examining the range of legislation to enhance the accountability and transparency of regulators' operations in their entirety.  These measures will strengthen oversight.I think Deputy Burton would agree that the fact that we have oversight over these regulators and that the Oireachtas will now have oversight over them is a good thing.  I have given her my general view.  I have never believed that hedging is not a regulated area.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	36	It is not.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I do not agree with that position.  Hedge funds are not akin to somebody going to Paddy Power.  I know one could use this argument in respect of how they are classified.  Punting a few hundred euro and punting hundreds of millions of euro into vehicle funds is entirely different.  It would not take until lunch time to work out that even if one put a limit on it, all these issues would come into it.  George Soros used hedge funds to attack the ERM and the entire financial system over a decade ago.  About 20 analyses of this were carried out internationally.  This was a regulated end of the market.  I have no reason to change my view.When Deputy Burton asked for my view, I was surprised to see that this vehicle fund of several hundred million euro was not regulated.  It would have been in the interest of the individuals involved, regardless of whether they are high rollers, if it was also regulated.  Maybe they thought the fact that it was not regulated was a good idea but I think they will change their minds now.The independent Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which was established in 1999, has regulated the market here.  It has regulated the natural gas market for the past five or six years.  Many of these measures came from EU legislation and European decisions and we set it down here by way of legislation.  The framework of our legislative policy in which CER functions reflects EU energy policy.  All of these areas, by and large, were initiatives and came from EU legislation and directives which we transposed.  What we did not do at the time was set up a regulatory and oversight system which is what this measure is doing.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The Davidson review was a very comprehensive report which made a number of recommendations on best practice in the implementation of EU legislation.  Is it not the case that this report highlighted unnecessary costs for business in respect of regulatory creep and the over-implementation of regulations coming from Europe?  Is it not the case that this is a huge concern not just for the business community in Ireland but for the public in general?Why has the Taoiseach not included sectors such as agriculture in the review which he has instigated?  Is it not the case that we have an upcoming health check in this area next year?  This would be an ideal time to review the regulatory impact of European bureaucracy in agriculture and the environment.  I know the Taoiseach touched on this area in his initial response.Our system is inadequate from the perspective of EU scrutiny.  What steps will be taken to ensure that this creeping bureaucracy is not introduced in various sectors of Irish society?  What specific measures will the Taoiseach put in place in advance of the tabling of the EU reform treaty?  Is it not the case that one of the biggest issues that will come up in respect of this treaty is bureaucracy?  This is brought on us because Ministers have time and again blamed Europe for introducing rules and regulations when in fact it is the transposition of those regulations by those same Ministers into Irish law that has caused the difficulty.  How are we going to address the issue of the interpretation of EU directives by the Government in Ireland, which, in the vast majority of cases, is causing the problem for people when they try to comply with these regulations on the ground?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	39	My question is in the same vein.  In the programme for Government, it is stated that the Government will implement procedures to ensure feedback from business in respect of the burden of regulation and publish annual reports on these issues.  Have the procedures been introduced and can the Taoiseach tell us what they are?  What mechanism is being used to consult with business?Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a significant burden on small businesses in particular in respect of complying with the regulatory burden emanating from the EU?  I offer that question in line with the Davidson review on the implementation of EU legislation and the final report of same in respect of the same matter in the neighbouring island of Great Britain.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the detail of the Davidson review?  While the report states that the impact is not as great as is generally believed, it nevertheless makes specific recommendations and instances a number of issues in respect of MOT tests, fisheries, insurance and mediation.In line with those and using the example of the MOT test, would such recommendations as are contained in the Davidson review have application here?  Would the Taoiseach consider similar measures in order to relieve the burden and responsibility on business, including small businesses, and the individual citizen?
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Given that the Taoiseach will visit Cork later this week, I hope he will announce some good news for the city and that he will honour the commitments given in respect of Cork Airport before the last election.  If he can spare a minute or two or a few hours, he might visit west Cork and see what we need there.  Maybe I might get a chance to introduce him to his palatial home down there or to his super ocean-going yacht.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I will take the three questions from the Deputies together.    A unit in my Department works with representatives of small business, IBEC and the trade unions.  It has carried out a survey of 800 companies, including small companies.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers Pulse Survey is also available.  Worldwide, 73% of CEOs see regulation as the main potential barrier to growth.  The figure in Ireland is 3% so we do not have an enormous problem with this.  We try to identify the burdens and those put forward by industry include taxation and, increasingly, health and safety, which industry sees as imposing too many rules, regulations and plans.  The latest Act addresses some of these concerns.  The other areas are environmental law, to which Deputy Naughten was particularly referring, statistical returns and employment and company law.  These are the five main areas, the others are small and insignificant.  In each of those areas we are working with the industry sector and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is examining how we can eliminate as much as we can without impinging on the core purpose of regulation.  Much of it involves simplification and using technology in better ways.When EU legislation is used to enhance matters, by cleaning water, improving the air or addressing issues of safety on roads, people are in favour of it.  When EU legislation imposes an obligation on people, they are against it.  One group of social partners wants EU law transposed because it improves security of work and the other group points out how it affects one of the five areas outlined.  Progress is being made on these issues and if we follow the regulation line, follow reports on business attitudes to regulations and get stakeholders to work together we can get rid of much bureaucracy and forms, as has happened in the past few years.  Many of the forms are not necessary and refer to old legislation even though the statutes stipulate what must be done.The Davidson review examined the transposition of EU legislation and came from Eurosceptics who were trying to argue the case that transposition of EU directives in the UK was causing major concern to British business.  Members of the group got their way on how the report should be done but then they found their concerns were greatly exaggerated.  The report found there was little evidence of gold plating in the UK, even though the project started from a totally Eurosceptic point of view.  That is why one does not hear much about the Davidson review anymore from Eurosceptics.  It did not give them the result they sought.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	46	There is no regulator for agriculture, which is done in a different way in the EU.  In fairness to Commissioner Fischer Boel, with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food we have been able to address most of the issues in agriculture in a satisfactory manner.  We must comply with EU regulations and, while we have a review of some of the issues, most of the major obstacles have been overcome by the single payment scheme.  The form is still too long and too difficult but we have tried to achieve an understanding with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Commission on that issue.  We must be mindful of the resources we receive.  That debate will be continued in the next review.Regarding the issue in Cork, we will try to ensure they are not regulated.

In respect of the Health Information Bill, due in 2008, the comments made by Professor Drumm to the Oireachtas last week were very different to what was contained in an internal memorandum from him to his senior staff concerning the transformation of the health services.

Private hospitals are not regulated under appropriate legislation.  Cancer treatment is supplied by a variety of hospitals throughout the country.  Does the Government intend to review the legislation in order to extend the remit of regulation of hospitals to include private hospitals in the legislation?What is the situation regarding the proposed review of local government in the context of local government elections of 2009 and the statements from the Minister indicating the proposed review of local government boundaries could take a long time?  The Taoiseach recently commented on this matter in the House.  Will he provide a more definitive timetable as to when, in the run-up to the elections, information relating to the local government boundaries will be forthcoming?  There are many areas where, as a result of development, towns have grown significantly larger in recent years.  These towns have made applications in respect of establishing town councils.  Will these applications be considered as part of the Minister's review?Despite tabling questions to the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, I cannot obtain information on what proposals for introducing a carbon budget on budget day will mean in practice.  We do not know what the budget will contain and the Tánaiste is now stating it will take the form of a carbon report appended to the budget.  Will the Taoiseach see to it that Opposition parties receive some information in respect of the proposed contents of the carbon report that will be contained in the budget in two weeks' time?

A report in today's Irish Examiner reveals that four women in the Cork area who are the victims of sex trafficking are being kept in hiding and that there may be 200 such women throughout the country who are being detained in a brutal fashion.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appears to view the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Bill in an extremely confined way.  The legislation does not seem to include any provisions relating to victim or witness protection.  In the light of today’s newspaper report and the questions continually put to the Minister in respect of this matter, will the Government reconsider the proposed legislation and take on board issues relating to victim protection in order to ensure supports will be put in place to allow victims to come forward and challenge criminality of this nature?

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources collapsed the greener homes grants scheme in September as a result of a budget overrun.  He promised at the time that phase 2 would be introduced and that a Supplementary Estimate would be provided.  Subsequently, a token Supplementary Estimate was introduced but all this did was to pay the bills run up by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  Is it the Government's intention to introduce a Supplementary Estimate, as promised by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources?

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Deputy is well aware that we cannot discuss the content of legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The matter to which I am about to refer involves European and Irish legislation.  As the Taoiseach is aware, an EU directive designed to protect temporary and agency workers was introduced in 2002.  The number of such workers has increased by some 500% in recent years.  Since 2002, the Government, with those of two other EU member states, has stalled this directive.  Given the suffering and bad pay and conditions agency and temporary workers must endure and in the light of the totally disgraceful way they are often treated by many employers, will the Government be supporting, at the European Commission on 5 December, moves to bring forward legislation in respect of these workers?  In view of the fact that temporary and agency workers are often treated with callous disregard, will the Government introduce domestic legislation to protect them?  People are sacked at a moment's notice.  I expected the Taoiseach to have an interest in this area but he has done nothing about it in 11 years.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I move:That Dáil Éireann:recognises the many difficulties and challenges which face young people in Ireland today;notes the important initiatives and ongoing developments in the following areas:addressing issues pertaining to alcohol-related harm;preventing drug misuse;promoting good nutrition and combating obesity;promotion of healthier lifestyles;provision of sports facilities;mental health awareness and suicide prevention programmes;sexual health awareness;youth work;youth justice;increasing youth participation;providing opportunities for recreation;affirms the importance of consulting with young people on matters of public policy which affect them; andwelcomes the growth of this practice amongst public bodies in the development of services and facilities for young people.As Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, I am delighted to have the opportunity to move this motion on young people and to outline to Members how the Government has made a significant and valuable contribution to improving the level of supports and services for young people in Ireland today.During the course of this debate, Members will hear from my colleagues about a range of initiatives and developments across a number of Departments which favourably impact on improving the lives of young people.  For my part, I will concentrate on those initiatives falling withinthe ambit of the Office of the Minister for Children.The Government announced an expanded role for the Office of the Minister for Children in December 2005.  The effect of the decision was to provide for the bringing together of a range of policy matters related to children and young people under a single umbrella within the Office of the Minister for Children, commonly referred to as the OMC.One of the key roles of the Office of the Minister for Children is to support the implementation of the national children's strategy which applies to children and young people up to the age of 18.  The national children's strategy, Our Children — Their Lives, was published by the Government in 2000 following widespread consultation with the full range of stakeholders and, for the first time in Ireland, with children and young people themselves.  The strategy covers a ten year period, from 2000 to 2010, and draws together the challenges facing young people in Ireland in all aspects of their lives and commits Departments and agencies to a range of objectives to address these issues.The Government pledges its support for the strategy's three national goals.  Goal 1 is that children and young people will have a voice in matters which affect them and their views will be given due weight in accordance with their age and maturity.  Goal 2 is that children and young people's lives will be better understood and Goal 3 states that children and young people will receive quality supports and services.I will concentrate on those actions and strategies pursued by my office to support the achievement of these goals.  Under Goal 1, the national children's strategy acknowledges children and young people as citizens with a contribution to make to social and political life.  The Government recognises its duty to empower young people to participate in issues affecting their lives.The OMC takes the lead role in managing delivery of Goal 1 and ensuring the development and improvement of structures such as Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle na nÓg to enable participation by young people.  It also undertakes specific participation projects in partnership with statutory bodies, Departments and non-government organisations and provides advice and support on young people's participation.  The Office of the Minister for Children is fully committed to ensuring that young people who are hard to reach are included in participation structures and projects.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I do not wish to interrupt the Minister unduly.  Will his speech be distributed?
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	112	It should be, yes.  I apologise to Deputy Shatter.I am pleased to state that during the past five years, the OMC has become a centre of excellence for participation by young people in decision making and champions the importance of giving young people a voice with regard to other Departments, State agencies and  non-government organisations.In recent years, my office conducted consultations with young people on a number of issues of national importance, including involving children and young people in the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children, the development of the national recreation policy, the taskforce on active citizenship, the age of consent for sexual activity and the development of the Irish youth justice strategy.Comhairle na nÓg are youth councils established under the national children's strategy in all 34 city and county development board areas of the country.  They give young people a voice at local level and an opportunity to influence local policy and planning.  Young people are elected to Dáil na nÓg through their local Comhairle na nÓg.The effective development of Comhairle na nÓg is cited in Towards 2016, as a key innovative Government measure and will be one of the major priorities of my office during the next ten years.  During 2006, the OMC established an implementation group to develop and improve the operation of Comhairle na nÓg throughout the country.  Proposals from the implementation group have been approved and a funding and enhancement strategy aimed at developing good practice and building capacity has been put in place, with additional funding of €400,000 allocated to this measure this year.  To date, 30 out of the 34 Comhairle na nÓg have applied for funding under this scheme.  An independent evaluation process for the scheme has been put in place by my office.During 2008, the implementation group will develop a five-year strategic plan for Comhairle na nÓg and establish a national steering committee to oversee delivery of that plan.  Local steering groups will also be established, with strong links to the children's services committee once they are in place.Dáil na nÓg is the national parliament for young people aged 12 to 18 years and takes place once a year.  A consortium comprising the National Youth Council of Ireland, Foróige and Youth Work Ireland hold the contract to run Dáil na nÓg from 2006 to 2008, in co-operation with the Office of the Minister for Children.  It is widely acknowledged that Dáil na nÓg has gone from strength to strength since its inception in 2001.  Successive independent evaluations of Dáil na nÓg have informed the implementation of changes and improvements over the years.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	113	It is an extraordinary discourtesy to the House that at this stage the Minister of State's speech has not been distributed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I have asked my colleague to check why it was not brought down.Dáil na nÓg 2007 met on 17 February.  The two themes selected by the delegates were road safety and attitudes towards young people.  Each Comhairle na nÓg elected one delegate to the Dáil na nÓg council to follow up the recommendations from Dáil na nÓg 2007.  The work of the Dáil na nÓg council is jointly managed and supported by the OMC and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The council conducts research into the main recommendations from Dáil na nÓg and meets with key policy-makers with a view to implementing change for young people in these areas.As part of its research into road safety, two Dáil na nÓg councillors attended the first UN road safety week in April, the theme of which was young road users.  Another two councillors attended the World Health Organisation children's environmental health intergovernmental meeting and youth assembly in Vienna in June as part of the Irish Government delegation.  The young councillors will make presentations on their findings to the Road Safety Authority, the Garda Síochána and the Oireachtas Committee on Transport to put forward recommendations on road safety education courses, vehicle safety measures and road safety legislation.  They will meet with the Community Transportation Association of Ireland to offer feedback on its work on rural transportation and infrastructure.The councillors are also working on the negative stereotyping of teenagers by the media, which was one of the major issues raised at Dáil na nÓg 2007.  The young councillors conducted comprehensive research into newspaper coverage of the celebrations of junior certificate results.  They will make presentations to the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the National Union of Journalists and newspaper, television and radio editors.  They have also written an article for The Irish Times which will appear next week.I had the opportunity to meet with the group when it was discussing road safety and media coverage.  I was extremely impressed with the commitment and knowledge of its members and the urgency they attached to their deliberations, particularly with regard to media coverage and their anxiety to ensure this age cohort receives better coverage from the broadcast and print media than it has in recent years.The delegates at Dáil na nÓg 2006 voted as their top priority the establishment of a website for teenagers providing information on activities, facilities, clubs and youth entertainment.  In response to this demand, my office is in the process of completing construction and development of www.teenspace.ie, a national website on activities and facilities for young people.  The site will go live in March 2008.  Dáil na nÓg councillors and young people from my office’s children and young people’s forum have been involved at all stages in developing the site.  Site branding and content will be linked to Teenspace, the national recreation policy for young people, which was launched in September 2007.Effective student councils in second-level schools are cited in Towards 2016 as an innovative Government measure.  My office is collaborating with the Department of Education and Science in overseeing the running of the new student council support service recommended in the final report of the student council working group established, chaired and managed by my office.  Eleven second-level students aged between 13 and 17 were involved in this working group, marking a milestone in public policy making.In a related initiative, my office has collaborated with the curriculum development unit in funding the development of a civic social and political education teaching and learning resource entitled Giving Children and Young People a Voice.  This resource promotes the right of children and young people to a voice in matters that affect their lives under the National Children's Strategy and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  It incorporates information about Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle na nÓg, and their potential links with student councils.  The establishment or improvement of student councils is the main focus of the resource, which is currently being printed and will become the basis for the work of the student council support service.In keeping with international good practice on involving children and young people in decision making, the office's children and young people's forum, CYPF, was established in 2004 to advise on issues of concern to children and young people.  The forum includes 25 young people aged between 12 and 18 from all parts of the country who were nominated to the CYPF through Comhairle na nÓg and organisations representing hard to reach children and young people.  The CYPF has been an invaluable resource for the office.  Its members have been consulted on, or involved with, many initiatives including design and content of the national recreation policy, development of student council resources, health service provision for teenagers, the mid-term review of the national children's strategy, co-facilitating and organising national consultations with teenagers on alcohol misuse, development of aspects of the office website, www.omc.gov.ie and tender evaluation for relevant projects.  Many organisations have consulted the CYPF, including the HSE, the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the growing up in Ireland study team and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board.In February 2007, the then Minister with responsibility for children announced that a series of consultation workshops would be held with teenagers to seek their views on solutions to alcohol misuse by teenagers.  This was in recognition that if alcohol misuse is to be addressed, young people will have to be part of the solution.  Research in this area, such as the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs and the health behaviour of school-going children, shows that binge drinking is a problem among many teenagers in Ireland and that Irish teenagers have a very high rate of alcohol consumption.  In October, 257 young people between the ages of 12 and 18 years took part in a national consultation on alcohol misuse in five locations around the country.  The response to the invitation to participate was overwhelming, which indicates a significant interest in youth participation and the issue of alcohol abuse.  The consultations were framed to seek young people's views on the solutions to alcohol misuse.  The CYPF was directly involved in the preparation, collection, analysis and compilation of information arising from the consultation.  A report of these consultations is currently being prepared by my office.  I had an opportunity to attend a consultation which took place in Dublin and was impressed at the level of participation and the significance attached by participants to the issue.My office is firmly committed to improving young people's lives through research.  Work undertaken in my office is based on goal No. 2 of the national children's strategy.  The objectives of the programme are to build a more coherent understanding of children and young people's development and needs among those working with them, to develop an evidenced-based approach to decision making at all levels down to the point of delivery, to improve the communication, production and dissemination of research and information and to improve evaluation and monitoring of services.I was delighted to launch Teenspace, the national recreation policy for young people, last September.  This was the first time any Government brought forward a comprehensive policy about young people's recreational needs.  The policy reflects in concrete terms our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the national children's strategy.  Essentially, the policy provides a strategic framework for the promotion of positive recreational opportunities aimed principally at young people aged 12 to 18 and includes seven core objectives.  Each objective incorporates a series of corresponding actions for priority implementation by the various Departments and agencies which have a crucial role to play in delivery within the overall framework of the national policy.There is no doubt that recreation is an essential childhood experience which enriches young people's lives.  In the past, we often assumed that opportunities for these activities simply existed.  However, the major changes experienced by this country in recent decades mean we can no longer make that assumption.  Young people have been explaining to us the reasons we have not been getting it right.  We need to understand that the way young people spend their free time has a major impact on their development, socialisation and future lives.  Benefits of recreation include promoting self-esteem, well-being, freedom and independence; providing chances to let off steam and have fun; helping young people to be healthy and active; improving problem-solving capabilities; and a better perception of quality of life.The national children's strategy identified the need for more opportunities for community based play, leisure and cultural activities.  There has been considerable public investment in recreational activities in recent years.  I welcome the funding provided by the Government and commend the many voluntary organisations which are actively involved in providing recreational and sporting facilities for people of all age groups.The national recreational policy for young people is not merely about advancing new initiatives.  It also involves a more integrated and strategic approach to investments already being made.  The Government and many providers are aware that we can achieve more from existing funding streams if we collaborate across agencies in a more structured way.  There is no doubt the policies and actions being pursued by my office will have an immense impact on the provision of better services and improved outcomes for young people.  I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies on this motion.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I move amendmentNo. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"calls on the Government to submit to Dáil Éireann, within one month, a comprehensive plan of action which will deal with the many difficulties and challenges faced by young people in Ireland today, set out firm completion dates for action, measurable performance targets and assign responsibility to specific Ministers and Ministers of State."I regard this motion as a gross abuse of Parliament.  It will have no impact of any description on any issue that genuinely affects young people.  Essentially, this intellectually bankrupt and exhausted Government, which is bereft of ideas and incapable of producing legislation, is conjuring up a motion to fill the entirety of today's business because the alternative was to simply adjourn the House.  This motion clearly indicates that, after more than ten years in office, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have passed their sell-by date.  They are engaged in a cynical act of gesture politics.  It also represents the final surrender of the Green Party to the Fianna Fáil mentality.  The Green Party, fresh-faced and bushy tailed to Government, does not have a single legislative proposal to bring before the House which would introduce the badly needed reforms it and other parties have identified in the past five years. This is a spurious, self-congratulatory, meaningless motion which is devoid of substance.  Essentially, it says the Government is great and talks to young people and deserves a pat on the back for all the good things it is doing.  It randomly refers to a series of concerns to young people, as if by listing them, hey presto, the magic political wand is waved and these problems are resolved.The House should encourage many more young people to be involved in politics than those to whom the Minister of State referred.  A very small proportion of young people participate in politics or are aware of or involved in Dáil na nÓg or the commission for young people, the bodies to which the Minister of State referred.  The overwhelming majority of young people are hugely cynical of politicians and the political process and have little faith in the capacity of Governments or the House to address the needs they confront.  Most young people, if they took time to read the Minister of State's speech, would wonder what on earth we, as legislators, are doing wasting our time engaging in a debate on a motion of this nature.The motion is, however, interesting in one respect.  It shows the limited vision of the Government, which pretends to know the problems facing young people, even if it does not appear to have many answers as to how to address them and is incapable even of identifying a range of issues which need to be addressed.  It is interesting to note the issues the Minister of State chose to omit.  Street violence and anti-social behaviour are the scourge of many young people on Friday and Saturday evenings in the centre of our cities and towns.  It does not appear to occur to the Minister of State that these problems need to be addressed.It is of concern to many parents of autistic children that proper services and educational facilities are not available for their children.  This issue directly affects young people and their future lives and capacities in adulthood yet the Government has fought battles in the courts to resist having the State provide to the parents of autistic children education within an applied behaviour analytical, ABA, framework.  The Government and its predecessor have wasted hundreds of thousands of euro in legal costs trying to resist establishing the educational facilities sought by parents and have defended the indefensible in the courts in the context of young people with special needs or behavioural difficulties who require specific forms of education.  As a consequence of its stance, badly pressed parents have been forced to litigate.The motion refers to Government action in the area of drug abuse.  While resources have been invested in this area, not enough is being done.  It was interesting to read in a good supplement to yesterday's edition of the Irish Examiner dealing with the drug crisis comments by the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs strategy, Deputy Pat Carey, in which he promised yet again to provide a variety of facilities.  In dealing with drug abuse, methadone appears to be the principal weapon or treatment mode in the armoury of the State.  Some people have been on methadone for seven, eight, nine or ten years and addiction to this drug has replaced addiction to other drugs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, admitted that young people on methadone will continue to take the substance into adulthood because of the lack of residential rehabilitation places and structured after-care.I recall being present in the House in 2001 when the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition promised to provide the necessary facilities to address the problem, a promise the current Government continues to make.  While we need to tackle prevention head on, we should also ensure that drug addicts have treatment urgently made available to them when they finally seek it and do not find themselves placed on waiting lists for months while their lives continue to be destroyed.  It is possible these individuals will lack the capacity to avail of treatment by the time it becomes available.Other issues the Minister of State appears not to believe require addressing include the housing crisis facing many young people, the Government's complete failure to ensure social housing is available and the excessive expense of getting on the housing ladder, an issue which, in the context of first-time buyers, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was finally battered into addressing in the dying days of the general election campaign when he promised stamp duty reform.  Much more needs to be done.  Young people are under severe pressure to find affordable housing, an area on which the Government has utterly failed.Children affected by domestic violence come within the Minister of State's brief.  There is a complete lack of counselling facilities for children caught in these circumstances.  In the context of providing refuges for the victims of domestic violence, it is extremely difficult to find accommodation in refuges when a woman who has been a victim of domestic violence is accompanied by a male child in his teenage years.  What is being done to address this problem, which is not even mentioned in the motion?In the context of our court structures dealing with children in need of care and protection District Court judges are crying out for a court welfare service to undertake independent assessments to facilitate the court in making decisions in the best interests of children.  In the context of marital breakdown, the courts do not have a welfare service attached to them to facilitate judges to determine the appropriate orders to make with regard to parenting, for example, on questions such as which parent should be the primary custodian or carer of a child or what arrangement should be made regarding child access.  In the event that, on the one hand, there is concern that a child could be at risk if left alone with a parent while, on the other, it is also believed that the child should maintain a relationship with the parent in question, supervised call-in centres similar to those established in England, other parts of Europe and the United States are not available to facilitate child-parent access arrangements.  The Minister of State, by the very wording of the motion, has indicated the Government's lack of insight and policy in terms of tackling a broad range of serious issues.The House should be dealing with legislation today given that the Government has been in office for almost six months.  In my previous 21 years in the House, I have never seen an Order Paper of the nature of the current Order Paper which does not list a single Bill as waiting to be dealt with in the House.  The Government has utterly failed to deliver on any aspect of its legislative programme, as published on 25 September, or to produce a single new Bill, as agreed to and promised in the programme for Government in June last.It is interesting, when dealing with a motion on young people which will achieve nothing, effect no change and impact on no one, to examine the legislative programme.  I recall that I was shaving while listening to the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Tom Kitt, speak on the "Morning Ireland" programme on Tuesday, 25 September.  During the interview he promised the Irish people that a great, exciting legislative programme would be brought before the House before Christmas.  It is an extraordinary achievement that two months later and six months into the lifetime of the Government none of the 17 Bills listed in the legislative programme has been published.  This demonstrates a lack of commitment, seriousness and energy and a desire to be in power for power's sake, rather than to address issues.Some of the Bills promised directly affect young people.  A serious issue exists for young people at third level colleges with regard to the level of student grants, the costs of being in college, the cost of books and the availability and cost of accommodation.  The Government has promised a student support Bill.  Although third level fees have been abolished, students must make additional payments to colleges at the start of the academic year.  We are debating a nebulous motion about young people, but the student support Bill, which was third on the priority list mentioned by Deputy Tom Kitt on 25 September, has not been published.  The employment agency regulation Bill, which will affect young people, was also promised before Christmas, but it has not been published.The adoption Bill to ratify the Hague Convention on foreign adoptions has been promised since 1999, but we may celebrate a decade of that promise before we see the Bill, despite the fact that major problems in that area need resolution.  Our adoption laws are still largely based on the Adoption Act 1952 and a series of amending Acts which fail to address a range of issues that should have long been addressed.  These days many of the couples who are fortunate enough to adopt under our domestic adoption system agree to an open adoption system as opposed to a closed system where everyone's anonymity is preserved.  However, our legislation makes no provision for this.Some young people who have been adopted wish to trace their origins.  A series of promises have been made with regard to putting in place a legislative framework to facilitate them while also protecting the privacy of natural parents in appropriate circumstances.  That framework has been promised for years and was originally delayed because of a Supreme Court decision which was delivered four and a half years ago.  There is no serious intent in what we are doing today.  Where is the adoption Bill?  We should be debating that Bill, if not the student grant Bill.Another neglected Bill is the one the Taoiseach this morning forgot, the DNA Bill.  It was promised by the Ceann Comhairle when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It was promised by Mr. Michael McDowell when he was the Minister and it has now been promised by the current Minister.  What relevance has that Bill for young people?  It is relevant because we are one of the few countries in Europe that does not have a DNA database.  If a young woman is sexually assaulted and raped on the streets of Dublin, there is less likelihood that the perpetrator will be identified than in most other European countries or any state in the United States, because we do not have a DNA database.  This affects the lives, security, safety, well-being and particularly the future psychological well-being, of young people, yet our Parliament has been promising this legislation for approximately ten years.Much of what I have been saying has to do with the failure of the Government towards young people generally and the farce of this motion.  That farce is particularly well illustrated in respect of the failure of the Government to deal with issues affecting not just young people born in Ireland.  This is neatly encapsulated in the Government's failure to put in place proper policies to deal with young people who come here seeking political asylum.  The Government has presided over the HSE's loss of over 300 young people from residential care and has no idea where they are.  It is a Government the Supreme Court stopped from deporting three children in the past three weeks in circumstances where its behaviour was regarded as illegal.Tomorrow morning, the Government proposes to deport Adijat Okusanya who came to Ireland alone in 2004 at the age of 15.  She has completed her leaving certificate and commenced a course in business and accountancy at Tallaght IT.  This articulate young girl who has adapted to our Irish education system has lost all contact with her family and should be allowed to remain in this country.  Her remaining here would benefit the country, but the Government proposes to deport her back to Nigeria tomorrow where she will have an uncertain future and no certainty of employment.  I am informed that if employed, she fears she will be expected to provide sexual favours in return to her employer.If we want to have credibility in the United States when discussing young illegal Irish people there, we need to make a radical change to our treatment here of young people, who may be illegals.  Many came here seeking political asylum and to escape from circumstances that were not under their control as children.  They have made this State their home, been responsible members of their local communities, successfully got through our examination system and have much to contribute.  The Minister of State has some hours to look into the situation of this young girl.  I urge him to do so and to confirm to the House by the end of this debate that the young lady in question will not be deported tomorrow.The Government must end the lunacy and deal properly with the predicament of non-national parents of Irish-born children.  Where young people are born in this country and are Irish citizens and entitled to remain here, we must put in place a system that does not require the type of advertisements and notices that were published recently and that result in their parents having to register annually to be allowed to remain here.  It is time we adopted a child and family-centred humane policy that is not locked into bureaucratic idiocy.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Unfortunately, if young people were watching this debate, they could be forgiven for wondering whether we want to do anything at all for them.  We are debating a motion that does not include action.  It does not propose doing anything for young people or speeding up the process of providing them with facilities, supports or help for problems.  Instead, the motion is all about recognising, noting, affirming and welcoming the growth of practices.What young people want to hear from their legislators is that we are doing something about their lives, addressing their needs, listening to them and acting on what they say when consulted.  With respect to the Minister of State and to all who have spoken or intend to speak in this debate, we will not achieve anything by dealing with the motion.  Rather, we should be discussing the specifics of what we will do under the various departmental heads that deal with the interests of young people.I will try to make some positive proposals for action rather than waffle on about noting this, that and the other thing.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that to be honest, we are having this debate because there is no legislation ready to be presented to the House.  Again tomorrow we will have another such debate or statements on an issue of importance.  We should instead be talking about what is being done, rather than talking broadly about motions that cross all sorts of areas and that do not propose any conclusive action that will help achieve a better world for our young people.In all honesty, there is no legislation prepared for us to deal with.  I have been pressing hard for legislation we were told would be implemented by the beginning of 2008, although it may not specifically relate to young people.  However, I support Deputy Shatter with regard to the legislation to which he referred.  I was told last year that the student support Bill would be enacted and implemented by the start of the school year, September 2007.  Not only is it not debated, passed and enacted but it is not even published.  That is an example of legislation that directly affects young people that simply has not been progressed by Government.  Reference was made to the adoption Bill.  I came into the Dáil in 1998 and was spokesperson on equality.  That legislation, which was supposed to be imminent, was being dealt with at the time by the then Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Frank Fahey.  Yet, almost ten years later, it has not been published.The All-Party Committee on the Constitution recommended that the rights of children be inserted in the Constitution.  That recommendation which would be important for young people has not been promoted in any way, despite being an all-party proposal.  The Youth Work Act was implemented after a long delay.  Have the provisions of the Youth Work Act been implemented?  Has the funding been provided to fully roll-out all the various actions determined under the Act and, if not, why?  When will the money be provided to do so?  I do not know if the Minister of State reached the point in his speech — he did not get to read it all — which reads we "realise that we can achieve more from existing funding streams if we collaborate across agencies in a more structured way".  I am concerned about that because I think what that means in plain English is that no more money will be put into it and the money will be spread around to various places where it already exists.  I am glad the Minister of State is shaking his head and I hope he will tell me exactly how much money he will spend on young people and where he will spend it.

I agree that a certain amount of consultation is taking place and that is good but it is not reaching some of the most vulnerable young people.  I am concerned about that.  I meet young people in the course of my political work whom nobody has ever consulted and we need to reach them.  I commend Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children, who is doing a very good job and is listening to young people.  I hope the proposals from her office will be implemented.There is a reference in the motion to addressing issues pertaining to alcohol-related harm, preventing drug misuse, promoting good nutrition and combating obesity, promotion of healthier lifestyles, mental health awareness and suicide prevention programmes, sexual health awareness and so on.  Many of the issues referred to in the motion concern the health of young people.  Side by side with that I raised the question of child and adolescent psychiatric services.  The answer I received from the Health Service Executive stated there are currently 12 public inpatient beds available for young people.  Last night I spoke to a mother of a 17 year-old girl who is in an adult psychiatric ward.  There is no psychiatric bed near where she lives.  There are only 12 such beds in the whole country, six in Galway and six in Dublin.  This unfortunate child is in an adult psychiatric ward.  That is an example of the terrible psychiatric services for young people.Community services are no better.  There is no walk-in area where young people can go if they are worried, feel suicidal or have psychological problems or lack self-esteem.  According to this answer there are 3,598 children on waiting lists for the community psychiatric services for young people.  Deputy Dan Neville walked out of the debate on psychological services last night because he was so angry that programmes are being reorganised by the Minister rather than being pooled in regard to the prevention of suicide in young people.We need to be serious about addressing the health problems of young people.  We can have grand statements about alcohol abuse and drug abuse, including the article we read in yesterday's edition of the  Irish Examiner. However, they are no good unless they are practical and reach young people.  In regard to the use of alcohol, one can buy a 24 pack of beer in off-licences in residential areas all over the country for €15.99, as I saw on the window of an off-licence yesterday.  Off-licences are springing up all over residential areas.  Older people can go into them and buy for young people.  I have asked young people about this, it is as simple as pie.  Some 13 and 14 year olds have no problem getting access to cheap alcohol.  It is cheaper to buy a can or a bottle of beer than a bar of chocolate.  Unless we begin to address these serious issues that young people have to deal with we will not get anywhere.I turn to some of the recreational facilities that young people say they want, such as youth cafes.  We have had a good deal of talk about them but very few of them are up and running.  Young people have been consulted all over the country in regard to what they want.  In my area they have said they want youth cafes but no stone has been turned in regard to the provision of a youth cafe in Limerick where there is a big problem with young people who do things they should not do.  If they had places to go perhaps there would be less chance of them doing what they should not do.  In regard to skateboard parks there is a funding problem but finally we got it sorted out in Limerick following much lobbying by the young people themselves and their supporters.Young people will not believe we are serious unless we get rid of the obstacles to the provision of such services for them.  If one is 13 years old and wants a particular recreational facility and is 19 or 20 years of age by the time it is provided, one has lost faith in the political system.  There must be a sense of urgency.On the issue of young people who drop out of school and have difficulties with the school curriculum, there are as many young people dropping out early as there were ten years ago.  That is statistically accurate.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, will be aware of some of these issues.  It appears we are not reaching a certain cohort of young people.  When they drop out there is no method of tracing them and keeping with them.  If they dropped out for a job there is no method of tracing them to ensure they have not lost that job in a years' time and drifted into crime.  Those young people are as entitled to training and education and a future as those who go on to do a PhD and yet we just lose them and forget about them.  We bring in people from other countries to do the jobs these people might well want to do if they got some training and education.  I strongly believe we need a social guarantee for all young people in order that they will be tracked and given an opportunity for a bright future.The school curriculum needs to be changed.  The leaving certificate curriculum is absolute anathema to a small section of our young people who are not academic minded and do not want to learn off reams of material in order to regurgitate it in an examination and forget about it because it will not be useful to them for the rest of their lives.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has made fairly wide proposals on reform of the leaving certificate and the Minister for Education and Science will do nothing except slightly change the timetable of the examination.  That will do a huge disservice to a cohort of young people who drop out and lose faith in the system, in some cases losing faith in themselves and possibly being at risk of suicide, and in other cases turning on their own communities and causing all kinds of mayhem and destruction.The problems of anti-social behaviour, crime and young people getting into gangs, who later commit serious crimes, will not be addressed unless we deal with the reasons they are dropping out of school and losing faith in the system.  Unless there is cross-departmental action between the Minister of State with responsibility for youth work and the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, leading them into FÁS schemes and work, which is a positive response, we will not get anywhere.  All the woolly language in the Minister's speech does nothing for me.  There is nothing specific in it about what will be done. I would like to see positive proposals with specific timeframes regarding how we intend to increase the speed with which we respond to young people, whether these proposals involve youth cafes, skateboard parks, sports facilities, reform of the educational curriculum or providing locations young people feel comfortable walking into if they have problems of mental health, suicidal tendencies or concern about a wide variety of young people's issues.Some of the reasons young people turn to abuse of alcohol, drugs and so on are that they have bad self image, are easily led by other stronger people in their group and get a sense of bravado from being identified with those who are big in their communities.  Unless we begin to improve their self esteem and provide the supports they need and alternative activities, we will continue to come to the House to offer pious platitudes in this regard.We must respond to young people.  We need to get Departments working together.  We need specific programmes of action with timetables and funding attached.  We need to bring in Emily Logan and her office, which has a very good sense of what young people want.  Ms Logan and her office have a lot of cred and are popular with and trusted by young people.  They need to be brought into the delivery system.I do not want this debate to be a useless exercise; I want it to have a positive outcome.  When the Minister of State responds, I hope he will deal with the issues raised by myself and other Members and that we will get practical proposals with real-time implementation dates.  We need to respond to young people or the depressing situation with regard to alcohol, drugs and crime will continue.  We need to provide fundamental intervention if young people are to recognise that we want to provide them with facilities.At the next election, I do not want young people approaching me to say they have nothing to do and nowhere to go, and that they must hang around corners, annoying the owner of the corner shop, who must move them on.  That is not doing a good service to young people.  I hope we will have a better response than we have had to date.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I welcome this debate.  It is important Dáil Éireann discusses young people and their problems at this time.  I disagree with the contribution of Deputy Shatter.  This is not a useless debate.  As Minister of State responsible for youth affairs, I have waited a long time for such a debate and welcome the fact we are having a day-long discussion on issues that affect young people.Ireland has the youngest population in Europe.  Its present population is over 4 million, the highest on record since 1871.  Of this, 42% or two in five are under the age of 25 while the EU average for under-25s is 25%.  My Department has long recognised that our young people represent an active and vital force in our country's social, political and economic development and well-being.  It is, therefore, important we recognise the valuable contribution young people make to our society and that we support their personal, social and educational development.Enabling individuals to achieve their potential and participate fully as members of society is a key objective for Government.  For young people, this means ensuring the availability of supports across a range of measures, including family support, health provision and, probably most notable in a young person's life, education.  While much attention is paid to the undoubtedly important role that formal education plays in young people's lives, it should be recognised that it is also through complementary non-formal education activities and programmes that young people find the means to reach their personal potential and engage actively in their communities.Irish society has changed dramatically in the past ten to 15 years.  At least four major types of recent change, all interrelated, have been identified: economic, political, technological and cultural.  These changes impact significantly on the lives of our young people.The make up of the youth population is more culturally diverse than heretofore, increasing the need for intercultural aptitudes and awareness among young people and those who work with them.  Ensuring this diversity is seen as a positive from which all can gain enrichment is a key challenge for all of us.  In addition, the economic boom of recent years has brought its own challenges.  Young people have more disposable income than heretofore, bringing with it its own set of burdens and complications for our young people that we of older generations did not experience.Recognising that these problems and challenges are real, my Department, with others responsible for young people's issues, have put a number of measures and initiatives in place to address them.  It is fair to state that those involved in the education process accept that innovative approaches are required to meet the current needs of our young people, with provision being made available through non-traditional modes, including those used by the youth work sector where appropriate.Youth work and the youth work sector has a particular role to play in preparing and equipping our young people for adulthood.  The overall purpose of the youth work service is to assist young people to realise their potential and become active participants in a democratic society.  Youth work programmes and services provide space to young people to voluntarily engage in educational programmes which help this development.  These activities, while being fun, engaging and inclusive, are also educative.Youth work is complementary to the formal school system and in Ireland is implemented primarily by voluntary youth work organisations and groups.  It is characterised by requiring the voluntary participation of young people.  The programmes run by the voluntary youth work organisations vary widely and include outdoor pursuits, arts, recreation, project work and international exchanges.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision-making, motivation and self responsibility are acquired by young people through this non-formal learning process.  In addition, youth work often acts as the point of contact and referral in the interface with other youth-related issues spanning the realms of care, health and welfare.The development of youth work has been underpinned by the Youth Work Act 2001, which provides for a structural framework to support youth work at national and local level.  The Act provides for a national youth work advisory committee comprising of equal representation from the voluntary youth work sector and the statutory sector, including key Departments such as the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Arts Sport and Tourism and the Department of Health and Children.  The committee, the third of which I appointed earlier this year, advises me and my Department on policy regarding youth work.At local level, a structure has been agreed with the Irish Vocational Education Association to resource VECs to help them carry out the functions envisaged for them under the Act.  The national youth work development plan also provides recommendations for action on a number of issues affecting young people and the youth work services that are provided for them.  These are being progressed by my Department in consultation with the various youth work interests on a phased and prioritised basis.The important work carried out by the youth work sector with young people is also recognised by the Government through a number of initiatives funded by my Department and in 2007 this support totalled €51 million.  Essentially, as Minister of State responsible for youth affairs, I am responsible for rolling out the provisions of the Youth Work Act 2001 and the provisions of the national youth work development plan on a phased and prioritised basis.Education is central to addressing youth welfare issues.  It is necessary not only to communicate information but to foster the motivation, skills and confidence necessary to take action to improve health and well-being.   It is important that young people know and accept themselves for who they are, have increased self-esteem and are enabled to make responsible decisions about their health behaviour.  Young people need to be empowered to communicate with others, negotiate healthy relationships, differentiate between high and low risk behaviour, protect themselves and others, and know how to gain access to and use health care information and services.The work of the national youth health programme is central in addressing youth welfare issues, such as health and well-being.  This partnership programme, which is operated by the National Youth Council of Ireland and funded by the youth affairs section of my Department and the HSE's health promotion unit, provides a broad-based, flexible health promotion support and training service to youth work organisations.  It aims to promote healthy lifestyles and provides information and training in a number of areas, including health education, alcohol, bullying, drugs, mental health, sexual health, nutrition, physical activity and suicide prevention.Youth work has a particularly distinctive and significant role to play in increasing youth participation. The operation of democratically controlled youth groups by young people provides them with valuable learning experiences on how to participate in and manage democratic systems.  Such learning is likely to be highly beneficial to the future health and well-being of society.  Criteria for youth work organisations, which is being finalised as part of the further roll-out of the Youth Work Act 2001, will require youth organisations to demonstrate a commitment to the involvement of young people in areas such as programme-service provision and the decision-making process of the organisation.As regards citizenship, many youth organisations through their programmes and activities seek to involve young people in a voluntary capacity in analysing community needs and taking action to contribute to meeting those needs.  Examples of such activities are to be seen in areas such as environmental improvement, the upgrading of community facilities, care for the elderly, services for those with disabilities, aid to the Third World and analysis of social issues and suggestions for their improvement.These projects are recognised by young people as being of value to them as well as to the community.  Different groups are very much involved in active citizenship.  In particular, I welcome Foróige's youth citizenship programme under whose aegis I recently made presentations to certain young people.  Gaisce is another important youth initiative with which many Members will be familiar.I affirm the importance of consulting young people on matters of public policy which affect them.  I welcome the growth of this practice among public bodies in the development of services and facilities for young people.  This will better position us to put in place appropriate mechanisms to facilitate young people in the quest to achieve their potential and to participate in and improve society.

As other Deputies pointed out, the value of this motion is in great doubt.  Everybody agrees we should be discussing the problems facing today's youth, but there is no point in doing so unless one has a plan to deal with them.  I ask the Minister to look at the Visitors Gallery.  Normally it is full of school children, but the people most concerned with this debate are not hear to listen to it.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Let us discuss the schools we have before talking about those we do not have.  Some 75% of primary schools have no indoor sports facilities and common rooms have been used as classrooms for the increasing enrolments.  I am speaking specifically about Dublin North, including areas such as Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk and Donabate.  The latter two areas have no secondary school even though both have experienced major growth.  The planners in Fingal set up a committee with the Department of Education and Science whose representative sat on the committee.  Yet the Department turns around with its hands up and asks how such a situation could have been predicted.  The question posed by residents of Dublin North is how the Department could have failed to predict this outcome.There are not enough speech and language therapists for children with such problems.  It takes months to see a therapist and parents realise that with each passing day the chance of a successful outcome for their children diminishes.  Therefore they pay for private therapy even though they can ill afford to do so.  Many parents cannot afford such treatment.  We do not have enough school psychologists and we will be debating that matter again tonight.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is on record as having paid parents nearly €4 million to obtain psychological consultations for their children due to the lack of an adequate psychological assessment service in our schools.  This is despite the previous promises made about this matter.I heard Deputy Jan O'Sullivan refer to youth cafés, but how many do we have?  There are virtually none.  The only one I know of in Dublin North has been proposed for Rush, which is as a result of the progressive far-sightedness of the county manager, Mr. David O'Connor.  Such facilities are important for the many teenagers who are not involved in sport.  Even if they were interested in sport, however, the facilities are not there for them to use.  Look at the society we have created over the past 20 years.  The Minister of State must accept that his party has been in government for 18 years of that time.  Children are now dropped to and picked up from school.  They are kept at home because it is not safe to be outside.  If somebody's child is missing for an hour there are panic stations, whereas when we were growing up one could be gone all morning until lunchtime and people did not worry.  That situation does not pertain any more.  This is a societal issue that transcends policing, the construction of new residential areas and traffic volumes.Many youths feel detached from society because they do not have a vote and what they say does not seem to count.  They look with suspicion at gardaí in squad cars.  More community gardaí are needed because the numbers are insufficient.  We need the gardaí we had ten or 15 years ago to whom people would look for help.  When people had a problem they would go to a garda who was seen as a helpful person to solve problems, rather than the heavy hand of authority.  We need authority as well, of course, and there must be accountability, but while young people learn that at home, they also need to learn it on the street.Where are the required sports facilities?  They do not exist in primary or secondary schools.  Because of the nature of society and the lack of investment in facilities like gyms, we now have an American scenario with soft drinks companies promoting vending machines and giving part of the proceeds as a grant to schools for sports equipment.  On the one hand they are promoting sporting activity, while on the other they are promoting obesity through the sale of high sugar food and drink.  Instead of having this nonsensical discussion, why can the Government not make a concrete proposal to install vending machines with fruit and other healthy eating  options?  Vendors of such products could be allowed tax breaks given that fresh food has a shorter shelf life than many high sugar products such as chocolate and soft drinks.The Government has failed miserably to provide medical cards for young people.  The current threshold for a medical card is €184 per week for a single individual, which is marginally over half the minimum wage.  Even more intriguing is that a married couple receives an extra €38 allowance for the first two children and €41 per child thereafter.  Can anyone in this House explain why a child's health is valued at one fifth or one sixth of an adult's?  Children, particularly those under five, have tremendous health needs, yet the allowance for a child is only one fifth that of an adult.  If the Government wants to do something meaningful in the next budget it must not only increase the income threshold for a medical card, which is scandalously low, but also focus on the young by increasing children's allowances to realistic levels.  The last attempt through the doctor visit-only card increased it by only 25%.  What is 25% of 25?  It is a joke.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government needs to introduce new guidelines for housing development.  While they are on the way and they will refer to crèches and facilities as part of residential developments, will provision be made for gymnasiums and safe exercise areas so that the new developments are built in a manner more conducive to safe walking?  Gymnasiums are needed because many women do not feel safe walking on their own after dark.Drug and alcohol abuse and sexual behaviour are also major issues, which need to be addressed through our education system.  A great case can be made for providing specific classes to educate young people about drugs, alcohol and sexual behaviour.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, lack of enforcement is the most significant problem regarding alcohol.  Everybody knows it is illegal to sell alcohol to people aged under 18 but the law is not enforced.  Sometimes, for example, 19 year old people are sent into the shop to buy 24 cans of cider.  Alcohol purchases must be properly monitored and community gardaí should be on the beat because prevention is better than cure.Drugs are rife in our society.  I met a young man who started taking drugs when he was 11.  Drugs are too prevalent and, for example, it has been reported that they have been detected on cisterns in Leinster House.  Why are sniffer dogs not used more widely?  Why do gardaí not visit pubs and clubs at night with such dogs to detect drugs?  That would prevent drug dealers from treating them as safe havens.I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan regarding psychiatric services for young people.  It is absolutely outrageous that only 12 beds are available in the entire State.  Many children with intellectual disabilities and psychiatric disorders are cared for as inpatients in adult institutions.  It is not acceptable in a modern society.I refer to education, diagnosis and autism, which was ignored by the Government and the Department of Education and Science until they were dragged kicking and screaming through the courts where awards of more than €200,000 were made against them.  Why can the Department not support autism schools?  I fully agree with the Minister for Education and Science that ABA is not the only way to go but it is one way to go and she will not even support the one way we know works.  The outlook for children with autism who are subject to early intervention can be greatly altered from a life in an institution to a near normal existence.  Children with cystic fibrosis have also been let down badly.  No isolation rooms are available for them in hospitals and, as a consequence, their life expectancy is ten years lower than sufferers in the UK.  Is that acceptable?The Government has brought us into the House to discuss pious platitudes in the motion.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Haughey, made no concrete proposals to address our problems.  He gave the Government a clap on the back and said everything was wonderful.  This is the Government's  modus operandi.  According to it, there is no crisis in the health service and everything is grand in the education system, yet 13 schools are needed in Dublin North.  Parents are faced with emergencies and last minute arrangements have to be put in place for schools, even though officials have known for years that this was coming down the line.  They were told people moving into the area had existing families and the projections for the school population should not be based solely on the birth rate.The motion should be amended and the Government should come back to the House with concrete proposals, otherwise all we are doing is filling the Chamber with hot air.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on this important motion.According to census 2006, Ireland's population of young people — up to 18 years — is more than 1 million, representing 26% of the population.  Overall this population group experiences good health and reports high levels of general well-being.  A few months ago I launched the most recent health behaviour in school-aged children survey, HBSC 2006.  I was delighted when the survey results showed that rates of excellent or good self-reported health have improved in the children surveyed since the previous survey in 2002.  With regard to children's reported happiness, 92% of boys and 89% of girls feel very or quite happy with their lives, which is a slight increase since 2002 across age groups and gender.While this can be deemed positive, the many difficulties and challenges that face young people in our society today must be recognised.  In seeking to improve and maintain the health of young people, the Department of Health and Children works toward a policy-making process that ensures a holistic understanding of the young person, with the young person at the centre of the process.  To this end, the work of the Department is focused to a large extent on addressing the determinants of health for young people while ensuring preventative, partnership-based approaches are to the fore.I refer to smoking.  While the consequences of smoking-caused death and disease emerge in adulthood, addiction begins when most tobacco users are children and teenagers.  The younger the age when a person takes up smoking, the higher their nicotine intake as adults.  In addition, the earlier children start to smoke, the more likely they are to remain smokers.  More than three quarters of all smokers in Ireland started to smoke before they reached the age of 18.  It is critical, therefore, that we do everything possible to stop children and young people from smoking in the first place.A report published by the Office of Tobacco Control late last year, focusing on the issue of children, youth and tobacco, shows that 16% of those aged between 12 and 17 smoke.  The office made children and youth smoking its top priority in 2007.  Earlier this year the office held a conference entitled, Children, Youth and Tobacco: Causes, Consequences and Actions, which highlighted the risks to young people of tobacco use and the actions that can be taken to reduce it.  Research shows that one of the most effective measures in preventing young people taking up smoking in the first place is the price of tobacco.  A number of measures have been taken to prevent young people smoking, including the banning of the sale of packs of less than 20 cigarettes and confectionery which resembled tobacco products from 31 May 2007 and increasing the minimum price at which 20 cigarettes can be sold to €6.79 with effect from last Monday, 19 November.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, hopes to shortly announce the commencement date for further provisions of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts 2002 and 2004.  We are in consultations and will take decisions in this regard in the near future.Ireland has experienced significant increases in alcohol consumption and related harm over the past decade and alcohol misuse is a policy area in which I am committed to working towards protecting children, particularly in light of worrying attitudes to alcohol among young people.  Research shows that a young person who commences drinking before the age of 15 is four times more likely to have problems associated with alcohol in adulthood.  We need, therefore, to make particular efforts to protect our young people and to delay them taking their first alcoholic drink for as long as possible.  The HBSC study shows that half of children aged between 15 and 17 years report they are current drinkers and more than one third report they have been "really drunk" in the past 30 days.  That is alarming.  We must act to protect our children and young people.  The evidence contained in the study should strengthen our resolve in that regard.  We all have a part to play in addressing this problem.  We need to take responsibility, both collectively and individually.  We need to examine our social acceptance of alcohol and the signal this sends to young people.A number of the recommendations contained in the report of the strategic task force on alcohol concern a reduction in the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship.  In response to these recommendations, the Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship, sales promotions and marketing practices.  This resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of alcohol advertisements.  A voluntary code of practice on advertising was agreed, which addresses the issue of the placement of advertising.  The alcohol marketing and communications monitoring body was put in place to oversee implementation of these voluntary codes.The first annual report of the alcohol marketing communications monitoring body for 2006 was submitted to the Minister responsible in July this year.  Following consultation, my Department has decided to commence discussions with the relevant stakeholders with a view to strengthening and expanding the current voluntary codes on alcohol marketing and communications.  The purpose is to provide significantly greater protection for children and young people.  I will give further consideration to the possibility of using legislation in this area depending on the outcome of these discussions.With regard to sponsorship of sports and youth events by alcohol companies, the Department intends to raise this issue with the industry representatives during the course of the broader discussions that will take place on advertising and marketing to which I referred.Another issue to which I wish to refer in the limited time available is obesity, the prevalence of which has been described by the World Health Organisation as an epidemic.  Ireland is no different from other countries in terms of obesity trends.  Data suggest that there could be more than 300,000 overweight and obese children on the island of Ireland.  The rate is rising at a probable 10,000 per annum.  In response to these trends a national task force on obesity was established in 2004.  Its report, Obesity: the Policy Challenges, was published in 2005.  It encourages and facilitates a healthier lifestyle, thereby reducing the incidence of non-communicable diseases that afflict many in Ireland.At an early stage my Department was able to begin funding implementation of the recommendations that related to the health sector.  For example, additional funding has been made available to provide specialist community dietitian and physical activity posts in obesity and weight management and for the development of specialist hospital services for obesity treatment.  I would like to have the opportunity to refer to physical activity and the national nutrition policy but time does not permit me to do so.I assure the House of my commitment, as Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion and food safety, to continue to keep a focus on promoting healthier lifestyles for young people and seek the most appropriate means of realising this goal.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on young people.  A month ago an RTE "Prime Time" programme re-examined the provision of psychiatric services for young people, following up on a programme 12 months previously which had exposed the glaring neglect of the services provided by the State.  It was found that nothing had changed in that time.  Waiting lists for psychiatric services for children are up to three to four years long, even though we are aware that early intervention is vital as it increases the chances of a cure for the problem.  Allowing a child in need of psychiatric services not to be treated for such a long period leads to the problem becoming chronic.  It would be helpful if the Government recognised early intervention as a cost saving measure.  Early intervention ensures people will not need adult psychiatric services when they reach the age of 18 years.  Therefore, early intervention is essential.The Government must examine its performance in the delivery of services to young people and how young people see themselves in Ireland in the 21st century.  I refer to a study carried out of how young people see their treatment.  According to the report, Inequality and Stereotyping of Young People, published by the Equality Authority and National Youth Council of Ireland, they see their treatment at the hands of adults as being unequal and unfair.  The research found that among young people there was strong agreement that they were being stereotyped and treated unfairly by adults in general.  It found that the media were regarded as particularly prone to stereotyping young people in negative ways by constantly associating youth with crime, deviance, delinquency, drug and alcohol problems, sexual promiscuity and general disorderliness.  The predominant view of young people was that politicians dismissed them as being unimportant.  There was a view that politicians were responding both to media stereotyping and helping to fuel it.The views of young people as to how their teachers perceived and treated them were mixed.  In general, they felt most strongly about not being listened to and not having a say in how schools were run.  They perceived that there was a poor relationship with the Garda and that gardaí had a poor opinion of young people.There is a need to consult young people on issues that relate to them and to involve them in decisions.  It does not come as a surprise to me that there is this attitude.  I have always argued that young people today face pressures about which previous generations never knew.  They are coping with many sources of stress and many experience difficulties because of these pressures.  We must examine why they sometimes feel so alienated from society, the political system and official religion, even though most young people are spiritual.  Many turn to binge drinking or worse as a response to their feelings of alienation and the spiritual vacuum often present in modern day life.  This demands a political and media response.  In seeking to find solutions to the problems facing young people, however, we must be sensitive to the possibility of negative stereotyping and seek to avoid it.Suicide is the chief cause of death among young people under the age of 25 years.  More people die by suicide than in road accidents.  We must seriously examine why so many young people, at a time of unprecedented prosperity, are so disenchanted by life that thousands present at accident and emergency departments each year, having attempted to take their lives or self-harm.Social change has brought with it many serious challenges.  There is the fragmentation of the family, allied to the increase in marital breakdown.  Young people believe they have nowhere to turn.  Clearly, those who fall out of the education system are most vulnerable.  Many of the cultural icons and authority figures of the past such as the church and the political establishment are no longer inspirational in the eyes of the young.  The report to which I referred also makes this clear.  It is worrying that young people feel so separated from adults when the role of each generation should be to lead and protect the one that comes after it.It is also of great concern that young people feel demonised by society.  We should all seek to understand why this is so.  Politically, we must demonstrate the will to recognise the equal rights of young people and develop a greater sensitivity to their particular needs.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.I previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the Health Service Executive, HSE, from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU, on fees, prices and margins for its members.  When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees and margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  These new arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17 September last.In regard to the new reimbursement prices, the main wholesale companies have confirmed they will charge community pharmacists the same amount for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists are reimbursed by the HSE for these products.  Furthermore, no changes are planned by the HSE to the operation of the GMS medical card and community drugs schemes, and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.The HSE has not received formal notification from any community pharmacist regarding cessation of services under the GMS or the various community drugs schemes.  In the event, they will be required to give three months' notice in writing of any intention to cease providing this service.  To address concerns expressed by the IPU on behalf of community pharmacists about the implications of the legal advice on competition law as regards their right to negotiate fees through the union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Mr. Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which their fears might be addressed.  Despite the suspension of this process during the recent withdrawal by individual pharmacists of methadone services, there has recently been renewed engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.  I am exploring, in consultation with the Attorney General, other relevant Departments and the HSE, the best way of progressing the development of a new contract with pharmacists.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I state categorically that I and the Fine Gael Party will not and cannot condone any action by pharmacists or the HSE which endangers the well-being of patients.  The dispute is dragging on because there is no clear path to resolution.  There is no mechanism by which resolution may be achieved.  It is clear that the HSE ignored the advice of its consultants, Indecon, who recommended that it should engage in consultation before bringing in this measure and that any change should be introduced gradually.  A reduction from 17% to 8% is not gradual.It is clear that the HSE will not engage with the IPU in a meaningful way and that patient services, once again, are under threat.  We in Fine Gael recognise the need, and the right of the taxpayer, for the Minister and the HSE to seek savings.  However, it is important this does not come about at the cost of service to patients.  Will the Minister appoint an independent arbitrator to get this dispute sorted out so that the most vulnerable people in our society are guaranteed continuity of supply of their medications, particularly coming up to Christmas and the winter period in which the incidence of illness is always greater?  Will she postpone the proposed changes until an independent impact study is carried out?  This is important because to talk about an independent and fair process is all right, but it will neither be fair nor construed as such unless it is independent, as the HSE initiative in this regard was not so.Will the Minister outline again what provisions are in place should the pharmacists withdraw services as they have threatened on 1 December?  It is not good enough of the Minister to tell the House that she has not received formal notification of withdrawal.  If people go out en masse contractual rights will go out the window, the three months’ notice will not be given and we are faced with 1.5 million people being unable to get their medication.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I welcome what the Deputy said on behalf of his party and I share his view.  As the Deputy is aware, this legal advice came to hand as a result of the negotiations that had begun with the wholesalers.  The intention, always, was to negotiate and we respect bodies that organise around trade unions and have always dealt with organisations on that basis.  Clearly, we cannot breach Irish competition law or EU law and that is why the Shipsey process was put in place.I understand there was a very good meeting last night between lawyers representing the IPU and the HSE, respectively.  I hope that as a result we are in a position to put a framework in place to resolve the outstanding issues.  There are a number of issues to be considered, one of which is the nature of the contract.  I am a strong fan of incentivising contract holders, whether they are pharmacists, general practitioners or dentists, towards providing a wider range of services, working longer hours and so on.  These are all matters for discussion, and medication management is also important.As the Deputy is aware we are trying to achieve a number of goals.  One is value for money and greater efficiency.  Our drugs bill has gone up by 373% in recent years, or 2.5 times greater than the rate of inflation.  We are not reducing the wholesale margin gradually.  It is being reduced from 1 December to 8% and to 7% from 2009.  These margin percentages are in line with what is being paid in other countries.  We want to separate from the commodity price the professional or dispensing fee paid for the professional services of the pharmacist.  We also want to ensure that there is fair return.  I am a strong fan of entrepreneurship and as pharmacists are entrepreneurs we want to see their efforts rewarded.   There are a number of legal mechanisms through which prices can be established, one of which is an arbitration system.  These matters are being explored by me in consultation with the HSE and the Attorney General.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I welcome the fact that the lawyers re-engaged last night because the news last week was that they had disengaged.  I hope that process will find a resolution to the problem.Will the Minister say whether she and the HSE are willing to accept a neutral chairperson to address this issue, as has been proposed?  Specific eminent people were proposed by the pharmacists.   She said she was consulting the Attorney General.  Is that in relation to the interpretation of the Competition Act?  If so, will she be willing to accept consideration of the Labour Party's amendment to the Competition Act in Government time?  She will have plenty of time tomorrow because there is no legislation on the Order Paper.  Will she consider debating that amendment as a possible step towards resolution of the dispute?The import of what wholesalers are saying to pharmacists appears to be different from what they are telling the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  The Joint Committee on Health and Children heard last week that pharmacists were being told that wholesalers are not going to bring prices down to what will be paid to them if the new arrangements are introduced.  Is the Minister aware of different reports about what precisely the wholesalers might do.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	131	To answer the first of the Deputy's three questions, I do not know how one might define "eminent" in this context, but the idea of a neutral, independent, acceptable person is a mechanism for consideration within the legal advice that has been given to me to date.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The  chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission, perhaps.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I want to clarify on the record that the Attorney General is not involved in the advice procedure because of a conflict of interest.  He has made arrangements for counsel to advise us.  Whether the person is eminent or well known, it is the objectivity and acceptability of the incumbent that matters and it may well turn out to be a process for more than one person.  Clearly, the same process will have to be put in place for general practitioners, dentists and other self-employed professionals.As regards legal advice, it is not just a matter of Irish competition law but EU law as well.  Price fixing with self-employed professionals on a class basis is prohibited and it would not be desirable to change those aspects of Irish competition law.  One might as well tear up the competition Acts if one could engage in such practices.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Will the Minister say why people should not be represented by their union?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	135	This is not a question of representation but of price fixing and setting prices and margins, and European law is very clear on this issue.  It has wide implications for staff other than health service personnel, including self-employed veterinarians and, perhaps, some members of the legal profession.  That is why so much advice is required.This matter was brought to the attention of the HSE, which entered into negotiations in good faith, by the wholesalers.  It was the legal advice of the latter that brought the matter to everybody's attention and it was examined by lawyers of the HSE and the Office of the Attorney General.  We are not trying to achieve a reduction in what we pay for medicines since the price will continue to rise, given Irish demographics and new innovations; rather, we are trying to slow down the pace at which the price is rising.

The contract is between the pharmacists and the HSE, not between me and the pharmacists.  Clearly, I have an important role to play in this regard and the meeting last night was very positive, but I do not want to say anything in the House that would jeopardise the positive outcome of the meeting.  I understand there will be further talks in the coming days with a view to ensuring the development of a process acceptable to everybody.  Mr. Bill Shipsey SC, who has done extraordinarily useful work in this regard, will have an important role to play in putting forward what I hope will be a solution to this problem.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Professor Tom Keane took up his position as interim director of the national cancer control programme last Monday.  Implementation of the programme is a major priority for me and the Government.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome, irrespective of geography.The recent decisions of the HSE in respect of four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  Professor Keane will be engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.To ensure we improve our planning and evaluation of cancer needs, my Department has asked the HSE to prepare a robust needs assessment for cancer control for the period to 2012 to reflect priorities in this area.  The needs assessment will address regional disparities in cancer treatment, identify gaps in the provision of existing services and develop a national approach to timely access to diagnostic services for cancers.Professor Keane and the HSE have emphasised the importance of mobilising existing resources and redirecting them to achieve the national cancer control programme's objectives.  I understand the HSE is putting arrangements in place to enable Professor Keane to take control of all new cancer developments from 1 January 2008 and, progressively, all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.  An additional €20.5 million was allocated to the HSE this year for cancer control.  Further investment will be phased in during the reform programme.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	143	When will the women in Portlaoise who are still awaiting results have those results and thus alleviate their worry?The Minister did not answer my question on the budget.  She has stated what is available for Professor Keane to implement his strategy for this year but not what is available for next year and the year thereafter.  It is essential that we know where the money is coming from and that there will be sufficient funds to transport patients when their local centres are closed.  We must be absolutely clear that when the Minister is at arm's length from the process, that is, when Professor Keane is reporting to Professor Drumm, Professor Keane will not be scrambling around looking for funds to address this most important issue.  What audit has been done of funding and how much will be provided?  We cannot buy into the process if we do not know how it will be funded.  The Minister has stated existing services will remain in place until the new ones are available.  This cannot happen, unless new funds are allocated.  How much will they amount to and for what will they be provided?There are serious geographical concerns over the distances patients must travel in the north west.  It takes two hours to travel between Sligo and Galway and even longer for those further afield.  I urge the Minister to reconsider her proposals.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The original number was seven; the figure is now nine.  The media were referring to eight women but, as far as Dr. O'Doherty is concerned, she diagnosed nine women as having cancer among the 3,037 tested.  When we were debating this matter two weeks ago, we were relying on a figure of seven.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Therefore, two more women have been diagnosed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Two more were diagnosed, resulting in a total of nine, all of whom are receiving treatment and counselling.  I reiterate my apology of some weeks ago to the women concerned for the delay in diagnosing their cancers.  We are trying to minimise the possibility of this happening again.An additional €1 billion has been invested in cancer care in the past ten years.  This is a considerable investment.  The task for Professor Keane will essentially, but not exclusively, involve the redirection of the available resources, just as he did in British Columbia.  New resources will be made available also.  I had a long meeting with Professor Keane last night and have asked him to identify the new resources he will require in the next year.  He will begin to take responsibility for all cancer care developments from 1 January.  He is to inform me of his requirements in the next few hours because the Minister for Finance will be making budgetary announcements in this area two weeks from today.Our cancer service has excellent clinicians.  It is, therefore, the manner in which the service is organised that is in question.  Transport and accommodation issues must be addressed.  When I was in British Columbia, I was impressed by the number of lodges built close to hospitals or treatment centres.  Patients can stay in these lodges and do not have to be in the hospital environment.  Most prefer not to be in such an environment, unless it is absolutely necessary.On the Deputy's question on cancer care in the north west, the centres were not selected by me but by an expert group, mainly comprising clinicians but also officials from patient representative bodies such as the Irish Cancer Society and Europa Donna Ireland.  They all remain strong fans of the locations selected.  Professor Keane is strongly supportive of what we have done.  All international evidence, comprising some 250 publications, suggests that volume amounts to quality.  I hasten to say it is not a question of the quality of individual centres.  To say "centres of excellence" implies the other centres are not excellent but this is not my implication since it is a matter of volume and environment.In British Columbia all the tests are read at the centre.  Those diagnosed at outreach locations experienced a level of diagnostic error in the order of 20%, as discovered when they came to the centre for follow-up treatment or further diagnosis.  All the evidence has been compiled.  Professor Keane is to put in place a clinical support team.  I understand he intends to appoint a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist and cancer surgeon to assist him in the development of the control programme nationwide.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The Department of Health and Children acted on my behalf in this matter and I am totally satisfied in every respect that the Department acted in a thorough, timely and appropriate manner on foot of the information received.  It is entirely without foundation for the Deputy to claim the letter "lay languishing" in the Department.The facts are as follows.  On 5 July 2005, a consultant at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise wrote to me outlining his concerns relating to the breast services at the hospital.  In accordance with normal practice, the letter was passed to relevant officials in the cancer policy unit for examination.  They rightly formed the view that the letter required to be brought to the attention of the HSE and management at the hospital.  It was duly referred to the HSE national hospitals office for urgent examination and appropriate attention.  The Department subsequently wrote to the consultant concerned advising him of this and also brought the letter to the attention of the regional director of cancer services in the midland region.  I understand he then had discussions on the issue with hospital management and with the consultant concerned.There are robust policies and procedures in place in the Department, including in the Minister's office, for dealing with letters, e-mails and telephone calls relating to matters of patient safety and quality of care.  If a senior clinician raises an immediate risk to patient safety with me in any respect, I treat that matter very seriously.In handling communications, administrative and professional staff, the office of the Chief Medical Officer in particular works with executive agencies such as the HSE and the Health Information and Quality Authority, regulatory agencies such as the Irish Medicines Board and professional regulatory bodies, where appropriate, to identify, describe and ameliorate any potential risks to patients or the general public in areas such as systems of care, professional practice or difficulties with medical devices or therapeutic agents.  Theses procedures are subject to constant review and refinement in the light of circumstances and evolving best practice.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The Minister's answer ignores the issue raised in the letter, namely, that the radiology service was a shambles.  If she can honestly describe the manner in which that letter and the issues it raised were dealt with as the best way to do so, it is not terribly reassuring to this House and the people who must use the health service.Can the Minister confirm that this letter was brought to her personal attention?  Did she read it?  Based on information from the HSE, I understand that the letter was passed to the network manager and on to the hospital manager who interviewed the consultant concerned and ascertained that no unnecessary operations had taken place, which was the end of the matter.  An offer to have mammograms double read in hospitals elsewhere from December 2006 was then made.During statements to the House on 7 November 2007, the Minister said the current review covers concerns raised by medical and nursing staff within the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise and that action was taken on foot of this in August 2007.  When the Taoiseach was asked when the Government first became aware of this problem, he answered that it was in August 2007.  The Minister did not see fit to correct him and tell him that the letter had come to her in 2005.It seems that action was taken only 18 months after Mr. Peter Naughton wrote to the Minister.  It does not even address the concerns that he raised.  I want to ask the Minister a number of questions.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Please do.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Does she expect all medics who are concerned about the quality and reliability of machinery to walk away from the job and their patients, as she suggested in her response in the Dáil where she said that if the machine was so faulty, why did the radiologists continue to use it?  The reality is that faced with the machine with which they must deliver the service, people deliver the service they can.This unacceptable attitude is indicative of a Minister who is unable to cope with the responsibility of managing the health service.  She has relinquished responsibility to the HSE and many would say that she has lost control of it.  In a radio interview, the chief executive officer of the HSE cast aspersions on the public for protesting to try to hold on to their services.The Minister told the House that nine women have been diagnosed and are undergoing treatment.  I welcome that news because in the newspapers, it was suggested that six women were still waiting for a diagnosis and treatment, which would be totally unacceptable.I wish to ask the Minister directly, because she has not answered the question, whether there are any other letters in her Department regarding the quality and reliability of services in the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise addressed to her, her predecessor or other senior officials of which we should be aware.  Could she confirm whether the doctor carrying out the current review of the mammograms was one of the doctors on the interview board that appointed the locum consultant in the first instance because if this is the case, it creates a conflict of interest?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	155	In response to the last question, I understand that Dr. Ann O'Doherty was a member of the interview panel.  It was a Public Appointments Service interview process that appointed the radiologist who is currently on administrative leave.  I believe we answered a parliamentary question here recently.  We get about 6,000 letters, excluding telephone calls, e-mails, representations from parliamentarians and parliamentary questions, in a four-month period.  I believe the Minister for Health and Children sees letters that are addressed "addressee only".  I believe the first time I became aware of this was 29 August when I was about to do an interview on the Barringtons Hospital issue.  The HSE informed me that it had suspended the service in the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  That was the first time I became aware of this.I hasten to add and emphasise that Department officials in the cancer unit who handled this correspondence did so in a very robust, thorough and fair fashion.  The outcome would not have been any different or better if I had personally seen the letter at that stage.  It was discussed with Dr. Hollywood, who was the medical director.I wish to set the record straight by saying that when the O'Higgins report was produced in 2000, there was a recommendation that, marginally speaking because it was doubtful in terms of numbers, the midlands could have had a centre.  The health board decided that each of three hospitals would have a little bit of the action.  Some of it would be provided in Mullingar, some of it would be provided in Portlaoise and some of it would be provided in Tullamore.  Even though over €7 million was allocated to develop the O'Higgins guidelines and multidisciplinary care, it was divided between three places, which was totally unsatisfactory.Following that letter, a radiologist was appointed.  Subsequent to her appointment, the hospital advertised for another radiologist.  I understand that someone initially accepted the job and subsequently did not take up the appointment.  I want to put on record that it is increasingly difficult to get leading specialists with a sub-speciality in something like breast cancer to take up positions in smaller hospitals.  That is a fact.  It is not just increasingly difficult to do so in Ireland.  Based on what Professor Keane and others have told me, I understand it is a problem all over the world.  Specialists with a sub-speciality in these areas want to work in big centres where there is a high volume of activity and where the environment for their work is conducive to excellence and good outcomes for their patients because of the sheer volume of activity.I do not know if there are any other letters.  We have in recent times involved the Chief Medical Officer and his team.  There is a team of medics in the Department and I want to see them involved in patient safety issues.  Regardless of whether the patient safety issue is raised by a doctor or patient — many such issues are raised with me by patients — I want to see the medical team in the Department involved in the follow-up to correspondence that comes to our attention, if that is possible.Question No. 46 answered with QuestionNo. 43.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	156	On 31 October last, the HSE announced the details of the high level framework brief for the new national paediatric hospital.  The brief was prepared by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Limited, RKW, an established UK-based health care planning company.  The content of the report was informed by the views of a range of international experts, including architectural and clinical experts.The brief sets out the range of services to be delivered at the new hospital and the additional services to be provided outside of the main hospital through an ambulatory-urgent care service.  The brief will help to inform the work of the national paediatric hospital development board in planning, designing, building, furnishing and equipping the new hospital.The new hospital will be at the centre of a national paediatric network, linked to regional and local hospitals and to primary and community care services through outreach, telemedicine, joint appointments and staff rotation.  The new hospital will be supported by an ambulatory and urgent care service.  The first such centre will be developed at Tallaght.The vast majority of children attending the National Children's Hospital emergency department do not require admission and will continue to access their care locally at the new ambulatory and urgent care centre.  RKW estimated in the report that the first centre at Tallaght will have the capacity to cater for up to 48,000 emergency attendances and up to 58,000 outpatient appointments, based on demographic and activity projections up to 2021.   A significant level of day case surgery will also be carried out at the new centre.  There will be 20 day case beds and three theatres with capacity for up to 9,000 day case procedures.  Clearly, this projected level of activity would be subject to change depending on the number and location of any additional ambulatory emergency units.  The high level framework brief has been provided to the national paediatric hospital development board.  The HSE will be meeting with the board to agree on the operational arrangements for bringing the project forward to the next stage.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	157	What is the timeframe for providing this new facility in Tallaght?  When will it open?  Can the Minister confirm the report stated quite clearly that it is essential that it opens prior to, or simultaneously with, the new hospital to be built at the Mater site?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I agree it is essential they open together because the two are part of the same facility.  The ambulatory care centre at Tallaght will be under the auspices of the national hospital.  The timeframe we are working to is 2012.  I had a meeting recently with the development board, which is working to the same timeframe.  There are many projects seeking capital funding in health but this is a priority and capital funding will be made available.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	159	What hours of availability are envisaged for this hospital?  In the context of accident and emergency, for example, will the hospital be open 24/7 or will it close at some time?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	160	It is envisaged that the hospital will be open 18 hours per day, from 8 a.m. to 12 midnight.  It will be closed between 12 midnight and 8 a.m. because the level of attendances during that period would be low.  Other issues to be considered include the availability of ambulances at Tallaght so that those patients can be taken to the hospital at the Mater site.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Considering the burgeoning population of south Dublin and the outer regions, for which Tallaght Hospital currently caters, and the investment in the construction of the facility, it is a false economy to close the hospital from 12 midnight to 8 a.m. daily.  There may be serious night-time emergencies for children and the proximity of the hospital can be crucial in saving the life of a child.  If consultants indicate it is crucial that this facility be provided in Tallaght, it is just as relevant, in the context of access, travel and the major young population in the vicinity, that the facility be open 24/7.  It is a waste of that resource to close it at midnight and it places lives at risk.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I do not accept that.  This accident and emergency unit will deal with 48,000 attendances as opposed to 31,000 in Tallaght at present, 9,000 day cases as opposed to 3,500 at present and 58,000 outpatients as opposed to 30,000.  The advice is that it is not necessary to have the facility open between midnight and 8 a.m. because a small number of cases would arise during that period.  This is the advice of clinicians, not something I have made up off the top of my head.  The staff at the centre will be rotated.  The paediatric staff from the centre at the Mater Hospital will be rotated and arrangements will be made between the two hospitals, such as ambulances on standby to transfer those who arrive at Tallaght to the Mater site.  These logistical issues must be addressed by the development board in conjunction with the hospitals.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	163	That concludes Priority Questions.  We are five minutes over time and I wish to proceed with Ordinary Questions.  I remind Members that the questioner and the Minister have one minute each for supplementary questions during Ordinary Questions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Following the introduction of human papilloma virus, HPV, vaccine internationally its safety, as is the case with all other vaccines, is being carefully monitored.  At national level, the Irish Medicines Board is responsible for monitoring national and international emerging evidence about vaccine safety.  The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is also represented on the national immunisation advisory committee.My Department has not been informed of any scientifically peer-reviewed research that indicates the HPV vaccine may be unsafe.  However, I have been informed by the IMB of media reports in the US and EU that described some cases with fatalities following vaccination with the HPV vaccine.  These cases have been reviewed by the authorities responsible in the jurisdictions in which they occurred and a relationship between the vaccine and these fatalities could not be established.As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.  The national immunisation advisory committee has recently undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  The NIAC and the national cancer screening service agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, undertake this study.  International evidence as to the safety profile and side-effects of vaccines is considered by NIAC in formulating its advice and is kept under constant review.  I understand the HIQA assessment will be completed in January.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I raised this because I was contacted about it.  There are always people who object to certain vaccines and it is important we clarify it.  I support the introduction of a vaccine for cervical cancer.  The Minister states there is no scientific evidence that it is contra-indicated for girls with a certain family history.  I am not suggesting there is an issue but I seek clarity.A report in a medical journal suggests boys may be considered as well as girls.  Has the Minister considered that?  This project is included in the programme for Government.  Will it be done in the early or later stages of the life of the Government, if there should be later stages?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I will be careful because I am not a clinician.  I understand that all vaccines have a downside as well as a benefit and, when a vaccine comes to the market, one takes a balanced view of whether it is likely to be beneficial or marginally negative.  That is the case with this, as with any other vaccine.  The authorities will advise the age at which it should be given, which is 11 to 12 years for girls.  It is my strong view that it should be introduced in Ireland, subject to the advice confirming that in January.  If that is the case, it makes sense to seek to do it in conjunction, not simultaneously but in the same period, with the roll-out of the cervical screening programme.  This is a preventative measure and the benefits of it will not be seen until at least 20 years hence.  We must act now in order to have the benefits in that timeframe.  We must consider whether we will give the vaccine through schools and address matters such as parental consent.

What is the opinion of the Minister of recent criticism by Dr. Kevin Connolly, a paediatrician and member of the national immunisation advisory committee, of the delay in determination of the safety of the vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix?  The criticism is of the inordinate delay in bringing forward these vaccines employed in other jurisdictions, apparently successfully.  While I agree we must be fully certain of the safety to avoid dangerous side effects in any group of possible recipients, does the Minister have an indication of the interim determination of the HIQA studies on the vaccines?In the programme broadcast last night in respect of Professor Tom Keane's role in British Columbia in cancer care redress, it was clearly indicated that the incidence of cervical cancer in the region had been reduced to minimum levels as a result of a combination of vaccination and screening.  The programme here involves vaccination only.  What progress has been made towards including screening as a component part of the programme aimed at dealing with this terrible scourge which is faced by too many women?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	168	A number of issues must be addressed.  Deputy O'Sullivan inquired as to whether it should be made available to boys.  We are awaiting advice in respect of these matters.  If the advice from the national immunisation advisory committee and that which will emerge from the HIQA process, which is due in January, is positive, it would be my wish to make provision to have the vaccine introduced here.  It is clear that this would not be a medical card issue and that it would be available to the entire population.  All of the other population screening programmes are freely available to everyone, not just medical card holders.  Cervical screening has been available in Canada since the 1960s or 1970s.

The programme in question has been extremely successful, although its nature is being changed somewhat.  The Minister for Finance will be making budgetary announcements in two weeks and I hope provision will be made for the roll-out of cervical screening programmes in the resources made available by him to the Department of Health and Children.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I will be as brief as possible.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The Deputy should do so.  We are already one minute over time on this question.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I wish to refer, first, to the costings relating to the vaccine and Dr. Connolly's concerns regarding our ability to deliver a vaccination programme should the Minister decide to proceed with it.  What will be the costings for the roll-out of cervical screening programmes?  I spoke to the Minister six weeks ago about this matter in the House when I stated it was unlikely that she could succeed because there were no laboratories in place.  Smears testing services are being outsourced.  There is only one accredited laboratory in the country.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	175	A question please, Deputy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I will be as brief as possible.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	177	A question, please.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Tá an ceist ag teacht.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	179	It had better come quickly because I intend to move on.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Is there a budget in place in respect of the roll-out of a cervical screening programme?  Is the Minister in a position to guarantee the House that it will be rolled out by March next year?  In light of the cutbacks taking place, is there any real credibility to her claim that she will roll it out?A large advertisement appeared in the Sunday Independent last weekend in which company directors, whether their companies are large or small, public or private sector, were urged to take good care of everybody and ensure they were fully compliant before it was too late because they would be responsible.  The Minister has a contract with the people to deliver health care services.  She promised them that there would be no cutbacks and that any cutbacks would not hurt patient care but there were and they have done.  How does she intend to come good in respect of her promises?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	181	We will spend over €15 billion this year and spent €14 billion last year.  We will spend €1.2 billion more than last year.  I do not regard that as a cutback.  It is the duty of the HSE to remain within the budgetary allocation voted to it by the House out of taxpayers' money and be able to meet the demands on services——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The cutbacks should hit administration, not services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	183	There has been a great deal of discussion regarding the report published last week by the OECD which indicated that spending in Ireland grew faster than in any other country.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Because it started from such a low point.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	185	We are spending 8.9% of our national income, the average in the OECD, even though——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	186	We have only just reached that percentage.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The Minister to conclude her final reply.  We must proceed to the next question.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	188	It would be easy to roll out all these vaccines in Ireland.  The cost of a vaccine is the smaller——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Roll out a cervical screening programme first?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	190	We could also roll out the screening——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The Minister promised it would be introduced ten years ago.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Will the Deputy, please, allow the Minster to conclude her reply?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	193	The issue is that clinicians' and general practitioners' fees are substantially higher than in, for example, Northern Ireland, Britain or other jurisdictions.  The cost relating to the vaccine is usually the smaller part of the overall figure.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	194	What about cervical screening?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The same applies to screening in respect of the taking of smears, etc.  All of these things are more expensive here
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	196	It did not apply ten years ago.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	197	They are more expensive, as the Deputy knows.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	198	That does not wash.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 52 together.The legislation for the new nursing home support scheme, a fair deal, is being drafted.  The intention is to publish the Bill as soon as possible and to have it in place by 1 January 2008.The Minister originally announced her proposals for the new nursing home support scheme in December 2006.  Information leaflets, a guide to the fair deal and a frequently asked questions document have all been available to the public since.  In addition to dealing with queries and representations from interest groups, public representatives and members of the public, the Department also met a number of interested parties, including the social partners, the IFA and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I met representatives of nursing home owners and various senior citizens groups which are all concerned about the timeframe involved.  I wish to ask a few questions in respect of their concerns.  The first relates to the standards that will be drawn up by HIQA will not, as I understand it, be available when the legislation is introduced and will only be produced later.  Is it not strange that the fair deal will come into play before the standards relating to it appear?My second question relates to whether senior citizens will have a choice of nursing homes.  I understand the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be given the role of deciding on and allocating nursing homes to individuals.  I would be concerned about this because a facility might be located a long distance from a person's home or a person might not wish to be sent to a particular home.  It may eventually be the case that large nursing homes will take in many people because it will probably be cheaper to proceed in that way.  The people to whom we are referring will live in these homes.My third question involves family homes and the percentage of the value of a family home that will be taken subsequent to the death of the person who owns it.  There are serious concerns with regard to this aspect of the matter.  How will a spouse or another member of a family who remains in the family home and might be on social welfare payments or a low income pay this percentage?  There are many questions relating to this matter and I do not believe there will be adequate time for consultation before 1 January.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I also met nursing home owners in recent times and I am aware of their concerns.  The NTPF is still in the preparatory stages of finalising the forthcoming legislation.  We propose to introduce the legislation as soon as possible and expect the advertisement relating to nursing homes to be placed in the near future.  I understand people's concerns in that regard.  Applications to provide nursing care will be approved in time.  Nursing home owners will be obliged to meet a certain standard, of which they will be notified in due course.As regards the fair deal and people's homes, people remaining and living in their own homes while their loved ones are being cared for should not be concerned.  It will only be when a loved one dies that the question of the percentage will become pertinent.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	202	What will happen in the case of a person still living in a house after his or her loved one dies?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	203	It only becomes relevant when the house passes on.  In other words, following the death of the loved one being cared for in a nursing home.  The Deputy will be happy to hear that people will not be put out of their houses.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	204	What would be the position of an unmarried 40 year old daughter living in her parents' house where both parents had died?  Would she be allowed to remain until she was 90?  Am I correct in understanding that no money would be drawn against the value of the house?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	205	Only if she were the carer.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	206	She would be allowed to remain only if she were the carer of the person or persons originally admitted to the nursing home.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	207	If it were her family home, surely she would be entitled to live there and not be obliged to try to raise a mortgage in order to pay the State.  It seems extraordinary——
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	208	At present, people in this situation are obliged to sell their houses.  People are not obliged to opt for this scheme, it is voluntary in nature.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	209	We are all aware that there is going to be a major problem with regard to the funding of nursing homes.  My difficulty with what I have seen so far of the Bill is that it refers to drawing down other resources before the family home is touched.  How will this apply in the case of small businesses and farms?  Will people be obliged to sell their businesses and use up all their assets before their family home comes into play?  What will happen, for example, in the case of a young man who is running a shop with his mother and who decides to take over the business and invest money in it?I cannot understand how the Minister or the House can envisage a situation, particularly in the aftermath of Leas Cross, in which we will seek further funding from people in respect of their care in their old age without first ensuring the standards of care in the relevant institutions will be set in stone.  People entering nursing homes and their loved ones must be able to rest assured that they will be looked after in the best possible way.  How will the NTPF set fees if it does not know what standards are reached?  I wish to declare to the House that I have a 25% interest in a nursing home.  The points which concern me are care of the elderly and the standards that will be applied.Age Action Ireland is extremely concerned.  The elderly is the first group to have this eligibility approach foisted upon them.  Hundreds of thousands of euro are spent on cancer and cardiology patients but they are not asked to sell their homes.  This issue requires a great deal of further discussion and elaboration.  It works for some small groups of people but it certainly does not work for many others.  I hope we have the time to discuss this matter and tease it out.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	210	As Deputy Reilly has a quarter share in a nursing home he is aware of the fact that inspections take place in private nursing homes at least twice a year.  We already achieve a standard.  If a house is already transferred it is not an issue with regard to the payment of nursing care.  We anticipate the HIQA standards will be ready by June next year.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Will the Minister of State clarify what is the role of HIQA with regard to private nursing home facilities?  Will she assure the House that HIQA has a role in ensuring full inspection and accountability of all State funded places, be they in public or private nursing homes, for senior citizens and other residents of such facilities?  The Government is committed to extending the remit of the social services inspectorate to include residential care for older people.  What progress has been made with this proposition?
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Health Act 2007 provides for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, which will provide the standards of nursing care in public and private nursing homes.  Private nursing homes are already subject to inspection.  It is expected that HIQA standards will be in place next year at which point they will be rolled out.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	213	The Government is committed to extending the remit of the social services inspectorate.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether it will include residential care for older people and what progress, if any, has been made on this?
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	214	It will happen next year and will include residential nursing homes.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Highly reputable nursing home owners who wish to care for their patients are extremely concerned that if the standards are not in place when the fair deal starts they may not have patients sent to them by the National Treatment Purchase Fund because they may not be the cheapest.  They may have more nurses employed per patient and better standards in other ways than those who see it purely as a business.  This is the most significant concern but not the only one with regard to the system being established before the standards are in place.  I am concerned that the nursing home with the cheapest price is what the National Treatment Purchase Fund will choose.  In the absence of standards, the cheapest price may not mean a good nursing home for patients.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I agree that the cheapest price may not mean the best standard.  We will rely on the NTPF to ensure that in the tendering process the best standard is assessed on an individual basis for each nursing home which enters into the contract.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	217	We need real assurance on this matter.  I am extremely concerned about it.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	218	In conjunction with this, I hope we have similar investment in community initiatives to keep people at home.  Nobody likes to go into a nursing home because it means a loss of independence.  The HSE has been inspecting nursing homes for some time.  However, we have not been reassured by what is happening.  The HSE inspecting its own homes is not proper.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	219	This is why HIQA was established as an independent inspection body to investigate public and private nursing homes.  Deputy Reilly will appreciate that we know people live longer and in a healthier state if they remain at home for as long as possible.  The Government has an excellent record of achievement in this.  This year, we had the successful introduction of home care packages throughout the country whereby nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists attend to a person in his or her own home.  We intend to continue and increase this in the coming year.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 56 together.The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for enforcing food law, including the Health (Country of Origin of Beef) Regulations 2006, SI 307 of 2006, which were amended in February 2007.  These regulations are enforced by environmental health officers of the Health Service Executive on foot of a service contract with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Approximately 400 environmental health officers work on the enforcement of food legislation.Checks on compliance with food labelling, including the Health (Country of Origin of Beef) Regulations 2006, are undertaken in conjunction with routine hygiene inspections.  Accordingly, it is not anticipated that additional costs will be incurred.  I am advised that the number of inspectors and level of inspection to implement these regulations is sufficient.Guidelines for the implementation of the regulations have been issued to the HSE and an explanatory leaflet has been circulated by the HSE to food business operators.  The Deputy may wish to note that these regulations do not relate to food safety but rather to consumer information.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	221	What steps do the Minister of State and the Department propose to take with regard to the mislabelling of food products imported to this country and represented to the consumer as Irish in origin when clearly they are not?  A substantial amount of meat produce circulating in supermarket chains here is labelled as Irish or EU but does not come from the European market.  It is imported into the European market and presented as EU produce and then imported into Ireland and repackaged and presented as Irish in origin.  A great deal of information is available on this.  What is the Department doing to stamp out this practice?  Does the Minister of State agree it is pointless to have labelling if we cannot have confidence in what the labelling tells us?Is there a degree of hypocrisy in addressing the issue of labelling when significant elements of the State's services, specifically areas of the health services, directly purchase food products from outside the European Union for the requirements of people here?  We must lead by example and present the Irish people with food products in which they can have confidence and those grown at home are the best.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Legislation is in place to deal with mislabelling and I and departmental officials are anxious to obtain information on mislabelling.  I have no reason to doubt what Deputy Ó Caoláin stated and I assure him it will be dealt with.  There is no question of environmental health officers or the Food Safety Authority of Ireland ignoring this.  If it is brought to the attention of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland or detected by any of the 400 environmental health officers carrying out routine inspections, it will be dealt with under existing legislation.  In regard to State bodies purchasing from outside the EU, these organisations are bound by public procurement regulations.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The enforcement of food labelling regulations is a cause of significant concern among consumers.  In regard to the wider debate on the connection between diet, food and cancer deaths, does the Minister of State accept that serious questions are being asked, particularly by the medical professions, and that citizens are becoming as worried as they are about alcohol and smoking?  Is he aware of these concerns?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	224	All ingredients should be listed on the label so that people can make a choice.  The issue of dietary requirements is also important in the context of health.  There is no question of the FSAI suggesting those with responsibility for labelling should not provide all the necessary information.  We have taken a recent initiative in regard to labelling country of origin for poultry, pork and mutton after consulting the relevant parties.  However, we will have to share our views with the European Union, which will make a unanimous decision on the matter.  We are preparing the appropriate provisions and within a matter of months will present our proposals to the EU.  However, we will need the support of 24 other member states if we are to be successful.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	225	In regard to meat, what is the point of imposing standards on Irish farmers for places of origin and antibiotics when imported Brazilian beef is not subject to the same stringent requirements?  We do not know where it comes from, other than a large continental area called Brazil, nor do we know the conditions in which the cattle were reared.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The Deputy will be aware that regulations and statutory instruments require Brazilian beef to carry country of origin labels when it is sold in this country.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	227	What about hormones and antibiotic use?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have responsibility for the matter.  We are holding consultations on it to ensure Irish consumers can have confidence in the food they eat.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 44 of today.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Does the Minister agree the units which are to become centres of excellence do not have adequate resources to treat their current patients and that their waiting times fail to meet best practice guidelines?  For example, Professor Gupta, who practises in my own area, has publicly stated that he needs additional resources in order to meet best practice requirements.The Minister indicated that money would be available in the budget.  Will that include provision for needs such as transport and accommodation and will the homework be completed in that regard before the budget is announced?If resources are being moved, most of the locations due for closure could experience a surge in different types of cancer treatment.  Certain staff are not easily relocated because they are already doing work that does not relate to cancer.  Are these issues being taken into consideration and will adequate funding will be provided to implement the cancer strategy?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	231	A lot of work remains to be done.  Professor Keane has set targets of completing 50% of the transition by the end of next year and 90% by the following year.  That is an ambitious programme but I believe he will have buy-in from the clinical community.  Those who have chosen to be specialists in cancer care want to work in centres where they can pursue their clinical passions with like-minded colleagues.  In the area of breast cancer, for example, I understand 70 surgeons currently performbreast cancer operations whereas we probably only need 12.  Clearly, most of the surgeons who are generalists rather than breast cancer specialists will transfer to general surgery.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Yes.  We would like the specialist breast cancer surgeons to move to the centres and Professor Keane will be engaging them in dialogue in that regard.  I understand that significant enthusiasm and interest have been expressed.  We want activity to move from the centres to the hospitals where cancer surgery comes into the centre.  Many people in these eight hospitals could have their surgery facilitated in different hospitals if the capacity was in place.  It is a matter of moving some stuff out and other stuff in.  The 13 places that have already closed dealt with in the order of 55 surgeries last year, or one per week.An additional €1 billion has been spent on cancer treatment over the past ten years.  Professor Keane will have control of that budget and of course more money will be available for cancer.  Additional funds will be allocated for every speciality but cancer will receive special attention because of the aging of the population.  However, to place all the emphasis on additional funding rather than what is already in place would be a mistake.The transport issue is being reviewed by the HSE not only for cancer but also in respect of health services generally.  The accommodation issue is also very important.  I was impressed by the accommodation provisions made in British Columbia, which reported great patient satisfaction.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	234	It would be erroneous of the Minister to place all her emphasis on existing resources instead of discussing additional funding.  Has she not placed Professor Keane in an invidious situation?  He has just arrived, yet decisions have already been made about where the centres will be located and the number to be established.  He will have to unravel those arrangements if he does not agree.  People certainly find it bizarre to see nothing north of a line between Galway and Dublin.  Will he encounter the same problems as Professor Drumm in terms of trying to reorganise something that is already half-organised?  Why will four centres be located in Dublin when only one third of the population reside in the greater Dublin area?Glib references have been made to transport, which will be a massive issue.  Someone dear to me just completed radiotherapy and, even though he did not have to travel far, he was shattered each day.  Making somebody travel two or three hours by train and then face the same journey in reverse is not a prospect we can relish with any degree of humanity.The Minister spoke about the services she closed down.  Some services will clearly have to be discontinued but to close them before the new centres are up and running and seen to deliver is not acceptable.  This is like Hanly all over again.  It is no use to say that we will close the local accident and emergency unit and send patients up the road to Limerick but we will fix up the services in Limerick at some point in the future.  The people who need services need them today or next week.  We can see what happened subsequent to the closure of Ennis hospital, which required patients to travel to Galway.  The following week, the regional hospital in Galway raised the prospect of reducing breast cancer services from five to three days per week because of cutbacks.The Minister indicated to the House that she would discuss the budget with the Minister for Finance.  I hope she will find the additional funds necessary to make this plan successful so that it does not become, like cervical screening, a mere aspiration.

Appropriate accommodation is needed for those who must travel long distances from home for radiotherapy whereas surgery is a once-off experience.  The idea is that both developments will take place at the same time.  As the centres are built up, they will have considerable capacity and expertise.  We are not starting on greenfield sites.  Some of the top clinicians in the world, both doctors and nurses, are working in the cancer area and their number has increased significantly in recent years.  We want to organise within these centres and, in particular, retain all cancer functions in one place.  As a result of the manner in which some of our hospitals are managed, cancer patients in some hospitals are located on every ward or floor, which is inappropriate.  We want dedicated beds ring-fenced for cancer patients.  Professor Keane and the medical colleagues he will bring on board to assist him will have responsibility for implementing the plan.  It will be realised.

Does she agree that this is a wholly inappropriate use of language to describe issues which directly impinge on people's lives?  Does she understand that the decisions she takes affect the prospects of survival of people around the country?The Minister is proceeding with the closure of hospital services without the so-called centres of excellence first being in place.  How many centres of excellence for cancer care does she envisage will be rolled out?  Is she aware that today a large body of people from Sligo gathered outside the House in protest at the prospect of the closure of a centre of excellence at Sligo General Hospital?  What does she say to them?  Does she have any assurance for the people of the north west regarding the provision of cancer care services at Sligo General Hospital?  Is she aware that all shades of elected opinion in this House clearly indicated to the people who gathered outside the gates their support for the retention and development of the cancer service at the hospital?  Will the Minister outline precisely what are the plans in this regard and give an assurance to the people of the north west that the services at Sligo General Hospital will be retained and developed?

We have an excellent breast surgeon — Dr. O'Hanrahan — in Sligo General Hospital.  All our national experts, from Professor Niall O'Higgins down, as well as a large body of international evidence — I understand 250 medical journals are published on cancer — suggest that volume equals quality.  It is not simply a matter of a single physician, whether a surgeon, a pathologist who has a specialty or a radiologist, but of numbers of people working together.  All the evidence suggests that one's chances improve by more than 20% when one is treated in these centres.

They were selected by experts, including the Irish Cancer Society, Europa Donna and a patient advocacy group active in this area.On Deputy Finian McGrath's question, the changes will begin to take effect at an early date.  I hope, in the first instance, that we secure buy-in from the clinical community.  While this will not be forthcoming from everybody, the feedback I have received suggests many clinicians are excited about what is happening.  We will get considerable buy-in from the clinical community early next year.Professor Keane has done this work before and is immensely qualified.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, will meet him shortly to discuss issues of concern to him.  Professor Keane, who is very supportive of the centres, does not come new to Ireland.  We have received assistance from British Columbia since I visited the province nearly two years ago.  The individuals concerned did not arrive on Monday as we have already taken a great deal of advice from them.  I was highly impressed during my visit to British Columbia where one will hardly find a person who does not praise the province's cancer services even though many people must travel long distances to access them.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I call on the Government to show political will to reduce the number of people dying by suicide each year.  Social change and increased materialism are bringing about an identity crisis in young people.  While the Celtic tiger has undoubtedly brought many benefits, it has also brought many new challenges, particularly for adolescents.Why, at a time of great prosperity, do so many people feel such despair that each year an average of 500 individuals take their lives and in excess of 10,000 present at accident and emergency departments having attempted to take their lives or engaged in self-harm?  Why are so many of our young people in such crisis that they decide to end their lives?  Ireland has the fifth highest suicide rate in the European Union among 15 to 24 year olds and suicide is the chief cause of death for those aged under 25 years.  This dark side of the Celtic tiger is ignored.It is increasingly difficult for a young person to find a meaningful identity.  Those who are valued are the successful, the winners, those in third level education and high earners.  People who are not in these categories struggle to find their identity and may experience despair.Six times more young males than females take their lives.  The critical issue for male adolescents is to derive self-esteem and personal meaning from their identity and position in society.  Issues of self and identity are now linked to materialism, consumerism and globalisation.  Increased materialism has led to weaker social ties and a decline in neighbourliness.  We live in an age of uncertainty, anxiety and narcissism in which the euro isworshipped.  We have lost our way and no longer know what is of true value.  Who we are has come to be determined by what we can buy.  The overwhelming message being broadcast is that one is only as good as that which one can buy.The constant bombardment with Americanised images and values can be seen daily, while at the same time traditional cultural icons and role models are ridiculed and reviled.  Previous generations had a higher dependence on and belief in the pillars of society as sources of advice and guidance.  The early part of the 21st century is replete with images of distrust, from clerical abuse to political scandal.  Doctors kill, politicians are corrupt and businesses bribe and cheat.Adolescence is a creation of modern society.  In earlier times, individuals moved from being a child to being an adult, with no stage of transition.  When resources were scarce and individuals had to contend with daily survival in the basic sense there was no time for adolescents to discover themselves.  An individual was either a child and dependent or an adult who provided for himself or herself.  The emergence of adolescence has offered psychological time and space for individuals to consider their future when they grow up and offers limitless choices.  It has enormous positive advantage in that young people are given an opportunity to choose their career and to decide and influence their own success.  The negative aspect is that the adolescent is also free to fail.  Adolescence is a dangerous mix, a time of opportunity and pressure to succeed.  If we were left in doubt about the impact of such uncertainty and distrust on our young people, the suicide figures for Ireland over the past ten years indicate that something maladaptive and unhealthy is taking place.Nobody disputes the benefits that have been brought about by the Celtic tiger, but there is a dark side which cannot be ignored.  There is an urgent need for comprehensive research into how we can address the complex issues that lead to so many of our young people, especially young men, taking their own lives.

I have worked for the past 20 years with young people in Dublin Central and have seen massive changes over those two decades.  I was reared in the north inner city.  In the 1980s, areas like Sheriff Street, the North Strand and East Wall had high unemployment and suffered badly from the scourge of heroin addiction.  Successive Governments had neglected education in these areas, there was a significant deficit in housing and facilities were bottom of the agenda.Since then much has been done to help young people stay away from drugs and alcohol and to rehabilitate those who are already addicts.  We now have better treatment facilities, education, policing and communities, and families and young people have a better understanding of the problems.  Our ability to think outside the box and bring together communities, gardaí, public representatives, treatment centres, health services and education has contributed to helping thousands of young people over the years to stay away from crime and substance abuse.  If anybody is in doubt about the importance of this approach in reducing crime and drug problems, I would be delighted to bring him or her to visit areas in Dublin Central where a united and co-ordinated effort has made significant difference.  Everybody in the community, including schools and colleges, has played a part in helping thousands of young people to turn their backs on crime and drugs and look forward to a bright future.The way we have met these challenges has changed and we have seen new facilities, methods and skills introduced into disadvantaged areas.  A few young people still slip through the net and we must concentrate on helping them.  There are programmes in place, such as the youth diversion programme, which have proved successful.  I have first-hand experience of clubs and organisations involved in this area.  A club for youth service has become a national service, which is popular and effective and offers young people a focal point and meeting place for them to meet and chill out in an environment free from alcohol and drugs.  Projects like that have been set up all over the country.The key to the success of most of these projects is that young people were asked what they wanted and are central to the running of the clubs and organisation.  The Base Youth Club in Ballyfermot, which is to open shortly, is another example of such clubs.  These clubs help young people to develop.  I urge Departments and local authorities to continue to support such initiatives.  If these initiatives are to be successful, the agencies involved must be as flexible as the clubs.  They must adopt the holistic approach of the clubs and support funding, rather than pigeonhole access to grants and other forms of funding in an old-fashioned way.The most important factor for success is that the authorities should consult young people and encourage them to take ownership of projects.  There is a prime example of this approach in Dáil na nÓg, where young people from all over the country get together on a regular basis and discuss issues of concern to them.  We need to put a value on preventing young people from getting involved in drugs and crime and turn that into tangible support.We must also invest in the thousands of other young people who have no contact with crime or alcohol and drug abuse.  I am very concerned by some comments I hear that all young people take alcohol or drugs and are ruining their lives.  That is not true.  My experience is that the majority of young people work hard to make something of themselves, get a career and improve their lives.  Some of these toffee-nosed know-all commentators should stand outside schools and colleges in June and see the quality of the thousands of young people sitting junior and leaving certificate examinations.Education has always been essential to ensuring that our young people can work in our technology companies, the financial services sector, the service industry and the Civil Service, and it has contributed to the economic boom Ireland has enjoyed in recent years.  The Government is committed to continuing to invest in our training and education programmes to ensure our young people have the knowledge and skills to meet our economic needs.  For the past ten years Ireland has benefited greatly from our investment in young people.  I urge the Minister to continue to invest in this area in future years.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I thank Deputy Brady for sharing his time with me and am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I wish to pick up on one of the points made by Deputy Brady, namely, consultation with young people.  This is a relatively new idea.  I was brought up at a time when many households held that young people should be seen but not heard, although our household was one where everybody spoke on everything.I commend the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, and the young people who participated in her survey which demonstrates that, throughout the provinces, the main concerns of young people are families and care.  I found that interesting.  Mr. Fergus Finlay is doing excellent work with young people through the organisation Barnardos.  There was criticism from some speakers who demand more action from the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  He has assembled all the schemes, outlets and ideas relevant to young people and we will have action on those issues.The main cause of concern for me is that no matter how many good schemes or innovative projects we have, they only reach a certain percentage of the youth population.  This means we always have some who do not get involved.  This is often because of a lack of parental interest in what is going on or lack of finance to purchase the required gear for something such as sports activities.  I suggest to all involved in this area that they should watch out for those who cannot, through no fault of their own, participate fully.  These are the people who fall through the cracks and whom we read about some months later when some disaster has befallen them.Young people are often incorrectly portrayed as know-alls or smart.  I noted from the Dáil book that was launched last night that there are 18 second level teachers and 13 primary teachers, 31 in all, in the Houses.  Anybody who has ever taught, particularly at second level — I say to Deputy Brady that I am not decrying those who taught at primary level — learns very quickly that children have a facade of being wonderful and smart, but they are not.  They want to be like their peers, to appear brave and courageous and give the impression that they understand everything, but behind that facade they are hurting.  Often they cannot find someone in whom they can confide and to whom they can tell their story.  The business of childhood, growing up and services for young people are hugely complex.  Children cannot be put in a box, given A, B, C and D and then emerge as perfect adults.I commend the Minister of State on what he is doing in the Office of the Minister for Children.  It is a very good idea.  There were attempts in other Governments to bring together the various Departments but it never actually worked.  It is the setting up of the office which is important and the far-seeing role of the Minister of State.  I hope you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I can make an impact in the committee on the rights of children when it is up and running.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I join some of my Fine Gael colleagues in questioning the purpose of the motion.  While I welcome the opportunity to debate youth issues I would rather debate them in the context of a clear purpose.  We can all offer our views but I would like action.  If this is an attempt to reach out to young people I am not persuaded this method will succeed.  Clearly there is a lack of legislation coming through the House.  Obviously that is one of the reasons for the debate and why we have had so many statements in recent weeks.  Our primary purpose is to bring legislation through.  If this debate led to that I could see a better purpose in it.I would like to know whose idea it was to have this debate.  Since we have it, I will proceed in that vein.  The speech of the Minister of State with responsibility for children was a classic one.  It made clear exactly what he thinks his job is because it is difficult to see what it is.  It is supposed to co-ordinate Departments but it is not clear that it is doing that.  He told the House he had three goals.  It is not particularly taxing for him if that is all he has.  The three goals are, first, to give young people a voice in accordance with their maturity — that is fair enough; second, to have their lives better understood — to have their lives understood by whom was not clear; and, third, that young people will receive quality supports and services — no one could disagree with that.The Minister of State went on to tell the House about Dáil na nÓg, the youth councils and so on.  I accept they are very valuable, fulfil a need and are of enormous benefit to the children who participate.  However, only a limited number of young people get to participate in Dáil na nÓg and in youth councils.  I welcome the councils, particularly at second level where they are obviously more inclusive because they are in many schools.  Young people have told me they do not always cover the broad range of young people within a particular school.  Those who are more pushy and better able to talk get on to these councils while the quieter people, those who may need more assistance, are left behind.  I congratulate those young people who participate in these bodies.  I congratulate also the Ombudsman for Children on her work in accessing young people, getting them involved and hearing their views.  I still have to question how all this informs Government policy and Government decisions and I will return to that issue.In his speech the Minister of State mentioned a few websites, some of which are up and running, while some are on the way.  In regard to the most important aspect of his third goal, quality supports and services, there is no mention of the services, what he means by this, how young people will access them, their cost and where they will be located.  It is a broad catch-all woolly concept.  It is a meaningless aspiration in some ways; it sounds lovely but what does he mean by it?I turn to some real issues affecting young people, bearing in mind that yesterday was universal children's day.  The Government's concern for children is very selective.  An example of this is the failure of the Government which signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, three articles of which we are clearly in breach of.  We continue to subject approximately 3,000 young children to the habitual residence condition for child benefit.  The effect of this is that approximately 3,000 children go without basic necessities, such as, medicine, food and adequate clothing.  The State in general, the Government and the Opposition, have always agreed that child benefit is a plank to remove children from poverty.  Everyone in the House would respect the work of Sr. Breege Keenan of the Vincentian Refugee Centre.  She said:We see children all the time whose parents cannot give them the most basic requirements.  These include suitable food and dietary supplements, over the counter medicines like Calpol and even simple play things are often way beyond the means of these parents.If we want to discuss youth and treat all young children in this country the same we cannot continue to enforce a policy which segregates a particular group of children and leaves them with €9.20 per week.  I appreciate that food and so on are provided in the hostels in which they live.  The schools tell me children are unable to buy books but are not eligible for the free books scheme.  They are unable to participate in school tours and where contributions are expected in the schools they are not able to participate.  They cannot access basic requirements such as over-the-counter medicines.  This is a real issue and one which the Government should go back to the drawing board and reconsider.  The groups who got together — the Free Legal Advice Centre, Barnardos, the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, Children's Alliance and so on — called on the Government yesterday to change this commitment.  My colleague, Deputy David Stanton, spoke out against it in 2004 when it was introduced.  If anything meaningful is to come from the motion I ask the Government to reconsider the imposition of this on children.There are a few issues that particularly affect young people, be they children or young teenagers, one of which is bullying.  The State has failed to provide a national anti-bullying strategy.  One project was carried out by Trinity College and piloted in Donegal.  The Norwegian Government adopted that model as the best one it could find.  Yet we in Ireland have failed to adopt our own pilot project despite the fact that it was successful.  It is clear that if a child is bullied the effects last for three years within that child's family, as proved by statistics.  This is an issue we have failed to tackle.  We can talk about giving them quality of life in other areas but if we do not implement policies such as this we are putting them at a disadvantage.The Government has failed to roll out the Stay Safe programme to every primary school, despite the fact that it can be of such enormous help to children.  It teaches them what is and what is not appropriate in terms of the behaviour of adults and strangers towards them.  It is not accessible to every child whose parents want them to access it.  My colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, outlined the clear problems in the area of psychological assessments last night and I have done so in the past.  We are failing children from an early age.  Deputy Neville touched on the psychiatric services which has been a big issue in recent months and years.  I listened to it being debated on the radio yesterday afternoon when a number of parents telephoned to say their children are not able to access basic services.  While I do not want to be political, because this is such a sensitive point, a motion such as this should state how we intend to deal with that, how we will fund that and create real change in children's lives.On the issue of sports and play facilities for children, when I became a member of Offaly County Council in 1999 there was not one playground in County Offaly although there had been when I was a child.  That position has changed.  I congratulate the Government on the provision of grants for three playgrounds in Birr, Tullamore and Clara.  A further two are on the way in Banagher and Ferbane.  What happens in the rest of the county?  The entire north of Offaly is without a playground because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who was hardly a day in the office, scrapped the playground grant.  We can talk around all these things but if we are serious about children learning socialisation skills, learning how to get on with each other and to play with each other, they must have somewhere to do it.  They cannot do it at home on their own.  That is one severe criticism I would make.I acknowledge the work of the various sporting organisations around the country.  I agree that a great deal of money has been provided through the national lottery to sporting organisations.  Most of the time it is for us to sit and watch.  I am concerned that greater investment is needed to allow children and young people to participate.  We have to get away from the notion that the answer to all young people's problems is sport because there will always be a section of young people who will not engage in sport. Other avenues have been tried such as music schools and dance.  What young people want is simple — they want funding for this type of programme throughout the country.  There should be greater use of school facilities so these activities can be provided.I disagree with colleagues anywhere in the House who claim young people do not have values.  While that was not necessarily said during this debate, it is an awful statement and one that has been made in the past.  Young people may have different values but the ombudsman's report clearly showed the huge percentage for whom the most important issues were family and care, which does not represent any great change in values from the position 30 years ago.We must realise young people do not pick their habits off the ground but are to a large extent brought upon them by society and advertising.  It is not young people but adults who spend huge sums on advertising yet it is often targeted at the young, who are subject to many negative influences that may change their behaviour.  Members of the House have a duty to respond and to help families and parents deal with the pressures of life and in so doing to help young people.The motion refers to obesity.  My major concern with the motion is that it is like a slap on the back in that it claims we are doing a great job, which is not the case.  Some 200,000 people are affected by eating disorders but there are just three public beds for the entire country, and these are only accessible to people over the age of 18.  If we want to help young people, we must examine these issues.The Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, Deputy Carey, is present.  While I do not have time to deal with that issue today, I hope we can discuss it at another time.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	252	We will have an opportunity to comprehensively address the drugs issue next week and I will refer to it in passing in this contribution.There is probably never a perfect time to discuss young people's issues.  The European Youth Parliament was held in the Chamber last week and, while I was not present, I believe it addressed many of these issues.  Dáil na nÓg also does good work.  We need to learn to listen to young people.  We are very good at telling them what to do but we are not always good at listening to their concerns.  Very often, they have much to tell us which we should incorporate into the work we are doing.Like Deputy O'Rourke, I was a teacher in a previous incarnation.  In fact, I spent 30 very enjoyable years working in that profession and would like to think I had a reasonably good engagement with young people.  I also spent much time involved in youth work.  I have seen at first hand the positive effects that can arise from giving young people a chance.  Most of my involvement has been working with young people in areas of disadvantage.  I have seen the difference it has made to young people in those areas when additional support and encouragement was given to them at an early stage.I take Deputy Enright's point with regard to playgrounds.  Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of playgrounds throughout the country.  When I started in youth work, one of the first campaigns waged against young people was that by the adult population of this city to remove playgrounds from their areas.  We did not have the term anti-social behaviour in those days but the allegation made was that they would only be drinking around the swings, that one could not get insurance and the devil and all would be happening around the place.We are coming from a very low base and the situation remains difficult.  My Department is associated with both the RAPID and CLÁR programmes.  For every area where we manage to persuade the local authority and community to agree to locate a playground, there is another where it will be said "Not in my back yard, thank you very much."  There are times when I think it would almost be easier to locate a facility for drug misusers than one for young people to enjoy creative opportunities.  It is regrettable this is sometimes the case.Since I took over responsibility for the national drugs strategy five months ago, I have been struck by the number of youth workers and others involved with young people's initiatives.  I have met those who themselves received support that helped in their formative years and who are now willing to put something back.  I was in Edenderry in Deputy Enright's constituency some weeks ago to visit a superb drug awareness project.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I did not do the inviting; I was invited myself.  Young people from the local schools were present.  They know what they want and made their voices heard.  They want a youth centre and I suspect they will keep hounding local representatives until they get it.  I encouraged them to keep it up.I attended a meeting of the regional drugs task force in Athlone yesterday.  I was very impressed by the number of initiatives that slowly but surely the task force is rolling out in that region.  While I would like to see progress achieved much more quickly, definite progress is being made and solid and well-grounded programmes for young people are being put in place.Despite so much work going on, problems persist and we continue to struggle to keep up the scale of support which is needed, whether through an ability to respond for a short time at stages when young people might be vulnerable and need a helping hand, or through more long-term interventions which are needed in other circumstances.  From my experience on the ground, I believe it is important that young people become involved as much as possible in their communities — to be fair, they do so.  We need to educate children and other young people about themselves and the world around them, and empower them to contribute to the development of their community, environment and society.  I firmly believe any resources invested in children and young people will be repaid many times over through the future well-being of our communities and society in general.I was invited to present certificates to a group of transition year students in a school in my constituency last Friday.  The school ran a programme based on an American programme concerned with empowering young people and giving them the capacity to make their own decisions and come to the right decisions.  Much of the programme concerned the area of drugs.  While I am sometimes sceptical about imported programmes, I was very impressed by the way the young people were able to articulate the value they found in these courses.  Much work of that type is being done throughout the country.When people talk about these difficult times for our young people, drugs are never far from their minds.  As Minister of State with responsibility in that area, I am acutely aware of the problems and potential problems facing young people today.  Through the prevention pillar of the national strategy, including the young people's facilities and services fund, resources are directed into facilities and services aimed at encouraging alternatives to a lifestyle that revolves around drugs and alcohol.  One of the most effective strategies to prevent problem drug use is to ensure young people have alternatives in their lives, for example, sport and recreational opportunities.  In such settings, combined with the work of those organising the activities, youth has a chance to get involved in alternative pursuits where they can express themselves and their ideas, and be supported generally in a way that can improve their lives.I take the point that not every person, young or old, is interested in sport, which is why it is important we have facilities such as youth cafés.  "Youth café" is a new buzzword but they are a useful intervention, provided we can adapt to changing needs.  They provide another outlet and help to include those young people who are interested in, for example, art or playing music or computer games.I am pleased to note the Department's young people's facilities and services fund is assisting in the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The objective of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  The target group for the fund is ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and drugs and so on.Since 1998 the Government has allocated €132 million to the fund for current capital projects which, broken down roughly, is an allocation of €70 million for current spending and €62 million for capital projects.  This year, €12.9 million is being provided to cover current expenditure under the fund, with €6 million for capital expenditure.  Approximately 500 facilities and services projects are being supported under the fund and over 350 people are employed directly, with the funding provided under the young people's facilities and services fund.At present the fund operates in the 14 local drugs task force areas — 12 in Dublin and the others in Bray and Cork — as well as Limerick, Waterford, Carlow and Galway.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, the operation of the fund will be extended to other towns, mainly in Leinster.  I will probably be in a position to identify those towns before Christmas and am currently assessing the best way towards meeting that commitment.  I am meeting the regional drugs task forces, local authorities and sport and recreational organisations to roll out that programme.Applications for funding under the YPFSF are being made through a relevant local development group.  The group generally comprises representatives of the relevant drugs task force, local authority and vocational education committee.  The ideas originate in communities and proposers are always encouraged to consult young people about what they would like to have in their areas.  I am anxious to get projects that will grow from local communities and which are closely identified with the needs of young people.  The proposals are assessed for suitability against priorities identified from the area, not from the Department.  I intend to deal with that in more detail next week.We cannot underestimate the risk of illegal drugs and to this end the Department has started a review of the next phase of the national drugs strategy.  I know that Deputy Byrne and others will be actively engaged in that process.  The next phase covers a long period from 2009 to 2016, which might appear like an eternity to young people.  The year 2016 is a seminal, iconic date in the life of this country.  I would like to think that by working together on a cross-party basis we can put in place strategies that will make a difference for young people.  By 2016 therefore we will be in a position to treat all the children of the nation equally.The field work for a second all-island prevalent study on drugs has been done and it will soon give us a good idea of the extent of various drug misuse issues.  I will be working closely with Members on both sides of the House to identify the way forward to implement the study's findings.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	255	We live in a different Ireland today from the one in which we grew up.  As a parent I recognise the pressures young people face these days as a result of increased levels of prosperity.  We live in a society where beauty and image are considered to be very important.  The media have a major influence on the lives of young people and go a long way towards projecting this image.  Like other parents, I have been told to "get a life" and "come into the real world", but we must listen to our young people and try to understand their world.  Elected representatives must legislate on issues that reflect the views of today's youth.It is well known that the experiences of childhood go a long way towards shaping our future lives.  Confidence and self-awareness must be nurtured in those early years and education is the key to achieving this.  We should put in place a programme that presents school as a gateway to opportunity and fulfilment regardless of our backgrounds or family circumstances.  Last year, in Dublin city alone, 368 children left school before the age of 15.  The number of such children has doubled in five years, which is a shocking statistic and one we must act upon now.At present, there are 83 welfare officers for the entire country, which falls far short of the recommended figure of 360.  The Government must act urgently to employ more educational welfare officers to reduce the number of early school leavers.School programmes are required in which physical education is afforded more priority in the everyday curriculum.  There is a lack of PE facilities in schools and in this respect I will cite two examples from my area.  The two-hour per week slot for a PE teacher in a local school is inadequate to facilitate the 240 students.  Loreto College and Goldenbridge national school have no proper PE facilities.  Sports halls have been long awaited so I hope the Minister for Education and Science will consider providing them following the budget.As the Minister of State said, youth cafés are required.  Places such as St. Catherine's in Marrowbone Lane and John Bosco's in Drimnagh have begun to demonstrate their role in the community.  Young people turn up to such centres every night of the week to get involved in various activities, including Internet surfing and playing music.  In addition, alternative sporting venues are needed such as an all-year ice skating rink and swimming pools.  I was delighted to see that Dublin City Council overturned an earlier decision not to introduce the ice skating rink this year.  I am amazed by the number of children from my area who are thrilled and excited to use the ice skating rink.  We are a prosperous country and it is about time we had such rinks and swimming pools in most parts of the city rather than just in certain areas.  We need places where young people can congregate and socialise in a healthy, alcohol-free environment.  They should be able to meet their friends in the evening without having to stand on street corners.Health awareness is another neglected part of the education system.  While a mandatory RSE programme is in place, in reality it is not happening on the ground.  The programme should be reassessed to reflect the issues that currently affect young people.  In addition, the CSPE programme should be reintroduced for the senior cycle year.  However unpleasant it may be for parents to contemplate, children as young as 11 years of age are now sexually active.  The consequences and risks must be spelt out more visually through media advertising to highlight the emotional dangers and health risks of sexually transmitted diseases.We can discuss these matters as long as we like, paying lip service to them, but without a willingness by Ministers to accept responsibility and take action, the problems will continue.  The Government should act quickly to ensure that children will have an improved role in our society.  I urge the Government to accept the amended motion moved by Deputy Shatter.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I welcome the opportunity to speak about some pressing issues for young people.  Children are the most vulnerable people in our society.  Their well-being must be a fundamental aspect of how the State legislates and governs.  If we do right by our children now, they will do right by this country in generations to come.  For some time, reservations have been expressed about the manner in which our legal justice system deals with victims of child abuse who attempt to seek justice.  A landmark report last week found that the criminal justice system as it stands is not serving victims of child abuse correctly.  The report was produced by University College Dublin and the child abuse treatment units at Temple Street hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.  It was presented at the Psychology Society of Ireland's annual conference in Killarney last week.The report found that the legal system is at best inaccessible and at worst cruel to some of the most vulnerable in our society.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should take on board the report's findings and implement the necessary changes.  Such victims are clearly being let down by the current process, which needs to be altered.  We need to act sooner and more sensitively in this regard.  An average wait of 15 months for a guilty plea to be heard in child abuse cases means victims and their families are under needless stress for almost two years.  That is a long time during which one is unable to rebuild a young life.  It is hard to see the justice in this.I am also concerned at the finding that only one quarter of all victims had availed of specialist support before their cases opened.  The trauma suffered by child abuse victims should not be compounded by their efforts to bring child abusers to justice.  I hope the Minister will place significant importance on these findings and listen to the experts in the field who are calling for immediate reform.The Government needs a wake up call regarding the abuse of drugs in the State.  Drugs can be bought at every crossroads and the State is doing very little about it.  In County Clare only three gardaí are deployed in the drugs unit, which is totally inadequate.  More resources and more gardaí dedicated to tackling the drugs problem are needed, together with a genuine commitment from the Government.The lack of facilities for young people is another issue that needs immediate attention.  Many of us met and spoke with hundreds of young people in our constituencies during the recent general election campaign.  The issue they raised repeatedly was the lack of facilities for them.  The building boom has not been kind to our sports or recreational infrastructure which has fallen behind best European standards.  Voluntary bodies are left to make up for the lack of direction or investment.  This needs to be addressed.  Sociologists have long outlined the benefits of better recreational and sports infrastructure in our communities and it is time the Government prioritised investment in this area and brought forward a new community development scheme to give communities access to funding.How can we have faith in a Government which has demonstrated such little regard for our children in the area of education?  The situation in Ballyea national school in my constituency, where funding has been withdrawn, is deplorable.  A total of 159 children attend a school built for 80.  A sum of €200,000 has been expended on the development of a temporary site but the funding has been suspended.   It is difficult for us to ask our children to respect their environment as they grow, when the Government has such little respect for the daily environment of thousands of schoolchildren.  It needs to cop on to the fact that an investment in our children is an investment in our future but that is not the case.I would also like the Government to work on the issue of road safety as it pertains to our youth.  Our schools are the best places to begin the dialogue with children about this issue.  A programme entitled the Irish School of Excellence is used in schools in County Clare and elsewhere in Munster.  However, it is not funded by the State.  The Government should support this initiative and treat road safety with the importance it deserves.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I wish to share time with Deputy Margaret Conlon.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is an opportune time for us to reflect on and review our policies on young people and to outline positive policy initiatives for the future.  In particular, it is an opportunity for someone like me, who represents one of the fastest growing communities in the country, to highlight the specific challenges young people face in areas such as Kildare North.  It is almost a cliché to say young people have contributed to our economic success.  However, one of the key reasons Ireland been successful in attracting foreign direct investment is the young, educated and skilled workforce on offer.  While we should never look on our youth merely as a financial resource, it is important to recognise the contribution of our young people and educational infrastructure, which helped transform the country which was previously bedevilled by high unemployment and poor economic outlook to a modern vibrant and successful economy.As we reflect on that success and put policies in place to harness the best from our young people, areas that have experienced considerable residential development, without matching community and social infrastructure, must be considered to assess how best we can retrofit these facilities.  Kildare North, with towns such as Maynooth, Naas, Celbridge, Clane and Kilcock, has experienced significant population growth in recent years.  Many young people live in these towns and have or are about to have young families.  A significant proportion have families of teenage age and require fit for purpose community facilities to ensure they will have a positive focal point for engagement through sports, music, drama, art or social interaction in café bars.  We are expected to set policy guidelines that will offer the best chance of extracting what is most positive from our youth.This is the main issue I would like to address in my contribution, as it is specific to Kildare North which has witnessed rapid growth without  matching community facilities.  It is important to put this issue in context.  In recent years significant funds have been invested in sports facilities in County Kildare.  Almost every sports club has benefited in one form or another from the sports capitation grant allocations or the Kildare sports partnership.  Significant investment in school extensions or new schools to match the increasing demand for places has taken place.  In addition, progress has been made in reducing the pupil-teacher ratio which was helped by the introduction of the developing schools status.  However, in constituencies such as Kildare North the challenge is to ensure new development is strengthened and complements existing or new communities.  We all accept that new developments need to comprise more than houses.  It is essential that schools, community facilities, employment, transport and amenities are integrated with the housing development process in a timely, cost effective and sustainable manner.  Joined-up government across the local and national spectrum can facilitate the emergence of sustainable, integrated communities as we continue to expand.I welcome the Government's commitment to allocate €150 million to a community development fund in the next five years to build the infrastructure required to sustain communities.  I will press the Government to ensure County Kildare obtains its fair share of this funding.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The development fund is an opportunity to retrofit community facilities, in particular, for our young people.  I call on the Government to introduce schemes to implement this agenda of retrofitting community facilities in conurbations.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs administers schemes such as RAPID and CLÁR which have been tremendously successful in dealing with specific needs.  The needs of our communities could be addressed through such specific schemes, where funding would be ring-fenced for the provision of facilities.  Large residential areas need a focused approach to build communities around the bricks and mortar of our housing estates.  We have a successful model for the disbursement of such funding to tackle specific needs in our communities.It is also important to point to a facility in my constituency which is a model for future development.  The Leixlip Amenities Centre which recently received funding to improve and expand its facilities provides a large number of services for the community.  It has become a positive focus for the community and, particularly, young people.  The population in Kildare North has increased rapidly with significant growth in residential development.  The success of our economy has led to a rapid increase in the population in recent times.  While this success is welcome, it brings challenges that must be addressed.  Now is the time to invest in our communities in order that our young people can be attracted to sport, music, drama, art, community activities and education.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and all other stakeholders, including our local authorities, to provide improved facilities to ensure our youth have a positive focus for the future.

The Celtic tiger has led to increased opportunities and with opportunities come challenges.  While we have become more affluent, we have also found ourselves dealing with the many societal issues that come with increased wealth.The majority of our young people have a very comfortable lifestyle and while I agree that we, as legislators, have a role to play in ensuring problems are dealt with and that our schools continue to educate in a holistic manner, I welcome the many new programmes introduced in our schools to deal with the challenges facing our young people.  However, let us be clear, parents also have a duty to parent and they need to be supported by us in this role.For me, health promotion is hugely important.  Statistics show that good habits formed early on in life are maintained.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, referred a number of years ago to the new generation of "screen-agers" who spend every spare minute moving from one screen to another, from PlayStation to Game Boy to the computer screen to the TV screen.  They see this as their pastime but it is a sedentary pastime and we need to encourage these young people to participate in sport and to become much more active.  Unfortunately, it is the exception rather than the norm that children would walk to and from school.  This is not always related to road safety but a habit formed early in life.I agree that not every child is a gifted footballer or a talented athlete.  We need to take account of the pressure placed on young people to win and to stress the importance of participation rather than winning.  In this respect, I commend the work of Community Games which provide many different opportunities for young people to participate in a broad range of artistic, sporting and cultural activities.  These activities are of huge benefit from a physical perspective but they also enable our young people to develop team building skills which they will need as they progress through life.  Every community has an active GAA, soccer or other sport club and huge resources have been invested in the juvenile sports structure, and the Government continues to invest in sporting facilities through the sports capital programme.  We must give due recognition to the many volunteers involved in these clubs but it is important for parents to become more involved because clubs will not survive if it is left to the few to keep the momentum going.A healthy body leads to a healthy mind and our schools play a major role in health promotion by encouraging nutritious lunches and banning fizzy drinks and junk food.  In responding to the issue of childhood obesity, we need to deal with the complex causes including diet, lifestyle and environmental issues.  While it is important to tackle childhood obesity it is also imperative that our young people do not become obsessed with the fashion, food and slimming adverts which, either directly or by implication, link positive, emotional or psychological well-being with reduced food intake or a particular body shape.As a teacher I understand the pressures facing our young people.  Many are stressed but many also put themselves under increased pressure.  They have a very active social life.  Many have part-time jobs and they try to juggle work with school work and study to ensure they get the course of their dreams.  Unfortunately, some students spend equally as much or more time in active employment as they do in school.  Their increased disposable income is some cases is spent on alcohol, cigarettes or other illicit substances.Our young people seem to live for the present and the notion of saving for the rainy day is a concept with which they are not familiar.  It is not uncommon for teachers to have classes on a Monday morning which are not well attended or if students are present their attention span is poor as they recover from the excesses of the weekend.  This dependence on alcohol is worrying.  While many young people do not drink or drink responsibly, unfortunately there are some whose idea of a good night out is when they cannot remember it the next day.  We have all witnessed the scenes of young people, drunk and disoriented lying on the street and in clubs and that brings its own problems.  Alcohol should contain the same health warning as cigarettes so the user is clear that it can have serious health effects.We need to work to promote a healthy mind and positive mental health.  I welcome the developments of the SPHE programme at primary and secondary level where children become more confident in discussing their problems because for too long we have lived with the notion that children should be seen and not heard.  I reiterate my commitment to promoting the issues and concerns of the young people I represent.  I welcome the debate and look forward to continued investment and commitment in this area.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12768	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	265	In speaking to this motion one wonders what is the Government's primary motivation in putting it before the House.  It is not a legislative proposal.  It contains no concrete provisions.  It is short on detail and long on aspiration and therein lies the rub.  The Government is high on aspiration but low on delivery.  The motion is so broad that one senses there is a clear agenda by the Government to pay lip service to the idea of addressing the young people's issues throughout this island.  What young people want are concrete legislative proposals that will speak directly to their concerns.  These concerns are well documented and have been brought to Government through representative bodies such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI.  The NYCI is a social partner and the genuineness of this motion will be measured by the Government's response to concerns outlined by groups such as the NYCI.  I fear, however, that this motion is meaningless and full of platitudes and that young people have become used to hearing from a Government about the provision of services.In the limited time afforded to me I wish to address a number of specific areas.  The first relates to the health of children and our young people.  The NYCI, in its budget submission, calls on the Government to deliver on its promise to double the income threshold for full medical card entitlements for parents of children under six years of age in this year's budget.  I believe this is attainable.  The Government must look positively on this proposal.  Approximately 1.1 million children and young people under the age of 18 live in Ireland.  According to the NYCI, only 305,000 of them are covered under the medical card scheme.  Access to a GP is vital to ensure that a young person can avail of services to assist him or her through these difficult years.  A young person needs to be able to do this without incurring a financial cost.  This service would serve as a positive move that would give young people the confidence and independence to avail of vital services but in a way that would ensure confidentiality.  Young people living in rural areas in particular where counselling and other services are not readily available would benefit in particular.  The Government must also look favourably on families with children over the age of seven and under the age of 18 with a view to ensuring that income thresholds are raised to allow more children to avail of primary and secondary health care.The second issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of adequate facilities and services for young people who are in need of counselling and require access to mental health facilities.  In my constituency of Cork East the organisation Lets Get Together was set up to help others affected by suicide and to examine ways of preventing it.  In 2005 the Lets Get Together Foundation linked up with a number of similar organisations throughout the country to set up an all-Ireland suicide prevention strategy, thereby raising awareness of the issue and speaking to local and national media.  If this motion is to mean anything, the Government must assist organisations of this nature.  The highest rate of suicide is found among young men aged under 35 — this age group accounts for 40% of all Irish suicides.  There is a clear lack of a coherent Government policy to encourage young people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives to talk to others about it.  The lack of available facts on a range of health and lifestyle issues linking potential users to relevant help services throughout the country is exacerbating the travesty of suicide which has reached epidemic proportions throughout this land.  We have the fifth highest suicide rate in Europe among the 15 to 25 year age group and death by suicide is the number one cause of death among young Irish men.  The Government, if it is serious about this motion, needs to fund more campaigns of representative organisations such as the NYCI, through the primary care strategy, to reduce the large number of deaths by suicide.  Awareness must be raised.  Young people need options and to be able to access them in a safe and non-judgmental manner.  We have all experienced tough times.  Many of us have been fortunate in that we had family and friends to support us.  Not every young person has that luxury.  Issues such as coming out to parents, unexpected pregnancy, low self-esteem and depression need to be tackled in a non-judgmental way.On the issue of unwanted pregnancies, now that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has admitted that VAT on condoms can be cut to as low as 5%, will she not bring a proposal to Cabinet that the Minister for Finance should cut the tax from 21% to 5%, as was done in the UK and other EU member states?  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has stated that 32% of people have indicated that the cost of contraception is a major factor in the decision not to use condoms, resulting in a rising incidence of sexually transmitted disease and unintended pregnancies.  I could go on as there are many issues.  However, since I am sharing with my colleague, Deputy Wall, I am happy to do so and will leave it at that.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, for allowing me a number of minutes of his time to speak on this very important motion.  It is disappointing, however, that it is just a motion and no action is promised in relation to it.As the Labour Party's spokesman on community and rural affairs, I want to back the call by the National Youth Council of Ireland, which appeals to all parties to commit to the setting up and funding of a national youth participation programme.  The objective is to support and promote greater participation, active citizenship and volunteering among young people, with specific emphasis on those aged 18 to 25.  Recently, in reply to a parliamentary question submitted to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I was told that according to the most recent report from the ESRI, volunteering was up from 17.1% in 2002 to 23.1% in 2006.  Active community involvement, according to the same report, was up from 21.7% to 29% in the same period.As one who lives in a rural constituency, while I welcome these figures I doubt their authenticity.  It is not apparent to me on the ground that the figures are relevant to rural Ireland.  While I welcome the trends indicated, the figures leave much to be desired for the ordinary person on the street who comes to me on a regular basis with their problems.  Thus, while welcoming the figures, with reservations, we must recognise the call from the NYCI to set up a programme to support active citizenship and volunteering among the younger population.  The youth are our future volunteers and although one cannot force any individual to become actively involved, we must ensure every effort is made to create the conditions for young people to participate in community life.  In talking to local youth groups I know they experience problems in getting young people to become youth leaders, especially in the 18 to 30 age bracket.  The pace of life in modern Ireland is not helping.  Young people have to travel long distances for work or college and find it difficult to get the time, resources and energy to commit to youth leadership.  This is unfortunate, and very serious.  If we cannot get persons in the 18 to 30 age group to commit in large numbers to become leaders, we are widening the age gap between leaders and those in the age bracket 12 to 18.The time has come to act, bearing this in mind.  I agree with the NYCI that a sustained effort is crucial to attract young people as volunteers.  We must look at how people who volunteer are treated and question why they become involved.  Hopefully, this will lead to a programme to encourage others.  The time to act is now.  We cannot any longer do without such a programme.  I ask that the potential for a programme of this type be investigated by the relevant Minister and that initiatives are put in place to address this vital issue.Another major concern is mental health and suicide prevention.  A major concern among the entire population is the rate of suicide among the young.  Ireland has the fifth highest rate of suicide in Europe for the 14 to 24 age group, a frightening statistic.  The highest frequency is to be found among young men in the 20 to 29 year old age group.  Mental health problems and disorders such as depression and substance misuse are associated with 90% of all suicide cases.  This is one of the issues I have argued with relevant Ministers as regards the provision of facilities.  We have seen wonderful work done through the capital sports programme in relation to arts, sport and tourism, but we must move the goalposts and ensure such facilities have permanent staff that can engage with the major housing developments.  We must ensure they know and are involved in what is going on and we should not cherrypick in terms of those big estates.  Rather, we should pick the best people from them to become involved in the sports area because that is one of the major problems we have.  We must go right across the spectrum towards ensuring that every child in these enormous estates, without facilities, is cared for.I want to highlight the situation whereby planning authorities allow developers to minimise the green areas on such estates without maximising their efficiency or ability to provide for the youngsters who must live there.  Developers give the local authority the worst land in the estate, situated in the most awkward place possible, and nothing can be done to turn it into a facility that is usable, presentable and of benefit to the people living there.  I ask the Minister of State, through his offices and those of the mover of the motion, to ensure something is done in this regard.  Thought and dedication must be put into ensuring green spaces are not located in the wrong places in estates and of no benefit to the young for whom they should be of major significance as regards the provision of user-friendly facilities as a buffer against anti-social behaviour.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this very important debate on young people.  I am delighted we have the opportunity to discuss issues regarding children and young people.  This is a very important debate and we are at a crossroads in our wider society as regards young people and in comparison to what their peers were like 20 years ago.Young people represent the future of the country and as such, are a major asset.  We need to listen to young people and develop and plan around what they require and need for the future.  I warmly welcome the magnificent efforts of Ms Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children, who has done great work, particularly in recent weeks, in serving the needs of young people and children.  She is playing a fantastic role as regards this issue.Looking at the wider debate, when she was consulting children over the last few weeks, it was possible to see what they thought about the wider society and what was going on in their minds.  For example, 31% of children prioritise family and care as their first option, 24% regard play and recreation as a very important issue and 16% say that having a voice is very important.  That is why today's debate is significant from the viewpoint of the Dáil reflecting the plea for children to have a voice, as indicated in that survey.  Also 16% of the children express an interest in health, wealth and material well-being, while some 12% regard education as a major issue.  The first priority is to zoom in and see what children need and require for the future.  As someone who worked in the primary education sector for more than 25 years, I have some experience as regards these issues and believe all schools, in particular primary and pre-school institutions, should ensure they are listening to children.  Much abuse and neglect can be caught if there is early intervention.  There are many listening and progressive schools in disadvantaged areas which can assist children at a very young age for the future, and also help those who are at risk.I raised these issues in my talks with the Taoiseach during the summer, particularly in my agreement with him.  I put the issues on the agenda, particularly as regards children with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This needs to be included in a broader debate.  When we talk about children, we need to ensure we are referring to all children, particularly those with disabilities as well as young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Over the next five years I am confident we will see a major investment in those areas and this is to be welcomed.  Anybody who says the opposite is not telling the truth to voters.  Major investments in the areas of disability, educational disadvantage and child care are planned for the next four or five years.  We must accept the issues I have raised as a reality.When discussing children, one must touch upon alcohol and drug abuse because one cannot accept a three year old or four year old child as normal in a home where there is cocaine abuse or excessive violence taking place.  Sadly, this is the case in some homes.  I totally reject the views of the smart-alec journalist who turned up on "The Late Late Show" and dismissed these facts in respect of cocaine.  Cocaine presents a serious problem and has led to major violence.  Drug feuds have resulted in many women becoming widows and young children being placed in very bad circumstances.  I challenge those in the media who believe it is a matter for oneself what one puts in one's body.  It is disgraceful for a person to spout such a message on a national television programme and I will not accept it in any way.  One should think of the widows of those massacred in cocaine-fuelled feuds.  That is the reality of Ireland in 2007 and I will not accept any oldguff from those who make assertions to the contrary.Twelve years ago, while I was working in my previous day job, I attended three funerals of past pupils within a ten-day period and all the deaths were drugs-related.  These are the issues with which we must deal and that is why this debate is very important.On a positive note, we must listen to young people in respect of sport.  Sport, regardless of whether it involves Gaelic games or soccer, is very important to one's development.  I commend my local club, St. Vincent's, for its excellent win in the Dublin county championship recently.  It is doing magnificent work for young people in Dublin North-Central and many other clubs are doing such work also.We must broaden the debate on sports for young people and assist them to become more involved in the arts and music.  I refer in particular to those who are not particularly talented at sport.  Exposure to the arts, including music, at an early age is very important.  In many disadvantaged schools, particularly on the north side of Dublin, there are excellent projects pertaining to the arts and music.  One can use the arts to assist children from dysfunctional or very violent families.  Some excellent projects in my area offer art therapy for children in such circumstances.  A trained artist and therapist work with the children from Monday to Friday and do substantial preventative work.  This is where we need to invest as investment in this area will deliver.  I am confident that in the coming years such services will be rolled out in the most needy areas.  Priority should always be accorded to the most disadvantaged in addition to children with disabilities in all sectors, irrespective of whether the disabilities are physical or intellectual.I welcome some of the positive developments of recent weeks, particularly in Dublin North-Central.  For example, an additional €108,000 was invested in north-side schools, and housing projects for the disabled have been launched in Coolock.  The Greendale school is being planned and staff are being recruited to provide services for autistic children.  Educational services in the Marino area have been improved and, as the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey will know, the Donnycarney Community & Youth Centre is doing an excellent job for the people of Donnycarney.  It is a beautiful centre that needs to be supported and developed.  Some €850,000 was allocated to the beautiful day centre of the Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf.  In the past ten days, €88,000 has been provided for ICT grants for 18 Dublin North-Central schools.  These measures comprise part of the development of services for young people.I recognise the many difficulties and challenges that face young people today.  We need to address the issues of alcohol and drugs, promote good nutrition and healthier lifestyles and combat obesity.  We must also develop sports facilities and address issues pertaining to youth work and youth justice.  Young people are the future and we need to invest in them.I urge more investment in services for young people and all adults should listen to and pay more attention to them.  Then and only then will we have a bright future for all our children.

The Minister of State responsible for youth work, Deputy Seán Haughey, should note that I introduced the Youth Services Bill in 1990.  There is a total lack of joined-up thinking.  I wonder how many times the Ministers of State who were present this afternoon have met to ensure an integrated, cross-departmental approach to youth services.  There are programmes emanating from each of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, and Health and Children, and there is major confusion among some youth organisations as to the source of their funding.  There is a major need for joined-up thinking.  The Youth Services Bill 1990 recommended this approach specifically but, unfortunately, as it was a Private Members' Bill, it was not considered, despite the fact that it received very good support from the Government benches.  We are still talking about having joined-up thinking and a cross-departmental approachto youth services, but they have not yet materialised.The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brendan Smith, outlined how young people now have a voice.  It is great that young people participate in organisations such as Dáil na nÓg, Comhairle na nÓg, local youth fora and students' fora, but in some ways these are as exclusive as this House.  In no way do they represent the rank and file of young people.  They are a great idea but if we are really serious about including young people, we should allow them to become involved in local partnerships, such as local area partnerships, county enterprise boards and county development boards.  We have the opportunity to do so but are not availing of it.Considering that I represent a generally rural constituency, I note that services for young people in rural areas are non-existent in most of the country.  Nobody seems to care or bother to address this problem.  While there are good and effective programmes such as the Garda diversion programme in urban areas, which programmes are linked to the RAPID areas, large rural regions have none.  In north Kerry, for example, there is just one youth worker.On the issue of Teenspace, the national social and recreational policy of the Department of Health and Children recommends what we all, including Deputy Finian McGrath, know already.  It is something of a cliché to state there is less crime if recreational facilities are provided for young people.  We all know this but we are not acting upon it.The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, should convey to his ministerial colleagues my view that the budget should ring-fence a specific fund for the development of youth cafés.  Young people, irrespective of whether they are surveyed locally or nationally, say they want them.  Perhaps if they get them, they will want something else but at this moment, they seem to be what is required.I have just mentioned the advantages of youth cafés.  They are alcohol-free and drug-free spaces that are properly supervised.  This is what young people need.  Hopefully, this point can be responded to but that is critical.It is easy to say this when one is in Opposition but despite this country's wealth, our Government and establishment have failed young people in many areas.  Orthodontic treatment is very important for young people for cosmetic reasons.  Young people are now very conscious of how they look and appear.  In Kerry, the HSE will only treat people who applied before 2 June 2002.  I am sure this is a microcosm of what is happening across the country.  If one has to pay for orthodontic treatment, one faces a wait of more than five years.  One can understand the damage that is done in the meantime.I am delighted that we have the opportunity to discuss youth service provision in this country.  As Deputy Shatter noted, it is a bit of an empty debate in one sense because we have in many ways abandoned and let down our youngpeople in so many different areas despite our wealth.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I take this opportunity to convey my sentiments on behalf of many young people in this country.  This debate smacks of the usual tokenism we afford our young people.  We are talking about young people but are not talking about doing anything for them.  We are not bringing forward any proposals.  We are giving ourselves a self-congratulatory slap on the back about ongoing work with young people, some of which I acknowledge.  However, it means nothing in terms of this motion and is a pure charade.According to the report released yesterday by the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, young people are not taken seriously and this debate is an example of this.  Although some young people in this country might know that a debate is taking place tonight, others do not.  I am sure there are very few people listening to  www.oireachtas.ie live on worldwide web.  If the Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Independent Deputies supporting this Government were serious about this debate and believed it had value, representative youth groups would be here.  If one looks around the Gallery, one can see that not even one group representing young people is here.  This smacks of tokenism and means nothing.We are engaged in filibustering when we could be doing something serious in terms of legislation.  Maybe we could have used this as an opportunity to look at the Youth Work Act 2001 to see where it is at, where it is going and what resources are needed and to evaluate the work, progress and proposals of people appointed to the various VECs.  That is what we should do in terms of using time valuably.  We talk about efficiency, value for money and cost efficiency.  This is a complete waste of time.  If every young person in this country knew this debate was happening, which they do not, it would qualify their thinking in terms of realising they are not being represented and nobody is listening to them.What we do on an annual basis in this House is talk about young people, scratch our heads, have a wee charade and pretend that we are representing them when we are not.  A very famous person in my parish came out with a very famous statement one night, one in which the Acting Chairman might be interested and which he might use again.  He maintained that when all is said and done, there is a hell of a lot more said than done.  This sums up what is going on this evening.The image of young people hanging around on street corners with nothing to do is no stereotype.  It is a reality which we must address.  As my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, noted in respect of youth cafés, we need facilities where young people can hang out with their peers in an environment that is supervised, not necessarily by adults but by youth workers.Let us roll out a proper programme where we employ full-time youth workers and a proper educational programme where we have proper degrees for youth and community workers in this country and let us be serious about where we are going with respect to young people.  Let us not kid ourselves about the good work that is ongoing.  A considerable amount of work is ongoing in different youth projects and there is no generic model for youth work.  Different models of youth work exist in Cork and the entire way up through Kerry — which is Deputy Deenihan's backyard — Clare, Mayo, Donegal and Dublin.  Different types of projects exist.  We should utilise the confidence of our young generation, have proper premises and supply them with proper telecommunications systems, including proper broadband and digital communications systems.  If we do this, we will be serious about youth work because tonight we are not serious about it.  The debate smacks of tokenism; nothing will be done and we are just making a mockery of the representation of young people here tonight.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this motion tonight and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I applaud the efforts he and other Ministers and Departments have made in respect of this issue.  I would not be as negative as the previous speaker, for whom I have great respect and with whom I served in the Seanad.  Deputy McHugh always used the opportunity there to set out the concerns of young people and was and is a great defender of young people's rights.  I am slightly disappointed by the negative stance he has taken tonight because he talks about filibustering and charade.  In fairness to him, he did an admirable job in adding to that charade.Notwithstanding that, it is most important for us to have regular and ongoing discussions in this House about youth and young people.  During the era in which I grew up, which is not totally different from the era in which Deputy McHugh grew up, the approach to children was that they should be seen and not heard.  Thankfully, this approach has changed in a very real way.  I suppose it has changed because of changes in the culture and society in which we live and because there is more assertiveness among young people.  There is greater interest among young people in taking a stake in society from a much younger age.  There is a great depth of understanding, knowledge and interest in taking a role in society among them.  As guardians and legislators, it is incumbent on us to recognise that and identify clear ways to involve young people in a real way in the decision-making process.I believe that a discussion in this House, regardless of whether the Gallery is packed with various interest or lobby groups, has the capacity to change the thinking of the Minister of State and his Cabinet colleagues who will, ultimately, be responsible for providing the funding and developing the strategies and mechanisms by which the concerns of young people are addressed.I was very taken by Deputy Finian McGrath's contribution where he talked about the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, and what she has done over the past number of weeks in respect of the big ballot.  Deputy Joe Carey and I were fortunate enough to be invited to a school in north Clare where we had an opportunity to discuss at first hand the concerns of young people as part of that big ballot.  Over and above the importance of the family, the importance of play and recreation was made very clear to us.  It is in discussions like this that we can bring about the kind of policies that will ensure the needs of young people are met in that regard.There has been a great movement in terms of the facilities that are available.  It is not that long ago since those who have just spoken were growing up.  There was certainly a great lack of facilities during this time.  The kind of investment that has been put in place through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Ceann Comhairle would have been very much to the fore of that during his tenure in that Department.  There is an old saying that one can take a horse to water but cannot make it drink.  In respect of sporting facilities, the Government has certainly provided the well from which children can drink.  One has only to travel around the country to see that, which is a very welcome development.  We should not rest on our laurels and believe that this is the only input we can make because we can make many others.  I agree with Deputy Deenihan regarding the establishment of Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle na nÓg.  While they are important, they apply to an elite group associated more with the debating societies than the real needs of young people.  The challenge for us is to continue to promote Dáil na nÓg and Comhairle nanÓg while identifying the needs of youngchildren.The establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister of State with responsibility for children in 2005 demonstrated the Government's commitment to addressing the issues facing young people.  The continued debate in this House and the effort to identify the needs of young people through that office is the mechanism for delivery of services.At the younger end of the scale there has been recognition of the importance of playgrounds.  Local authorities have received resources to address this, a welcome development.  Young people must be seen as stakeholders in society.  In doing that we must identify the root cause of their issues rather than dealing with symptoms.  Many of these debates refer to administering ASBOs and preventing young people from drinking too much, smoking and taking drugs.  We must look deeper and identify a set of policies with a greater level of participation.  Children are becoming active in society and flying the nest at an earlier stage.  We must educate them about life issues at an earlier stage and this is where we are falling down.  We treat nine to 12 year olds as young children even though they have advanced more than I did at the same age.  They have a greater understanding of what happens in society but do not have the pillars to protect them from the ravages of society.  We have examined the provision of play facilities for younger children.There was a time when we referred to providing facilities for teenagers but it is too late when they get to their teens and this should be examined for children aged nine to 13 years.  The health promotion unit at the Department of Health and Children is doing good work and is developing practices and procedures for dealing with young children.  Those areas include sexual health, mental health, suicide prevention, which is prevalent, alcohol and drug abuse andobesity.The latter is part of a changing culture.  When I went to school very few, if any, children suffered from obesity.  Diet was very different before the advent of fast food.  The advent of both parents working changed matters and children had a better and more balanced diet because of the better level of parental input.  We could examine our tax code in this respect.  Tax individualisation has created a greater acceptance of both parents working and has perhaps encouraged it.  I am not sure this is a policy we should push on parents.  We should reward those who make the sacrifice to remain at home to rear children in the formative years, allowing children the best opportunity and to develop to live and deal with difficult issues.The abuse of drugs and alcohol is putting our society off kilter.  It has the capacity to damage children irreparably.  We have heard of unruly children and perhaps we were a part of that group at one stage.  Children are at risk of losing their path in life through drug and alcohol abuse and this may prove difficult to regain.We need early intervention programmes for those at risk.  Society, and the Government through its agencies, must identify children at risk.  In many cases it is a parental issue, perhaps involving the grandparents.  There may be instability and a lack of understanding of how to resolve problems.  The State has a role in intervening.I agree with calls for greater funding for youth cafés.  Teenagers put forward this as a solution to the notion that they have nowhere to go.  This applies particularly to those not interested in playing hurling, football or camogie.  In mentioning these sports I should recognise the tremendous efforts of my club Tulla in advancing to the Munster club hurling final.  The club encourages young people to participate in sport.  Youth cafés are expensive because they are needed in areas of towns where property is expensive.  The drink and drug free environment allows them to congregate, or hang out as they now say, in an environment without the pressure to consume alcohol or drugs.I compliment the Government and the Ministers with responsibility for health, sport and justice for tabling a comprehensive motion.  While it is not overly expansive on projects under way, it clearly sets out a framework for the delivery of the services required to ensure our young people grow into mature adults in a changing environment.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I wish to share time with Deputy O'Mahony.  I thank Deputy Shatter for tabling the amendment and I call on the Government to submit a comprehensive action plan within one month to deal with the many difficulties and challenges faced by young people.  Society is awash with drugs and alcohol.  The rate of suicide among young people, particularly teenage boys, is increasing.  I demand young people receive education on alcohol, drugs, relationships and sexual health awareness.  I call for widespread availability of sports facilities and youth clubs, as other speakers have outlined.Young people from the age of ten years are using drink and drugs freely.  The situation must be addressed urgently.  Early intervention is needed to cover adolescence and early adulthood.  I commend the work of the health promotion unit, which provides informative leaflets on alcohol, drugs, relationships and healthy eating.  Schools can access the leaflets freely and they are useful for teenagers.In secondary schools, students have access to one class of social, personal and health education.  Topics such as alcohol, drugs and relationships should be addressed in this class but, in reality, not enough time is devoted to these subjects.  Demand exists from disciplines such as career guidance.  Career guidance teachers wish to use this time to advise students on future careers, which is also important.  Teachers providing advice do not have the experience or the confidence to deliver information on these topics.  An outside body could provide people to deliver these social, personal and health education classes, which are important for our young people.Facilities for our young people are badly needed.  In Dublin North-East, people are fighting an uphill battle for facilities and battling developers who look to take over every green space in the city.  However, developers are not willing to provide facilities.  We have a major problem with communities expanding where there is a great demand for youth facilities because of the number of young people.Non-profit organisations are also working to serve our communities, although they are forced to pay huge rates to rent rooms in premises because the requisite facilities are not available to them.  Community groups in Dublin North-East have contacted my office to inform me that they cannot afford to pay fees or rent and cannot find rooms big enough to serve the needs of their members.  The sports and leisure centre in Portmarnock is in serious danger of closing if badly needed funding is not provided.  I am campaigning for this funding to be provided because if the club closes, young people will suffer as a result of losing access to badly needed facilities.  The latter would not be good for their future development.Another organisation in Kilbarrack, which is located in my constituency, is campaigning to build a new community centre for the youth of the area.  The proposed centre will include a youth café which will provide an urgently needed facility for young people.  I commend the work carried out to date by the residents association in Kilbarrack and the Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme, KCCP, which provides assistance and courses for recovering drug addicts.  I wish those involved well as they pursue their campaign for a new community centre.Young people must be encouraged to reach their full potential.  A comprehensive psychological service needs to be put in place in schools.  I will only briefly mention the need for additional psychologists because this week's Private Members' motion tabled by Fine Gael relates to the inadequacies of the psychological service in secondary schools.  If one examines the NEPS budget for next year, it is apparent that what is proposed represents a cut of 6%.  That is not a welcome development.  I spoke to many school principals and guidance counsellors in Dublin North-East who informed me that huge numbers of children were on waiting lists.  The provision of two psychological assessments per year per school is not adequate.  How many children has the Government failed?There is an urgent need for a suicide prevention scheme because suicide rates are increasing on a daily basis.  We must devote time to educating young people in schools in respect of this issue.  In government my party would introduce a youth mental health initiative aimed at teachers and other adults who have frequent contact with young people; introduce a suicide prevention strategy, the fundamental aim of which would be to prevent suicide and self-harm and reduce the level of suicide in the general population; increase the budget to the National Office for Suicide Prevention to €10 million per year, which would rise to €20 million by year five; and provide a comprehensive package for all primary and secondary schools, which would include mental health programmes and comprehensive counselling services.I am seeking the provision of further sports facilities and youth cafés in my constituency and throughout the country, as they are badly needed.  Large-scale developments should not be allowed to proceed, unless proper facilities are put in place for young people.  The latter must be looked after because they are the future of the country.  Catering for their needs will reduce anti-social behaviour, a plague upon old and young people alike.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on young people.  Like previous speakers, I am somewhat puzzled as to the effect it will have.  Deputy Dooley stated those of us on this side of the House should not be overly negative.  I will try to respect his wishes.  However, I would like to give those on the Government benches a few opportunities to reduce the negativity coming from this side.I am completely in favour of consulting, engaging with and supporting young people at all times.  There is a danger, however, that as they watch these proceedings later in the evening, they may wish to know what action will follow.  We should focus more on action, the provision of facilities and the delivery of services.  Consultation is pointless if action does not follow.Deputy Terence Flanagan referred to children with special needs.  If young people listened to the Minister for Education and Science's contribution to Private Members' business as it related to the NEPS, perhaps they might be willing to give their views on being refused the help they require.I refer to a further example of young people and their parents being deprived of services for which they are crying out.  Applied behaviour analysis, ABA, is the scientifically proven method of treating autistic children.  A total of 12 schools have been approved for funding in respect of this method.  I congratulate the Government in this regard.  However, a further 12 schools submitted applications which, to date, have been turned down.  I am familiar with one of these schools which is located in County Mayo and desperate to set up an ABA facility.  It has collected €100,000 in the past nine months from fund-raising efforts alone.  The Government has spent millions of euro on court cases in which it was obliged to defend itself for not providing some of the services to which particular children are entitled.I would love Ministers to have heard the impassioned plea of one of the parents of an autistic child at one of the school's meetings in recent months.  It would have brought tears to a glass eye.  The father was paying tribute to his wife for looking after their autistic son.  He referred to it being a life sentence on her because she was obliged to care for the boy 24 hours a day.  The parents at the school were informed that if psychological assessments relating to their children were carried out, the position would be considered.  They had them carried out on a private basis because it would have taken two years for this to happen under the normal system.  The assessments were sent to the relevant Department but, as yet, no acknowledgement has been received in respect of them.  Those involved in the project to which I refer might have something to contribute to this debate regarding the way in which their young people are being treated.I could speak for hours about the importance of providing facilities for young people in towns and villages.  This issue keeps arising when one engages with, talks to or consults young people.  Many voluntary organisations are doing a fantastic job but they must continue to receive the support and funding they require.  Again, I congratulate the Government in respect of the funding it is providing.  I could also refer to the facilities provided in schools but which are not available after 5 p.m.  However, I do not have time to do so.Organisations such as the No Name Club should benefit from positive discrimination when it comes to funding for premises.  This should particularly be the case on foot of the great work they do in promoting a positive outlook and a healthy, responsible lifestyle.Young people who live on the fringes must be frustrated at the way they are treated.  I am aware of a group of young people who could be described as boy racers.  These individuals recently approached some adult leaders and requested assistance in respect of establishing an organisation for their members.  They want to be seen to be acting in a responsible way and to complete a driving course that will assist them in obtaining cheaper insurance and becoming better drivers.  They approached the Garda and received its support and are now working with members of the force and building a sense of trust with all members of their community.  The name of the group, Ballyhaunis Automaniacs, might sound contradictory but I am aware of the great work its members are doing.  We need more work of this nature and greater support for it.I support the Fine Gael amendment to the motion, which is seeking a plan of action and a timeframe for delivery.  As well as consultation, we should also be seeking action.

The motion is particularly appropriate, given that the General Assembly of the European Youth Parliament met in this Chamber on Friday and Saturday last.As a parent, an uncle and a public representative, I meet young people who are friendly, articulate and very knowledgeable on a daily basis.  They are not slow to point out that we have an enormous responsibility to ensure the legacy of our time here as public representatives will be that we hand down to them a society that is at least no more damaged than that which we inherited.How we go about this is the crucial question.  Like other TDs, I refer back to my constituency of Cork South-West to gauge matters.  The conclusion I came to on this is that in many ways we have left down our young people.  Opportunities in education which were not available to previous generations have opened many doors for young people and as a society we should be rightly proud of this.  However, many do not achieve their educational potential and we must continue to work to improve their situation.We must ensure the schools they attend are worthy of modern Ireland and have the facilities to cater for life in Ireland today.  It is right to commend the Minister for Education and Science on her ongoing commitment to pupils and schools.  While she accepts we still have a distance to travel in this regard, what we need to tackle are facilities outside the educational setting.  We must invest more in our young people by making available extra funding for youth cafés, youth clubs, sports facilities, swimming pools, cinemas and other leisure activities if we are not to be judged harshly by those who come after us.In Cork South-West, which is a large constituency geographically, the major towns of Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Bantry and Castletownbere and the large hinterland have only two cinemas and one public swimming pool between them.  The battle continues to find a room or a building which will allow young people to have a place to meet or organise their youth clubs or activities.Young people walk around the streets aimlessly because they have no place to go and little to do.  Their problem is that they have few positive activities in which to get involved.  This in turn makes them easy prey for those who seek to sell drugs, alcohol or get them involved in various forms of anti-social behaviour.  One does not need to be on the streets of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or other major cities for this to happen.We hear a great deal about young drivers.  They are mentioned every time we pick up a newspaper, listen to the radio or watch television.  Thought should be given to expanding the driving tuition done by schools in transition year.  Time and energy must be devoted to helping young people gain proficient driving skills if they so wish.  Serious thought must be given to making funding available for practical sessions of driving tuition in designated spaces.  These spaces could be provided by local authorities and driving tuition carried out by qualified driving instructors.  Students who complete the course should be acknowledged, perhaps with cheaper insurance or a fast-tracked driving test.During recent years, we ensured our senior citizens benefited from our increased prosperity.  We must give young people the same priority.  I am aware of the funds available for youth projects throughout the country.  However, I urge the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, to consider increasing the moneys available for young people.  We must not forget those who come after us and do our best for young people.  I am delighted to speak on this motion.  I hope the outcome of this debate will be of benefit to future generations.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	278	This is an important debate.  I am sorry to hear Members state we should not have it, particularly in the week when the Ceann Comhairle welcomed the President, Mary McAleese, and young people to the Dáil Chamber last Friday and Saturday.  I heard reference to the empty Gallery and it is not the first time we have had this.  I am glad my young son, Niall, on his own volition, came to hear the debate.  At least somebody is watching me.I often state that I bring my life experience to politics and I feel confident about this debate.  Apart from the youth work I did when I was quite young I was also involved in the Community Games organisations which I heard mentioned previously.  I was the Dublin and national PRO for ten years.  My last real job was as communications director with the National Youth Federation.  I was also nominated by the then Government to be involved with Gaisce when former President Hillery was in office.  I was the first chairman of the County Dublin youth committee.  I am competent to deal with this matter.Many people mentioned various matters and my colleague mentioned almost every town in Cork.  I could mention almost every street in Tallaght but I will resist.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country with an extremely young population.  It is estimated that 25,000 young people in Tallaght are still in school and this poses particular challenges.  It is important that I discuss the need for more resources and facilities.  I am not afraid to speak with young people and the positive message I hear from them is that Tallaght has experienced major progress in recent years.The economy has been buoyant in recent years and many colleagues make the point that it has been difficult for community and youth groups to find volunteers.  Despite this, the National Youth Council stated that so far this year, 8,000 people have sought Garda vetting to join youth services as volunteers.  This is a positive sign and an upward trend.  As somebody who worked in youth services, I was always impressed by the relationship between paid staff and volunteers.  It has always been an easy relationship and I am glad this is the case.Since 1982, Foróige has had a presence in Tallaght through the Tallaght youth service and much progress has been made in this regard.  We now have ten Foróige groups throughout the constituency.  I understand the Tallaght youth forum conducted a consultation process with young people.  Matters raised by young people as part of that process and with me and other TDs include the need for more information on racism and discrimination.  They are also anxious to know about alternatives to drugs and alcohol and they are concerned about security in the area.  They are also concerned about their relationship with local gardaí and this is an important point.  Young people want to be listened to and they want us to respond as opposed to listen and do nothing.  Public representatives have a role to play in this regard and we should reach out.I wish to pay tribute to the MC Teens group in Tallaght west which last week won a Foróige youth citizenship award.  Its project was to examine the concerns of the local community with regard to Tallaght Hospital.  This is a good example of young people responding to community needs as they see them.We must continue to understand the need for facilities and resources.  The other side is that we must invest money in Garda diversion projects.  While it is money well spent, we should be more positive.  The more positive youth work we have the less reliance we will have on Garda diversion projects.  With regard to what Deputy Finian McGrath stated, I had a happy healthy childhood and we should aspire to everyone having the same.

It is staged by the Government as a time-filler because it has not got its act together and it has no legislation to process today.  This is the sum total of the entire matter.  We were presented by this generalised motion last Friday and asked to come back by 10.30 a.m. on Monday with any amendments.  The motion is hardly meritorious of amendment because it is of little consequence or substance.  It is an invitation for statements rather than real debate.  The Fine Gael amendment is essentially a different motion but it is worthy of support because it at least calls on the Government to come up with a plan of action.  I will be supporting it for that reason alone.Even with such a generalised subject matter, the Government has still managed to make a hash of the motion.  Instead of setting out a rounded and comprehensive view of the place of young people in Ireland, it chose to focus on problems and feed into stereotypes.  We were presented with a list of problems such as alcohol related harm, drug misuse and obesity, as if these were the exclusive preserve of young people.  They do not only affect young people and certainly do not affect all of them.  Alcohol abuse is endemic in Irish society.  We have a culture which sees alcohol as part of the coming of age of young people.  This is ruthlessly exploited by drugs manufacturers through advertising and the portrayal of drink as an essential element of a modern lifestyle.  The blame should be put on the elders, where it firmly belongs.  Those involved in the drinks industry and the Government who refuse to combat this glamorisation of alcohol or restrict advertising must bear much of the responsibility for the growing abuse of alcohol among young people.A recent study has indicated that social differentiation between boys and girls is on the increase.  The gap between genders is widening at a young age because of the exposure of children to relentless commercial pressures through advertising.  Advertisers target mass audiences of boys and girls and the wider the diversity, the greater the number of products that can be pushed on young and impressionable minds.  This has links with the sexualisation of young children which has damaging consequences.  Children and young people are constantly presented with images of so-called perfect people whom they are encouraged to emulate.  They face increasing pressure to conform to such images, with widespread implications for issues such as bullying and eating disorders.  These are real issues for young people.  Our ruthlessly commercialised society is robbing children of their childhood.We should be debating the rights of children rather than the problems they confront if we really want to do some good.  Their first is the right to a childhood.  It was pleasant to hear one of the previous contributors describe a happy childhood but such should be the right of every child.  Unfortunately, that is not the case for many children in Ireland.  They have the right to be regarded as people rather than the most lucrative of consumers, which is the reality they often face.  They have the right to the best possible care and an education which allows them to reach their full potential.  It is an indictment of us all that the aforementioned rights are curtailed for many children in Ireland.  I do not level the accusation only at the Government because there is collective responsibility.Our child care infrastructure is inadequate to cater for the needs of children and their parents.  The Government's mishandling of the community child care subvention scheme illustrates the flawed approach to child care in the State.  The inadequate provisions for children with special needs are another example of rights denied.  The lack of proper planning means that vast housing estates are being developed without provision for schools and other amenities for young people.  Further problems are thereby being stored up for the future.The Government motion makes much of the importance of consulting young people on matters of public policy which affect them.  It welcomes the growth of this practice among public bodies in the development of facilities and services for young people.  However, the reality is far from the picture presented in the motion.  Improvements may have been made in consulting some young people but the vast majority are ignored.  No substantial consultation is taking place.  They are not considered a party to the determination of what is to be done in their interest.  This must change and, if the motion is to have any meaning, there must be a resolute commitment on the part of the Government to translate it into practice.On Monday I spoke at an engagement with Cavan County Council attended by my constituency colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith.  Scouting Ireland's Castle Saunderson project on the Cavan-Fermanagh border exemplifies the importance of taking imaginative and far-seeing initiatives that can impact on the lives of young people.  Sadly, its ambitions have not been thus far realisable.  A number of years ago I worked with colleagues to arrange a meeting attended by representatives of all the scouting organisations on the island.  This unique occasion, held in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, was facilitated by Sinn Féin.  The Castle Saunderson project would have established a facility that could have been enjoyed by some 60,000 young Irish boys and girls who would have had the opportunity to participate in healthy pursuits and learn from others from a variety of backgrounds and with disparate opinions and experiences.  Years later, however, we are trying to argue for a contracted version of the original proposal and there is still not a sufficient commitment throughout the island, either in terms of governance or independent funding support, to ensure this project's realisation.  It needs a Minister at Cabinet to properly champion it and put the interests of such a large number of young people first.  I urge that this be taken on board to ensure this wonderful idea is realised.  I commend it to the Ministers concerned and thank the Ceann Comhairle for his patience.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I wish to share time with Deputy Chris Andrews.I do not intend to malign young people.  On the contrary, society and elected Members must understand the pressures and anxieties young people experience and try to alleviate them through effective local and national policies.  It is an important job of Government and public representatives to make and implement policies about young people on their behalf and in their best interests.  Young people have never been so privileged or had so much, materially at least.  However, in too many cases material success has been accompanied by pressure to succeed, depression and alcohol or drug problems.  Thankfully, the number of registered suicides has declined in recent years.  However, it is a matter of concern that more than one quarter of all deaths by suicide occur among young males aged in their 20s.  The recent national campaign encouraging people to talk about their mental health is a step in the right direction in removing the stigma many men have about openly discussing their feelings.Some 45 child and adolescent mental health teams are in place.  The mental health strategy, A Vision for Change, requires the recruitment of 40 additional child adolescent mental health teams.  This will be a difficult challenge.  I do not want anyone to die on our roads and the Road Safety Authority's current campaign on carnage on our roads is important.  However, the number of people who die each year as a result of self-harm is almost as high as the number who die on our roads, yet it generates minimal comment.Although all urgent cases of depression are seen immediately, the waiting list for treatment remains too long.  The young lives of many of those languishing on waiting lists are on hold and in many cases those involved do not share the experiences of their peers, whether in terms of socialising with friends, playing sport after school or generally enjoying their childhood and adolescence.  Good work is being carried out by the young social innovators programme on a social awareness education and action programme for 15 to 18 year olds.  More than 5,000 people participated in the annual programme, with a showcase event of more than 200 projects, many of which relate to mental health promotion and-or suicide prevention.The link between physical exercise and good mental health has long been established.  It is vital for young people's mental and physical well-being that they have an opportunity to engage in sport and other recreational activities.  In this digital age, many young people spend their time texting friends or communicating with others on Bebo, Myspace or other Internet chat rooms.  This activity appears to have replaced traditional methods of socialising, such as playing a game of football after school.  Last week, PlayStation launched hurling and Gaelic football games.  However, like all good Tipperary men, I prefer live action to playing sport on a video game.  To this end, we must ensure young people have the resources and facilities they need to play sport.  The value and importance of being a member of a club or team cannot be underestimated.  It teaches young people responsibility, social skills and the importance of teamwork and fair play, values which cannot be gleaned from PlayStation.Last July, a youth programme in Fethard in my constituency was discontinued, despite the community having invested a great deal of work in establishing the project, which employed a youth care worker.  Unfortunately, as in many other areas, funding for the project was discontinued.  Investment in our youth, particularly in programmes of this nature, is vital if we are to keep young people on the right track, show them attractive options and ensure they do not follow the wrong path.All young people are citizens in their own right and it is vital the Government recognises their concerns and encourages their participation when it implements legislation of concern to young people.  Many youth bodies and forums allow young people to become involved in their communities.  As the nation's leaders, we should encourage young people to participate in local communities and at national level.  We should continue to encourage the use of the National Youth Council of Ireland as a framework for involvement.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for sharing time.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue.  It is safe to point out that we were all young once, even if some people got older quicker.  In recent years, Fianna Fáil-led Governments have placed great emphasis on the role of young people in society, as evidenced in the establishment of the first Ombudsman for Children in 2004 and the Office of the Minister for Children in 2005 as well as the development and implementation of the national children's strategy.  That a motion on young people is being discussed in the House is testament to the priority the Government attaches to the issue.One cannot deny that we have experienced major economic and sociological changes.  The society in which my two young daughters are growing up differs greatly from that in which I grew up.  Although it offers many more opportunities, it also presents greater challenges.  On a recent international flight I encountered a team of young Irish basketball players travelling to Hungary.  At 15 or 16 years of age, my peers and I were fortunate to travel to County Kerry.  While it is good that young people have greater opportunities and more freedom, they also face greater dangers and must shoulder much more responsibility.  Helping them to cope with this sense of responsibility is the biggest challenge we face.Society will always face challenges.  Deputies referred to issues such as obesity, bullying, drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse and mental health problems.  I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Jimmy Devins, to continue to take a proactive approach in the area of mental health.  I am particularly concerned with the difficulties we are experiencing in addressing eating disorders, which affect young people most.  All Members have a responsibility to raise awareness of this problem and strive to address it.Sexual health is another problem, as is the need to address the effects of technology such as the Internet and mobile telephones.  While these can have positive impacts in terms of education, for example, the use of search engines such as Google, they can also have negative impacts, as is evident in the phenomenon of cyber-bullying.One of the best ways to deal with many of the challenges facing young people is through physical activity and sports promotion.  Being involved in sport helps young people to be physically and mentally healthy, while being on a team gives them a sense of belonging.  It makes a big difference to take part in sport and be part of a team.  They flower through the activity and relax and enjoy themselves.  I know the Minister of State was hugely supportive of sport in his previous role.  This must continue.  Investment in sport is an investment in society and health.  We must ensure we continue to develop sports facilities to meet the ever increasing need for them.The biggest consultation of children, which took place through a ballot organised by the Ombudsman for Children, found that family and care emerged as the most important issues for them.  Society may have changed in some ways since I was a child, but the importance of family and care remains central to both young people and society.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I am glad we are discussing issues relating to young people, but I question the value of general statements on such a broad topic, as they do not challenge the Government to do something on the issues raised.  In this debate we have statements on alcohol related harm, the prevention of drug misuse, combating obesity, promoting healthier lifestyles, the provision of sports facilities, mental health awareness, sexual health awareness, youth work, youth justice and so on.  We could have a three or four hour debate on any one of those issues.It is out of concern that we call on the Government to set targets that will challenge us to try to find solutions to many of the problems and difficulties for young people.  It is for that reason that Fine Gael has tabled an amendment to the motion.  Our amendment is raised in a proactive manner to point out clearly that we are not happy just to chat here about issues that affect young people.  We want the Government to set ambitious targets and will support achieving those targets in areas of real concern.I wish to concentrate on two specific issues that affect young people.  The first concerns a matter currently prominent in the media, namely, drug abuse.  The headline in the Evening Echo in Cork today reads: “Cork heroin seizures are up by 250%”.  The chief superintendent in Cork has said needles are now being found on the streets of Cork city.  While heroin has been a problem in Cork for a number of years, people were, predominantly, smoking it.  Now, however, they are starting to inject it.Is it not time we admitted that most of the objectives of the national drugs strategy entitled, Building on Experience, which began in 2001 have failed?  There has been some positive progress in terms of treatment and we have some fantastic people working in organisations and schemes funded under the strategy.  However, the overall measure of the strategy should be whether more or fewer people are using illegal, harmful drugs than in 2001.  The fact is that more people have a drugs problem now than last year when the number had increased on that for the previous year and so on back to the start of the strategy.Cocaine and heroin which were predominantly a Dublin problem when the national drugs strategy began are now a national problem.  I attended the launch of the strategy when there was much genuine interest and support for what the Government was trying to do.  We were promised we would have an annual review of the strategy, but that has not happened.  We do not have performance indicators to demonstrate whether it is working because the news would be too bad if we did.We need to take a more scientific approach towards what we are trying to achieve and how we will get there.  Funding treatment programmes is important and we must ensure they are available for everyone who seeks help for an addiction problem, regardless of age, but that is not enough.  On the issue of drug abuse, we must target areas, whether it is in prisons, schools, universities or among homeless people on the streets.  The reality is that the Government is failing in its responsibility to combat drug misuse and addiction.  Reports in the media, reliable and unreliable, have reminded us of this in recent weeks.  In this regard, the supplement to the Irish Examiner yesterday made gruesome reading.Community courts are a proactive way of looking in a new way at anti-social behaviour.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this concept which was outlined in detail in a recent National Crime Council report.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion.  We have had statements from the Government, but there has not been much action proposed, which shows us how out of touch it is with regard to what is happening to young people.  I heard Mr. Fergus Finlay speak recently on RTE about a report produced by Barnardos on young children.  He mentioned that most young children now had a television set in their bedroom and spent more time in front of the television than they did talking to their parents.  That is not good for children or family life.Parents are under more pressure today, as they must work harder than before.  They spend more time in their cars commuting and have less time to spend with their families because of the pressure.  This affects children and society.  The Government should consider how it can help such parents, particularly women who must go out to work.  We should provide more flexible working conditions in order that they can spend more time at home with their children.The greatest evil in terms of the harm it does in the home and society is drink.  We are always afraid to condemn drinking because we are afraid of the vested interests, the publicans and drinks companies, which are a powerful lobby group.  I have said this previously, but will repeat it now.  Sports organisations should not accept sponsorship from drinks companies or promote them by displaying their names or advertisements at sports events.  There is enough grant aid from the Government and enough support from the public to make it unnecessary for sports organisations to accept money from drinks companies.  Drink has the country destroyed.  It has been destroying it since the foundation of the State, but the situation is even worse now.Drugs, the new phenomenon, are even more dangerous than drink.  At least, we know the effect drink has on people.  It affects the person drinking, families and family life.  However, with drugs we find that people are out of their heads on the streets.  As a result, there is a new type of violence.  We talk about the national drugs strategy, on which I will have more to say in the debate next week, but I cannot understand how such quantities of drugs are being brought into the country, considering how we were able to track down those who had been operating offshore accounts for over 20 years.  Drugs are being brought in daily.  The Garda knows who the crime bosses are and the wealth they are earning from their businesses, but we have not targeted these criminals in the we should.When Nora Owen was Minister for Justice there was a serious problem in regard to crime.  We saw what happened in regard to the journalist who was murdered and we responded.  We dealt with criminals.  It is time a task force was set up and that criminals who are bringing in drugs and selling them to young people were targeted.  Why do we let them away with it?  Why is CAB not used to deal with these people?  The problem is evident in all our communities.  People who never worked a day in their life are driving around in BMWs, have the best of houses and some draw social welfare.  Why are these people not targeted?  Why are they not being looked at?  Why do they not show the taxman where they are creating their wealth?  They ruin children, society and the county and nothing is done about it.The same applies to the drinks industry, which we are afraid to take on.  We are afraid to take on the vested interests but it has to be done.The Government has a job to do in getting more people involved in sport and in the community.  In my town of Westport, for the past 30 years a young Independent councillor, Martin Keane, takes a group of young people every Saturday and Sunday and does great work for the voluntary sector.  People like him are not honoured enough.  He does not ask for anything, all he wants is that the young people are kept busy and out of trouble.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	291	There have been welcome developments in mental health in Ireland in recent years with the launch of A Vision for Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy in January 2006, the launch of Reach Out, a national strategy for action on suicide prevention and the full implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 from 1 November 2006.The Government is firmly committed to the further development of mental health services.  The current level of expenditure in this area has trebled since 1997 and this year approximately €1 billion will be spent on mental health services, which includes an additional €51 million allocated since 2006 for the development of services in line with A Vision for Change and the implementation of the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.Many factors affect the mental health of young people.  While the changes which have taken place in society in recent years have brought considerable benefits to individuals and the community, social problems continue to exist which affect young people and their families.  The vast majority of young people do not develop mental health problems but at any time approximately 2% will require specialist mental health expertise.  These young people experience distress in emotional, behavioural or relationship problems that can hinder learning and social development.  We are all aware of the pressures on young people such as bullying, emotional distress, addiction, peer pressure and exam pressure.  The stresses and pressures associated with everyday life combine in many cases with difficulties in coping with significant life events, such as bereavement and interpersonal relationship problems.The promotion of positive mental health along with early detection of mental illness is key to the personal development of our young people.  The publication of the two important strategy documents, Reach Out, a national strategy for action on suicide prevention, published in 2005, and Protect Life, a strategy for Northern Ireland, published in 2006, are testament to the determination to address these areas on an all-island basis.  Both strategies set out milestones, ranging from general approaches, intended to approve awareness and education to specific plans for specifically targeted at risk groups.The establishment in 2005 of the National Office for Suicide Prevention provides a centre for developing and progressing suicide prevention policies.  In light of the information available around suicide and self harm, it has been agreed with the national office that an interim target for a 10% reduction in suicide will be achieved by 2010.  In addition, a target of a 5% reduction in repeated self harm will be achieved by 2010 and a further 5% by 2016.Since 2006, significant additional funding of €3 million has been provided which brings total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to more than €8 million.  This funding is being used to develop and implement national training programmes, complete the availability of self-harm services through accident and emergency departments, implement recommendations arising from a review of the bereavement services and support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.The overall Irish rate of suicide is below the EU average and is the seventh lowest of the 27 OECD countries.  Of particular concern in Ireland, as elsewhere, is the high rate of deaths by suicide among young adults.  Based on current official statistics, Ireland has the fifth highest rate of youth suicide in Europe with men under 35 years accounting for approximately 40% of all Irish suicides.  Deliberate self-harm is also a significant problem with more than 11,000 cases presenting to accident and emergency departments each year.  Reducing suicide rates requires a collective concerted effort from all groups in society, health, social services, other professionals, communities and community leaders, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations, parents, friends, neighbours and individuals.  It also requires the careful nurturing of a culture in which people, particularly the young, in psychological distress will not hesitate to seek help from family or friends, a culture that is willing to help and that focuses early in life on developing good coping skills and avoiding harmful practices.In October 2007 I had the pleasure of launching the National Office on Suicide Prevention's mental health awareness campaign.  The main aim of the campaign is to influence public attitudes to mental health.  The campaign is specifically designed to change negative attitudes and to promote positive attitudes to mental health.  This campaign involves television and radio advertisements and an information booklet is available through the HSE information line.I assure the House that the Government is committed to the provision of quality care in the area of mental health and to encouraging all measures aimed at preventing the further tragic loss of life.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Given that much discussion has taken place on the provision of sports facilities it would be remiss of me not to congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on what he did for young people across the country in his time as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.This debate can lead on to a huge range of issues for young people.  However, there are three or four specific issues with which I wish to deal.  Clubs and organisations throughout the country have done much voluntary work to provide facilities for young people.  Having been at the coalface for the past ten years in trying to ensure funding was delivered to these clubs and organisations I have seen a huge amount of work being done on a voluntary basis.  I pay tribute to them and thank them for the time and effort they have put in to running youth facilities, clubs and organisations on behalf of various bodies.The issue of suicide particularly among young people is major.  We all know people and families who have been affected by suicide and its aftermath.  The devastation affects not only for the families but the wider community and friends.  There are many "what ifs" in its wake.  I have been speaking with people who have been directly affected and it has a huge and devastating effect.  Much good work is being done on suicide prevention and the rationale and understanding of the whole issue.  I encourage the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to ensure funding is made available from his Department because it is a serious issue.  There should be a wider debate across the country on the issue of suicide.Many speakers have mentioned the participation of young people in schools.  There is much emphasis in favour of sport and sporting recreation within schools but sport also encourages young people to participate in society.  On any occasion we discussed CSP classes, I have noted that the most important aim is to get young people to understand their society.  They should become involved and try to effect change, and take ownership of their community or neighbourhood.  It is only by beginning this framework in schools that progress will be made.I wish to refer to the issue of young people with disabilities.  Organisations such as St. Joseph's Foundation in Charleville do excellent work for people with intellectual disabilities.  Those who work in such organisations should be commended in this House and elsewhere and we should support them in any way we can.Many Members referred to the difficulty in getting youth clubs off the ground in communities.  In the main, a committee will establish a youth club but it will then fall by the wayside.  It is an ongoing and difficult process to ensure these youth clubs continue in operation in both rural and urban areas.In the short time available to me, it is difficult to deal with all the areas I want to.  The issue of suicide, facilities for young people and issues arising for people with physical and intellectual disabilities should be considered.

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I am pleased to speak on the motion.  Earlier this year, I attended the launch of a report, Where Do you Go When You Go Out — Young People's Thoughts and Views on Promoting Youth Friendly Facilities in East Cork.  It was a longitudinal project where transition year students in all the schools in the area plus youth clubs and organisations were involved in a consultation process over a prolonged period.  The project began in 2004 and was three years in the making, with the report being launched this year.  It involved in-depth quantitative and qualitative research which sought the views, needs and hopes of young people on society and youth facilities in the area.  East Cork Area Development and the HSE worked together with youth organisations and visited young people to compile the report.A common priority clearly emerged at the beginning of consultations, namely, the need for a place where young people, mainly early teenagers, could meet and participate in a range of activities.  The report highlights the reality, to which many Members made reference, that there are few social outlets and recreational facilities available to young people in many parts of the country.  In the words of young people themselves, they want a place to go with their friends to have fun where they will not get kicked out.  Throughout the country there are many State buildings and facilities lying idle that could, with a little imagination and flexibility, be used for youth work purposes.  This could be done almost immediately and at little cost if the will existed.It is not surprising young people are unhappy with the facilities available to them.  While the Youth Work Act was passed six years ago in 2001, much of it has not been fully implemented, as is the case with the national youth work development plan.  Progress is very slow.  In response to a question I tabled earlier this year, the Minister for Education and Science stated many sections of the Youth Work Act have not yet been commenced.  At the time of the passing of the Act, in which I was involved, the VECs were to be involved through sections 8 and 12, the youth work development plans were to be put together, the assessor of youth work was to be appointed, youth work committees and voluntary youth councils were to be established and so on.  It was exciting, innovative and agreed by all sides but progress has been very slow.An impetus and sense of urgency is needed to get the process moving.  I accept work is ongoing in a number of areas of the youth work development plan and there is a national youth work development unit in Maynooth, which is welcome, but more speed is required.  It is no wonder young people are disillusioned when they feel their needs are being ignored.  Many are disheartened at the lack of action in the area of youth facilities.All Ministers should read the report Where Do you Go When You Go Out.  It is obvious there is a huge need, not just in the area covered by the report but throughout the country.  In the compilation of the report, groups of children from each school in the area came together and were questioned about the adequacy of youth facilities.  Only 5% were satisfied whereas 79% said facilities were not adequate.  The report contained the following quotes from the young people questioned:‘No!  There are no recreational facilities at all for young people in this area.  People that live here get so bored because there is nothing to do ever!!'‘No!  Young people have nowhere to go or nothing to do so they turn to underage drinking.'‘No, because most young people hang in the same spot and usually get into trouble because of boredom.  They also get depressed because of no facilities and end up in a lot of danger like vandalism, getting drunk or dealing with drugs.'‘No, because if there was, less people would be going drinking in bushes every weekend thinking that it does not get much better than this.'‘No.  There is no proper youth centre or anything.  Everywhere we go we get told to move.'‘No, the guards and the council are constantly giving out about the amount of underage drinking but realistically there is not much else to do.'‘No, I'm either too young or too old for any facilities around here.  There are facilities for children i.e. primary school children but none for teenagers.'So it continues.  The young people themselves recognise the problems and the needs.  They have asked for facilities but none is forthcoming.The report makes a number of worthwhile recommendations, including a call to meet the needs of young people for recreational facilities such as youth cafés in all towns, as well as other outlets such as swimming pools and cinemas.  Youth cafés in particular would provide young people with a safe, warm place to go but action is needed at local and national level to achieve this.  Professional youth workers are needed on the ground.  I could continue but the same message has come from all colleagues during the debate.

I am not sure the motion does anything other than put on record a series of statements as to our aspirations in this area.  That may be a good thing in some ways but it does not go far enough.  I support the amendment put down by Deputy Alan Shatter of Fine Gael.I wish to discuss what is really happening with regard to young people nowadays.  How many challenges face them in the high street on a daily basis?  For example, there is the threat and challenge of alternative activities, including the use of drugs, to which reference was made by other speakers.  The problem is that if a young person has nothing else to do and no place to go, he or she will automatically be propelled into the areas where the drug vultures operate.  It is a multi-million euro business.  These people are living onshore and offshore, constantly promoting their goods and wares.  They sell to vulnerable people and have operatives well placed in the community to press their case effectively.Society must compete.  It must provide alternatives for young people to move towards, which they will.  Cynics will suggest that if facilities were available, young people would not use them.  That is not an excuse.  If facilities are not available, we cannot blame young people for not using them.  Having been young once myself——

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	298	It is a while ago.  Having been young once myself and having reared teenagers, I know one comes to a stage in one's life where one begins to learn it all, or at least one has gone through first and second stage.I pay particular tribute to the Naas youth services section in my constituency, which has done tremendous work, as the Acting Chairman will know.  For the past 20 years it has provided facilities for young people which compete with those who have destruction in mind for the young.  The degree to which we can expand such services to areas where the population is burgeoning is crucial.  It must happen because if not we will lose the next battle.  We should recall what young people have been subjected to both at primary and second level, having had to attend classes in prefabricated buildings.  That provides us with an indication of how we consider ourselves.  If they manage to survive schooling they will be qualified, but if they do not have a trade and are unqualified they will be vulnerable and may fall by the wayside.  This is before we consider the issues of child care, children's health and all the other pressures currently facing society.Over the years, as public representatives, we have dealt with child psychiatric services many times.  As we speak, in the constituency of Kildare North those services are poor due to a lack of investment, personnel, upgrading or any facility to deal with queries as they arise.  People complain afterwards when tragedies occur and ask why nothing was done, so we must invest in these services that are required by young people now.  We must act for the future because we need such services.  If we do not start somewhere we will not succeed.  Departments are involved in providing grant aid for various facilities but we need to accentuate that programme.  We should examine areas of rapid population expansion and recognise that more investment is required there.  We must respond to voluntary agencies that are already providing services and are utilising grant aid well, but we must add more.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Having listened to earlier contributors, I note that while many of us in the House are not that young we have much experience in dealing with young people directly through our families and having made our way into politics through our involvement with youth organisations.  In my case, I would never have been a Member of this House had I not been introduced to politics through youth clubs.  Even though that era has long passed for me, we still have hands-on experience of youth matters as public representatives.  That is relevant to many of the contributions in this debate.  Things have changed enormously since I was a teenager, and for the better.  Before you took the Chair, sir, it was occupied by the Ceann Comhairle, a former Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  He had a particular responsibility for sports, an area in which we have witnessed major changes.  That should be recognised and I am sure the previous speaker would acknowledge that is the case.  When I was growing up and playing football there were no changing facilities.  We changed on the side of the road, in the back of a car or in the ditch.  Deputy Durkan is smiling so I am sure he agrees that was so.  Nowadays, however, such conditions are unacceptable.  Society has changed because resources have been invested in the sporting sector.  Over the last decade we have seen significant changes in that regard.It has been acknowledged for some time that we need to change the direction of available resources.  We have put resources into a wide range of sporting activities, which is good up to a point.  Those who are participating in sports are doing well.  Studies indicate that young girls or boys involved in soccer, Gaelic games or other sporting activities are less likely to become involved in anti-social behaviour.  There is a cohort of young people, however, who do not engage in sporting activities for one reason or another.  The primary reason is not that they are unfit or unhealthy, but that they are not competitive enough.  By its nature sporting activity is competitive so in future we should also invest in youth activities that are not necessarily based on sporting competitiveness.  In that context, I wish specifically to mention youth cafés.  A couple of months ago I was invited to the opening of the Ronanstown youth café, which is both interesting and well run.  I spoke to the teenagers who were there and said I would bring back my son for a longer discussion.  Those who attended the café were really enjoying it.  Subsequently I met with those involved in establishing the youth café who were from the VEC and other organisations.  They told me about the difficulties involved.  If a soccer or GAA club wants to build a dressing room for local children, it must go through a recognised structure or procedure.  However, if one wants to establish a youth café in Maynooth——

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	301	——Cavan, Clondalkin or Lucan we do not have a simple application procedure, which is the case with soccer or GAA clubs.  In the past decade, the resources we have invested in young people have been targeted at sporting activities, with which I do not disagree.  We have made huge inroads investing in such activities for young people but in the coming decade we should examine other recreational and social activities in which teenagers want to get involved.  We do not have a simplified structure to provide such facilities, however.  The Ronanstown youth café was established through the VEC, South Dublin County Council and others.  If it is appropriate for soccer, GAA and rugby clubs to provide dressing rooms for children, the social role model is of equal significance.  We should put in place a simplified programme whereby one organisation — be it based in Clondalkin, Lucan, Tallaght or elsewhere — can roll out such facilities.  No such programme currently exists, however, so we should examine that matter.While we have discussed many issues regarding young people, it has come to my attention that Irish obesity levels are not the EU norm but rather on a par with the US.  That is partly because of our economic growth and the consequent wealth and affluence that we have never seen before.  In addition, it has happened so quickly that people were unprepared for it.  If children are involved in sporting activities it is easy to look after them.An initiative undertaken by South Dublin County Council will provide a children's activity club on the site of the old swimming pool in Clondalkin which was decommissioned because we have a new swimming pool.  The old pool is being filled in to allow the county council to provide that fitness club facility for children.  It is an activity club for young children who are not competitive by nature.  It will not be like playing Gaelic football, soccer, rugby or any other sport.  The establishment of such a centre recognises that some children are suffering from higher obesity levels than we have hitherto seen.  In rolling out initiatives such as youth cafés and fitness clubs, we need to be aware of the changing nature of society.  While acknowledging what we have done in the past, it is insufficient simply to repeat that in the future.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  A number of themes have emerged, particularly the need for consultation with young people and increased participation by them in sports and other recreational activities.  Deputy Curran referred to the proposal to develop youth cafés throughout the State.  I was informed by him previously about the very positive and progressive programme run in Ronanstown in his constituency, which includes a youth café.  I launched the national recreation policy last September, as part of which youth cafés will be rolled out throughout the country.  A youth café is generally a relaxed meeting space for young people, which is safe, friendly, inclusive, tolerant and free of set rules.  Young people from all backgrounds can engage in social interaction with their peers in a safe, drug free environment.  Deputy Curran has validly pointed out that sports clubs work within specific parameters and, thankfully, in the past few years most of them have drawn down substantial funding through the sports capital programme.  The GAA is the organisation with which I am most familiar.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Wall, served as chairman of the Kildare County Board for a number of years.  We are all aware of the outstanding work done by the GAA and other sports and voluntary organisations.  However, Deputy Curran is correct that a framework is needed for the development of youth cafés.Since September departmental officials have surveyed existing youth cafés to establish vision, objectives, structures, governance, funding, staffing, accessibility and overall usage.  I have also requested the national children's advisory council's support in the production of a toolkit and guide to setting up a youth café.  Consideration is being given to how best to develop a coherent, structured programme for the development of youth cafés, as well as the most appropriate lead agency for the management and administration of a funding scheme.  I am anxious to develop that proposal because some cafés such as those in Letterkenny, Waterford, Galway and Naas are organised and funded through Foróige and the local vocational education committee.  The Health Service Executive has also been active in supporting projects but a formal flexible structure is required within which people will have set parameters to work.I thank all Deputies for their contributions to the debate and wide-ranging views on issues that impact on young people.  During the debate we have heard details of the difficulties and challenges faced by young people.  However, we should not underestimate their resilience or the many positive aspects of young people's lives.  I reaffirm the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of initiatives to support young people in their journey towards adulthood.In my opening contribution I outlined in detail the Government's commitment to support the national children's strategy which sets out a series of key objectives to guide policy in respect of issues affecting children and young people over its implementation period.  In particular, I emphasised how the actions of my office supported the achievement of the strategy's national goals in giving young people a voice in matters that affected them, in supporting research in order that their lives would be better understood and in providing quality supports and services.  In the fora I attended at which young people put forward ideas, I was heartened by their enthusiasm and participation.  Comhairle na nÓg and Dáil na nÓg must be better publicised among a larger cohort of young people, an issue the Department has addressed.  Representatives of both bodies have engaged with the national media, through which it is hoped they will contribute articles.  One or two journalists have offered assistance to them in drafting appropriate articles in order that they can get their views across and highlight the structures in place for them to be heard.We are all keenly aware of the necessity of ensuring the views of young people are heard, their contribution to society is valued and their role as citizens fully recognised.  The national children's strategy supported by the Government and its agencies leads the way in fully recognising the value of young people and in preparing them for adulthood.  The ten-year framework social partnership agreement 2006-15 fully recognises the importance of children and young people and sets out a framework within which key social challenges that impact on them can be addressed.  Provision has been made for the establishment of a national children's strategy implementation group chaired by the Office of the Minister for Children and comprising representatives of key Departments, agencies and organisations involved in the provision of services for children and young people.  One of the main functions of the group is to promote the establishment of committees at local level to drive forward and oversee implementation of policies that will impact on young people.  The group will also provide leadership and support in the implementation of integrated services and interventions for young people.  Its work is ongoing and will positively influence developments and initiatives that impact on young people, including the development of a second ten-year national children's strategy for the period 2011 and beyond.Young people identified the development of youth cafés in their areas during consultations with them on the development of a national recreation policy.  I reiterate the Government's commitment in the programme for Government to the structured development of youth cafés, the establishment of which was identified by young people as their single greatest need during the consultations relating to the drafting of the national recreation policy, Teenspace, which recognises that youth cafés offer great potential for providing a wide range of developmental, educational and information programmes for young people.  However, their development requires a cross-departmental and inter-agency collaborative approach.  The launch of the national recreation policy last September provided the strategic impetus for the development of that approach and the delivery of youth cafés countrywide.A small survey of 20 of the existing youth cafés has been undertaken by my office to establish their vision, objectives, structure, governance, funding, staffing, accessibility and overall usage.  In addition, I formally requested the national children's advisory council's support in the production of a toolkit and guide to setting up youth cafés.  Both of these processes will support the development of a coherent, structured programme for youth cafés which will be rolled out next year.The promotion of positive recreational opportunities, as enunciated in the national recreation policy, can make an important contribution to young people's development and help to counteract the risks and harm associated with sedentary lifestyles.  The World Health Organisation recognises the importance of leisure time activities for young people which can foster the adoption of other healthy behaviour, including the avoidance of tobacco, alcohol, drugs and aggression.  In addition, aspects of young people's leisure time activities have given rise to social concerns in recent years.  These include, for example, binge drinking, illicit drug use, juvenile crime and youth suicide.  The national recreation policy will not in itself solve these problems.  However, when combined with the policies and preventive interventions implemented by the Government, many of which have been mentioned, this policy could help minimise the risk of young people engaging in criminal or anti-social behaviour and avoid negative outcomes for their well-being in adolescence and adulthood.Many issues relating to young people have been raised.  We have amply demonstrated the ongoing and critical work being progressed across Departments to comprehensively address the issues that impact on their welfare and well-being.  The Government is fully conscious of the needs of young people and committed to ensuring they are met through the series of measures outlined during the debate.  I appreciate the varied and valuable contributions of all Members.A recent Barnardos survey and a recent poll taken by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children points us in certain directions, namely, that young people need to be listened to.  They have identified their priorities.  It is up to us in government and as legislators to deal with the issues that the young people have identified.  In the short time I have been in the Office of the Minister for Children those of us there are determined to ensure that we expand on the consultation process and the dialogue we already have in place with that age group.I commend the motion to the House.

I condemn the Government's amendment in that it is totally misleading and untrue to state "all schools have access to psychological assessments for their students."  The very fact that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul had to pay for 1,000 private assessments for children last year is adequate proof that this bald statement is misleading and therefore the Minister cannot expect us to believe it.Today's newspapers refer to the case of a youth of 16 whose parents are concerned about his strong suicidal tendencies.  He is falling between two stools in that he cannot avail of child psychological services because he is too old and cannot avail of adult services because he is too young.  This is bizarre and the needs of the child should be taken into consideration.  Sufficient flexibility should exist to allow this to happen.I have previously asked the Minister about the special school in the Phoenix Park and have tabled another question thereon.  The school did not open in September because it did not have four teachers.  Articles in the newspapers indicate that some of the students are receiving no schooling or the special educational supports they require so badly.  We clearly do not have an adequate psychological service.This is a question of human rights in the first instance.  It is not only the case that the rights of the child are not being vindicated but they are also being infringed upon.  The Government, including the Minister, has failed the children of this nation in that respect.  It has failed to staff and resource NEPS, leaving the most vulnerable children, namely, those with special needs, without the intervention and supports necessary for them to develop and continue to benefit from their education.  Consequently, the lives and career prospects of many children are destroyed.  Further problems develop during the course of their childhood, often leading to disruptive behaviour, early school leaving, drug abuse and self-harm, sometimes resulting in suicide.The importance of early intervention cannot be overstated.  The Government has appointed just seven additional psychologists to NEPS this year despite a firm commitment from the Minister to appoint an additional 31.  The psychological service is in decline in many schools.  Where schools lose their disadvantaged status, they also lose access to the NEPS programme, as happened ten post-primary schools this year.  The picture painted by teachers and those at the coalface is altogether different from that painted by the Minister.  An ASTI survey in 2006 found that 89% of schools have students with special needs.  These students have not been formally assessed but were considered by the teaching staff as having such needs.  Some 74% of principals are reporting unacceptable delays in obtaining assessments and 42% stated it took an average of three months, or more, to secure an appointment with NEPS.  Some 35% of principals reported a two-month delay.The Minister's claim that schools can have access to private assessments raises two issues.  First, the number is strictly limited to 2% and therefore a school of 400 pupils with ten or 15 pupils in need of assistance must exclude a considerable number rather than ensure that all children at risk have access to an assessment.  In this case, it is the children who suffer.  No amount of bluster from the Minister will change the fact that the Government has failed to vindicate the rights of children.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I thank Deputy Brian Hayes and his Fine Gael colleagues for tabling this motion.  The debate is fundamentally about providing each child in the State with the best opportunity to reach his or her full potential and it is also about the ongoing daily anguish and frustration faced by parents who want help for their children.  It is a question of how we define the price of a child's education and development and of whether we provide resources early or pay the cost later.  This price is not just measurable in financial terms but also in terms of the great personal cost to those who need help now, and their families.In recent years, the field of educational psychology has been broadened by individuals such as Professor Howard Gardner of Harvard University.  Learning styles, for example, have been worked upon and it is unfortunate that great new educational concepts cannot be employed because of the difficulties in this area.  We have arrived at the view that every child in the State should have full educational opportunities and we must ask ourselves why the most basic requirement of the Department of Education and Science, namely, to assess children with special needs, cannot be met as soon as possible and why an individual education plan cannot be prepared for them.When NEPS was first established in 1999, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Micheál Martin, promised the service would have 200 psychologists within five years.  Clearly a commitment was broken, thus providing another example of a Government that actually lives in the moment.Last evening, the Minister stated she attempted to keep her own election promise by making funds available for 33 extra child psychologists this year.  The net increase is likely to be 16, at best, by the end of the year.  When the Minister ran for election, she knew the recruitment difficulties that existed and when she was making her promise she should have known the circumstances that would now obtain.  It is clear that approximately half of our primary schools have no service and Ireland has the lowest pupil-psychologist ratio in the European Union.  Sadly, one must ask whether this explains why 23 school-going children died from suicide last year.Regardless of Ireland's financial prospects, it has enjoyed unprecedented wealth in recent years and we have heard Ministers say it was awash with money.  It is incomprehensible why people were going to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in recent years so that they could have assessments carried out.  Eight years after the setting up of NEPS, the service has yet to reach a staffing target of 184 psychologists.  The Minister stated she is on target to achieve a complement of 134 psychologists, but since 1999 the complexities of education have grown exponentially and student numbers have increased.  New students are arriving from other states and the problem, as defined in 1999, has changed radically.This debate is fundamentally about providing each child with the best opportunities to reach his or her full potential.  Every day parents face the anguish associated with trying to have their child assessed.  Children may require an assessment at two or three years but by the time they are five, when they should be assessed and in a school with an education plan, their parents are forced to run from school to school asking what is the best option in the absence of the information they require.  There is a price being paid while we are having this debate.  When the children in question are adults, we will be making funds available to make up the cost that should be met now.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I will share time with Deputy M. J. Nolan.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on psychological services.  The special needs provision in our schools have seen significant investment in recent years and as a former teacher and special needs director, I am acutely aware of the importance of improving the services we provide.It is with this in mind that I highlight the ground-breaking approach adopted by the HSE in the Kildare — west Wicklow area in providing support to children with special needs attending mainstream primary schools.  The Kildare west Wicklow school support team, as it is known, provides support for children with a primary intellectual disability or a specific learning difficulty who are attending mainstream schools in the catchment area and who meet the criteria for this service.  It is effectively an interdisciplinary approach for assessing the needs of children with intellectual disability and drawing up a programme for these children in conjunction with the children themselves, their parents, teachers and support staff.The team at present includes a psychologist, senior occupational therapist and a speech and language therapist.  The team has prioritised the senior end of the primary schools and schools with bigger numbers of children requiring the service.  These children were known to the HSE but were not receiving services.Parents, school staff, GPs and a range of other health professionals can refer a child to the Kildare west Wicklow support team for assessment.  The model of service provided by the HSE to schools is agreed in advance and involves the team carrying out a block of visits into each school to work with the children in their school environment.  The assessment process varies greatly for individual children which, in my view, reflects the quality of the assessment.  Where standardised assessments have proved valuable for a few children, for others the most useful information has come from observation of the child and-or discussion with staff, parents and child.  The aim of the support team is to enable children to access the curriculum and participate in school activities to their full potential.Programmes addressing the specific needs identified in the assessment are put in place for use by staff in schools.  Training is provided to teachers and support staff to assist with the intervention process, which helps in targeting the specific needs of each child.  Typical support programmes which have been implemented include speech and language programmes; strategies regarding management of behaviour in the classroom, playground, physical education halls etc; strategies to help children who have high activity levels or poor concentration; and programmes to develop motor planning and co-ordination skills.  Where necessary, follow-up visits to schools have been carried out to review progress and update programmes, as required.The main advantage of this model of service is that the team gets a greater understanding of how the child functions in the "real" world, as opposed to assessing a child in a "clinic" setting.  The approach also looks at the child as a whole, not just a set of difficulties, and can identify a child's strengths, which can be used to work on weaker areas.  This approach also supports close communication between all of the professionals involved in the child's life and the child's family.  It also increases the potential for working together and sharing of skills between all those involved.School staff are very enthusiastic and positive about working with the support team and see this approach as a mechanism for improving their own skills and providing a better service to children with special needs.  School staff are very committed to meeting the needs of children with special needs in their classes, are very open to using new approaches with these children and are very keen for guidance in their work.  I have also received extremely positive feedback from parents who have interacted with the support teams.  Everyone has gained from the sharing of skills and experience.  I recognise the work of all those involved.  In particular, the dedication of the disability manager for the HSE in the Kildare — west Wicklow area must be recognised.  She has pre-empted the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and spearheaded this initiative, thereby giving us a model that hopefully will be rolled out throughout the country.As we continue to incrementally improve our services and policies in the whole area of special needs, I want to make the case for increased resources to be provided for this school-based approach for our special needs children.  I look forward to the appointment of another occupational and speech therapist to this team in the new year so that we will eventually have a team in each SENO area.  I would like to highlight to the Department of Education and Science the importance of having the physical space for this programme included in all school extensions and new schools.  In addition to increased resources, we also need to ensure we improve the cohesion between all the agencies involved in the area of special needs.  This would lead to a more effective, needs-based, inclusive and co-ordinated service for our children.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	308	At the outset, I should put on record the extraordinary changes that have been made in the education system and compliment the Minister and previous Ministers for their commitment to education at every level — primary, secondary and third level.  What we have seen over the past ten years is very heartening, particularly in the area of special needs.  Huge investment has been made in identifying the shortfall for special needs pupils and rectifying it.  Those involved in education will say they are heartened by the commitment of this Minister to continuing that programme.  In the context of the upcoming budget, I hope the Minister for Finance will again be generous in looking after the Department of Education and Science.I know the delivery of services in the health and education sectors to people with disabilities and special educational needs is a priority of the Government and I wish to see it continue.  Since 1998, this Government has continued to provide funding for pupils with special needs.  The number of staff working solely in the area of special education has grown enormously in that period.  There are 6,000 primary school teachers working directly with children with special needs, compared with 1,500 in 1998.  That in itself shows the commitment.One of the concerns I have, with which I hope the Minister can deal, relates to a case in my constituency where a child starting school in September was waiting to be assessed for a special needs assistant.  No assessment could take place because the individual who was to assess that school was on maternity leave.  I ask the Minister to look at that area to ensure that if somebody is on maternity or other form of leave and a service is not being provided because of it, replacements can be brought in either the private sector or another area and funding can be provided.  In her statement last night, the Minister talked about private assessments but I would welcome it if she could examine that area so that where individuals are on leave for whatever reason, private assessments can take place.  It is almost Christmas and I know that in this particular case, the individual will not be back until closer to Christmas and there is a three-month period lost.Schools have access to psychological assessment for their pupils.  Those schools that are not yet directly served by NEPS psychologists can have the assessment carried out by private psychologists and NEPS will pay for it.  I ask the Minister to look at that particular area.One of the major successes in our education policy has been supporting marginalised families through the home school community liaison scheme.  The work these teachers do is incredible.  I suppose it is under the radar and many of us do not see it but we get anecdotal evidence of marginalised families who, for one reason or another, have not been part of the mainstream education system and whose attendance record at schools has not been great over the years.  Incredible improvements have been seen when teachers go out and make the effort to interact with those families.  I know of a number of families in Carlow who have been brought into the system and the results have been astonishing.  Individual pupils who did not go to secondary school are now doing so and doing their junior and leaving certificate.  I know of some cases where such pupils have gone on to third level education.  If one looked at them ten years ago and said that members of the community would go on to secondary school, let alone third level education, one would not be believed.I commend the Minister on her work, wish her continued success and ask her to look at one or two small areas where we need to provide a service and insure it continues.

I acknowledge the contribution made by Deputy Dan Neville, who impresses us greatly with his work on suicide prevention.  I have taken an interest in it in recent times.  I was a member of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Health and Children that dealt with the issue last year.The national strategy for action on suicide prevention, Reach Out, sets out its intent to "plan, develop and implement an effective service response appropriate to the need in each area, such as liaison psychiatric nurse services in all accident and emergency departments for responding to those who present following DSH or who are acutely suicidal".  The office for suicide prevention is anxious that by the end of the year each accident and emergency unit has at least one specialist member of staff to follow up with those who present at hospitals having self-harmed.  In this case I pursued the issue and found out that in Dublin specialist nurses are in place in St. James's Hospital, Connolly Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown.  In St. Vincent's Hospital the response to self-harm presentations is made through the psychiatric liaison team.  I regret that Tallaght hospital has not made such an appointment and I am supported by many colleagues in calling for it.  I have taken an interest in this matter in recent times, assisting those who feel strongly about it.I pay tribute to a local organisation, Teenline Ireland, based in St. Dominic's Centre in Tallaght and founded by Ms Maureen Bolger following the sad death of her son a few years ago.  The organisation does tremendous work and points out that young people should contact it if anxious, lonely, vulnerable, depressed or suicidal.  The organisation has a drop-in centre in Tallaght — I am sorry for speaking only about Tallaght.  The centre also has a board with memorials, correspondence and cards from families of young people throughout the country.  Most of this debate will focus on education but we must pay attention, as Deputy Devins did, to the need for more resources for suicide prevention among young people.  I hope the Minister will pay attention.  I called for more resources for educational projects at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last night.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	316	As an educator in my former life, I welcome the improvement and investment in education in recent years, particularly in special education.  Those with special educational needs receive increased support, enabling them to be the best they can be in a positive learning environment.  For too long they struggled, became disaffected with school and chose the easy option of dropping out of school.  I commend the Minister for her clear commitment to those with special educational needs.  This was enhanced by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, under which each child is entitled to an educational assessment and an individual education plan.  I welcome the consultation process that enables parents to have a partnership role as stakeholders in the education of their children.The allocation of resource teaching hours has been very beneficial and the children in need of assistance can access the support immediately.  Many with special educational needs do not need individual assessments to access additional support.  In 1998 there were 300 special needs assistants in our schools, today there are 8,200.  The special needs assistants provide students with valuable support necessary for them to cope with the complexities of life in school.NEPS did not exist until 1999 and since its foundation resources for staffing have increased.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to fill the vacancies.  As a teacher, I compliment the NEPS psychologists who provide invaluable advice to teachers and, in particular, in making recommendations for students who seek reasonable accommodation in the leaving certificate examination so that they can achieve their potential.  Some 2,800 sought reasonable accommodation in the State examinations last year.Unfortunately, youth suicide is a reality.  Our schools have a major role to play.  Over the past few years, schools have developed critical incident policies although hopefully many will never need to act on them.  It is important to be ready.  Equally, a healthy mental attitude should be nurtured and fostered by schools.  Our pupils need to leave school with high self-esteem and coping skills.Students must learn complex skills and values.  The transition from primary to secondary school is difficult but support is in place to ease the stress on the student.  I am an advocate of the SPHE programme, which enables students to verbalise concerns and problems in a non-threatening environment.  Students in primary schools learn from an early age that a problem shared is a problem halved.  They quickly learn the benefit of not internalising troubles as they develop skills to discuss problems in age appropriate language.  For too long we lived with the notion that children should be seen and not heard but we have moved on.  We have many positive mental health programmes in schools.  In transition year we ran the Mind Yourself programme, assisting in the development of a positive mental attitude.For many school children, school is the one place in which they have a routine and feel safe.  As a practitioner at the coalface, I have witnessed this at first hand.  In many cases students look forward to the listening ear of a caring, considerate, compassionate teacher who makes time for the student.  The increased support for teachers, such as guidance councillors, class tutors, year heads, home-school liaison officers and chaplains, assists in ensuring problems are identified quickly and concerns are referred to the HSE without delay.  This ensures the necessary wheels are put in motion to assist the student and the family.Our society has changed in the past 15 years and our schools must be equipped to help students to cope.  I will work to build on the significant improvements made for all our children, in particular those with special educational needs.  Our schools and society are becoming more inclusive in respect of these children and we are seeking, at all times, to recognise the individuality of all students, particularly in the context of the special people they are.

I genuinely believe that the motion is devoid of any real substance and it fails to recognise the very significant advances the Government has made in the area of special education during the past seven or eight years.The motion refers to NEPS.  As the previous speaker stated, the latter was established during the lifetime of the previous Administration led by Fianna Fáil.  It is easy to sit on the opposite side of the House and nit-pick and cherry-pick about things that may or may not have been delivered.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The Deputy should sit and listen.  My point is that the Government introduced and delivered on NEPS.  It is never the case that programmes are introduced which do not encounter hitches and glitches.  We devised and introduced NEPS.The motion refers specifically to NEPS and assessment.  There is no point carrying out assessments if resources are not delivered simultaneously in respect of special needs assistants, SNAs, and school supports.  Last week, the Minister for Education and Science replied to parliamentary questions from Deputy Quinn in respect of average class sizes and pupil-teacher ratios.  I do not know whether the Deputy was trying to play dumb but he made no attempt to recognise that there is a difference between the two.  While average class sizes may not have been reduced in the way people may have wished, the primary reason for this was that the pupil-teacher ratio has fallen.  The latter came about because we appointed a significant number of additional resource teachers and SNAs.  During the Question Time to which I refer, Opposition Members stated that the latter do not count or are not significant.  Now they are suddenly most significant.If those children who are in mainstream education and who have special needs are not attended to by SNAs and resource teachers, it has an impact on their education and that of their classmates.  When we were in school, such resources were not available.  Members can refer to individuals with whom they went to school who should have had but who did not have that level of support available to them.  It is only during the past eight to ten years that Fianna Fáil-led Governments have delivered in that regard.The motion tabled by Deputy Brian Hayes and Fine Gael is mean-spirited because it refers only to assessment and not to the delivery of resources.  There are now 6,000 primary school teachers working daily with children who have special educational needs.  In 1998 less than a quarter of that number were employed in the system.  At post-primary level, almost 2,500 teachers work with these children.  More importantly, in 1998 there were only 300 SNAs in employment.  Now there are over 8,800.  The motion is, as already stated, mean-spirited and fails to recognise the very significant improvements that have been made in the delivery of services.  It primarily concentrates on——

From a policy point of view, this requires the Government and all its partners within the education system to develop a mixture of different educational responses appropriate to the needs of children in varying circumstances.In the past nine years, the ability of the education system to meet the requirements of children with special needs has greatly improved.  Since the Government took the decision in 1998 to provide an automatic response to children with special needs, investment in this area has multiplied.  In the current year alone, investment in special education will be over €820 million.  This represents an increase of over 30% on the amount allocated in the 2006 Estimates.There are now over 6,000 primary school teachers working directly with children with special needs, compared with just 1,500 in 1998.  The number of special needs assistants has increased from 300 to over 8,800 since that date.  In addition, there has also been a substantial increase — from 200 in 1998 to 2,450 at present — in the number of whole-time equivalent teachers who support second level students with special needs.The establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the decision to place special educational needs organisers in local areas means that for the first time parents and teachers have local support to help them obtain the appropriate responses for their children.  The roll-out of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act will see further improvements in services for children with special needs.  The Act provides for educational assessment for children with special needs and gives them an entitlement to an individual educational plan.  It also gives parents recourse to an independent appeals body that will have the power to compel organisations such as the HSE to take specific actions relating to children's requirements.One of the most important advances in recent years in providing an individually tailored educational response to children with special needs has been the provision of resource teachers to primary schools.  For the past two years, each school has been allocated resource teaching hours based on its enrolment numbers.  This is a significant improvement on the previous system of requiring children to undergo a psychological assessment before being allocated resource teaching hours.  The latter often caused long delays in providing children with the support they needed.  With resource teachers placed in schools, children can now access the support they need immediately.We have also seen a substantial investment in recent years in psychological assessments of schoolchildren.  In the past school year alone, the Department of Education and Science paid for over 10,000 individual psychological assessments to be carried out on schoolchildren.  A total of 5,800 were carried out in that period by the Department of Education and Science's NEPS psychologists.  In addition, the Department paid for a further 4,400 assessments to be carried out privately, at a cost of €1.5 million, through the scheme for commissioning private assessments.  I welcome the fact that although the number of NEPS psychologists has trebled since 1999, the Department is still committed to increasing that number from its current level of 134 to 200 by 2009.Another important development has been the increase in the number of speech and language therapy students.  Additional courses in speech and language therapy have been established in three universities, University College Cork, NUI Galway and the University of Limerick, with an initial uptake of 25 places on each course.  This represents an increase in training capacity from 25 to 105 speech and language therapy students.The availability of suitably qualified speech and language therapists is of great concern to many parents.  I wish to refer to an example from my constituency.  St. Patrick's special school in Enniscorthy is the only special education school for the entire county of Wexford.  St. Patrick's special school requires two full-time speech and language therapists.  However, the school receives an allocation of only seven sessions of speech and language therapy per week.  In a school of 133 students, this gives each student minimal exposure to speech and language therapy on a weekly basis.  While I recognise that nationally the amount of speech and language therapists employed in the public health service has increased substantially in the past ten years from 281 whole-time equivalents in 1997 to 648 in 2006, this area has the potential to benefit further when the new university speech and language graduates come into the health system.  I particularly hope that some of these new graduates will be allocated to St. Patrick's special school in Enniscorthy.I welcome the many developments which have taken place over the past number of years on the provision of educational services to children with special needs and I commend the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children for their commitments to this sector.  I hope both Ministers continue to prioritise special needs education.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	340	In 1999, when NEPS was established, undertakings were given by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, that within five years he would establish a programme of psychological assessment throughout the country.  NEPS aims were to develop a local and accessible psychological service at primary and second level following best practice in all cases.  If ever a situation highlighted a Government's failure this one does as eight years later the original estimate of 200 psychology professionals in the service has not been achieved by a long shot.We have 131 psychologists for the entire country.  However, as the Minister of State and the Minister, who has just left the Chamber, know, in counties such as Longford only 18% of students are covered by the service.  The figure for north Tipperary is 34%, for south Tipperary it is 26% and for Kilkenny it is 21%.  These statistics counter the argument made by the Government during this debate with regard to its success.Despite the fact that in January this year, prior to the election, the Minister stated 31 additional people would be appointed, only seven appointments have been made with one more promised for December.  How can we tell students in need of psychological assessment and their parents that this is a comprehensive service?  The responsibility is not only thrown at schools and parents but also at charities.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul pays for 20 assessments on a weekly basis.How can the Minister be proud of the service she delivers when she has failed miserably?  The reason she asked the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, to co-ordinate between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science is that she has seen her failure and is unable to attend to it.  She does not have the willingness and determination at Cabinet level to seek resources because she would be refused and told to make do with what she has and organise it properly.  She has failed to do so.Seeing the 842 people in County Galway who await speech and therapy services makes one realise how inadequate is the service.  The greater Dublin area has a reasonably good service.  The rest of the country falls far behind.  How can any Minister justify this in terms of access to a national scheme?We need an immediate increase in the number of NEPS psychologists.  However, they are not being trained and the Minister knows this.  A total of eight psychologists are trained here per year and they are asked to complete two additional years of post-graduate work.  The bar for appointments is set so high that we cannot get people to enter the service and adequately deliver it.The idea of having two separate Departments involved in the delivery of this service means people fall between two stools and lose out.  The Minister repeatedly referred to the importance of early intervention in the provision of these services.  However, she has failed to deliver any service at any stage.Recently, two people with two children returned from the United States to live in my constituency.  They had state-of-the-art services in the United States but came to a rural school in County Galway where one of the children was offered 15 minutes speech and language therapy per week.  When they requested more and offered to pay for it they were denied the opportunity to obtain it in that school.  They almost returned to the United States until a benefactor helped them access the service.  If only 43% of schools are covered the Minister must accept that she has failed.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	341	The Irish Constitution pledges that all children should be cherished equally.  It is obvious that our children are not treated equally.  Children are left behind in a system which militates against those most vulnerable.  Children in many of our schools suffer from behavioural difficulties such as depression, anxiety, conduct disorder, ADD, ADHD and multiple disorders.  Early intervention in the educational system is vital to assist those children most at risk.However, many children do not receive assistance because of the lack of psychologists.  Many schools restrict the number of private tests they authorise and as a result various support and charitable organisations fill the gap.  One of the support groups which provides much-needed assistance is the mid-west region's ADD support group.  It is the norm for the organisation to lend money to parents who cannot obtain help for their children.A child can wait for up to two years for an early assessment.  In some cases, children have left the education system without having received help.  This results in greater difficulties for these children later in life.  The mid-west ADD support group told me of a case involving a ten year old boy whose family could not afford to pay for private consultation.  He would have had to wait until he was in second year or third year in secondary school for help if the support group had not intervened.  The fact that a charitable organisation was forced to cover a shortfall in Department funding is an appalling indictment of the lack of care for our children and their parents.In April 2006, only 60 of the 120 primary schools, or 50%, in County Clare had access to NEPS.  The failure to provide 100% coverage for such essential services is scandalous.  Three psychologists operate from a base in Ennis and occasionally they are assisted by a psychologist from Galway.  They provide a first-class service to those children fortunate enough to access the system.  However, expecting 20 full-time psychologists to cover 138 primary schools and 55 post-primary schools is not good enough and extra resources are required.Since 1997, spending on mental health services has dropped from 11% to 7% of overall expenditure.  The development of our psychiatric services has been ignored for far too long.  During the past school year, 23 suicides by children were reported to NEPS.  We must increase our investment in helping children most at risk.The same is true with regard to speech therapy, which is provided by the HSE.  However, it should be provided directly through the education system.  It is regrettable that those at the coalface dealing with this problem, namely, teachers, are not involved in this service.  Recently, the experience of the mother of an eight year old boy was related to me.  She is anxious to obtain help for her son who has learning difficulties.  She is just one of the many parents and children throughout the country who are experiencing difficulties.  Following an assessment of the child at his local school, he was advised to apply for speech and language therapy and his name was added, at No. 200, to the waiting list for initial assessment.  It would be more than a year before he would be called, which is a disgrace.  In today's complex world, educational qualifications are critical and it is difficult for children to catch up later in life if they are left behind in their early days.The shortfall in the numbers of suitably trained psychologists for the educational service must be addressed.  Putting NEPS on a statutory basis and recognising it as an equal in the education system would be a start.  The Taoiseach has described the promised referendum on the rights of children as a watershed for Irish children.  The watershed should commence with a commitment to investing more resources in NEPS.

It is typical of Fianna Fáil Deputies to attack when they know they are wrong.  I do not understand how they can vote against this motion.The Government's educational programme has been backwards for the past ten years.  We build houses but we never seek to find out how many children will live in them.  It is a simple equation because 100 houses will contain a certain number of children.  The one statistic we have at the end of every year is the number of births in the preceding 12 months.  The Government must plan for the future.The people no longer accept the status quo of ten years ago when if things were not 100% perfect for one child in a household, he or she was left behind to close the gate after the cows.  They want full support for every one of their children.  It is unacceptable that Fianna Fáil is attacking us for tabling this motion because that party did not address the issue.  The Government knows the number of children in the country and that 190,000 are affected by these problems.  Promising everything before the general election and breaking the bad news afterwards is not the way to do business.Every household has a child who needs a bit of extra help.  The money should be spent at the beginning of each year when the Minister for Finance comes to the House with his budget.  The required €100 million should be provided up front for these children rather than for the children who will be all right.For the past ten years, repeated commitments were made to reduce class sizes to 22 students but this has not been progressed.  If children are given proper assessment at the age of three or four, their health bills will be reduced 20 years in the future, the problems on the streets will be less severe and fewer of them will leave school at an early age.  Great promises were made last March and April but all we are getting now is bad news.  The people will no longer accept simple stories.  We have the money and we want the best for our children.Several weeks ago in County Meath, Deputy Johnny Brady and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, laughed at me for criticising a project being imposed on the people of the county.  They said it would have to proceed but they changed their tune in front of 3,500 people in Trim three weeks later, when they said it is not Fianna Fáil policy to erect overground cables.I intended to speak about young people until Deputy Curran started ranting about our policies.  The people of Ireland will no longer accept false promises.  They realise the country has had an abundance of money over the past ten years but it was lost in our education system.  Schools are overcrowded.  Children who need special attention should be assessed at three or four years of age so that when they reach the age of ten or 12 they can take their place in normal life.  They can join the workforce later so we do not have to be dependent on people from other countries.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Unlike Deputy Curran, I sincerely thank Deputy Brian Hayes for introducing this motion.  Some 40% of primary schools in County Kerry lack this service.  I conducted a survey last year and discovered from the INTO that only 52% of schools in the county had the service.  Such a service is simply unacceptable.Schools are expected to generate two or more assessments per 100 pupils, depending on location.  Even where the service is provided, it is insufficient.  Assessments by educational psychologists are essential if primary schools are to be able to identify and meet children's special learning needs.  It is vital that special needs are identified early and learning programmes developed if the children are to reach their full potential.  Regular support from educational psychologists is crucial and it is necessary that NEPS psychologists are assigned to particular schools.As anybody involved in education would attest, further development work is needed because it is not merely a matter of writing a report and leaving it at that.  The commissioning scheme is not working at present because it only provides for reports.  A teacher informed me last week that many psychologists are less than enthusiastic about the scheme because the fee for assessments has not increased since its introduction.  Private psychologists have long waiting lists and they are not going to put somebody to the front if they receive less money for seeing that person.A fully staffed psychological service for schools is critical to ensure all children, regardless of family means, are assessed.  It is fundamentally wrong that some children are assessed because their parents can afford private care whereas those without the necessary means must do without or depend on charity.  Several Deputies noted that one of St. Vincent de Paul's most important services is supporting parents is having their children assessed, provided a psychologist is available.In the area of emotional health, a clinical psychiatrist rather than an educational psychologist is required to diagnose attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  However, the clinical psychiatry service is completely inadequate and has failed the youngsters of Ireland.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I concur with the comments made by my colleagues.  Speech and language waiting times can vary from several months to two years.  A small child in my area of Dublin North has been waiting nine months for this service.  The child's parents must wait and worry before they can find out whether the child has dyslexia, autism or Asperger's syndrome.  Schools are restricted in terms of the number of assessments they can receive each year depending on whether they are disadvantaged.  However, it does not make any difference if they are disadvantaged.  An estimated 10,800 children annually have special educational needs. The limited number of psychologists available are unable to cope with this number.  The motion is, therefore, timely.I echo Deputy McEntee's comments on earlier statements by the Government's spokesperson.  After one has clothed, fed and given a person shelter, the most important needs to be met in a civilised society are health and education.  Psychological assessment covers both these areas.  What happens to children with dyslexia who are not diagnosed before the age of seven years?  Their prospects for recovering from their disability diminish with each month.  It is harrowing for parents to find themselves wondering whether their child has autism when all the evidence points to the fact that early intervention leads to much improved outcomes.  Early intervention is much more advantageous to society and the State because the children in question will not require institutional long-term care and will be able to lead fuller lives in society.With speech and language therapy currently unavailable, people must avail of the private option.  I may have been misquoted earlier when I indicated the Society of St. Paul had spent €4 million.  The sum was spent on school transport.  The society has received 350 telephone calls from every corner of the country, including Galway, Limerick, Cork, Dublin and the midlands, from people who cannot afford to pay for a psychological assessment for their children, many of whom have been getting into difficulty.  The child in Dublin North to whom I referred is experiencing tremendous difficulties with his peers; for example, he is being abused on account of what is described as his "baby talk".It is also alarming that Ireland has the seventh highest rate of suicide among schoolchildren in the European Union.  It is frightening that suicide accounts for 22% of all deaths among those aged between ten and 17 years.  Psychological assessment clearly has a major role to play in detecting those in difficulty.  For this reason, I ask the Minister to value our greatest asset, namely, our children and address the deficit in the psychological service.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Speaking as a Deputy who has raised this aspect of education on a number of occasions over the years, I believe few issues in education are as important as dealing with special educational needs.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on bringing this issue to the fore.  From my experience of dealing with many constituents who have children with special educational needs, I have concluded that there is only one cardinal sin in education.  There is something seriously wrong with an educational system which consigns a boy or girl to achieving less than his or her full potential or failing to fulfil his or her God given talents.  This cardinal sin is committed consistently all over the country.Let us imagine a boy or girl who cannot keep up in class or make or keep friends and slips through the net as a result.  He or she will begin to hate going to school, will build up the prejudices one associates with children in this position and will eventually come to hate society.  I do not need to tell the House what is written on the forehead of such children.  I can assure Deputies it is not "University College Galway" but is much more likely to be "Mountjoy Prison Dublin".  This is an awful problem.While I do not want to bring politics into the issue, when I see Ministers award themselves salary increases of €38,000 per annum at a time when it is impossible either to secure the services of professionals to assess children and determine or identify their special educational needs or pay for educational psychologists and other professionals to look after these children, I must conclude that this society could hardly be more unfair.

It is nothing short of disgraceful that this is allowed to happen.We have all the evidence in the world to show that when the system works it works exceedingly well.  The problem is that we also know that many children, for many reasons, cannot secure the service they fundamentally require.  I am ashamed of some of the Government Deputies.  While I cannot deny the Government has been responsible for some good measures in education, in so far as this issue is concerned it has made a major mistake in failing to help those who cannot help themselves.  I hope it takes notice of the motion tabled by my party's education spokesperson, Deputy Brian Hayes.  Irrespective of which party does the job it will be a good day when the necessary action is taken because it will make many people much happier in the years to come.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion and compliment Deputy Brian Hayes on tabling it on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  The Government has broken nearly every promise it made regarding the delivery of the National Educational Psychological Service programme.  Eight years after its initiation, 50% of all primary schools have no psychological service available to them and the numbers of secondary schools with designated psychologists is falling.  It is vital that children presenting with a special needs requirement are assessed without delay.  This is not the case.I regularly speak to parents and school principals and they are disillusioned with the system because it takes so long to secure a psychological assessment for a child.  Delays in carrying out assessments affect all the pupils in a given class.  The students with special needs fall further behind and other members of the class are affected by disruption.Why does it take up to two years for a child to secure an assessment?  I am aware of a number of cases in County Clare where children waited two years for an assessment and their parents subsequently found that the results were overruled by special education officers.  Three children were refused access to school transport as a result of this practice.  Two of them were attending St. Anne's special school in Ennis, while the third attends St. Gabriel's school in Limerick.  Following extensive pressure and a large number of representations, the decision was revoked.  In what way are special education officers qualified to overrule judgments made by qualified psychologists?Given that full implementation of the NEPS is critical for all pupils and schools, it is beyond belief that the Government intends to cut by 6% funding for the NEPS programme next year.  How can it stand over this decision?  Will it keep any of the promises made before the general election?  I strongly support the motion.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I am amazed by the contributions made by Government Deputies.  I do not know what planet they live on but the National Educational Psychological Service is in tatters and is not being delivered on the ground.  In recent weeks, I have spoken to a number of school principals who are working at the coalface and dealing with the frustration caused by waiting lists and the inability to secure an assessment.  Even when an assessment takes place, the child's name will be placed on another waiting list for services such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy.  It is a tragedy.I spoke to the principal of school where six students have been waiting for an assessment since last May.  One of the pupils will be assessed before Christmas but the principal does not know when the other five assessments will be carried out.  Children must wait for years, which is a long time in their short lives.  This neglect causes irreparable damage and it is a sad reflection on us that we do not provide the services children need or an opportunity to allow them develop to their full potential.  There is an onus on the education system to educate children and support them in their needs, but this is not happening.  Many issues in this regard have been raised here.  The NEPS service is not available in 50% or our schools.  Many psychologists are not willing to work in the system because remuneration is not adequate, and others are leaving the system.  The system is in tatters and our children are being neglected.  Our schools now need to take a multidisciplinary approach and if an assessment is required, they must be able to provide the speech therapist, the occupational therapist and all the rest that go with the necessary psychological assessment.  We need to discuss this motion again.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I would like to address some of the issues that have arisen in the course of this debate.  On the demand for assessments, since 2005, most primary school children with special needs do not need assessments carried out in order to assess extra teaching supports required.  The need for assessments has, therefore, been reduced.  At the same time, we have made sure that all schools can access assessments for their pupils, either directly through the national educational psychological service, the Dublin VECs or by commissioning them from private psychologists whose fees will be paid by NEPS.  Over 10,000 assessments were funded by the Department of Education and Science in the 2006-07 school year, 5,800 through NEPS and 4,400 through the private scheme.As the Minister said last night, the number of schools served directly by NEPS is, therefore, only half the picture.  Nonetheless, the Government is committed to expanding the number of NEPS psychologists, from the current 134 to 200 by 2009 so that more schools can receive a direct service.  As part of this expansion, funding was made available earlier this year for 31 extra psychologists to be appointed to NEPS in 2007.  While recruitment for these positions has taken longer than expected, it is under way.  On top of the 31 extra posts sanctioned for this year, a further 11 NEPS psychologists will be recruited next year.The Fine Gael motion also refers to access to speech and language therapy.  As Deputies will be aware, the provision of such therapies is a matter for the health sector, rather than the Department of Education and Science.  Access to the appropriate therapies can of course impact on children's capacity to succeed at school.  The Taoiseach appointed Deputy Jimmy Devins as Minister of State with responsibility in both the education and health Departments to ensure better cross-departmental co-operation in such areas.  I understand from him that the number of speech and language therapists employed in the public health service has more than doubled in recent years and there are plans for further improvements.

The first cohort from the new MA programme in the University of Limerick graduated in 2005, while the first students on the new BA degree programmes in UCC and NUIG graduated this year.I wish to address the tragedy of youth suicide, an issue raised by several Deputies.  While a clinical diagnosis of mental health problems is a matter for the appropriate health professional, schools have a vital role to play in suicide prevention.  Since 2003, social, personal and health education has been taught to all pupils up to junior certificate level.  The modules at junior cycle deal specifically with issues such as bullying, dealing with peer pressure and coping with stress.  In third year, an awareness of the range of agencies that can help students in difficulty is promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help.School staff such as class tutors, home school liaison teachers and guidance counsellors also have a key role to play in supporting individual students who may experience personal problems.  Referral can be made to appropriate health agencies where necessary and NEPS provides support and guidance to school staff who deal with pupils on a daily basis.  As the Minister outlined last night, NEPS has developed an advice and information pack for schools on responding to critical incidents.  When requested, NEPS will also make itself available for consultation and advice with regard to individual students causing concern.

This is a major issue around the country.  The frustration and anger of parents and principals trying to access services for children and students has reached an extraordinary level.  People have totally lost faith in the State's competency to provide a service it is obliged to provide.We are talking about the most vulnerable people in the country, children of two, three, four or five years of age with special needs who need either a HSE or NEPS service.  We have 185,000 school age children with disabilities or special educational needs.  We have 134 psychologists in NEPS to deal with these, as well as a scheme whereby private psychologists can be brought in to make assessments.  Less than 50% of schools have access to a proper NEPS scheme.  For those who do not, it is misleading for the Government to suggest in this debate that they get the same service through the scheme for commissioning private assessments.  The private assessment is merely an assessment while the NEPS assessment is supposed to put a structured educational programme in place for children who need it.As my colleagues have said, this is about early intervention and assessment so that families can work with their children and teachers to maximise their children's potential.  A missed year here or there because of a waiting list can have a dramatic impact on a child's ability to catch up later.  This is what causes the frustration suffered by parents.I do not want to let this debate pass without referring to speech and language therapy, as well as the need for improved psychological assessment services.  In May this year, Deputy David Stanton submitted a parliamentary question to establish how long children in schools in the Cork area must wait for psychological assessments.  The response he received informed him the wait was two years.  We also received information in May that 658 children were waiting for speech and language therapy assessment in Cork, while some 4,312 were waiting for speech and language therapy services.Government spokespersons have been bragging about what the Government has achieved in terms of special needs assistants, as if we do not have a problem in terms of psychological assessments.  I see the Minister making a dismissive comment to her colleague, as if to say: "What is he talking about?  This has nothing to do with psychological assessments in schools."  This motion is about children and the provision of services for them.

#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I will stick with the facts which speak for themselves.  Only 50% of schools have a service in place.  In my constituency which includes the city of Limerick two thirds of primary schools do not have a service.  The figure for post-primary schools is 56%.  The number of students without a service is almost three quarters in primary and 61% in post-primary schools.  That is an indictment of the system.  The available resources do not match the need.  For every 50 students there is one assessment, which gives a figure of 2%.  Under the scheme for private assessment, the same criteria apply, yet one in five children have special educational needs.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, said children did not need it, but some 20% of children have special educational needs.  That is a fact.There is a major anomaly.  If the schools which have a service in place exceed their quota, they cannot access the Department's scheme; instead students have to pay for an assessment privately.  Shame on the Minister.  These are the students who need it most and the Minister should provide the necessary funding.  Only 134 out of 200 posts which the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Martin, said would be in place by 2004 will be in place.  The Minister talks about having the entire 200 in place ten years after the announcement was made.  That is unacceptable.In the mid-west only eight of the 16 psychologists are in place, that is, a figure of 50%.  The Minister said 31 would be in place by the end of the year, yet another broken promise.  At most 16 will be in place.In the budget the Government will provide for a reduction of 6%.  I hope that when the Minister goes back to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, she will fight her case for the students she represents.  She should not accept a reduction of 6%; rather she should seek an increase.  She needs to deal with this issue but is accepting a cutback from the Minister for Finance.  She needs to fight the case of the students who need the service most and honour that commitment.Many children who are assessed by the NEPS and private assessors need a psychiatric assessment under the HSE.  I know of a child in Limerick who will be seen in the next day or two but who has been waiting two years.  That is unacceptable.  The Minister needs to provide the necessary resources.The Government's amendment to the motion does not stand up to scrutiny.  It refers to all schools as having access to psychological assessments.  They do not — only 50% have access to such assessments.  There is a quota system in place under which only 2% of students will qualify.  If the schools with a service in place exceed their quota, they cannot access the private assessment scheme which the Minister put in place for students.  Instead parents who can ill afford it will have to pay privately or organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul will have to provide assistance.The Government has great capacity to speak about voluntarism and funding.  This matter should have been dealt with during the past eight or nine years when the Celtic tiger economy was booming.  We should not be debating this issue tonight.  The Government is pushing out the timeframe by five years to 2009.Speech and language therapy services are a disgrace.  In Limerick people have to wait six months to one year to avail of such a service.  If they cannot be seen, they have to have an assessment made privately.  If they are seen, the resources are not in place to deal with the issues identified.  The Minister needs to go back to the Minister for Finance tomorrow to demand that the resources be put in place.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I thank all my colleagues who have contributed to the debate which has proved very useful.  I asserted in the House last night that there would be a 6% reduction in the budget for the NEPS next year and expected the Minister or the Minister of State to tell me I was wrong.  We have established, both last night and tonight, as Deputy O'Donnell rightly pointed out, that next year there will be a reduction in the budget of the NEPS.  That is a fact.  It is the first cutback the Minister can tell the House she is introducing.  A service in which she wants to have 200 psychologists in place within two years will have less money next year in its overall budget.The Minister is a very smart woman but her biggest problem is that she does not listen to anyone.  Another problem is that she is never wrong about anything.  I would have thought she would have had the good grace to come into the House and apologise for the commitments she gave the House before the last general election.  On 13 February she told Deputy O'Sullivan that, "With the extra 31 coming on board this year, we will be able to extend the coverage."  On 22 March she informed Deputy Enright: "I have recently been pleased to announce an increase of 31 posts in 2007 in NEPS psychological staffing."  On 5 April she informed my friend, Deputy Stagg, following a very insightful question, that:I announced recently in this connection my intention to expand the number of NEPS psychologists by a further 31 in 2007.  This will represent a significant increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS and bring the total number of psychologists in the system to 174.That was then, this is now and there is no apology.  This is the same woman who will receive an extra €38,000 a year for delivering on her commitments, on a key aspect of educational policy.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I apologise, the figure is €26,000.  The Minister has not delivered on her promises.  Before the last general election, when it came to her attention that  29 schools had been chucked out of the NEPS scheme, she reinstated them, rightly so. Many were in her constituency.  I want her to give me advice for the schools in my constituency.  I thought Deputy O'Connor would mention it when he saw a reference to Dublin 12 but, unfortunately, it was left out of his speech.I refer to St. Paul's junior and senior national school in Greenhills which had a service available but then lost it.  It was promised a service in September this year and recently received a note from the NEPS — effectively, the Department, not a separate statutory body — stating, "As you know, there have been staff shortages in area 4.  Again this year, we unfortunately have to inform you that we do not have the sufficient staff in place", yet the Minister said last night that as there had been substantial recruitment in the three eastern coast areas serving Dublin and surrounding counties, the service would be transferring to other areas.  Who is right: the Minister or the nameless official?  That is the reality.There is a lack of responsibility on the part of the Minister and the Department.  She is presiding over a bureaucratic nightmare — the NEPS, the National Council for Special Education, SENOs and the HSE.  The system is “shambolic”.

Not only is the Minister failing to deliver on her specific commitments to the House, she has also failed to put in place a proper system to adequately address the need for follow-up assessments.  She spoke last night about the SCPA scheme, privately commissioned assessments, but there is no follow-up, as any school principal in the land would tell her.  At least in the case of the NEPS, once there is an assessment, there is a follow-up and a plan is devised.  The suggestion that the other 50% of schools have access to this service does not stand up to scrutiny. The Minister is also aware——

The Minister is aware of a report which she has had on her desk for the past year and a half, namely, the implementation report from the National Council for Special Education.  I asked the Minister a straight question in the House today and received a reply.  A total of 42 actions are to be implemented in this area by her Department and related agencies for children with special needs.  By this date, November 2007, the Minister was supposed to have in place 27 actions.  When I received the reply today, how many actions did the Minister stand over in terms of having them in place?  A big fat zero.  That is the Minister's record.  Let us leave the big speeches, PR occasions and all the cameras and happy-clappiness to one side and deal with the issues that confront our children and educationalists on a daily basis in their classes.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I welcome the Minister to the House to take this Adjournment matter which is general and national in nature.  I presume she will present a comprehensive statement on her commitments and all the good jobs in decentralised projects that are on stream, but I will be parochial on this topic and with good cause.There is a fear in the most northerly part of the country that the Coast Guard station on Malin Head will be made redundant in the coming years.  I am worried about its future.  In 2002 a report was commissioned from Deloitte & Touche which cost the taxpayer €145,000.  It highlighted two centres — one on Valentia and the other on Malin Head — as the main centres for the Coast Guard service.  In 2004 the then Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, approved one of the proposals in the Deloitte & Touche report concerning these two centres.  The crux of the matter is that in 2006 there was a change of thinking as to where the main centres would be located.  The two centres now on the table are in Drogheda and at an unknown location in the west.  What is the Government's real commitment to decentralisation vis-à-vis existing State jobs?  There are 18 such posts on Malin Head.  The Deloitte & Touche report proposed that upwards of 28 jobs be located there in the next five to six years.  Is the Minister committed to the original Deloitte & Touche report’s suggestion which was sanctioned by the Cabinet?  Is she committed to Malin Head and Valentia being the locations of the two main centres, or will she and her colleagues go against the Government’s decentralisation policy?Deloitte & Touche made its proposal on the basis of the Government's decentralisation policy.  I know the Minister will cite a long report about all the things that have been done and are planned, but she should give a commitment that these two stations will remain as priorities in the future provision of Coast Guard facilities.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on demonstrating his true belief in respect of decentralisation when, in his former ministerial capacity, he relocated the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to south Kerry.  I find it hard to understand why the 17 jobs in Valentia Coast Guard station are being put at risk.  For a town such as Killarney that number would represent the equivalent of 250 posts.  The 17 staff at Valentia Coast Guard station are consummate professionals.  The buildings in which they operate are in perfect working order.  I have visited them myself.  In 2004 when the Dublin station was decommissioned while asbestos was being removed from the roof, the entire Coast Guard service was run from Malin Head and Valentia.  The technology is available and up to date.  The Government does not realise what it would mean to an area such as Valentia to lose 17 high end jobs.  The children of several of the employees in the Coast Guard station are studying and hope to take up jobs in Valentia down the road.  On those grounds, I ask the Minister to reconsider the decision and to take on board the essence of decentralisation by retaining these jobs in Valentia.  The jobs should not be centralised to Drogheda, Galway or Ennis.  Will the Government row back on this proposal and retain the jobs in Malin Head and Valentia?  The 17 jobs on Valentia Island equate to 250 in a large urban town.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I will address the issues raised on behalf of the Minister of the Transport, and the Irish Coast Guard is relevant to his Department.  I am pleased to confirm that the decentralisation of 50 staff from the Department of Transport and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to Loughrea was among the priority moves in the Government's decentralisation programme and it is complete.  With regard to RSA staff moving to Ballina, the number involved increased from 67 — that is, the number of staff originally located there — to 129.  The majority of the additional 62 posts were secured from the Ballina central applications facility.  Ballina, as an existing decentralised location, was an option for candidates under the current programme.  The remainder of staff were secured from a mixture of open recruitment and internal promotional competitions.The Minister for Transport's recent decision to move the maritime safety directorate, the Irish Coast Guard, technical and administrative, and the marine survey office, technical and administrative, to Drogheda is likely to lead to an increase in the numbers of posts transferring there over and above the original 37 planned.  The central applications facility has resulted in a very positive response from applicants for this location.  While neither the total numbers nor grades has been identified, the Minister for Transport is confident that finalising the actual moves will not present an insurmountable problem.The immediate priority is to finalise a suitable location and construction of a premises. This work is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  Once a premises is available, I expect there will be no delay in completing the decentralisation process.  As per the Government decision, all staff decentralising to Drogheda will do so on a voluntary basis.  Proposals to decentralise the National Roads Authority and the Railway Safety Commission to Ballinasloe, Bus Éireann to Mitchelstown and the Irish Aviation Authority to Shannon are less advanced.  The bodies involved were not identified by the decentralisation implementation group as early movers.Each of the agencies has reported that few staff have expressed an interest in moving to the decentralised locations.  This creates particular difficulties as many of the staff involved are in specialist posts.  In addition, in the case of Bus Éireann, the total number of staff located in its headquarters is 80, while the decentralisation decision calls for 200 posts to move.  Updated implementation plans have been requested from the agencies and these are expected to show progress on their individual moves.  The matter of providing additional State jobs in any location is subject to Department of Finance approval within Government policy.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for attending to reply.  A decision by the building unit on a school building for Gaelscoil Thaobh na Coille is critical if a repeat of the entire tendering process is to be avoided.  The gaelscoil is situated in an area that has experienced significant population growth over the past 15 years and the growth rate has accelerated over the past five years.  The area is characterised by the number of cranes in its skyline.  It was the subject of a local area plan by the county council and the need for local schools in a timely manner was identified.  In this instance, while the forward planning took place, there has been a failure to deliver.I attended the opening of the gaelscoil in the De La Salle Palmerstown rugby clubhouse when I served as cathaoirleach of South Dublin County Council in 1995-96.  The parents, teachers and pupils have waited for a permanent home for 12 years and many of the children who attended the school when it first opened are well into their secondary schooling having spent their primary schooling in cramped prefabs.  Eight classes operate in conditions so cramped that one of the teachers can never wear a skirt to school because she must jump over desks to reach some of the children.The board of management has gone through the planning, architectural and design phases and not alone has the construction tendering process been completed but the contractor has been selected and the contract awarded.  Technically, under the contract the contractor will no longer be obliged to build the school at the quoted price if sanction is not given by the Department by the end of the month.  While there may be flexibility in this regard, the deadline is too close for comfort and there is serious unease among all concerned that the sanction, which was felt to be a matter of form, will not be forthcoming.  The parents and teachers were overjoyed when they received the go-ahead to invite tenders for the construction of the school and they are bitterly disappointed that they probably will not be in the new school by next September, as they had anticipated.They are shocked because it is highly unusual for a project to reach the final stage and have the funding withheld with the contractor ready to go.  I assume the sanction will eventually be granted but it will make no difference to the Minister or the national finances if the go-ahead is given this month, next month or in January.  It would make a major difference to the gaelscoil because, at best, the teachers and pupils would not be in their new school by September 2008 and, at worst, if the administrators had to go through the tendering process again, they would be lucky to be in by 2009.  The finance was promised and it was reasonably assumed it would be forthcoming.  I ask the Minister to give sanction for this.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity of outlining to this House my Department's position regarding the provision of a new school premises for Gaelscoil Thaobh na Coille, Cill Tiarnáin.  The proposed project involves the construction of a new two-storey, 16-classroom generic repeat design school.  Planning permission and a fire certificate has been obtained and the tender report for the project is being examined by the Department's building unit.Under the national development plan, €4.5 billion was assigned to the capital requirements of the primary and post-primary sectors.  More than €540 million will be spent this year on school buildings.  The level of construction alone in the primary and post-primary sectors in 2007 is such that it will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for approximately 17,500 pupils.  The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is considered on an ongoing basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme in which the main focus is to deliver school places within rapidly developing areas.  The progression of the school referred to by the Deputy, as is the case with all large scale projects, will be considered in this context.  I assure the Deputy I am committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Gaelscoil Thaobh na Coille at the earliest date.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12768	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The Defence Forces camp at Kilworth, County Cork, has been designated as the location for a prison covering Munster and it will replace facilities at Cork Prison in particular.  The proposed location of the prison will be within the 1,200 acre camp located close to the M8 motorway between Mitchelstown and Fermoy and it is destined to house up to 450 prisoners.  On Monday last, the residents of the immediate area called public representatives to a meeting to discuss the proposals and to air their genuine concerns.  In seeking this Adjournment debate, I wish to speak about a number of those concerns.  Given that this prison will be constructed under the terms of the strategic infrastructure legislation, there is genuine concern that local residents' fears will not be addressed.  The construction of such a large prison within a very rural area raises a number of fears.  For example, landowners who leased land from the Department of Defence for agricultural purposes now wonder where their future lies.  They had a long-standing arrangement and have asked will they be able to stay on the land or will this scenario change.People have also asked whether the land acquisition process for the prison has been completed.  If not, there is a strong school of thought within the community that the footprint of the prison should be moved to a more suitable location within the overall landholding.  The community also believe the prison should be constructed within contours that make it more suitable.  It is strongly perceived that the current proposal, as we understand it, is a site within 162 acres.  If the land acquisition is not completed, residents believe that the case could be made for the prison to be moved, even if that is beyond the current 162-acre footprint.From an environmental point of view, there are concerns that three streams within the footprint of the proposal will be compromised.  The area in question is served by the Killally, Ballinrush and Graigue group water scheme.  The source of this scheme is approximate to the footprint of the site.The Minister, in response to a question I tabled on Thursday last, stated that normal planning provisions do not apply to a prison development.  There is an understanding that for security reasons one does not broadcast or make known the exact plans.  We all acknowledge that fact, but further concerns have been raised about the transport provisions to and from the prison.  People in the nearby village of Kilworth, where at times traffic causes a bottleneck, are seeking, through their community council, assurances on the traffic management provisions of the proposals.  They also seek a buffer zone around the prison from an aesthetic and security point of view.Those who live in Cork city are used to the presence of a prison within their city.  The construction of a prison of this nature in a very rural area would give rise to genuine causes for concern and anxiety.If the proposal is being presented as a fait accompli and is not subject to normal planning considerations, I respectfully ask the Minister to ensure any provisions relating to public safety and environmental concerns are addressed.  To assist the community further, I respectfully request of the Minister and his officials that he would meet a deputation of residents and public representatives in the area so they can have their concerns addressed at an early stage.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I am responding to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The existing Cork Prison was built by the British military in the early 19th century as part of what is now known as Collins Barracks.  It was only in 1972 that it was transferred to the Department of Justice and used as a civil prison.  Originally designed for 150 inmates, it now has a capacity for 270 and is normally operating at close to full capacity.The Deputy will be aware that it has been the policy of the Irish Prison Service to modernise all outmoded prison accommodation to bring it in line with modern facilities, including full in-cell sanitation.  The Deputy will also be aware that the existing accommodation at Cork Prison falls well short of these requirements.  In particular conditions are crowded and there is no in-cell sanitation.  There is insufficient recreation space and, furthermore, the lack of space does not allow an adequate perimeter security to prevent drugs and weapons being launched into the prison.  The site is not suitable for redevelopment and it is planned in due course to replace it by a new Munster prison built on a greenfield site.  Planning exercises by the Irish Prison Service indicate that a facility with a capacity of approximately 400 to 500 prisoners would be required to ensure adequate capacity for the Munster region over the next ten to 15 years.In this regard the Government decided earlier this year to assign a site owned by the Minister for Defence in Kilworth to the Prison Service to serve as the location for the development of a prison facility to replace Cork Prison and serve the Munster region.  The project is at an early stage.  A preliminary site suitability report has been carried out on the site and this has confirmed that there are no significant constraints to the development of this site.  A process of consultation has commenced with representatives of the local community, a number of meetings have being held and these will continue as outline plans for the new development are drawn up.While a decision has been made in principle to proceed, there are a number of steps that must be gone through before a detailed plan of a prison facility on the site can be finalised and a contract signed.  The first step required by Department of Finance guidelines on capital expenditure is the preparation of a business case for the project.  The Prison Service interim board has approved recently the necessary preliminary business case for this project and has forwarded it to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for consideration.  In due course and in consultation with the National Development Finance Agency a decision will have to be made on the procurement process to be used and in particular whether a public private partnership approach is appropriate.  That decision will influence the timing of the design phase.  The Deputy will understand that it is not possible to be definitive about the project until a design has been agreed.When a detailed design has been finalised development consent will be sought.  Before consent to a prison development can be given, the procedures set out in Part 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 and, where appropriate, section 181A of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as inserted by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 or the procedures set out in Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007 must be followed.  Both these procedures require public notice to be given of the proposed development and allow submissions to be made by interested parties on the development.  There will therefore be a formal consultation process with local interests at that stage.  Allowing for the steps still to be taken, including the tendering process as well as the design and construction phase, it is unlikely that a new prison facility to replace Cork Prison will be completed at Kilworth before 2011.As to the approximate cost, the terms and scope of the project have not yet been finalised.  In addition, this project will be procured by means of a public tender competition and, accordingly, it is not appropriate for a number of reasons to publish estimates of the cost at this point.

#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I want to focus on the fact that one of my children thought it was picture of a person who had a bad dose of chickenpox and the other child thought it was a person who had been burned.I was appalled on reading the report in yesterday's Irish Examiner  which highlighted the seriousness of the drug problem in this country.  We all know that we have a huge drug problem that affects every corner of Ireland, but sometimes it takes a report such as this one, which shows us graphic images of the effects of drugs, to make us stand up and take notice.Drugs are about buying and selling, and one of those processes cannot function without the other.  It is crystal clear to me that the aim of the Government should be to target the suppliers, drug pushers and drug barons and put them out of business.  These people are the real criminals whose hunger for profit cancels out any guilt or remorse they might feel about the lives they destroy.The Government also needs to support actively the rehabilitation of those people who are desperately trying to break free from drugs.  We need to give these people opportunities to rehabilitate themselves and to try and lead a drug-free life.The Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, said in yesterday's report that more than €200 million was targeted at problem drug use in 2006.  I would like to know where this money went and what effect it has had.  The Government can continue to throw money at the drug problem but the sad fact is that it will only continue to get worse unless the Government acts to catch the criminals and educate our young people about the real dangers of getting involved in drugs.  It would be much more effective to channel Government funding to ensure it reaches the people who need it the most.  At this stage the Government has enough policies and plans in place.  What we need now is action.It is a tragedy that the lives of young people and those of their families are being destroyed by drugs every day of the week.  In my constituency of Dublin South-Central I have witnessed at first hand many families whose lives have been torn apart and who have buried sons and daughters who have died as a result of drugs.  I attended a remembrance service in Ballyfermot this year at which more than 500 people lit candles to remember those they had lost through suicide and drug addiction.  The look of despair and hopelessness etched on their faces is a sight I will never forget.  It is heartbreaking to see families experience such a great loss.  Their loss should portray a clear picture to the Government that its policies are not working.I acknowledge that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, are playing their part in trying to combat the drug problem through the development of the local drugs task forces, the young people's facilities and services fund and the national drugs strategy.  However, these programmes are in place for nearly ten years and the drug problem has worsened.  We can have all the meetings, policies and plans in the world at our disposal but they are not improving the situation.  They are just another waste of taxpayers' money.The local drugs task forces have done good work locally and have the potential to do great work.They have a challenging role which takes in treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local supply.  However, I often feel that their work can become tied up in red tape and bureaucracy, which shifts the focus from why they were set up in the first place.  It is the people in the local community who have come face to face with the devastation and violence caused by drug addiction, who should be main focus of the local drugs taskforces.The national drugs strategy is an ambitious document, which aims to tackle the source of the drug problem as well as the terrible effects it has on communities.  It is now six years, however, since it was introduced, and how many of its recommendations and aims have actually been achieved?The Department of Education and Science prides itself on being heavily involved in running awareness and education programmes in schools throughout the country to communicate the dangers of drug misuse to children and young people.  However, it could do much more and I really believe that education is the key.  The Department's drug prevention programmes such as On My Own Two Feet and Walk Tall go some way towards educating young people about drugs but there is still no mandatory drugs and alcohol awareness programme available for senior cycle students.  Teenagers in fifth and sixth year are vulnerable and are often targeted by drug dealers, yet receive no drugs awareness classes.  This is a clear failure of Government policy.Fr. Terry Murphy, parish priest in Darndale, was quoted yesterday in a moving piece in the Irish Examiner to the effect that one of the pieces missing at the moment was gardaí on the street building relationships, getting to know the community, meeting families and breaking down the divide between the Garda and the community.  I agree with Fr. Murphy and believe that in order for the Garda Síochána to have a more effective role in the fight against drugs, more community policing is needed at a local level.  This will entail community gardaí staying in place in the communities they serve for some length of  time.  I know there is no quick fix in prospect, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as the entire Government need to look at all the strategies and policies and assess why there has not been significant progress to date in the fight against drugs.  Can the Minister say why, if €200 million was spent last year on tacking the drug problem, this country is still in the grip of a drugs crisis, with young people in particular dying every day as a result of their addictions?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Again, I am making this reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan.The Minister would like to thank Deputy Byrne for raising this matter on the Adjournment this evening and indeed we all welcome the comprehensive reporting on the drugs issue this week by the Irish Examiner.The issue remains one of the most pressing social problems facing us.  Given the destructive consequences brought about by drug misuse at the individual, family and community levels, many of which are recorded sadly in the newspaper reports referred to, it is an issue on which we as a society must continue to collectively maintain a sharp focus and sense of urgency.  It is useful for any debate on the issues of drug misuse and drug trafficking to take place in the context of the nature and the scale of the problem with which we have to deal.The annual report 2007 of the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime states that the total number of drug users in the world is now estimated at some 200 million people, equivalent to approximately 5% of the global population aged between 15 and 64 years.  This is undoubtedly a global problem, one which is by no means unique to Ireland.  Equally, it is one for which there is no quick and easy solution.  The focus in our jurisdiction must be to constantly strive to ensure that the measures and policies which we have in place to address the problem are appropriate and flexible enough to be able to respond to what is a global and dynamic issue.  The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem of drug misuse through the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08.  The national strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.As Deputy Byrne will appreciate, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is the lead Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  The Government firmly believes that the co-ordinated and integrated approach involving all the relevant players concerned with the issue in place under the national strategy is the only way by which real and meaningful progress can continue to be made in tackling the drugs problem.  Under this policy framework, significant resources continue to be allocated to a range of measures dedicated to addressing the issue which are in place.  A good example of this is the allocation of €50 million to the Vote of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for the drugs initiative this year which represents a 16% increase on the equivalent 2006 allocation.  This figure is exclusive of the many mainstream services that are availed of in the normal way by those affected by problem drug use and the Government will continue to make resources available on a scale appropriate to the needs arising.The Government is conscious that the drugs situation is a dynamic and ever-changing one and the policies in place must be kept under close scrutiny and review.  The current national strategy is nearing its conclusion and with a new programme for Government taking us through to 2012 this is an appropriate time to reflect on and note what it has been achieved and make any changes in our approach which are deemed necessary.  We need to evaluate the current drugs situation, our experiences during the past six years of the strategy and utilise what we have learned from the outcomes achieved when developing a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009-16.  Initial steps in that process have already been taken.  Under the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the area of drug supply reduction and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework.  Enforcement of the law relating to drugs very much continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities.  Underpinning this approach, the Garda Síochána will continue to invoke a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue.  Under the strategy, the Garda National Drugs Unit co-ordinates large scale operations against drug dealing and trafficking and unit personnel either investigate such cases or assist local investigation teams.  Additional assistance is also available from other specialised Garda support units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.A joint Garda National Drugs Unit-Criminal Assets Bureau initiative is in place which targets local dealers and the Minister has specifically included in the policing priorities for 2008 a reference that enhanced liaison arrangements between Garda divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau are put in place in the pursuit of those engaged in drug dealing at all levels.  As it is, profilers trained by CAB are now present in every Garda division.  The Minister wants the message to be clear that drug dealing by anybody on whatever scale is unacceptable and will be pursued.Significant drug seizures, including the considerable amounts of heroin and cocaine which have been discovered in recent times, have been made as a result of these strategies.  Policing operations continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade and such measures will continue to be vigorously pursued by the Garda Síochána.The House will be aware that additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time.  These resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need, including areas with a significant drug problem.  I should like to take the opportunity to wish the new Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, who took up his appointment today every success in the job.  In conjunction with this, the Government is ensuring that our law enforcement agencies continue to have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work in tackling those involved in such criminal activity.While we already had a strong legislative package in place for tackling drug trafficking, the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 provide further measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.  In talking about the successes the Garda has had, I want also to pay tribute to the outgoing Garda Commissioner Noel Conroy for his tremendous work over the past few years.Finally, the Minister is very clear that there is no room for complacency in our response to the issue of drug misuse.  He would like me to stress again, as indeed would the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, that the enforcement of the law relating to drugs is a key element in the Government's policing priorities.  The implementation of the national drugs strategy is also a key element.

This follows an inter-departmental examination of the issue by a working group and research commissioned on its behalf by the National Disability Authority.Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 establishes a system for the assessment of individual needs for people with a disability. The assessment of need process has been implemented for persons aged under 5 years of age with effect from 1st June 2007. It is intended that the assessment of need process for all persons with a disability will be in place by 2011.My Department is committed to considering the issues around a cost of disability payment following the development of this needs assessment system.In the meantime, there is already significant assistance available to mitigate the impact of the additional costs incurred by people with a disability. These measures include weekly/monthly allowances, additional income supports, other benefits such as medical cards/free travel/mobility allowance and tax concessions.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The Health Service Executive has commissioned a Review and Feasibility Analysis of Nursing and Other Related Staff Resource Deployment in the Health Service Executive (HSE). The review commenced at the end of July and a final report is expected by January 2008. The aims of the review are:To conduct a system wide and national analysis of current nursing/midwifery and other staffing resource deployment by clinical unit having regard to bed occupancy and acuity;To compare the current use of our nursing resource in Ireland against best international practice.  This will be benchmarked against OECD and other analysis of human resources for healthcare;To recommend the optimal configuration of our nursing resource in the delivery of health services taking account of best international practice and the emerging transformation programme;In the light of the above, to assess the feasibility of the introduction, on a cost neutral and Wholetime Equivalent (WTE) neutral basis, of a reduction in the weekly hours of work (of the staff involved) by reconfiguration of the workforce. Such a feasibility study will determine whether any potential risk to the availability, quality and accessibility of health service provision might ensue.Fifty-two acute hospitals are being surveyed as part of the review. The review is not designed to establish minimum or maximum staffing requirements for hospitals but, rather, to report on the project objectives and deliverables outlined above.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	394	The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established in May 2007.  This represents a crucial element of the Health Reform Programme and is a new departure for the Irish Health Services.A core function of the Authority is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of these standards in an open and transparent way.  The Act gives HIQA strong powers in this area in relation to services provided by the Health Service Executive and bodies funded by the Executive to provide health services on its behalf.  The introduction of such regulatory regimes in the public sector in the first instance is a feature of such developments in other jurisdictions.  The extension of these provisions to the private sector would involve further legislation of a complex nature.In January 2007, I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance chaired by Dr Deirdre Madden.  The Commission is developing proposals to develop proposals for a health service wide system of governance based on corporate accountability for the quality and safety of all health services.  One of its terms of reference is to specifically examine and make recommendations in relation to a statutory system of licensing for both public and private health care providers and services.  The Commission is expected to issue its report in mid 2008.  I am keeping this matter under active review.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 69, 70, 74, 80, 81, 92, 111, 114, 192 and 204 together.Achieving and maintaining the highest possible standards of hygiene in our hospitals and healthcare facilities generally is a priority for this Government.The National Hygiene Services Quality Review on acute hospitals was published by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) on 13th November, 2007.  The report represents a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in 51 HSE funded acute care hospitals.  The method of assessment and criteria used are substantially different to previous audits carried out by the HSE and therefore the results are not comparable.  The results do however set a very good benchmark for the future.  It is important that our health service provides the highest possible standard of care for patients.  Hygiene and infection control are among the essentials that we must get right.  That is why the HIQA review not only looked at the immediate service delivery elements of hygiene but also examined the critical areas of governance and corporate management.Hospitals generally performed well on hygiene in the service delivery area.  Most hospitals achieved either extensive or exceptional compliance with the standard in the service delivery section of the report.  However, the results were poor on governance.  While improvements have been made and are acknowledged in the report, no hospital achieved a ‘very good' rating, 7 were categorised as ‘good', 35 as ‘fair' and 9 as ‘poor'.I support the emphasis by HIQA on a ‘whole system' approach to hygiene.  The report indicates clearly that the review is not, and was never intended to be, an absolute assessment of cleanliness in a given hospital.  It provides a detailed assessment of performance across the entire range of areas that impact hygiene so that individual hospitals can identify areas of strength and areas for improvement.While the good hygiene practice of front line staff highlighted in the report is vital, real improvement in this whole area also depends heavily on good leadership and a system of governance.  A quality improvement plan now needs to be drawn up by all the hospitals and the HSE.  This will continue to be monitored by HIQA as part of its ongoing quality assurance programme.The HSE established a National Infection Control Action Plan in March 2007.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health), is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce Health Care Acquired Infections by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in healthcare settings.  A key element of the plan is to clearly set out the individual accountable in each hospital who will have the authority to ensure compliance with its various elements.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.HIQA is currently working with managers and clinicians to develop national standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  When completed these, along with the national hygiene standards, will provide a comprehensive framework to help reduce the spread of infection and improve the quality of our health care.The results in the HIQA review cannot be directly compared to previous HSE hygiene audits or statistically linked to the results of the 2006 HCAI prevalence survey.  However, I am satisfied that the progress made since the first HSE Hygiene Audit in 2005 and the measures being taken under the 2007 HSE National Infection Control Action Plan will contribute to significant improvements in hygiene standards and infection control.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 66, 88 and 103 together.As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP).The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.  It would not be accurate, therefore, to describe this scheme as one which was intended to support middle income parents as it was an approved scheme for disadvantaged parents and their children.Despite the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, the Government decided to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents.  Accordingly, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  It will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are being required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office.  This information will be used to determine the level of subvention for each service.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that community creches providing a service to children of parents in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will receive a weekly subvention in respect of these children.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service.  However, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.The new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by, and takes account of, a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported.  The ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.  My officials and I have been meeting with representatives of the Community Childcare sector on an ongoing basis since then regarding the Scheme.  A number of concerns regarding possible anomalies have been raised at these meetings, and will be considered in the context of any modifications to the Scheme.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008, provided they apply to enter the new Scheme by submitting the data required as part of the application process of the new Scheme.  Therefore I urge groups with applications outstanding to forward the completed applications to the Childcare Directorate of my Office as soon as possible to avail of the transitional funding.  This funding is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  Initially, 780 Groups in receipt of EOCP staffing grants who had no compliance issues in respect of their current grant aid were requested to complete applications for the new Scheme.  Of these, some 600 have been received to date. A further 52 groups were forwarded applications with a deadline of completion and return later this month.  These returns, together with those from a significant number of groups who have contacted the Childcare Directorate of my Office and the City/County Childcare Committees requesting an extension, are expected by the end of this month.  The Childcare Directorate has begun the process of analysing these returns and letters have already issued to 120 groups confirming that they will receive transitional funding for the period January to June 2008.As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which has been received from applicants this month.  Where appropriate, adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children, particularly where there are low income parents above the FIS threshold, will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.

These guidelines are prepared with the assistance of an active committee from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.The policy decision to introduce Hepatitis B and pneumococcal vaccines into the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme was based on advice received from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee as part of its review of the immunisation guidelines.  This advice is based on epidemiological information about the occurrence of these diseases and evidence as to the public health benefit to be obtained from immunisation.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee also commissioned cost benefit analyses of both of these measures.  My Department received advice about a catch-up programme for children up to 2 years of age for pneumococcal vaccine and has conveyed this advice to the Health Service Executive.  This advice has been taken into account by the Health Service Executive in preparing its 2008 service plan.  As part of its ongoing work the National Immunisation Advisory Committee keeps all available vaccines under review.  I understand that Varicella Zoster was considered by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee in the review of the immunisation programme but its inclusion in the programme was not recommended.

Before the establishment of the HSE, the nature of any arrangements for community physiotherapy services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards.  As a result, variation in practice developed over time.The HSE has informed me that, in some areas, local management have entered into Service Level Agreements with private physiotherapists to provide services to medical card holders who have been referred by their General Practitioners.  These arrangements will be reviewed in the context of the ongoing development of primary care services and the legislative proposals being prepared by my Department to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services, including physiotherapy services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Arising from the health reform programme and the establishment of the HSE, a number of operational functions previously carried out by my Department have been transferred to the HSE. These include:hospital planningthe administration of the voluntary hospital superannuation schemes and the nominated health agencies superannuation schemesoperational aspects of casemix and speciality costinghealth promotion (advertising and awareness campaigns on health promotion and responsibility for funding voluntary organisations involved in health promotion initiatives only)the administration of the Health Service Personnel Census.The transfer of these functions involved a reduction of approximately 38 posts in my Department's approved complement of posts and some 17 individuals moved to the HSE on a permanent or secondment basis.The approved complement for my Department at present is 530 posts. This includes nearly 70 posts in the Office of the Minister for Children but excludes the General Registration Office, the Adoption board, the Ombudsman for Children and the Repayment Scheme Appeals Unit.Although the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health services across the country, the Minister for Health & Children remains politically accountable for developing and articulating Government policy on health and personal social services, and for the overall performance of the health service. Clearly, I rely upon my Department to support me in this regard.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The health repayment scheme was launched in August 2006 and is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in conjunction with the appointed Scheme Administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.The most up-to date information provided to me by the HSE indicates that a sum of €160m approximately will be paid out of the special account in 2007. This would mean that some €200m of the funding provided this year will not be required. However, the Government has provided a further €150m to cover repayments from the scheme in 2008. I understand that the Scheme Administrator has provided the HSE with assurances that all eligible claims received before the closing date of 31 December 2007 will be processed by the end of the contract period which expires at the end of June, 2008. The Government will ensure that provision is made to meet all appropriate costs arising under the scheme.The HSE has indicated that the scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to complete payments. The time taken to process each application varies depending on the complexity of the application, whether in the case of estates a grant of representation has been extracted and the availability of accurate records to calculate repayment.As of 9 November 2007 over 31,000 claim forms have been received, 4,721 payments totalling over €93.4m have issued and 6,943 offers totalling over €134m have been made.

Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular issue raised by the Deputy.However, cleaning in hospitals is currently carried out by a combination of direct provision of cleaning services and contract cleaning.   It is recognised that irrespective of the organisational arrangements, it is essential to monitor hospital hygiene on an ongoing basis.   It is important that the focus is on levels of hygiene achieved rather than hours of cleaning provided.  What matters is continuous improvement in hygiene not whether the cleaners are HSE or contract staff.  I have been informed that a Cleaning Manual which was circulated by the HSE to all acute hospitals in September 2006 includes guidance on service level agreements with contract cleaning firms.

The HSE acknowledges the importance of home helps as part of the community services team in supporting older people and other dependent persons to remain in their own homes for as long as possible.The home help national budget allocation has increased from €156m in 2005 to €207m in 2007, representing an increase of €51m since 2005 (33% increase).  Due to the expansion of the service over recent years, the HSE now has a considerable workforce available to deliver the service.  Currently, there are in excess of 17,000 predominantly part time home helps employed nationally in the delivery of the service to over 53,000 clients.The level of home help required by any existing or new client is informed by an assessment of need which is carried out by HSE professional staff.  This is monitored and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the assessed needs of clients continue to be met.  This would include any requirement to provide additional home help hours if needed.  Indeed, data from the HSE indicates that the total number of hours of home  help services provided in September was above the average for the previous eight months.Due to the nature of the service, there is considerable fluctuation in the level of assistance required by clients.  In practice, this means that there is considerable flexibility and capacity in the HSE home help service to ensure that new clients requiring a service can be accommodated by the existing workforce. Therefore, the current pause in recruitment is manageable in the context of the delivery of the home help service.

Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular question raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to the matter raised.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Firstly, I understand that the figures used in the Deputy's question come from the Annual Reports of the Courts Service. I also understand that a reply to question 21560/07 which related to the same matter was recently issued to the Deputy by the HSE.  This reply included data relating to the number of Care Orders and Supervision Orders in force in 2004 and 2005 and these figures differed from those quoted by the Deputy. Officials from my Office have arranged for the HSE and the Courts Service to examine these differences with a view to resolving any issues with the data.With regard to policy relating to children in care, a number of initiatives in recent years are aimed, inter alia at ensuring that services for children and young people are delivered in an effective, efficient and coordinated manner. In support of these initiatives, over €240m additional revenue has been provided for child protection and welfare services since 1997. It would also be important to note that of the more than 5,000 children in the care of the state approximately 90% are in foster care.The Office of the Minister for Children (OMC) was set up to bring greater coherence to policy making for children. Children now have a stronger voice on issues that affect them through my attendance at cabinet meetings. The OMC focuses on harmonising policy issues that affect children in areas such as early childhood care and education, youth justice, child welfare and protection, children and young people's participation, research on children and young people and cross cutting initiatives for children.The OMC is responsible forImplementing the National Children's Strategy (2000-2010)Implementing the National Childcare Investment Programme (2006-2010)Developing policy and legislation on child welfare and child protectionImplementing the Children Act 1991 and the Children Act (2001)The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005.  Under the Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Again, the purpose of having one body with responsibility for services at a national level is to ensure the delivery of services in an effective, efficient and coordinated manner.In the context of the implementation of the Children Act, 2001 the Health Service Executive is involved with the Irish Youth Justice Service, the Garda Juvenile Liaison Service, the Probation Service and the Courts Service in the co-ordination of services for young people.The HSE also has a key role in the National Implementation Group established under the Partnership agreement "Towards 2016" which hopefully will lead to improved co-ordination of services to children and young people in each county.The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) has played a crucial role in ensuring a quality assured system of care for children and young people who are in the care of the state.  Legislation and standards have been developed in this area and it is essential that the services are monitored to ensure that they meet these requirements and that any deficiencies are identified and corrected.  The SSI  have published annual reports on the findings from inspections and informs the HSE, other bodies involved in the provision of services for children and young people, and the public on the standard of care in children's residential centres. The SSI was established on an administrative basis in 1999 and concentrated on the child care area, in particular on the inspection of Health Service Executive (HSE) operated residential child care facilities and it had also undertaken pilot inspections of foster care services. Under the provisions of the Health Act 2007, the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services was established on a statutory basis as part of the Health Information and Quality Authority in May 2007 and will continue the role of the SSI.In addition to the aforementioned significant developments, the Agenda for Children's Services is being developed by the Office of the Minister for Children and will be published in 2007. The principle of having social services provided on the basis of the child being supported within the family, within the local community will be at the core of the national policy.

The recent decisions of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  Prof. Tom Keane took up his position as interim Director of the National Cancer Control Programme last Monday.  Prof. Keane will be engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.Prof. Keane and the HSE have emphasised the importance of mobilising existing resources and redirecting them to achieve the National Cancer Control Programme objectives. The HSE is putting arrangements in place to enable Prof. Keane to take control of all new cancer developments from 1 January 2008 and progressively all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.  An additional €20.5m was allocated to the HSE this year for cancer control, including €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the National Cancer Control Programme.  Further investment in cancer control will be based on the reform programme now being implemented by the HSE.

A national breast screening programme combined with quality assured symptomatic services nationally are key elements of our cancer control programme.BreastCheck has commenced the screening process in the South and West.  I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million to the National Cancer Screening Service for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of seven additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  Construction commenced on the static sites at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork  and University College Hospital Galway in November last year and final handover of the buildings is scheduled for the end of this month.Arising from the designation of eight cancer centres nationally and in order to comply with the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has directed a number of hospitals with very low case volumes to cease breast cancer services.  The National Hospitals Office has already planned the redirection of this symptomatic caseload.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur over the next two years in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.The specific questions raised by the Deputies regarding mammography equipment and the provisions that have been put in place to assist patients affected by the transfer of breast cancer services relates to the management and delivery of health, personal and social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matter raised.

Women aged 25 to 44 years old will be screened every 3 years; women aged 45 to 60 will be screened every 5 years.  The Service will be available free of charge to eligible women.All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service. The programme will be based on a turnaround time of four weeks for smear testing.  The Service will shortly be inviting laboratories that meet the requisite requirements to enter into service level agreements to achieve this objective.The specific questions raised by the Deputies regarding the cost of sending cervical smear tests to a US based company, the duration of the contract , the quality of these tests and laboratory capacity at University College Hospital Galway relate to the management and delivery of health, personal and social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matter raised.

The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital and Mayo General Hospital.It is fully recognised that there are particular and unique geographical circumstances applying to Donegal.  This is reflected in North-South co-operation in the provision of radiation oncology to patients from Donegal at Belfast City Hospital.  On a sole exception basis, the Managed Cancer Control Network in the West will therefore be permitted to enter into outreach service delivery in Letterkenny as an additional activity.  This exception is subject to quality assurance criteria and also to the proviso that the potential to meet the needs of cancer patients in Donegal through North-South initiatives, such as the Belfast radiation oncology service must be optimised and fully facilitated.

It examines the re-admission rate between 2001 and 2005.The study found that re-admission will continue to be a feature for patients with recurring or enduring mental illnesses.  It is appropriate that such patients be admitted and discharged as clinically indicated and not become part of a long stay population as would have been the norm in the past.Since 2005, the Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change" has been published.  It provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service for a seven to ten year period.  This policy envisions an active, flexible and community-based mental health service where the need for hospital admission will be greatly reduced.Implementation of the individual recommendations of "A Vision for Change" is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country.   The HSE intend to publish an implementation plan shortly which is to include a timed and prioritised set of short, medium and longer termgoals.I expect the HSE to take account of the findings in this report.  The Health Research Board is to be commended for this study.  Studies like this, repeated at regular intervals, will provide us with useful indicators on the extent and effectiveness of implementation of policy.

Issues to be examined include the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the vaccine for different age groups and for differing levels of screening provision and uptake.As is being done in other jurisdictions, Ireland is now considering the potential role of HPV vaccination in addressing the problem of cervical cancer prevention.  The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recently undertaken a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS), agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertake this study.One of the key functions of the Authority is the assessment of health technology, drugs and health promotion activities.  When I have received the policy advice from HIQA and NCSS I will make the necessary decisions that arise from the advice.A quality assured population based cervical screening programme aims to reduce cervical cancer in Ireland by approximately 80%.  The NCSS is planning to roll-out such a programme early next year.  A national cervical screening programme will still be required regardless of a decision on a HPV vaccination programme.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	416	In 2001, the year of the publication of the Health Strategy, the average number of in-patient beds and day places available in the 53 public acute hospitals was 12,145, based on returns to the Department ( 11,374 in-patient beds and  771 day places).   The provisional number of acute hospital beds recorded by the Health Service Executive for 2006 was 13,771( 12,574 in-patient beds and 1,197 day places) based on a total bed complement. The Programme for Government includes a commitment to provide an additional 1,500 public acute hospital beds. In this context the co-location initiative which was announced in July 2005, aims to deliver about a 1000 additional beds for public patients through the development of private hospitals on public sites. The balance of approximately 500 public acute hospital beds are at various stages of planning under the Health Service Executive's capital plan.The HSE commissioned PA Consulting Group to undertake an independent review of acute bed capacity requirements for Ireland until the year 2020.  My Department is advised that this review has now been completed.The HSE will be arranging for discussions with the social partners and other interested parties around the findings of the Review in the context of the future development of both hospital and community based services.

I have made enquiries of the Registrar General and the position is as set out as follows.As a general rule, marriages are legally recognised in Ireland if they are celebrated in accordance with the applicable laws relating to marriage of the country in which they are solemnised.For a couple to contract a valid marriage, they must possess the capacity to marry and the necessary legal formalities must be observed.  Capacity to marry is determined by the laws applicable in the jurisdiction in which each party is domiciled.  The formalities are those required by the lex locus celebrations (i.e. the laws of the place where the marriage is celebrated).Under Section 33 of the Family Law Act 1995, a marriage solemnised outside the State where, at the time the marriage is solemnised either or both of the parties was under 18 years, and where no court exemption was obtained, is invalid.  This provision applies to persons ordinarily resident in the State.When Irish citizens marry abroad, it is important that such marriages are not polygamous or potentially polygamous, that they are registered with the civil authorities of the jurisdiction in which the marriage is solemnised, and that a certified copy of the entry in the register of marriages can be obtained.Where a doubt as to the validity of a marriage exists, Section 29 of the Family Law Act 1995 provides that an application may be made to the Circuit Family Court for an order declaring, inter alia, that a marriage was at its inception a valid marriage.  Recognition of the validity or otherwise of any marriage is therefore a matter for the Circuit Family Court and there are no plans to change the existing legislation at the present time.

As the Deputy is aware there are some provisions in relation to convicted sex offenders which makes it a criminal offence for a convicted sex offender to apply for employment involving children.  I assume, however, that the Deputy is referring to a register similar to those operated by the neighbouring jurisdiction whereby persons who have not been convicted of an offence but in relation to whom there is sufficient concern based upon information available to the statutory authorities that they should not be permitted to seek employment with children and vulnerable adults.  A key component of such a register referred to above is the ability to exchange information, which would fall short of the threshold for prosecution or conviction and to receive such information from third parties, employers, etc and to act upon it.I am advised that currently constitutional difficulties would arise in trying to legislate to effectively establish such a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children. As the Deputy is aware, an amendment to the Constitution addressing provision for legislation on the collection and exchange of information relating to the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of children or risk thereof , of children or other persons is one of a number of issues addressed by the Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2007. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which is being established, will examine the proposed amendment in the Bill with a view to further deepening consensus on this matter. It is envisaged that the published Bill will provide a framework for the work of the Committee. It is planned to consider the introduction of the legislation that the Deputy refers to in the context of the outcome of the work of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.

Some HSE areas have placed public patients with eating disorders in St Patrick's Hospital and St John of God's private facilities when required.  In a limited number of cases, consultants make referrals to other specialised eating disorder private services in Dublin or the UK.The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, entitled "A Vision for Change", which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health service over a 7 to 10 year period.  "A Vision for Change" acknowledges gaps in the current provision of services for people with eating disorders and makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services.Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, training on eating disorders for undergraduate and postgraduate training of health professionals, the further development of primary and community care services including the management of eating disorders in children and adolescents by the child and adolescent community mental health teams, the creation of specialist multidisciplinary adult teams and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.A sum of €750,000 has been allocated to the HSE in 2007 to develop services for the treatment of eating disorders.  €500,000 of this funding was provided to enhance the service in the Elm Mount Unit, St Vincent's Hospital, Dublin and the balance of €250,000 has been allocated to HSE South to commence the development of an eating disorder service.  In addition, funding was provided for the development of 16 child and adolescent community mental health teams in 2006 and 2007.

It particularly highlights the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards.  It recommends that there be one major regional hospital in the North East, supported by the five existing local hospitals.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24-hour basis and also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.The reconfiguration process is being overseen by a HSE Steering Group.  The specific issue relating to time-scale is a matter for the HSE.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to have this particular issue investigated and to reply directly to the deputy.

As the Act provides that the enhanced inspection function will be taken over by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), draft standards (prepared by a Working Group chaired by the Department of Health and Children) were formally referred to HIQA in January 2007 for consultation and finalisation.  The Authority established a wide-ranging Working Group to finalise the draft standards.   The group held its first meeting on 30th January and has met on a regular basis since.On 8 August, 2007 the Authority published their draft for public consultation prior to finalising the standards.  Members of the public, service users, their families, service providers and all those with an interest in residential care for older people were invited to submit their views on the draft before Monday 17 September 2007.The results of the public consultation were discussed at the most recent meeting of the HIQA Working Group on Friday 19th October.  It is proposed to hold 2 further meetings of the Working Group to finalise the standards.  The next step in the process will involve the standards being referred to the Minister for approval.  Following this, Regulations will be drafted to give statutory underpinning to the Standards.In the interim, the HSE is continuing to inspect private nursing homes using the 1993 Care and Welfare Regulations.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	432	In December 2006 the Minister announced that the subvention scheme would be replaced by a new nursing home support scheme — A Fair Deal. It is intended to have the legislation for the scheme in place by 1 January 2008.This scheme will apply to everyone who needs nursing home care, whether a person holds a medical card or not.  Most older people in long-term care already have medical cards since they are 70 years and older.The proposed new scheme aims to remedy the inequities that exist in the current system. At present, people face greatly different costs depending on whether they are in public or private nursing homes. In addition, individual contributions in public places are based on a flat rate regardless of an individual's wealth, whereas State support for individuals in private places is based on means testing. This means that many people in private nursing homes get no support, and even with subvention, people can face costs they cannot afford. The result is that some people are forced to sell or mortgage their homes to pay for care costs.In contrast, the new nursing home support scheme will ensure that long-term residential care is affordable for all who need it. Contributions during a person's life will be affordable and they will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution. Furthermore, a person's family will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care.The new scheme will be based on national standard processes, ensuring that people with the same means contribute the same amount towards their care regardless of whether they are in a public or private nursing home and regardless of where they live.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The publication, OECD Health at a Glance 2007, provides comparable key health data up to and including 2005 across a range of measurements on health and health systems in OECD countries. These data are valuable in benchmarking Ireland against our OECD counterparts. The overall picture presented is of substantial and continuing improvement. In those specific areas where the data show us performing less well than other OECD countries, the objective is to concentrate our efforts to realise the necessary improvements. Some of the main areas covered in the Report are discussed below.In relation to matters such as life expectancy and infant mortality, Ireland scores well. The report notes that life expectancy in Ireland stands at 79.5 years in 2005. This is above the OECD average of 78.6 and the EU27 average. Infant mortality rates in Ireland have fallen dramatically over the last few decades. The rate is 4 deaths per 1000 live births in 2005, lower than the OECD average of 5.4.Between 1980 and 2004, our mortality rates for ischemic heart disease and stroke have fallen by 55% and 66% respectively.Over the same period (1980 to 2004), the mortality rate for all cancers together has fallen by 9%.  For breast cancer, the five year relative survival rate in Ireland is 79.7% for the period 1999 to 2004 which shows an improvement over the period 1994 to 1998 when the rate was 73%.  However, it is clear that there is room for improvement in the mortality rates and that this has already been clearly set out in the Strategy for Cancer Control. The two most important contributors to improving this pattern will be enhanced access to earlier diagnosis (through screening roll-out) and the implementation of the O'Higgins Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services which will concentrate services in fewer centres and enable the monitoring of quality of these services.Ireland ranks high in terms of the percentage of adults reporting to be in good health. 83% of Irish people rated their health to be good or very good or excellent compared with the OECD average of 69%, placing Ireland in 6th position.The report notes that total expenditure on health accounted for 7.5% of GDP in Ireland in 2005.  When calculated as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI), which does not include exported profits, the figure rises to 8.8% which puts Ireland close to the OECD average of 9%. Using the measure of current health expenditure as a share of actual final consumption, Ireland scores above the OECD average with a 13.5% share of final consumption allocated to health compared with an OECD average of 12.8%.Ireland's health spending per capita is 2,926 US$ (adjusted for purchasing power parity) which is above the OECD average of 2,759 US$. In terms of the annual average growth rate in real health expenditure per capita between 1995 and 2005, Ireland has the third highest growth rate of 7.2% behind Luxembourg and Korea and ahead of the OECD average of 4%.The public share of total expenditure on health in Ireland in 2005 was 78%, above the OECD average of 73%.Ireland had the highest annual average growth rate in pharmaceutical expenditure per capita between 1995 and 2005 at 7.6% compared with an OECD average of 4.6%.The report notes that Ireland has 2.8 acute hospital beds per 1,000 population compared with an OECD average of 3.9. However, the data for Ireland does not include acute beds located in private hospitals and would need to be adjusted to reflect our relatively young population. The share of population aged 65 and over was 11.2% in 2005, the fourth lowest and well below the OECD average of 14.7%.The OECD report notes that Ireland is above the average in terms of the number of nurses per 1000 population in 2005. There has been an increase of 45% in the number of whole-time nurses employed in the public health service since 1997.With regard to medical manpower, the Report shows 2.8 physicians per 1,000 population in Ireland in 2005 which is just below the average for the OECD of 3 per 1,000. A Government initiative on medical education and training, announced in February 2006, will involve a more than doubling of the medical school places for EU students from 305 to 725.  An additional 110 EU undergraduate places were provided between 2006 and 2007, and the first 60 graduate entry places were provided in 2007.The report notes that 63% of the over 65s in Ireland receive the influenza vaccine which is higher than the OECD average of 55.3%. The figure for the UK is 75% and Australia has the highest coverage rate of 79.1%.The report also shows that Ireland has the second highest alcohol consumption with 13.5 litres per capita for the population aged 15 years and over. The OECD average was 9.5.

An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in health care settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.The availability of isolation facilities is an important factor in the overall solution to this issue.  I have already agreed with the HSE that designated private beds should be used where such facilities are required for patients who contract MRSA and this policy has been adopted by the HSE.  The need generally for more isolation facilities for infection control purposes has already been taken into account in the planning of new buildings in recent years.  In addition, new environmental building guidelines are being prepared by the HSE to inform infection control policy in all future new builds and refurbishments.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.Details of the number of medical card and GP visit card holders are provided to my Department each month by the Health Service Executive. The figures are provided on a net basis showing the balance after new cards have been issued and other cards, as appropriate, have been deleted from the Executive's database, e.g. following a review of an applicant's circumstances.The following table shows the number of medical cards and GP visit cards as at 1st of November 2007 and at 1st of November 2006.Card Type1st November 20061st November 2007No. of Medical Cards1,216,3441,270,873No. of GP Visit Cards42,02674,671Total1,258,3701,345,544
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 202 together.Government policy is to provide safe, high-quality services that achieve the best possible outcomes for patients in line with best practice.  This objective guides the configuration and development of services and outweighs all other considerations.  This is not a resource issue, but a patient safety one.The delivery of hospital services needs to be re-balanced so that, in the future, those services that can be safely delivered locally are delivered locally, more complex services requiring specialist input are concentrated at regional centres, and highly specialised services are delivered in national centres.This issue has come to the fore most recently in the case of cancer care. There is an abundance of strong, international evidence to show that patients with cancer have the best chance of survival if they are treated by clinicians who treat a large number of patients with a similar condition per year.  To secure these benefits requires a consolidation of cancer treatment services to a smaller number of centres.A clear case for the re-organisation of the delivery of cancer services in Ireland was articulated by the National Cancer Forum, a multi-disciplinary group of experts.   Having reviewed patterns of surgical activity in Ireland, the Forum concluded that "the current arrangements for the delivery of cancer services are not generally in accordance with best practice and cannot be recommended to deliver best-quality cancer care".The Strategy recommended a move towards eight cancer centres nationally to ensure that cancer patients have access to consistently high quality care and the best chance of survival.The HSE Advisory Group on Cancer Control, also a multi-disciplinary group of experts, advised on the hospitals to be designated as cancer centres nationally.  The decisions of the HSE in relation to four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.   Professor Keane, interim Director of the National Cancer Control Programme, took up his post this week.  The delivery of cancer services on a programmatic basis will serve to ensure equity of access to services and equality of patient outcome irrespective of geography.  Professor Keane will be engaging in detailed planning to facilitate the orderly phased transfer of services between locations.Last June, I approved National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services under the Health Act 2007.  The aim of the standards is to ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible outcome.  As a first step in implementing the Standards, the Executive has directed thirteen hospitals with low case volumes (less than twenty procedures per year) to cease breast cancer services immediately, to be followed by further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services.In summary, the optimum configuration of health services is a complex and difficult issue. It needs to be managed in a consistent and coherent manner to ensure that we provide high quality and safe services to the population.

I would point out that there is a range of provisions in legislation to address circumstances where complaints arise. I refer to: Part 9 of the Health Act 2004 and the Health Act 2004 (Complaints) Regulations 2006; The Disability Act 2005; The Mental Health Act 2001 (Approved Centres) Regulations 2006; The Medical Practitioners Acts 1978 to 2007; The Nurses Act (1985); Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005; and The Pharmacy Act 2007.In relation to Part 9 of the Health Act 2004, I would point out that a complainant is also entitled to refer his or her complaint to the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children, as appropriate, where he or she is dissatisfied with the recommendation made or any of the steps taken by the Health Service Executive or service provider in relation to the complaint.The Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance was established by me in January this year to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure that quality and safety of care for patients is paramount within the health care system. The Commission is due to report to me next June. Should there be any recommendations made by the Commission in relation to the handling of complaints from patients, I will be happy to consider them.

The HSE has confirmed that it will have in place radiation oncology capacity to meet the needs of the population by 2010.  After 2010 the HSE will continue to increase capacity to ensure that these needs continue to be met.  I am fully confident that this will be achieved through a combination of direct Exchequer provision, PPP and where appropriate, the use of the private sector.

To date, 44 applications have been received for 2007 in line with this process and 24 of these have been approved.According to the Health Service Personnel Census, there were 17,262 whole time equivalents in the overall Management/Administration category on 31 December 2006 and 18,421 in this category on 30 September 2007.As operational responsibility for the Health Service Personnel Census rests with the Health Service Executive, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to provide the Deputy with further detailed information in relation to posts at Grade VIII level and above.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 203 together.MRSA is not a notifiable disease.  However, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE collects data on MRSA.  The data is collected on the first episode of blood stream infection of MRSA per patient per quarter.  This system showed that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005 and 588 in 2006.  Figures for the first six months of 2007 show that there were 292 cases.The increase in reported cases of MRSA bloodstream infection between 2002 and 2006 is directly related to improved surveillance.  In 2002, 23 laboratories in Ireland were reporting into the system.  By 2006 the number of laboratories reporting had increased to 42.  Between 2002 and 2006 both the proportion of MRSA and the bloodstream infection rate have remained unchanged at 42% and 0.15 cases per 1,000 bed days used, respectively.  Data for this year, to date, suggests that the number of reported cases of MRSA bloodstream infection for 2007 will not be significantly different from 2006 or preceding years.A new National Surveillance System has recently been established to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis on four key areas, to monitor Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) in our health care system: Staphylococcus bacteraemia; Antibiotic consumption; Alcohol gel use; and MRSA surveillance in Intensive Care Units.  The first report is expected shortly and eventually 52 hospitals and 30 local health offices will report into this system.Tackling HCAIs, including MRSA is a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The HSE has established a National Infection Control Action Plan.  An Infection Control Steering Group, chaired by Dr. Pat Doorley, National Director (Population Health) is responsible for overseeing implementation of the plan.  Over the next three to five years, the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infections by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  Achievement of these targets will benefit all patients who are at risk.  These targets will be achieved through the development of national and local level action plans to reduce the potential for spread of infections between persons in health care settings, and, in addition, will focus on reducing antibiotic use in Ireland.  The Steering Group is supported by eight Local Implementation Teams which will ensure that all local facilities are focused on achieving the national targets.The HSE has appointed a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.  I have instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contact MRSA.While accepting that not all HCAIs are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.  The first report of the HSE's new National Surveillance System will provide a sound basis for assessment of results of the improvement measures into the future.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The Strategic Task Force on Alcohol, which was established in January 2002, published two reports which together provide approximately 100 recommendations across a wide range of sectors.  Many of the recommendations are cross sectoral and require the cooperation of different stakeholders. My Department is maintaining a coordinating role in relation to alcohol policy and is continuing to pursue implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force.  To date progress has also been made in terms of research projects, the delivery of Responsible Server Training, awareness raising campaigns etc. Work is also continuing in a number of other areas.A number of the recommendations contained in the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol concern a reduction in the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, marketing and sponsorship. In response to these, the Department entered into negotiations with the broadcasting, media and drinks industries to restrict alcohol advertising, sponsorship and sales promotions / marketing practices. This resulted in the establishment of Central Copy Clearance Ireland which addresses the issue of the content of alcohol advertisements. A Voluntary Code of Practice on Advertising was also agreed which addresses the issue of placement of advertising.  The Alcohol Marketing and Communications Monitoring Body was put in place to oversee the implementation of the Voluntary Codes.The first Annual Report of the Alcohol Marketing Communications Monitoring Body for 2006 was submitted to the Minister for Health and Children for consideration on 19th July 2007.  Following consideration of the Report my Department has decided to commence discussions with the relevant stakeholders with a view to strengthening and expanding the current voluntary codes on alcohol marketing and communications in order to provide significantly greater protection for children and young people. I will give further consideration to the possibility of using legislation in this area depending on the outcome of these discussions.With regard to sponsorship of sporting and youth events by alcohol companies my Department intends to raise this issue with the alcohol industry representatives during the course of the broader discussions on advertising and marketing referred to already.Earlier this year, the Government approved the allocation close to €1 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support 19 community-based projects aimed at tackling Alcohol Related Harm.  The intention of this funding is to facilitate interventions and supports to strengthen community-based responses to alcohol related harm.While a number of youth cafés have emerged around the country on an ad hoc basis, an integrated approach is now proposed in the provision of youth cafés. The launch of the National Recreation Policy in September this year highlighted the Government's commitment to the development of youth cafés. Consideration is being given to how best to develop a coherent structured programme for the development of youth cafés as well as the most appropriate lead agency for the management and administration of a funding scheme.On alcohol treatment and early interventions, the Health Service Executive is continuing to work with the Irish College of General Practitioners in respect of leading out brief interventions and treatment in primary care settings.  The HSE is also working towards the establishment of systematic screening and brief interventions in acute hospital settings.In 2006 a Report entitled "Working Together to Reduce the Harms Caused by Alcohol Misuse" was produced by a Working Group established under the Sustaining Progress Special Initiative on Alcohol and Drugs Misuse.  The Working Group agreed on a programme of actions to deliver targeted results in relation to underage drinking, binge drinking and drink driving. An Implementation Group has now been established to monitor and report on progress on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.  The Implementation Group's membership comprises key stakeholders in Government Departments and Agencies and the Social Partners and is expected to report by early 2008.  My Department continues to actively support the work of the Implementation Group which is considering a broad range of issues such as alcohol labelling and the development of a voluntary Code of Practice for the Sale and Promotion of Alcohol in the off-trade/retail sector.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 to 137, inclusive, together.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the value added generated in the total economy from the production of goods and services, valued at market prices. Gross National Product (GNP) differs from GDP by the value of "net factor incomes” to or from abroad and is measured only at national level. Factor incomes are incomes from investment (including profits), compensation of employees and current transfers. Factor incomes to and from the country as a whole are reported in the official Balance of Payments. However in common with other countries they are not measured between regions within Ireland nor between regions and the rest of the world and for this reason GNP is not available for the regions in Ireland nor is GNP generally calculated on a regional basis in other countries. In Ireland the outflows of factor incomes exceed inflows and the net position (i.e. outflows minus inflows for the years 2000 to 2006) as published in the latest National Income statistics is as follows:2000200120022003200420052006Net factor Outflows15,48818,97523,69921,72323,21525,77525,575The value of GDP and GNP for the years 2000 to 2006 is given in the following table:2000200120022003200420052006GDP104,620116,939130,215139,413148,502161,498174,705GNP89,13297,964106,515117,691125,286135,723149,130Outflows of Direct Foreign Investment IncomeThe category "direct investment income" published in the Balance of Payments covers income accruing to an Irish or foreign direct investor from their ownership (or part ownership) of a direct investment enterprise located abroad (in the case of an Irish investor) or in Ireland (in the case of a foreign investor). Income, in this category, accruing to foreign direct investors from their enterprises in Ireland amounted to €31,448 ml. in 2006 and €32,817 ml. in 2005. Note that these figures exceed the net factor incomes shown in the table above, as there are also significant inflows of other factor incomes into Ireland. "Direct Investment Income" in the balance of payments includes the declared entrepreneurial income of the foreign investors (or the share of it accruing to foreigners) whether remitted abroad or not. This is standard international practice. Data on foreign outflows are not available for the regions within Ireland. Full details of the above data are published in "National income and Expenditure 2006" and in the latest Balance of Payments release which are on the CSO's website.GDP for NUTS II regionsStrictly speaking it is not appropriate to speak of GDP at the level of regions within a country. A related concept GVA (gross value added) is used instead. GVA (at basic prices) equals GDP minus product taxes plus product subsidies. Because distributing product taxes (e.g. vat, excise duties etc.) between regions can distort the comparisons of the amount of value added that is generated in each region GVA is the standard measure between regions. GVA for NUTS II regions for the years 2000 to 2004 are shown as follows.Border, Midland and WesternSouthern and EasternState Total200017,64975,29692,946200119,76285,353105,116200221,36295,679117,041200323,398101,374124,773200425,509105,916131,427The equivalent GVA per capita for these regions for the years 2000 to 2004 is shown as follows.Border, Midland and WesternSouthern and Eastern200017,61126,917200119,43630,043200220,57633,232200322,12734,700200423,63735,727Since GVA is essentially the sum of compensation of employees and profits generated in a region the differences between the absolute levels in the regions arise from population differences and different levels of profits and wages in the regions.  The per capita differences reflect different levels of wages and profits per person in the regions.Full details of these data are available in the release "County Incomes and Regional GDP 2004" on the CSO's website.It may also be worth noting that the CSO publishes regional figures on household incomes.  These figures do not include company profits. The per capita household incomes in the NUTS II regions for the years 2000 to 2004 are provided as follows.Border, Midland and WesternSouthern and Eastern200015,65418,296200117,45220,487200218,90321,767200320,07822,670200421,44023,869

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Under Section 28 (2) of the State Property Act 1954, the Minister for Finance assumes responsibility for all personal property and land vested in or held in trust by a body corporate (other than personal property or land held by such body in trust for another person) immediately prior to its dissolution. Upon the dissolution of the body corporate, such property becomes State property.  The effect of Section 28 is that the Minister does not hold the assets of dissolved companies as beneficial owner.  He holds them in trust.  The title which the Minister acquires under this section has been described as a defeasible title since, if the dissolved company is restored to the Register of Companies within twenty years of the date of its dissolution, its property is automatically restored to it.In regard to the case which is the subject of the current question, I am advised that the transactions referred to have no connection with my Department as the dates on which they are alleged to have occurred all predate 23 December, 1986, the date on which the company which held the title to the estate referred to was dissolved by being struck off the Register of Companies.The company in question was restored to the Register of Companies in December 2006. This had the effect that such interest in the estate as was held by the company at the date of its dissolution reverted to the company upon its restoration.  Consequently, the State has no interest in the property at present.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	456	The Deputy may recall that I have answered Parliamentary Questions on this issue over the past year, including on 4 July 2007 and in recent weeks.  The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However, the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintains that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  In this regard the Commission's decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission's behest, my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.  In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments which have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU state aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.

The project is being undertaken pursuant to the Government's Decentralisation Programme and will comprise approximately 20,000 square metres in office and ancillary space.  The project will be delivered as part of a major PPP contract that also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Carlow and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.  Following evaluation of Expressions of Interest received from developers, five candidates were short-listed and were invited to submit tenders.  Tenders were received in September 2007 and are currently being examined.  It is anticipated that a successful tenderer will be selected by the end of the year.  The successful tenderer will be required to apply for planning permission in respect of the three locations prior to awarding of the contract.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	459	Inflation as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is the appropriate measure of inflation as it excludes the effects of interest rate changes.  Including mortgage interest rate adjustments in the measure of inflation distorts the underlying inflationary trend.  Using the HICP, the purchasing power of the Irish Punt declined by 38% between November 1997 and October 2007.  Thus £1 in November 1997 would now be worth just over 72p, which is equivalent to 92 cent.  If the traditional domestic measure of inflation — the Consumer Price Index — was used, then the purchasing power of the Irish Punt declined by 42.8% over the period.  This would mean that £1 in November 1997 would be worth approximately 70p today.  This 70p is equivalent to almost 89 cent.  The euro replaced the Punt on January 1st 2002.  The Punt was converted to euro at a rate of £1 = €1.269738.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide an estimate of the amount of unclaimed tax refunds for the years in question.  This is because the Revenue Commissioners can only allow reliefs and credits on the basis of the information that is known to them.  Consequently, there is no way to accurately assess underclaimed entitlements where changes in individual circumstances have not been notified by the taxpayers concerned.  The Revenue Commissioners are confident that the majority of taxpayers claim the reliefs to which they are entitled.  For instance so far in 2007 almost 750,000 repayment claims, dealing with the years 2003 to 2007 inclusive, have been processed.  The Revenue Commissioners are constantly reminding taxpayers of their entitlements.  Every year, for example, every PAYE taxpayer gets a notice with his or her determination of tax credits outlining the full list of reliefs available.  They also get a short leaflet listing the most common credits that are available.  Over the last two years, the Revenue Commissioners have undertaken a number of public information campaigns to make people aware of their entitlements and to encourage claims.  The response to these campaigns has been encouraging.In relation to the granting of credits and reliefs, the policy of the Revenue Commissioners is that, once claimed, the majority of them are generally carried forward automatically from year to year by the Revenue computer system, without any need for the taxpayer to lodge a further claim.  In addition, many more significant reliefs are granted through the Tax Relief At Source arrangement.  For example, mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief are provided at source through the taxpayer obtaining a reduction in repayments or premiums equivalent to the tax reliefs.  Recurring reliefs, like those for trade union subscriptions or bin charges, once claimed, are allowed on an ongoing basis and reappear each year in the taxpayer's certificate of tax credits.  Additionally this year the Revenue Commissioners automatically grant age related credits and they will, in 2008, automatically generate refunds of tax in respect of unreimbursed expenditure incurred under the drugs payment scheme.  The Revenue Commissioners are being proactive in offering taxpayers every assistance and advice in relation to claiming reliefs and credits and, together with the variety of service channels which the Revenue Commissioners have put in place, they are being given the opportunity to do this in the most efficient and customer friendly way possible.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Under the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003, credit institutions and insurance undertakings are required each April to transfer to the National Treasury Management Agency, all moneys falling dormant in the previous year.  Each credit institution and insurance undertaking is also required under the legislation to keep a register of their dormant accounts or policies and to notify persons whose accounts or policies are due to fall dormant before transferring the money to the Fund each year.  The dormancy period for bank and savings accounts is 15 years.  The total value of unclaimed accounts as at 30 September 2007 transferred to the fund since the scheme's inception and which has not yet been reclaimed  assets which have become dormant and remain so, is €256.7 million.  In addition there is a further €37.2 million in respect of unclaimed life policies and €4.4 million in respect of the Escheated Estate Fund.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Deputy may recall that I have answered Parliamentary Questions on this issue over the past year, including on 4 July 2007 and in recent weeks.  The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States.  In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.  While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However, the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintains that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable.  In this regard the Commission's decision was published on its website in March 2007.  At the Commission's behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments who have primary responsibility in this regard are, in conjunction with my Department, exploring alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided, subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.  In the interim the reduced rates applicable to fuel used will be maintained.  Details of the tax relief granted to particular taxpayers are confidential between the Revenue Commissioners and those taxpayers.  However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the following table provides the overall repayments made under the Passenger Road Services Scheme for the years 2002 to date:YearRepayments€200223,899,253200324,385,812200425,389,778200529,196,361200627,382,1702007 to October25,576,116
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	469	The Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme provides relief from VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (up to a certain limit) on the purchase of an adapted car for transport of a person with specific severe and permanent physical disabilities, as well as relief from excise on the fuel used in the car, up to a certain limit.  The disability criteria for these concessions are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  To get a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Regulations.  As the Deputy will be aware, there was an interdepartmental review of the Scheme.  However, given the scale and the scope of the scheme, any possible changes can only be made after careful consideration and with regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme and the available resources.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The one-parent family tax credit is a credit that can be claimed by a single parent (whether widowed, single, deserted, separated or divorced) who has a dependent child resident with him/her for the whole or part of the relevant tax year.  The Revenue Commissioners deem this requirement to be met if the child is so resident for at least one night during the year.  The payment or non-payment of maintenance, as the case may be, by such a single parent is not a determining factor in entitlement to the one-parent family tax credit in respect of children of a claimant.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 requires the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to arrange for an actuarial review of the financial condition of the Social Insurance Fund to be conducted every five years.  The most recent actuarial review, which covers the period from 2005 to 2061, was published on 17 October 2007.  One of the Review's principal findings was that, based on a central scenario with stated assumptions about demographic, economic and benefit developments over the period (the last assuming that future benefits would increase in line with future earnings), PRSI rates would have to increase over their present levels if income and expenditure on the Fund are to be balanced over the long term to 2061.  However, the Review estimated that if no change were made to PRSI contribution rates over that period, Social Insurance Fund expenditure would exceed Social Insurance Fund income by €35.3 billion in real terms in 2061, assuming benefits were increased in line with projected earnings growth.  Alternatively, the Review indicated that if future benefits were increased at the rate of projected price inflation over the same period, the Fund would remain in surplus for much of the period and expenditure would exceed the Fund's income by the much smaller amount of €1.5 billion in 2061.In a situation where future benefits are increased at the level of earnings growth and assuming no other change, the Exchequer, as residual financer of the Social Insurance Fund, would have to cover that shortfall.  While the proceeds of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was established for the purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of Social Welfare pensions and Public Service pensions from 2025 until at least 2055, will be available to meet some of these Social Insurance Fund subvention costs over some or all of this period, the Actuarial Review did not make any assumption about the scale of funds that could be made available to the Social Insurance Fund from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for that purpose, nor did it make an estimate of the scale of increases in the levels of income taxation, or indeed any other taxation head, that would be necessary to meet a shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund over the longer term, assuming no change to the existing PRSI regime or otherwise.  It should also be noted that the projected shortfall on the Social Insurance Fund (based on stated assumptions) that would have to be covered by the Exchequer out to 2061 is only one of the many long-term social welfare and other demands that would have to be financed by the Exchequer and that income taxation is only one of the range of income sources that would be available to the Exchequer to meet these demands.

Following the formation of the current Government the Taoiseach appointed four Ministers of State to this Department — the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith; the Minister of State with responsibility for Health Promotion and Food Safety, Deputy Pat Gallagher; the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability Issues and Mental Health, excluding discrimination, Deputy Jimmy Devins; and the Minister of State with responsibility for Older People, Deputy Máire Hoctor.  These appointments reflect the commitment of this Government to the priority it is giving to these key areas of health policy.  As the areas of responsibility of the three previous Ministers of State have been re-allocated it is not possible to identify one specific additional appointment.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of services to prevent and reduce further tragic loss of life.  In September 2005, "Reach Out" — a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention, 2005-2014 was launched.  The strategy provides a policy framework for suicide prevention activities in Ireland until 2014.  The strategy calls for a multi-sectoral approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour in order to foster cooperation between health, education, community, voluntary and private sector agencies.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention oversees the implementation of the strategy and has taken on board the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the high levels of suicide in Irish society, which are consistent with the actions identified in "Reach Out".  Additional funding of €1.2 million and €1.85 million was provided in 2006 and 2007 respectively for the implementation of the Strategy which brings the overall funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to €8 million.  This funding is being used to develop and implement national training programmes, develop mental health awareness campaigns, complete the availability of self-harm services through accident and emergency departments, implement recommendations arising from a review of bereavement services and  support voluntary organisations working in the field of suicide prevention.

The funding, management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the HSE under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, A Vision for Change, acknowledges gaps in the current provision for forensic mental health services and recognises that such services should be available in all areas where law enforcement agents are likely to encounter individuals with severe mental health problems.  The Report makes several recommendations for the further improvement of these services including the provision of four additional multi-disciplinary community based forensic mental health teams.  The Government has accepted the Report as the basis for the future development of our mental health services.  Implementation of the individual recommendations of A Vision for Change is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country.  The HSE intends to publish an implementation plan shortly which is to include a timed and prioritised set of short, medium and longer term goals.  The Forensic Mental Health Service functions mainly as an in-reach service to prisons, providing clinics and consultations on request, and where necessary, advising on the transfer of persons to the Central Mental Hospital.  Staffing in the Forensic Mental Health Service has been increased to seven consultant psychiatrists and six fully staffed, multi-disciplinary teams.  This has enabled the HSE to further strengthen forensic mental health services in 2007, with the assignment of one consultant psychiatrist and appropriate staff, on a full-time basis, to the remand prisons.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	477	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.  Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable child care to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community child care services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which will be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement, will see a weekly subvention in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under one year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.  The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data received this month.  Where appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued this week from the Child care Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Group under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, which manages the day-to-day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.

I have been informed that the HSE is in regular contact with the supplier, and is doing all it can do to ensure delivery of the vaccine at the earliest possible juncture.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to stockpile the vaccine in advance as it has a very short shelf life.  It is anticipated that the HSE will receive fresh stocks of the vaccine in early January.

On 31 October last, the Health Service Executive announced the details of the High Level Framework Brief for the new hospital.  The Brief was prepared by Rawlinson, Kelly and Whittlestone Limited, an established UK-based health care planning company.  The content of the report was also informed by the views of a range of international experts, including architectural, clinical and nursing experts. The Brief sets out the recommended model of care, the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital through an Ambulatory/Urgent Care Service.  It will help to inform the work of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in planning, designing, building and equipping the new hospital.  The Brief includes a detailed assessment of the capacity of the Mater Hospital site to accommodate the space requirements of the new hospital, and a maternity hospital, to meet expected demand up to 2021.  The analysis indicates that all the requirements can be accommodated on the site, and still allow expansion capacity beyond 2021.  The analysis found that the site offers a development area of 140,000 square metres.  The overall space requirement for core services at the new hospital is 90,000 square metres.  When ancillary services including Education, Training, Research, Medical Genetics and Parents Accommodation are included, the total requirement is 103,600 square metres.  There is also sufficient space to comfortably accommodate a new maternity hospital on-site.The total projected bed requirement for the hospital to 2021 ranges from 352 to 454 beds.  The estimated space requirements for the hospital have been calculated based on the upper range of bed numbers.  The Brief includes provision for all in-patients to be accommodated in single en-suite rooms, allows for the provision of on-site accommodation for parents and families, and allows for education, training and research facilities to be developed on-site.  The Hospital will be at the centre of a national paediatric network, linked to regional and local hospitals, and to primary and community care services, through outreach, telemedicine, joint appointments and staff rotation.  A network of Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centres (A/UCCs) will be established, to be operated by the new hospital.  The first of these will be developed at Tallaght.  The development of the National Paediatric Hospital will involve the transfer of services from the three existing children's hospitals in Dublin.  My Department is advised that the site occupied by Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin is held in trust by the Board of the hospital.

The Group in question has been approved €1.16 million in capital grant assistance under the EOCP to date.  A request for payment of the last instalment of €45,402 has been submitted by the Group.  I understand from my inquiries that Pobal, which administers the day-to-day operation of the scheme, is awaiting outstanding information from the Group before payment can be made.  The Group has requested additional capital funding under the EOCP.  In September 2007 the Programme Appraisal Committee, having considered all the information available, agreed with the recommendation of Pobal that the level of funding approved to date per child care place had already exceeded the benchmark under the Programme of €24,000 per place.  The Group was notified of this outcome.  It was also approved a staffing grant of €74,750 in December 2006 of which the first instalment of €25,400 has been made.  A similar amount should be received by the group some time next week.  I understand that Pobal does not at this stage believe it is likely that all the funding approved will be spent and reported by the closure deadline of the EOCP, which is the end of December 2007.  Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing EOCP staffing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1 July 2008, provided they enter the new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme by submitting the data required as part of the application process of the new scheme.

In 2005, the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  They are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore asked the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased. This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of people who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.In addition to the availability of medical cards, in 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  At 31st October 2007, 74,761 people held a GP visit card.  Therefore, 31.74% of the national population currently have free access to GP services through either the medical card or GP visit card.

The decision is designed to ensure that radiation oncology, one element of cancer care, is integrated with all other aspects of care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  I am convinced that this model will provide better patient centred treatment with improved quality of service and outcome for patients. The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in this regard.  A transfer on similar lines took place last year in Northern Ireland when radiation oncology services transferred to Belfast City Hospital, a major academic teaching hospital.  In progressing the transfer, I will build on the expertise and ethos of St. Luke's.  I have ensured that experts at St. Luke's are centrally involved in the planning and delivery of the National Plan.The transfer of services from St. Luke's Hospital to new facilities at St. James's Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years.  In the meantime, two additional linear accelerators will be commissioned at St. Luke's in early 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned later in 2008.  These will provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents. With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents. Community childcare services will receive subventions to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees to parents who are in receipt of social security and social assistance payments or parents who are engaged in education, training or work experience programmes where an underlying entitlement to such a payment is established.  Parents in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008. While it is not possible to comment on the specific impact of the new Scheme in the case of an individual parent, a parent in receipt of a Back to Education Allowance and using a community childcare service, would be expected to benefit from a reduction in childcare costs based on the full rate of subvention available to the service under the Scheme.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The Minister for Transport is the main shareholder in the ten companies. Each board has up to twelve members in accordance with the Act. Staff and budgets are an operational  matter for the companies.Rosslare Europort falls outside the scope of the Harbours Acts but is owned and operated by the CIE Group. Greenore Port in Co. Louth is a privately owned port in which Dublin Port Company has a 50% shareholding.There are currently 10 harbour authorities under the provisions of the Harbours Act 1946:Arklow Harbour CommissionersBantry Bay Harbour Commissioners Bantry Bay Harbour Commissioners were established under the Harbours Act 1976.Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour CommissionersKilrush Urban District CouncilKinsale Harbour CommissionersRiver Moy CommissionersTralee and Fenit Harbour CommissionersWestport Harbour CommissionersWexford Harbour CommissionersYoughal Urban District Council.Membership of the harbour authorities varies in accordance with the provisions of the legislation.  Staff and budgets of the harbour authorities are operational matters for the authorities themselves.Two harbour authorities transferred to local authority control in 2006 (Sligo and Annagassan). Dingle was designated a Fishery Harbour Centre in 2007 by the Minister of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, with the consent of the Minister for Transport. Accordingly, these three bodies ceased to function as harbour authorities under the Harbours Acts.

The provision of public bus services by Bus Éireann on specific routes to serve particular areas is an operational matter for the company.  However the company is required to notify my Department in advance of any proposals to introduce services on new routes or alter existing services.  I can confirm that my Department received a notification from Bus Eireann for a service from Tullow to Dublin.  There is no other application from Bus Éireann in respect of services to or from Tullow.Section 25(1) of the Transport Act 1958 provides that the consent of the Minister for Transport is required where State companies wish to introduce or alter a passenger road service where such service would compete with a licensed passenger road service provided by a private bus operator.  In accordance with section 25(2), the decision made by the Minister under section 25(1) is final.My Department concluded that in this instance the proposed service would compete with an existing service licensed by a private operator in accordance with the Road Transport Act 1932.  Therefore, on 30 April 2007 my Department informed Bus Éireann that should they wish to pursue the introduction of this proposed service, the Company would be required to submit an application under Section 25 of the Road Transport Act, 1958.  To date no application in accordance with Section 25 of the Road Transport Act, 1958 has been received from Bus Éireann in respect of the proposed service.

The Department doesn't maintain a central log of all such interactions, although the majority of these over the past few years have related to driver testing.As part of the customer services arrangements the Department also monitors public satisfaction with its services through the commissioning of an independent customer satisfaction survey every two years.

In this respect a detailed spend analysis was carried out recently by the Department in the context of the development of a Corporate Procurement Plan.  The plan, which will be launched shortly, is being introduced to deliver strategic procurement practice and annual efficiency dividends.In addition, the Department is required as part of the Administrative Budget Agreement it has in place with the Department of Finance to provide an administrative efficiency dividend equivalent to 2% of its administrative spending.Formal reviews, with the focus on policy and key spending areas in particular, are also taking place as part of the Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative; examining spending in a systematic manner as part of a framework introduced to secure improved value for money from public expenditure.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The Mercantile Marine Act 1955 sets out the requirements for registering vessels in Ireland. Irish owned vessels over 15 net tons are required to be registered under the Act.  However, for vessels under 15 net tons, registration is voluntary and owners may register such a craft if they so wish.  Small leisure craft would fall into this category.The 1955 Act and the system of registration in Ireland is under review in my Department at present following a consultation process.  One of the issues being considered is how best to improve provision for the registration of leisure craft, including jet skis and other small craft.  Following completion of the current phase of the review it is intended that there will be further consultation with relevant stakeholders in the new year.Currently there is no legislative provision for the compulsory insurance of leisure craft but my Department would recommend that owners and operators of leisure craft should have appropriate insurance in place.

The principal expenditure of the Advisory Board relates to commissioning research and its budgets were as follows:YearBudget€200265,7272003608,6322004950,25720051,008,11920061,062,88420071,200,000The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) was appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee.  Its purpose is to advise the Minister, Minister of State and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education.  As an advisory body, the administration of DEAC is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and funded within its overall budget.The Díon Advisory Committee advises the Government and makes recommendations on Emigrant Services funding to voluntary organisations that work with vulnerable Irish people resident in Britain.  In February 2003, the funding allocation was transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The administration of the Committee is provided by our Embassy in London and financed within the Department's overall budget.The Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.  The Fulbright Commission enjoys autonomy of management and administration in accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991.  From 1997 until 2000 the Grant-in-Aid given to the Commission was £100,000 annually.  In 2001 the Grant-in-Aid figure was increased to €254,000 per annum and has remained at this level since then.The Hunger Task Force was established in September 2007, in line with the recommendation of the White Paper on Overseas Development Assistance, to identify the contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger.  The Task Force has been appointed for a period of six months, after which it will present a final report to the Minister of State with responsibility for Overseas Development.

The Shackleton Autumn School is a valuable forum in this regard.Issues concerning the Antarctic Treaty have been addressed most recently by the Government in a Seanad Adjournment Debate of 27 September, 2007 and in a PQ reply of 23 October, 2007.The stated aim of the Antarctic Treaty, which opened for signature on 1 December, 1959 and came into force in 1961, is to ensure "in the interests of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord."While the Treaty has been in operation since 1961, only 46, or fewer than one quarter of UN Member States, are States Parties.  Many of those who have chosen not to accede have argued that the Antarctic should be declared part of the common heritage of mankind and thus be treated in a manner comparable to Outer Space or the International Sea Bed Area and therefore beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.  Some have called for a UN agreement to which all Member States would subscribe as the best means to ensure full accountability for actions undertaken in, affecting and concerning Antarctica.While Ireland has traditionally been sympathetic to this view, we are aware of the immense difficulties which would arise in seeking to negotiate a new Treaty.  We have also noted that UN General Assembly Resolutions of 2002 and 2005 welcomed the practice whereby the Antarctic Treaty consultative parties regularly provide the UN Secretary General with information on their consultative meetings and their activities in Antarctica.In all the circumstances, it has been decided to re-examine the question of accession.  Officials in my Department, therefore, are currently studying the issues involved in accession, with a view to initiating broader interdepartmental consultation on the question.

These rights essentially relate to the merchantable quality of goods offered for sale and the requirements of diligence in relation to the manner in which services are supplied.  The Act does not convey any specific statutory right enabling a consumer to reclaim refunds in relation to contracts entered into for goods or services solely because the consumer no longer has any need for the product or service concerned.It is not clear from the details supplied with the Deputy's question as to the nature of the contract the person concerned entered into or the basis upon which the deposit was paid.  Given that this is essentially a matter of contract, the person concerned may wish to consult her legal adviser in relation to this matter.

Of this figure an amount of €116.669m. has been spent up to 31st  October 2007.  It should be noted, however, that grant payments to industry, which comprise the major portion of IDA's capital expenditure, are demand driven and the majority of such payments are made in the fourth quarter of the year.Figures are not broken down on a county-by-county basis.  The Agency's Financial Statements are published in the IDA Annual Report.  The latest Annual Report for the Agency is in respect of the year ended 31 December, 2006.

These efficiencies may be achieved, for example, by financing the cost of new services during the year from savings elsewhere in the Department's existing Administrative Budget allocation.Failure to achieve the efficiency savings in any year may result in a reduction, by the Department of Finance, in the allocation to my Department's running costs for the following year.  My Department has consistently been able to demonstrate that it has achieved the required level of efficiency savings.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 requires the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to arrange for an actuarial review of the financial condition of the Social Insurance Fund to be made every five years.  The most recent actuarial review, which covers the period from 2005 to 2061, was published on the 17th October 2007.One of the Review's principal findings was that, based on a central scenario with stated assumptions about demographic, economic and benefit developments over the period (the last assuming that future benefits will increase in line with future earnings), PRSI rates would have to increase over their present levels if income and expenditure on the Fund is to be balanced over the long term to 2061.  However, the Review estimated that if no change is made to PRSI contribution rates over that period, Social Insurance Fund expenditure would exceed Social Insurance Fund income by €35.3 billion by 2061.In such a situation and assuming no other change, the Exchequer, as residual financer of the Social Insurance Fund, would have to cover that shortfall.  While the proceeds of the National Pension Reserve Fund, which has been established for the purpose of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare pensions and public service pensions from the year 2025 until the year 2055, or such subsequent years as may be specified, will be available to meet some of these Social Insurance Fund subvention costs over some or all of this period, the Actuarial Review did not make any assumption about the scale of funds that would be available to the Social Insurance Fund from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for that purpose, nor did it make an estimate of the scale of increases in the levels of income taxation, or indeed any other taxation head, that would be necessary to meet a shortfall in the Social Insurance Fund over the longer term assuming no change to the existing PRSI regime or otherwise.It should also be noted that the projected shortfall on the Social Insurance Fund (based on stated assumptions) that would have to be covered by the Exchequer out to 2061 is only one of the many long term social welfare and other demands that would have to be financed by the Exchequer and that income taxation is only one of the range of income sources that would be available to the Exchequer to meet these demands.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities.  The second is the school meals (local projects) programme through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools in both urban and rural areas who are running specific school meals projects.An application for funding under the school meals local projects scheme for a lunch club in the school year 2007/2008 was received in my Department on 1st October 2007 from the school concerned.  As demand on the school meals local projects scheme has increased dramatically in 2007, and due to budget constraints, a number of schools, including the school concerned, have been informed that their applications for funding under the scheme cannot be processed in 2007.In 2008, priority for funding under the scheme will, in the first instance, be confined to schools in the Department of Education & Science's initiative for disadvantaged schools, ‘Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS).  Following on from that, applications from schools not coming within DEIS will be considered having regard to any available funding remaining.

It is not possible to develop the premises to the standard required by my Department for customers, or staff and consequently the Office of Public Works have been pursuing alternative accommodation. It is expected that a new office will be ready for occupation early in the New Year.Customers were advised of the closure of the office and were given details of how to conduct their business with my Department until the new office opens.  Local Office services are being provided from Galway.  Unemployed customers in the Loughrea area are not required to travel to Galway to sign the live register each month, but may do so by post instead.  All phone calls to the old office are automatically directed to Galway at no additional cost to the customer and a dedicated direct line is also available.  My Department also has two Social Welfare Inspectors located in Loughrea, who continue to provide their full range of services and information.  Any inconvenience caused to customers is regretted.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	551	My Department has consistently publicised the FIS scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families. Significant improvements in the qualifying income limits and ongoing awareness campaigns have resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims and, consequently, in claims for renewals.  Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer, which adds to the time taken to process claims.There are currently some 20,500 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment.  To date in 2007, my Department has received 34,600 new and renewal FIS claims compared to 29,800 for the same period in 2006 — an increase of over 16. %.  At this time, there are some 11,000 claims on hand for finalisation, of which some 5,000 are new claims and 6,000 are renewal claims.  The average time taken to award a FIS claim or renewal in 2007 (up to end of Oct) is almost 15 weeks.My Department introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS: A review of existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing; Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment; The ongoing staffing requirement was recently reviewed in light of the increased volumes of claims.  Overtime working is being judiciously applied.  These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.

In other cases application must be made in person at one of the Department's network of Local Offices. PPS Numbers are issued following a controlled allocation procedure, involving a personal attendance at the office, the completion of a written application form and the submission and authentication of appropriate identity documents.Once the identity of an individual is verified, his/her relevant identity data is entered by local staff to the Central Records System (CRS) and a PPS Number allocated overnight.  A number of system validation checks are part of this process to prevent multiple PPS Numbers being issued to the same individual. The current allocation process does not permit duplicate numbers to be issued.  My Department continues to develop/refine standards for registration and control to take into account its experience in managing the number.

To this end, the Management Services Unit (MSU) within my Department is providing specialist development for staff to analyse business processes; seek ways to streamline and improve those processes; determine resource requirements; and measure and report on likely savings.The Unit employs a two-stage approach to this work. In the first instance, a process improvement exercise is undertaken within a specific business area. This involves the use of a number of process improvement techniques in a consultative approach with both staff and management in the business area.  All suggestions which are expected to lead to improved processes and efficiency savings are documented and an implementation plan is agreed with management. Once the improvements have been implemented, an internationally recognised work measurement methodology, Administrative Productivity Training (APT), is then used to measure the improved processes within that business area. The APT system facilitates my Department in determining realistic and consistent resourcing requirements.This year alone, the Unit has undertaken a study of resource requirements in each of the 59 Local Offices across the country, as well as engaging in extensive projects in both the Carers and Family Income Supplement (FIS) areas in its Longford office and more recently, in the Child Benefit Office in Letterkenny.  The Unit has also played a significant role in the successful decentralisation of a number of business areas under Phase 1 of the Decentralisation Programme.My Department has also made good progress under the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review (VFMPR) Initiative. Currently reviews in my Department's Information Services and Disability Allowance are in progress and are expected to be completed in 2008.

These includeImprovement Schemes in the Gaeltacht;the Capital Programme for Islands;Ciste na Gaeilge;the Drugs Initiative;the Local Development Social Improvement Programme;Leveraged Funding Schemes under CLÁR and RAPID; andthe Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.In relation to administrative expenditure, the Internal Audit Unit of my Department has carried out a range of VFM reviews and has made provision for further such reviews in 2008 and 2009.A Corporate Procurement Plan has been completed in my Department, incorporating an analysis of expenditure and recommendations for further development and streamlining of the procurement function.My Department has a number of reporting, monitoring and oversight structures in place to facilitate the VFM process and indeed to support the other evaluation and assessment mechanisms that it has in place. These include MAC, the Senior Financial Management Group, the independent Audit Committee, the VFM Joint Steering Group, the Expenditure Committee and the Risk Management Steering Committee.Overall, I believe that there is a strong evaluation culture in my Department, which extends to both programme and administrative expenditure.

In a typical year, advertising consists mainly of regulatory display advertising and statutory notices placed in the print media.  Other media such as television and radio are rarely used. Internet media has not been used to-date.  Advertising expenditure in 2001 included as an exceptional measure €962,938 on the Foot and Mouth Disease public awareness campaign which included newspaper, radio and television advertising.  The increase in press advertising since 2004 is due largely to increased expenditure on forestry advertising, with forestry coming within the remit of the Department in 2004 and increased expenditure on disease public awareness campaigns such as Foot and Mouth Disease and Avian Influenza.  These figures do not include expenditure on fisheries advertising which came within the remit of the Department in October 2007.

I have been advised that no decision has as yet been made and I understand that Coillte has embarked on a local consultation process in the immediate vicinity of the proposed property sale. The area to be offered for sale has yet to be finalised and it is intended to carry out a more detailed consultation closer to the time of the proposed offer for sale.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	578	My Department does not have any direct role in determining the location of end use markets for oilseeds. In a single market situation, biofuel feedstocks including oilseed rape, are traded freely within the EU and I do not have the authority to disallow the exportation of oilseed that has been paid the National Energy Crop Premium of €80 per hectare.The €80 payment is intended as an added incentive for Irish farmers to grow energy crops. It is being paid as a top-up to the EU premium available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme. The rules governing this Scheme provide that aid will only be granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and the processing industry, except where the farmer undertakes the processing himself. Furthermore applicants must deliver all raw materials harvested to a collector or first processor who will take delivery of them and ensure that an equivalent quantity of these raw materials is used within the European Community for the manufacture of energy products.As announced in Budget 2007, my Department was allocated €6 million to support a new National Energy Crop Premium over the period 2007-2009. It is intended that the €80 payment will be available for 3 years and will be subject to a maximum ceiling of 37.5 hectares per producer over the 3-year period. My Department is pursuing EU approval to increase this ceiling.For 2007, a total of 550 farmers are potentially eligible for the National Energy Crop Premium. Payments are being made initially to 437 farmers and are worth approximately €341,000. Payments to the remaining applicants will continue as further cases are cleared.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005/2007 sets out deadlines within which applications under the various schemes operated by my Department should be processed. A Charter Monitoring Committee involving the farming organisations and officials of my Department under an independent chairman meets on a regular basis to review compliance with the deadlines in the Charter.Details of the applications processed by my Department are as follows:Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas SchemeUnder the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, my Department processes approximately 130,000 applications each year. A system of combined application form is operated, thereby negating the necessity for those farmers eligible under both schemes to submit two application forms. The EU Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme require that applications under that Scheme be submitted by 15 May of the year in question, while also providing that payments cannot be made before 1 December of the year of application. In the case of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, there is discretion as regards the payment date, which is generally mid-September, when the vast majority of applications were fully processed. It will be appreciated that the task of processing up to 130,000 applications is a substantial operation, with the necessity to confirm the detail contained in each individual's application, most importantly in respect of the various land parcels declared.The Single Payment Scheme, which was introduced in 2005, replaced the various coupled Schemes, each of which had different application periods and eligibility requirements. I have endeavoured to ensure that the practice of refining and streamlining the application and processing process, which was a trademark of the Department's operation of those coupled schemes, will continue with the Single Payment Scheme. To this end, for example, under the 2007 scheme, an on-line application facility was introduced, which allowed farmers, or their nominated agent, to lodge an application on-line. This facility had numerous built-in validations, which resulted in those farmers who availed of the service experiencing fewer errors with their applications.Mindful of the adverse weather conditions experienced during the summer months of 2007, I made a successful case to the EU Commissioner that agreement should be forthcoming to allow advance payments under the Single Payment Scheme be made at the earliest possible date, 16 October — the start of the EU financial year. Following successful processing of applications, in excess of 95% of farmers received their advance payment on, or shortly after that date. Payments under the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme had commenced on 21 September and in excess of 90% of applicants had been paid within the following two weeks, with in excess of 98,000 farmers paid to date. Those applicants under both the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme who have yet to be paid have received correspondence from my Department, which outlines the reasons for non-payment. As further cases are subsequently confirmed eligible, payment issues without delay.On-Farm Investment SchemesApplications under the following on-farm investment schemes are currently being processed by my Department within the deadlines set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007:Farm Improvement SchemeFarm Waste Management SchemeSow Housing (Animal Welfare) SchemeYoung Farmers' Installation SchemeFarm Improvement Scheme12,675 applications received up to 31st October 2007, of which 1,875 have been approved.Farm Waste Management Scheme46,132 Applications received under the revised scheme up to 31st December 2006.31,520 Approvals have been issued up to 30th September 2007.2,065 Applications have been rejected or returned up to 30th September 2007.All applications are being processed within deadlines set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007.Sow Housing (Animal Welfare) Scheme56 Applications received up to 31st October 2007.9 Applications rejected or returned.No case outside of deadlines set by the Charter of Rights for Farmers 2005-2007.Young Farmers' Installation Aid Scheme108 Applications received up to 31st October 2007.8 Approvals issued.REPSNotwithstanding a much higher than average level of applications for REPS in the closing months of 2006, over 87% of the 691 applications received that year were processed in line with the targets in the Charter.

These circulars and rules may create legal rights and obligations.  In addition they may be reviewed by the courts for legality.Thus the Rules for National Schools and Criminal Injuries Compensation Rules have both been considered and construed by the Courts.  It would not be feasible in a Parliamentary Question to lay down every instance where Department of Education circulars have been interpreted or applied by the courts.  By way of example however the Rules for National Schools were considered in Maunsell v Minister for Education [1940] IR 430 and Crowley v Ireland [1980] IR 102.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department does not sanction ABA specific classes for autism in mainstream schools, as the Department believes that  each child with autism is unique; such children should have access to a range of different interventions to meet their individual needs. ABA is one of the methodologies used in special classes for children with autism.Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate inform the Department of Education and Science's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one.  An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention.  By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methodologies, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues.  My Department therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. It is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met.  Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other interventions, such as TEACCH and PECS, are important in developing children's communication skills.Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has significantly improved in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.In excess of 275 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level and the National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more such classes where the need arises.  At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants (SNAs).  Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. An individual child can have access to full-time support from an individual SNA if he or she needs one.In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	589	The Department has been working for some time with Fingal County Council on the acquisition of sites to enable new schools to open throughout its area of functionality in 2008.The ability of the Department to open these schools next September is contingent on the sites being acquired very soon. The Department is encouraged by the Council's recent positive statement in relation to the progress being made in this regard. The schools themselves will be provided in areas to meet the needs arising from the local authority's own County Development Plan and its various Local Area Development Plans.The Deputy will appreciate that due to commercial sensitivities, I cannot comment on specific sites at this time, however, I can assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to work very closely with Fingal County Council to meet the needs of the Fingal area, including those to which he refers, for next year and beyond.With regard to the school to which the Deputy specifically refers, the Department approved the provision of one additional mainstream classroom for September 2007 to cater for additional enrolments.  However, I understand that due to site restrictions it would prove difficult to expand this school further.  Therefore, the plan is to make greenfield provision under the process outlined above.

These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.

The OECD published ‘Education at a Glance 2007' contains estimates of ‘tertiary survival' for each OECD member state based on the estimated proportion of new entrants in a given year who successfully completed a tertiary programme a number of years later.  The latest published data refer to 2004.On average in OECD counties, 30% of Honours Bachelor Degree programme (Tertiary-Type A) students fail to successfully complete these programmes.  Ireland has the second highest retention rate of all OECD countries for these programmes, at 83%.  Retention rates for Higher Certificate/ Ordinary Bachelor Degree students (Tertiary-Type B) were, on average, lower than those for Honours Bachelor Degree programmes.  In Ireland the retention rate was 69% compared to an OECD average of 62%.  Ireland's strong relative performance on these fronts reflects the priority that has been given to supporting retention initiatives across higher education institutions in recent years.Specific data on the numbers of mature students withdrawing from higher education courses are not currently available in this Department or the Higher Education Authority.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in the form requested.  The Higher Education Authority undertake periodic studies of the profile of the student population in higher education to facilitate the analysis of overall long term trends in relation to the participation of students by age, gender, field of study, educational achievement, and socio-economic background.  The latest published report ‘Who Went to College in 2004? A National Survey of New Entrants to Higher Education' was published in 2006 and is based on a national survey of all those who enrolled as new entrants to higher education in October 2004.  The study showed that the number of mature new entrants (those aged 23 and over), as a proportion of overall new entrants, had risen from 5% in 1998 to 9.4% in 2004.  This indicates that targets set out in the Report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education (2001), that mature students would represent 10% of all new entrants by 2006, were being met ahead of schedule.  Encouraging enhanced participation in higher education among mature students, on a full and part-time basis, continues to be a priority for the Government in line with the objectives for upskilling set out in the National Skills Strategy, jointly launched by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I earlier this year.I will arrange to forward a copy of the full HEA publication to the Deputy for his information.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The school referred to by the Deputy is a four teacher school with approximately 16 pupils.  At the start of this school year there were three teaching vacancies out of a total teaching complement of four teaching posts at the school.  Due to this exceptional number of vacancies, the school was unable to re-open in September 2007.  The recruitment process is in hand and the Board of Management has advised my Department that a person has accepted an offer of principalship in the school.  Every effort is being made to expedite the recruitment process for the two remaining staff vacancies with a view to re-opening the school as soon as possible.  In the interim, arrangements have been made to accommodate some children in other schools. Where this has not been possible, my Department has offered a home tuition grant to the remaining families.As home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, there is need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  A feature of the Home Tuition scheme is that tutors are sourced by the parent. The usual requirement for a home tutor is a fully qualified teacher.  However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child.  A list of relevant qualifications may be sourced on my Department's website on www.education.ie. It is in the interests of children to expect that home tutors funded under this scheme are appropriately qualified tuition providers.  Each child in receipt of home tuition is entitled to 20 individual hours tuition per week which is the maximum allowed under the scheme.

It is operated through the Vocational Education Committees.  The aim of the Scheme is to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance.  The student ceases to receive an unemployment payment and, instead, receives a VTOS training allowance at a rate equivalent to the maximum rate of unemployment benefit, plus a payment for an adult or child dependant, if appropriate.  VTOS students also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.The allowances for VTOS students for meals and travel referred to in the question are equivalent to these paid to participants on FÁS training courses.  VTOS students are entitled to a meal allowance of €0.80 per day.  They may be entitled to a travel allowance if they reside more than 3 miles from a centre.  This weekly allowance ranges from €4.60 for a distance of 3 to 5 miles to €32.60 for a distance of 40 to 50 miles from a centre.  These allowances are increased periodically in line with increases in FÁS rates.  The current rates are in operation since 2002.  An increase in the FÁS rates will be necessary before VTOS rates can be increased.

Every effort is made to enhance value for money.  The White Paper on Defence, which was approved by government and published in February 2000, deals with all aspects of Defence provision and Organisation. It sets out the policy for Defence over the period to 2010 with a view to ensuring an appropriate level of Defence capability having regard to the changing defence and security environment.  A restructuring process was mapped out for the Defence Forces and the Department.  The White Paper provided for a reduction of 1,000 in Defence Force numbers (to 10,500) and the consequent investment of pay savings in new equipment and infrastructure.  These savings, plus the resources generated from the sale of properties were utilised to fund an investment programme in defence equipment and infrastructure.I initiated a detailed review of implementation of White Paper recommendations in both the Department and the Defence Forces.  This has been completed and a report published in April 2007.In addition, my Department is participating in the current round of Value for Money and Policy Reviews approved by Government.  The terms of reference for these reviews includes examination of efficiency and identification of potential savings.  Recent reviews conducted and their publication dates are as follows:Review of Maintenance of Aircraft in the Air Corps 2006Review of Defence Forces Clothing Procurement 2007Two further reviews are currently being progressed:Review of Naval Service Vessel MaintenanceReview of Usage of Military Training LandsThe approach we have taken in Defence is to continuously monitor the defence and security environment to ensure the continued relevance of White Paper objectives and to monitor and report on implementation targets.  This approach is complemented by VFM and other reviews of specific sub-elements of programmes in order to seek out further VFM initiatives and engender a culture of continuous evaluation and improvement.

As the areas of responsibility of the three previous Ministers of State have been re-allocated it is not possible to identify one specific additional appointment.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I wish to advise the Deputy that the Report to which he refers (Domestic Abuse of Women and Men — Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse) focuses on those who have experienced severe abuse in an intimate relationship.  The Report notes that it is important to draw a distinction between those experiencing severe abuse with a significant negative impact on them and  those experiencing minor incidents that had little impact on them.  The figures which the Deputy quotes from the Report regarding the prevalence of domestic violence refer to the combined figure for both severe abuse and minor incidents.It is important to note the context in which the report puts these combined figures. The report states that, "This combination of groups, however, would deny the importance of the impact of the behaviour on the person experiencing it and would not be in keeping with the concept of domestic abuse developed here as a constellation of behaviours with a significant negative impact on the person affected".  The report notes that women are more than twice as likely to be victims of severe abuse, of either a physical, emotional or sexual nature  than are men.I am, however, cognisant of the finding of the Report that, notwithstanding the fact that women are more than twice as likely to be victims of severe abuse and that the consequences of that abuse in terms of seriousness of injury, fear and distress are more acute for women, a significant number of men are also affected by domestic abuse.The Government has taken action to bring a level of coordination and coherence to the State's response to the problem of domestic abuse.  Cosc — The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, was established on 25th June 2007.  Cosc is an executive office of my Department. The establishment of this office has raised the profile and the  focus on this work and for the first time there is now a dedicated, resourced office at Government level, with the key responsibility  to ensure the delivery of a well coordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  The remit of the office covers (i) domestic and sexual violence against women, (ii) domestic and sexual violence against men and (iii) elder abuse.Cosc's tasks are:Working with Government Departments, Agencies and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the sector to ensure the delivery of a well coordinated service to support victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.Developing and delivering awareness raising strategies to ensure that victims are aware of the availability of services in their locality and that society is made aware of the extent and impact of behaviours and crimes of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.Developing, and where relevant facilitating the implementation of, strategies to address the issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in line with best international practice.Further developing standards for service delivery and for training programmes which address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.Putting in place strategically based positive actions which work with perpetrators of domestic violence.Providing leadership and support to the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women (NSC) and its sub-committees.Continuing to implement the recommendations of the 1997 Task Force on Violence against Women.Working to establish a body of research to inform future policy directions for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.Representing Ireland at international fora  which have a remit in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.Proposing legislative changes as required.Cosc will lead the development of a National Strategy on Domestic Violence which will be firmly based on best practice strategies and evidence which the office is collating from national and international sources. In addition to the core interagency work, the structure of the office has been approved to include a specific research function which will enhance knowledge on the scale of domestic violence and on strategies to prevent and to address the incidence of this crime. The approved structure also includes a specific communications unit which will raise public awareness of the crime and increase the knowledge of options available to victims. This work will also involve collaboration with State and non-governmental organisations concerned with the crime of domestic violence.On the question of funding, I would like to clarify that the Report does not find that funding for supports for male victims amounts to less than 1% of that provided for female victims.  State supports for victims of domestic violence are provided primarily through the HSE, the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, local authorities and a number of NGOs and voluntary groups.  The NGOs operating in the field tend to focus on supports for women as evidence to date suggests that women are more likely to require immediate support such as emergency housing for themselves and their family, support to re-establish their life outside of an abusive relationship or to require court accompaniment services.  The funding and, more importantly, action to address domestic violence, is not determined on a gender specific criteria but on the basis of response to victims who seek services.Changes and improvements in the system of tackling domestic violence will be supported and facilitated by the work of Cosc and the new focus on improved co-ordinated approaches to data collection and best practice knowledge. Cosc is working positively with relevant State agencies and NGOs to ensure that all victims of domestic violence benefit from this new ‘whole of government' approach.

Accordingly, pension contributions paid by him were refunded to his wife in accordance with Article 15(2) of the Garda Síochána Pension Order, 1925.

The Regulations provide that an EU citizen who is in possession of his or her valid national identity card or passport may not be refused permission to enter Ireland unless he or she is suffering from one of the specified diseases or his or her personal conduct has been such that it would be contrary to public policy or would endanger public security to grant him or her permission to enter the State.  Restrictions on the right of residence of EU citizens may be imposed on similar grounds.The Directive provides that measures taken on grounds of public policy or public security must comply with the principle of proportionality and must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the person concerned.  The Directive states that previous criminal convictions shall not in themselves constitute grounds for taking such measures.  However, a previous criminal record would, where known by the immigration authorities, be a relevant factor in determining whether to permit a person to enter the State as the person concerned could constitute a genuine threat to public policy or public security.

The establishment of these Committees has great potential to ensure that policing is responsive to local needs.  The Committees are provided for by the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and operate under guidelines issued by me, after consultation with the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  In view of the innovative nature of the Committees and the number which will be established (there are 114 local authorities in total in the country), the Committees are being piloted in 29 local authority areas for a limited period under initial guidelines.I plan to provide for the establishment of a Committee in each local authority area in the State as early as possible in 2008, following consultation with my Ministerial colleagues.  Before doing so, I consider that it would be useful to consider the experience gained in the operation of the 29 Committees currently established.  As part of this process, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have decided to hold a consultation seminar on 29 November.  The purpose of the seminar, which we will attend, will be to consider the lessons from the operation of the pilot Committees.  The outcomes of the seminar will be used in the process of preparing the guidelines under which the Committees will be rolled out to all local authority areas.  It is planned to invite representatives of the participants in the Committees, which will include members of An Garda Síochána, the relevant local authorities and the Oireachtas and representatives of the community and voluntary sector, as well as of the representative associations for local authority members and city and county managers.The Committees which have been established last year and this year as part of the pilot phase have focused on the issues which they consider have the highest priority for them and on finding the most suitable methods of working.  They have made good progress, and the discussion of their experience will contribute to the outcome of the consultation seminar.

Collation of information regarding expenditure in previous years is not readily available and could not be achieved without the allocation of a disproportionate amount of staff time.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has an extensive range of functions and it follows that there is an almost continuous requirement to put notifications of significance into the public domain, including with respect to such matters as tender and recruitment competitions, legislative announcements and the invitation of submissions on policy matters or subjects under public inquiry.  The expenditure outlined also arises from the need to use effective and high profile means of raising awareness on matters of important public interest.  In keeping with the broad range of activities and programmes underway in my Department, this has arisen in such diverse areas as, for example, anti-racism, combatting domestic violence and campaigns to raise awareness of the penalties associated with the misuse of fireworks.Type of Public Information20062007 (to end October)€€Television489,987325,366Radio436,543268,467Print Media739,592669,052Internet Media018,743Other public information related costs58,8110Total1,724,9331,281,628

These assessments were taken into account in the preparation of the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-09 which I published on 17 September 2007 and which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Given the level of competing demand for the available funding, and the priorities identified by the elected members of Mayo County Council, it was not possible to include the Valley scheme in the current Programme.

While my Department approves the general programme, it is the responsibility of the local authority to prioritise and advance individual projects.  In this case specific approval was given to Kildare County Council to use €50,000 from Internal Capital Receipts to prepare a community profile and master plan for the estate in question.  My Department has received no proposals as yet on the plans for the regeneration of the estate.

It focuses on those areas of procurement for which the Department is directly responsible, for and is mainly concerned with expenditure on administrative activity. The Plan seeks to meet the obligation of the underlying National Public Procurement Policy Framework and, in doing so, reinforce the Department's commitment to effective and efficient resource allocation.Since the introduction of formal Expenditure/VFM Reviews in 1997 my Department has completed seven such reviews. One of the key evaluation issues addressed in these reviews centres on the efficiency with which programmes and projects are being delivered.The preparation of annual estimates of expenditure by the Department also ensures that the cost effectiveness and efficiency of all expenditure provisions are scrutinised with a view to eliminating all unnecessary costs.

Its remit includes overall responsibility for the coordination of policy relating to women and men who are victims of domestic violence.In relation to accommodation, capital funding is available through my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme to voluntary housing bodies providing accommodation to meet special needs, including accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  My Department also recoups to the local authorities 90% of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs arising in respect of homeless persons including, where appropriate, victims of domestic violence. The remaining 10% is provided from the revenue resources of the local authorities.Insofar as my Department is aware, funding under Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 is supporting of the order of 718 beds for emergency and transitional accommodation for homeless victims of domestic violence. The following Table sets out details of the recoupment by my Department to local authorities for the last five years in respect of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs for refuges and transitional accommodation for homeless victims of domestic violence. In addition, it should be noted that mainstream emergency homeless accommodation would also be available to victims of violence if required.The Independent Review of Implementation of Homeless Strategies was published in February 2006. Recommendation 16 of the Review states that "Victims of domestic violence should be recognised as an at risk target group, and in this regard the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women should consider convening an expert working group to examine refuge provision and occupancy around the country." The Government has accepted the broad thrust of the Review's recommendations and the details fall to be considered within the framework of work already underway in my Department on the finalisation of a revised and updated Strategy on Homelessness.  In that context, my Department will continue to engage with Cosc to further address the accommodation-related issues arising in relation to domestic violence.Women's RefugesLocal Authority20022003200420052006€€€€€Athlone Town Council00.035,461.6451,919.5916,298.0500.00Clonmel Borough Council80,381.7160,286.28100,477.1480,381.7180,381.72Cork City Council262,231.44250,317.00251,002.80273,222.00281,557.35Donegal County Council5,440.007,165.945,439.463,839.5428,516.07Drogheda Borough Council11,734.7123,897.858,007.8623,494.3629,413.83Dublin City Council181,021.51181,021.28181,022.00301,702.22241,362.00Dundalk Town Council49,950.0060,975.0062,332.8857,145.5000.00Ennis Town Council141,120.00210,240.00210,816.00210,240.00215,294.85Galway City Council26,055.8973,079.8592,988.90108,662.40129,524.95Kilkenny County Council00.00110,050.4173,260.2958,384.3058,384.31Limerick City Council191,870.12208,557.92208,597.52208,597.52215,898.42Mayo County Council12,639.2927,788.447,955.1033,219.4310,012.50Meath County Council64,899.54125,501.4083,667.6083,210.4083,439.00South Dublin County Council00.0000.0000.0000.0065,091.32Tralee/Kerry County Council61,937.45148,310.31149,111.28148,479.30148,570.20Waterford City Council57,658.0270,384.0691,786.0499,732.60100,096.20Wexford Borough Council00.00107,876.3492,034.3691,782.9091,782.90Total refuges1,146,939.681,700,913.721,670,418.821,798,392.231,779,325.6220022003200420052006Dundalk Town Council28,163.4232,670.0032,670.0032,670.0000.00Mayo County Council26,506.8157,600.0034,511.5539,135.6039,136.03Dublin City180,000.00112,502.70246,736.39255,370.06232,276.51South Dublin County Council37,794.6078,274.85100,505.03110,212.20Total transitional accommodation234,670.23240,567.30392,192.79427,680.69381,624.74Total Section 10 funding for accommodation for victims of domestic violence1,381,609.911,941,481.022,062,611.612,226,072.922,160,950.36
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-11-21 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I understand that on foot of representations made to my predecessor to the effect that the water charges set by Sligo County Council in 2007 were greater than warranted by the non-domestic sector cost recovery requirement, he requested that the matter be examined by his Department.  In March 2007, Departmental officials met with Sligo County Council for the purpose of obtaining detailed information on aspects of the Council's water charges calculations and establishing whether the charges had been calculated in accordance with water pricing policy.  Details of the Council's calculations were examined which indicated that they were prepared utilising the Water Services Cost Methodology Template, which was developed under the auspices of the County and City Managers' Association Water Pricing Operational Cost Sub-Group, in consultation with the Department.On the basis of the information provided by the Council, the combined volumetric rate of €1.67 per cubic metre plus the standing charge would generate an income from non-domestic sector water charges in 2007 of less than 26% of the total estimated cost of providing water and waste water services in the county in 2007.  Accordingly, the Council's water charges in 2007 could not be regarded as excessive in the context of its obligation to recover from the non-domestic sector the full cost of providing water and waste water services to that sector.  Variations in the level of water charges between one local authority and another are to be expected given the variations in the cost of water abstraction, treatment and distribution.

In my consideration of the licence application I raised a number of issues of serious concern with the Ward Union Hunt including in relation to animal welfare, conservation and protection of stags generally and compliance with previous licence conditions.   Meetings were held between my Department and representatives of the Ward Union Hunt and correspondence was exchanged with the Hunt in order to convey my serious concerns and provide them with an opportunity to address these concerns.I have given careful consideration to the responses provided by the Ward Union Hunt. There are however some outstanding issues that need to be resolved and my Department was in further contact with the Ward Union Hunt on Monday 19 November to seek clarification on these issues.

As part of the implementation of this policy, my Department has allocated funding of over €8 million to County and City Councils for the development of 167 new or refurbished playgrounds since 2004. Grant aid of approximately €4m in respect of over 75 playgrounds remains to be drawn down from my Department by local authorities.There has been no decision to withdraw funding from these schemes. The question of inviting further proposals from local authorities is being kept under review in the light of experience gained under the current schemes.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  Maps of areas unserved by broadband have been prepared to help inform the tendering process.  The scheme is technology neutral which means that the bidding service providers may use whichever technology they feel best suits the scheme's objectives. That technology may or may not involve using existing exchanges.The first phase of the procurement process, Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)   is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  The four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, Eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be during Quarter 2 of 2008, with roll-out of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.

This has involved the provision of training on appraisal techniques and implementing additional reporting and controls to ensure that capital expenditure projects are appraised, planned and monitored effectively in line with the requirements of value for money and efficiency.My Department's Internal Audit Unit also provides assurance regarding the adequacy or otherwise of the systems of internal control within the Department and as part of the overall governance and control environment in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources provides audit assurance that significant risks are identified, managed and controlled effectively throughout the Department.This is achieved by conducting audits, writing reports and making recommendations in line with an Annual Audit Plan that has been approved by the Audit Committee.  In addition we are, in common with other Government Departments, subject to review by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
