          <p eId="para_233">The next proposal to put to the House is that No. 10, the proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Planning and Development (Planning Enforcement) General Policy Directive 2013, be decided without debate. Is that agreed?</p>

          <p eId="para_234">It is not agreed. I think there should be a debate on this particular issue and I am at a loss as to why a debate in plenary session was not facilitated. Our general concern with the order of the day and the manner in which the business of the House has been organised is a very fundamental one.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I am not lecturing anyone. I am simply saying the way Members of the House are being treated is unacceptable. I say to the Minister that the Government is treating the Dáil with the kind of contempt he treated the students of Ireland with when he promised them, on the steps of Trinity College, that he would reduce third level charges and said, a month later, that he had to make that promise to get into power. As we know, Deputy Rabbitte said that is the kind of thing you do at an election.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">The Minister has used words like "discommode" and "inconvenience". This is not about inconveniencing anyone. I will be in Leinster House all day. It makes no difference to me what time the House sits. The issue is the manner in which the Dáil and the Members are being treated. There was a lack of courtesy and proper engagement with Opposition leaders and finance spokespeople last evening. There should have been consultation. The Chief Whip is not engaging with the other Whips. There is no genuine consultation. The affairs of the House are being organised by diktat.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The Minister said he is on throughout the course of the day. He has not been. That is the point.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">As other Deputies have said, Opposition Whips have had no say in the scheduling of business or in what should be discussed today. The Whips on this side of the House were not invited to make any suggestions and no opportunity was provided to this side of the House to say we should discuss the negotiations that are taking place today. There will be a press conference in relation to that, but the Dáil will be behind the public with regard to knowledge or presentation on that issue, because the public will find out through the media first.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> That is the basic issue. It is not a matter of being discommoded or inconvenienced. It is one of a fundamental lack of engagement and of respect for the Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> There was no legislation in the middle of the night on any bank guarantee. This is being peddled as if it were a fact. It never happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">It is hard to discuss the Order of Business when we cannot even have order in the Chamber. This issue is of serious importance. Thousands of euro of debt hang over each citizen of the State. Taxes and the provision of public services are at stake. A generation is at tipping point. We need more than shadow boxing on this issue. We need a real debate, provided by the Government, on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> The Cabinet will meet today to discuss the promissory note deal with the ECB. The Minister is right. The country knows the Government was engaged in crisis management last night. Today is different and the Government can design what happens. There is space today to have a debate. If space cannot be found for a debate today it could be held tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> It is also important that finance spokespeople have a proper briefing on this occasion, and not the microwave walk-through that happened yesterday. It did not serve the debate or the country well.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_274">I apologise for my absence yesterday and thank Deputy Niall Collins for taking the first ten minutes and thank other speakers for allowing that to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> This is an interim Bill with three main objectives: to establish Uisce Éireann, or Irish Water, as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann; to confer power on to that board and on to Irish Water to install water meters in all domestic properties; and to provide that the Commission for Energy Regulation can advise Government on regulatory procedures and act as a regulator for water services and functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> We will oppose this Bill, not necessarily because Fianna Fáil is against water charges but because of the manner in which Irish Water is being established and configured. There are not sufficient safeguards within the parameters by which it has been set up to stave off what we believe is a real and live threat of privatisation at a later date. I am conscious of the fact that we have many group schemes, private and public, and that many of them by their nature and location would not be considered profitable in the event of a buyer arriving in years to come who would be interested in vast multiple connections and population centres. We fear that without sufficient safeguards in the ownership of the company, that remains a threat where we could not guarantee the future for all areas. It is for that reason we feel there must be further strengthening of the configuration of the company to convince Fianna Fáil and others that the threat is not likely to be realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> We do not oppose the installation of water meters but the Government should first, before the publication of the Bill, honour the commitments it made when it announced the policy process more than a year ago. There was to be a full audit of the existing networks that was to be made available to the House. That audit would allow us to address the myth that the water service is not fit for purpose. If, as many on the Government side have said, we do not have an efficient water service, why should people be asked to pay for an inefficient service? It is only when that service is fit for purpose and we can stand over it, with the necessary safeguards in place, conservation at its heart and a pristine service, that the Government will be in a position to charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> Full costings were to be made available that would give us the exact figures not only for the reinstatement repairs necessary to bring the entire network up to the necessary standard, but that would put at our disposal a definitive cost analysis for water metering for the State and the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and ultimately for the user. There would need to be a proposal based on those costs that would state categorically how users would pay for putting that in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> When the policy direction was initially announced, there was great confusion in both Fine Gael and in the Labour Party as to how it would be configured. We are no wiser today than we were then. It is against that sort of background that I cannot commend the Bill to the House. We are in the dark about the progress that has been made and what progress is likely. It is difficult enough for us to finalise our own policy in this area. How, then, can we acquiesce to the Government's request at this stage on the establishment of Irish Water and giving it the authority to commence metering? Nor can we support the idea in the Bill of the regulator being put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Those are the broad questions we have but there are many other individual questions related to them. When this was announced last year, we were told installation would commence in 2012 and be rolled out on an accelerated basis. That idea has been canned. The Government now tells us there will be a three year roll-out. Previously the Government said 2,000 jobs would be created per annum in the roll-out. Can the Government commit to 6,000 jobs?</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> We were told there would be 150 to 200 local installation contracts. My sources tell me the tender process was very restrictive. I understand the Government tried to address that by compiling a list of local plumbers from which contractors had to pick. I have a problem with that because the Government still has not made any progress on the subcontractors Bill. How long has that been outstanding given the commitment that was made and the work that was done by the previous Government to put that in place? Why has there been such a delay? Can the Government commit to that legislation being in place before this Bill commences?</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> The tendering process is over and the applications are being considered. We were told no indicative figure could be given while the tendering process was under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">That process is complete in the main in the sense that the applications were submitted, the closing date has passed and the Department is in the process of that competition and awarding contracts. The Minister of State is now in a position to give us a better indication of the costs. Rather than rushing this, why can the Minister of State not give us those costs in order that we can make a calculated response to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> It has also been acknowledged that 300,000 homes cannot be metered. That being the case, there is nothing in the Bill that tells me the model to devise a mechanism for a flat payment or charge that will be paid in that regard. I understand it has been acknowledged that there is no cost benefit in making individual connections within apartment blocks. Can the Minister of State confirm that is the case? Can he let the House know how he is to devise a flat charge or what model he has used on which to base such a flat charge?</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> The figures that come from the Department on the existing household connections countrywide, whereby 1,093,000 are connected to the public mains, 265,000 are connected to group schemes which, in turn, are connected to public supplies, 46,000 to private water schemes, 145,000 to other sources which we expect to be wells, and 2,906 have no connection, which I presume are ghost estates, amounts to approximately 1.7 million households. The latest census tells us there are 1.9 million households. The Minister of State has also factored in the 300,000 apartments. There is a gap in the figures and I ask him to comment on that also.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> It was also stated that the Department would consult the regulator before the introduction of water charges. The Minister of State is now bringing forward a Bill that gives authority to an existing regulator to have that authority within this remit. How long will this consultation take place given that the Minister promised to have it done by now? Obviously, the Minister did not have the regulator in place and he could not do that either. How long will the consultation take place between the Department and the regulator to give an indication to the House thereafter of what the costs might be?</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Will there be an additional charge for those who have a connection to a public water supply and also have a connection to a public sewer? Will there be less of a charge for somebody who has a connection to a public water supply and has a septic tank? There is no mention in the Bill of the discrepancies that can arise in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> The Department was also to consult with the regulator on free allowances before the introduction of water charges. If there has been no regulator, there has been no consultation and we are no further on in that regard either.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> An interim Bill at this stage, if one was to follow the methodology of which the Minister spoke last year, should only contain the framework to put a regulator in place in order for meaningful negotiation and consultation to take place thereafter before the Minister could come with a proposal on metering with the benefit of the associated figures, analysis and costs. It would make much more sense at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> Many would argue that the high level of expectation contained in the rules and regulations and maintenance directives from the EU are not necessarily being met by many of the group water schemes, especially those who have their own private source and not necessarily those that have a relationship with local authorities for their services, despite the fine quality and excellent service that such schemes provide to those they serve. It could be argued that if they were to follow the existing expectations, they might not necessarily be able to afford to do so. Is it that the Minister will be forced to take over those two to meet the criteria that his regulator will put in place to meet the demands of the EU directives or will there be an amnesty? There is also more shooting in the dark in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The OECD stated in 2010 that water metering is unequivocally the fairest way to charge for domestic water usage, and I acknowledge that. There is a recognition by the Department that metering will reduce usage by 10% and that this saving is two to three times the level of savings applicable if the same was invested in areas such as mains upgrade. I do not question the 10% saving that is projected for metering correlated to usage but I question the logic behind saying that such a saving, in itself, is two to three times better value than the same investment in areas such as mains reinstatement, rectification and repairs. What methodology and statistical analysis is behind that statement? I thought we all had acknowledged that the biggest cost deficit in existing maintenance is the amount of leakage, and that does not tie in with the statement that there would be more value in the savings metering will deliver than there would be in those delivered by the reinstatements.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The framework directive demands water to be charged at a price that fully reflects the cost of providing that service. It is my party's contention that we cannot take this to mean that this omits Government subvention altogether. Fine Gael's partners in government had stated in this regard that an overhaul of the tax system would seek to get full cost recovery within the water framework and water pricing. Initially, the Government stated that Irish Water would be self-financing by 2018. With the various delays that have already taken place and with the absence of costings, projections and data, where now sits that prediction? If Irish Water has the power to borrow, as it states, would these borrowings be outside the central government balance and has this been confirmed by EUROSTAT?</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> In the report by Government to the IMF published at the end of last year, the Government stated that it was not yet clear what level of charges would impact on low-income households. That is obviously the case. The Department does not have the data available to it to give an estimate, even at this stage, of the overall charge. That charge, in itself, is related to the overall cost of upgrading the system, of metering, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Looking at the figures, based on some statements that have been made by Government Members and figures, and the Department and others over the past number of years, it is important for me and for Members on this side of the House to inform the public of what is coming down the tracks here. If the Government will not let us know, even though it wants to set up Irish Water, to meter and to put a regulator in place, if it has not adhered to the roadmap it put in place, and it has not provided any definitive figures related to that process, then the public is in the dark as to what it faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">As the Opposition, we cannot give the Government <i>carte blanche</i> authority to proceed in the absence of all those data.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> In an effort to try to get at what has been kept so secretive, we must look at the existing and projected running costs of water services, which the Department of Finance indicates as €700 million. A universal figure has been thrown out without the specifics to verify it indicating that the upgrade of the system would cost approximately €500 million. There is also a major problem in Dublin. Bord na Móna, in devising a plan that the chair of Irish Water has said he is prepared to analyse, investigate and hopefully run with, has put a cost of €500 million on that. We are now at more than €1 billion. The estimates bandied about for metering have been anything from €300 million to €500 million. If we seek to capitalise those figures over 20 years, metering would come to €20 million per annum, fixing the problems in Dublin would be €25 million per annum and the upgrade would be another €25 million per annum. This gives a cost of €770 million that has to be paid for either by 1.9 million households or 1.7 million households - I need clarification on that. If it is capitalised over 20 years it would give a water charge of €450 or €400. There has been no mention of free allowance. How could there be when the Government's commitment was that the Minister of State and his Department would consult with the regulator on the free allowance before any decision was made or indication given on charges? That is a contention I have sought to extrapolate from figures that have been bandied about.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> As I said at the outset, we are not against water charges. Sinn Féin is completely opposed to them and the Government is completely in favour. We would be to the right of Sinn Féin and to the left of the Government. That is the position to which we want to get. However, in the absence of the data, analysis and figures, we are in the dark. That is my problem with the Bill at this stage. If the Minister of State can answer my queries and present exact figures so that we can analyse how we will pay for it and can start being straight with the people, then we can play ball. The Government is trying to be cute on the issue because it is facing into local elections next year. If that is not the case, let us have it out here in the open. I have sought to analyse figures that have been in the public domain without being quantified that indicate every household will be faced with a water charge of at least €400 if not €450 per annum on the basis of capitalising costs over 20 years. The Minister of State should tell me if that is wrong and if it will be more or less. Where is the procedure providing for a free allowance? What provision is likely to be put in this Bill or another Bill to deal with less well-off people who cannot afford to pay?</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> What consideration is the Minister of State giving to group schemes and to private schemes with private connections or connected to public supplies? What efforts are being made to adhere to what is expected of them? Is their cost likely to be higher or lower? In the absence of those data, the Bill should not be passed. The Minister of State needs to go back to the drawing board and come back to us with the figures and analysis so that we can have a proper debate on how the State should pay for it and how this should be passed on to the people, including providing the less well-off and less fortunate with the same water they have received since the foundation of the State but at an affordable price that is equitable for everybody. Equalisation is at the root of this.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_299">The Water Services Bill is fundamentally flawed and draconian in its content. It establishes Irish Water as a subsidiary of a company, Bord Gáis Éireann, which the Government has indicated it wants to sell off. The new company will be given the power to install meters and charge families. Crucially, the Bill repeals the prohibition on water charges. Denmark, with 5.5 million people, has a population similar to Ireland's. Denmark has water metering and in 2007 the average cost per household was €715. The Bill before the House does not take into account people on low incomes or even those living in poverty. Has the Bill been poverty-proofed? Some 706,000 people in the State live in poverty and their households will be charged the same amount as the Minister of State's, mine or the Taoiseach's - one of the highest earning politicians in the world. That is shameful and unjust. Developments, including that of a water system, which ignore the essential needs of poor people in this country or abroad, are simply not sustainable. However, the Minister of State does not need to take my word for it. According to a major report carried out by the British Chartered Institute of Environment and Health a household, spending more than 3% of its income on water, is at risk of poverty. The report entitled, Water Poverty in England in Wales, found that "UK households in the lowest three income deciles spend on average 3% of their net income on water bills whereas the average spend for all households is just 1%." The report also states, "large water bills in relation to income do have the potential for causing significant deprivation." However, despite the international evidence the Bill does not even attempt to protect those low-income families and those who would be seen as vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The establishment of Irish Water along with the imposition of water charges is at best ill-though out. It transpires that it will not be possible to install water meters in one third of households and I believe a similar number in the rest of the country - certainly in towns such as Portlaoise, Tullamore and Portarlington. If water meters lead to water conservation as the Minister of State claims, the Government has a problem. Despite informing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht that Irish Water would be ready to bill households in January 2014, John Mullins, the project CEO, was unable to inform the committee the full cost of the installation of meters. What way is it to proceed if at this point we cannot be informed on the cost of providing meters? We have not even been given an estimate. We are being asked to issue a blank cheque to a Bord Gáis Éireann subsidiary, which is lunacy in the current economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> The Bill allows Irish Water to access information on households from sources including the Revenue, the Department of Social Protection, local authorities and the Private Residential Tenancy Board, which is a clear breach of people's privacy and civil liberties. It also gives powers to exempt Irish Water from the need to get planning permission when carrying out major infrastructural works. We need to see the Government-sponsored drive towards water metering in the context of overall Government policy. Sinn Féin condemns the wave of cuts in water investment planned from 2012 onwards as outlined in the Government's Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016. Capital investment in water has been cut from almost €435 million in 2011 to €331 million, a 25% cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">It is a cut of approximately €200 million on the 2010 allocation with more cuts planned until the budget has been reduced to €266 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> The budgets of consecutive Governments have brought extreme financial pressure to bear on families in this State. Water metering has an immediate and negative impact, particularly on the vulnerable sector. Taking into account poverty levels and income distribution, it is obvious water charges will impact on this group. Water charges must be considered within the broader context of the additional costs low income households will face in 2013. I am sure I do not need to explain that to the Minister of State. People are under serious pressure as a result of the cut in child benefit, the €100 household charge, the property tax, which it is estimated will be on average €495 per household, the increase in the carbon levy which will affect solid fuel to the tune of €5 per tonne, the reduction in the fuel allowance from 32 to 26 weeks, the 2% VAT increase, increased public transport fares, the increase in the drugs payment scheme thresholds, the increase in prescription charges and increases in school transport costs. </p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Water is a resource that everybody needs. Sinn Féin agrees on the need for better co-ordination across the island of Ireland in ensuring water is brought to where it is needed when it is needed and that homes and communities are protected against the adverse effects of flooding. In this State, there are 34 local authorities supplying water to almost 2 million households. There has been some debate on whether the actual number in this regard is 1.7 million or 1.9 million. Sinn Féin has opposed the introduction of water charges North and South and will continue to do so. We successfully campaigned against their introduction here in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
          <p eId="para_305"> This Bill is fundamentally flawed and is based on false notions. On 24 January 2012, the Minister of State claimed that Ireland was the only country in the OECD where citizens did not pay directly for water. However, he failed to mention that people in the North, which is approximately an hour's drive from here and ten minutes from the Minister of State's home town, also do not pay water rates.</p>

          <p eId="para_312"> Despite the best attempt of the British Government to bully the Assembly into imposing water charges, the Sinn Féin Minister for Regional Development, Mr. Conor Murphy, MLA, ensured that no charges were introduced. I feel obliged to set the record straight on the Government's mischief-making and lies on the issue of rates, charges and stealth taxes. Its tactics have nothing to do with informing debate but are simply an attack on Sinn Féin in an effort to undermine its support. The Minister of State, who has been a Member of this House for a long time and understands how government works, knows that the Assembly has no fiscal powers and as such cannot increase or decrease taxes. Taxation is the preserve of Westminster. Sinn Féin wants fiscal independence from London. If Fine Gael or the Labour Party can do anything to assist us in this regard we would appreciate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> People in the North pay rates based on the valuation of their homes, which funding is used to meet the cost of local and regional services, which is not dissimilar to the rates which previously existed in this jurisdiction but for reasons of political expediency were abolished in 1977 by Fianna Fáil. Crucially, those exempted from payment of rates in the North include people in receipt of the disabled person's allowance, people on low incomes, people in receipt of housing benefit, pensioners and zero and low carbon homes. This Government has made no provision for similar groups here. This will all happen at one remove from Government. If the Minister of State and I are still Members of this House in one or two year's time and I ask questions of him about water issues he will tell me they are a matter for Irish Water.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">The proposals in respect of the installation of water meters and imposition of water charges was dreamed up by Fianna Fáil and is now being kept alive by Fine Gael, supported by the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil's National Development Plan 2011-2012 states: "Part of the expenditure saving package will arise from the introduction of a scheme of metering and charges for domestic water. Overall, it is anticipated that these measures could lead to an annual saving of €500 million". Fianna Fáil is now opposed to the introduction of water charges. </p>
          <p eId="para_334"> This Bill sets in train a process that will see 1.3 million holes drilled outside people's homes and the installation of water meters with money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This means people will have to pay twice or, if the Government has its way, three times, for water, first through their incomes, second through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and third, through water rates. </p>
          <p eId="para_335"> The installation of meters will prove costly and inefficient and will result in 1.3 million holes in footpaths. Experts, including the local authority professional officers, estimate the cost in this regard will be €1.2 billion. Other estimates include one for €500 million. Meanwhile, private companies in Britain are attempting to complete installation of water meters 20 years after the process first commenced. Installation of water meters in Ireland was supposed to commence in 2012. I am not aware of any water meter having been installed. The Government also stated the process would be completed over two years.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">That may be so. I can guarantee the Minister of State that the process will not be completed in two or even four years. This Bill is nothing more than a Trojan horse for privatisation of our water services in the future. The Minister of State claims that is not the Government's intention, which I accept is true at this point. However, he will know that intentions and circumstances can change as opportunities arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Sinn Féin has actively campaigned against charges in the past and will redouble its efforts to ensure they are consigned to the dustbin of history. The Government can expect stiff opposition from across the country to the introduction of water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">These include gated developments and apartment blocks, in addition to houses that already have pipes running through their backyards or old lead pipes running behind terraced houses and through gardens. How does the Minister intend to get around that issue and deal with it? It is a serious matter.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_22">We will stand with the people on this.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23"> When the Bill was introduced in the Seanad two weeks ago, we were the only party to table amendments. We tabled 24 amendments ranging from outright rejection of certain sections to outlining our alternative solutions for improving the water quality system. It is worth noting that Fianna Fáil did not table amendments. Is there a meeting of minds between the three parties?</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_24"> We fully understand the challenges that lie ahead for the water sector. The Government has used the crisis as an opportunity to promote a ripening agenda of charging people for something for which they already pay, as I have outlined. Our approach is different and is based on ensuring that water provision remains in public ownership and is paid for through fair and progressive taxation. Sinn Féin proposes investing money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund in creating real jobs with a positive legacy. The money that will be wasted on meters which will not save one drop of water should be invested in upgrading an aging and leaking water distribution network. The €500 million referred to in the Bill would fund water conservation for six years and it would be far more appropriate to invest €500 million in water conservation rather than in meter installation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25"> Sinn Féin supports the introduction of district metering as opposed to domestic water meters in every household. This is already in place in local authority areas. It is cheaper and very effective. It operates in County Laois and on my road in Clonroosk View. The engineers tell me it works very well in several parts of the county. It is of great assistance to local authorities in identifying leaks and it is cheap. We call on the Government to abandon its ill-fated domestic water metering scheme and instead expand district metering. This would be far more cost effective and would ensure water leakage is detected quickly and efficiently and is stopped.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26"> At present, the water sector is managed by the 34 local authorities. The move to Irish Water will not improve accountability in government. Local authorities, however imperfect they may be, are accountable to their communities. There are able to meet local demand and can provide solutions when emergencies arise. The Minister of State's county supplied County Down with water because it has a single water authority at one remove from the government in the Assembly and we have seen the problems this caused. Whatever difficulties existed in Louth, the problems in Down and Armagh were worse.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27"> Following the establishment of Irish Water debates like this one today simply will not happen. The water sector will no longer be accountable to the elected representatives and the public they serve. One will no longer go to one's local councillor, Deputy or Minister to register a complaint or raise a concern; one will have to call a call centre on an 1890 number. The State water distribution network is antiquated. A decade of underinvestment means in some local authority areas more than half the water is lost through leaks, but it is not lost in households. The water leaks from the water distribution network. The State water distribution network is antiquated and one county is heading for 60% leakage. With average leakage at a staggering 41%, we understand there is a need for increased capital funding in the State water infrastructure. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government must return to at least 2011 levels of investment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28"> The Minister's proposals are focused on the domestic householder and there is no mention of the debt owed by the commercial sector where only 52% of commercial water rates are collected. It appears households are been penalised for the lack of building regulations, leaking pipes in the network and poor governance. Local authorities and the Government must take action on the outstanding water rates owed by the commercial sector to the State.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29"> The crisis facing water supply does not start or finish at the Border. Recognising that river basin management districts cover both sides of the Border, it is essential to have co-ordination of the water sector. We must develop an all-Ireland strategy for water provision. There is a requirement on the Northern Assembly and the Government to collaborate on the delivery of services where shared resources, joint capital investment in infrastructure and procurement would clearly prove beneficial on an all-Ireland basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30"> Sinn Féin calls for the establishment of a national water sector framework team overseeing governance of the water sector and capital investment. This would work with local authorities and comprise city and county managers and be convened by the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31"> The establishment of Irish Water is a Trojan horse for the installation of water meters and the imposition of charges and lays the foundations for the full privatisation of the water sector, which would be very easily done when water has become a commodity. In the drive to establish Irish Water, the Government continues to promote myths about water meters and water charges. The first of these myths is that the public gets water for free. This is untrue as people already pay through taxes. Another myth is that all other citizens in the EU pay water charges. This is simply not true, and I mentioned the situation in the North despite the best efforts of the British Government. The Government would also have us believe that water metering reduces consumption. We raised this with the Minister of State previously. In England, where water metering has been in place for many years, consumption is at 158 litres per head per day. The Dublin water supply report of 2008 showed consumption of 148 litres per day. This was at a time of very bad leakage in the system, which has improved massively since. All of the evidence points towards metering being simply a bad idea and being enforced by a Government hell-bent on making ordinary families pay for the current economic disasters in which we find ourselves. This is on top of the family home tax and many other charges. We have spoken many times about people hanging on the edge. Many people are on the point of falling over the edge. This is a serious imposition on people.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_32"> The Bill should be rejected. Does the Minister of State agree that the Bill should be poverty proved? Does the Minister of State agree the money allocated for meters would be better used to upgrade the leaking and crumbling system? The figure of €500 million has been mentioned but local authority professional staff reckon the amount will be €1.2 billion. Assuming the figure for meter installation is correct at €500 million, €500 million more will be required for upgrades and €500 million more on the Shannon-Dublin project. This amounts to €1.5 billion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33"> I have set out for the Minister of State why the €500 million being spent on meters will not save water. Would it not be better to invest it in the crumbling water network to stop leakage and conserve water? This significant issue needs to be addressed. I am not saying this to have a shot at the Minister of State, I say it sincerely. We firmly believe this and we are passionate about it.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34"> What effort is being made by the Government and the Department to get local authorities to collect the 48% of commercial water rates which are outstanding? In our house we pay commercial water rates and gladly so because it is the system which exists. My point is we cannot have a situation where almost half of the charges are not paid. It is lunacy. There is something seriously wrong. I understand businesses go out of business and changeovers occur and that businesses, particularly small businesses, are going through a very difficult time in every town, village and city, but 48% not being collected amounts to a huge amount of money. This is a major issue for us. Will the Minister of State address this issue with regard to the €500 million it is proposed will be spent on installing meters? I gave the water consumption figures for England where meters are in place and the figures for Dublin in 2008 before the leaks were fixed. Slightly less water was being used by people in Dublin.</summary>

          <p eId="para_342">That is the total but the operational cost is €700 million. Irish Water will not provide it for €700 million. I am not holding up County Laois as a model, but the local authority there has been very efficient in providing water services. It has obtained money from the Department and has used some of its own development levies. It has invested steadily in water services over the past ten or 12 years. I would ask the Minister of State to do one exercise and get his officials to pull out the file to examine it. If one examines the total annual budget, one can see that those water services are being provided at a very reasonable cost. Water quality has improved, although there can of course be further improvements. Given those figures, there is no way that the new entity will provide those services as efficiently. Nor will it be able to protect ground water to the same extent as the county council can when working with the local community. Irish Water will not have the expertise that council engineers, workers and water-keepers currently have. That is a fact.</p>

The best we can hope for is that somebody from Irish Water-Uisce Éireann will be invited once every year or two to talk to the Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht where we will get a few minutes each to ask questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> I am asking the Minister of State to reconsider this proposal, which should be rejected. It should be replaced by a proper plan to work in a co-ordinated way under a national framework team in conjunction with local authorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">Thank you. While I must admit that the idea of setting up a single utility company to manage water services across the country does have some merit, I worked in water services myself in the real world before being elected to the House and I have seen some of the problems that have arisen. They were created through the mismanagement of such services. Within the 34 local authorities, there is currently a surfeit of management of water services. In many counties there is not enough scale involved, particularly when one looks at smaller counties where services are duplicated. From that viewpoint, there is some merit in having a single utility but the Bill's motivation is not to provide for an improved service. Its motivation is to privatise water services. I will return to that point later.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> If we do establish a single utility there are risks involved. We will lose local knowledge in terms of how staff can respond to emergencies. We will lose the local workforce and the ability to react quickly. This was shown starkly a few years ago during the severe winters. In County Donegal, staff were out every day dealing with issues and resolving problems right away.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Across the Border in the Six Counties, as Deputy Stanley mentioned, water services collapsed because a decision was taken to establish a single entity to look after them. They took away the local knowledge and workforce and centralised the service. It turned out in the North that they could not respond to emergency situations when a crisis occurred. I fear that under the aegis of Irish Water that level of response will be taken away from local services. The management will be too distant from what is happening locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> The Bill also provides for the introduction of domestic water charges. The costs involved have already been mentioned in the House. I must agree that the Government is underestimating the cost, which will be significantly more. Over the last six or seven years, Donegal County Council has rolled out a non-domestic water metering programme. The council borrowed €9.7 million to install 11,000 meters across the county. On a <i>pro rata</i> basis, it means that the cost to the State could be anything up to €1.7 billion for the roll-out of water metering across the country. That money will be raised by a loan through Irish Water and whether it is from the National Pensions Reserve Fund or elsewhere, it will have to be repaid. In County Donegal, commercial water charges are repaid through a standing charge. Every metered property has a standing charge and the entire amount goes back in loan repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Will there be a standing charge on domestic properties here to pay for installing water meters? If so, not only will the Government be charging for water, it will also force consumers to pay for installing meters on their property.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Water charging is the real goal of this Bill. I never cease to be amazed to hear Deputies saying that one cannot get something for free, and that we cannot continue to pay nothing for a service that costs a lot to deliver. That is the kind of mantra being put out by those in favour of water charges, but it is utter rubbish. We do pay for water in this country. People who tax their cars have been paying for water since 1997. We also pay through general taxation, so everybody who contributes tax to the State pays for water. </p>
          <p eId="para_359"> When Irish Water is established and metering is put in place, we will still be taxing our cars and paying taxes to the Exchequer. We will also be paying for water at an estimated cost of €370 per household. That is the figure that has been quoted so far. The Fine Gael election manifesto promised that no water charges would be introduced until every property in the country was metered. We can see where that promise has gone. We now see that a fixed standing charge will be introduced while the water metering programme is being rolled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Following evidence to the Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government, we heard that at best only 15% of water meters will be installed in 2013. For many years to come, therefore, people will be paying fixed charges for water services, which Fine Gael has said should not be paid for until a fair metering process can be put in place and people can thus be charged on the basis of water consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Government continues with the mantra that if one pays for something, one will respect it, that the dearer something is, the less one will use and that people will respect water and use less of it because of the price. However, the consumption of water does not respond to price. One may get an initial kick when water charging is introduced and some drop in consumption but the consumption of water does not respond to price. It is deemed to be price inelastic in economic terms, which means that if one increases the price, consumption is not affected. The figures in this regard are quite low and there is very little reduction in consumption on foot of a price increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The motivation for this measure is completely flawed. It appears to be to set up a utility, a billing system and a management system nationwide, thereby setting it up for privatisation. Over the past 20 years of privatisation, massive profit-taking has taken place within the English water companies. In one instance, according to figures I have seen, the water utility in Devon and Cornwall made a profit of more than £100 million in a year. I believe this to be the ultimate goal this Bill hopes to achieve in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> As for water charging, in his summing up the Minister of State might explain whether VAT will be charged on the water that will be provided to consumers and whether the charge per year of €370 will be inclusive or exclusive of VAT.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I did not think the time had gone so quickly. PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_372">... once Irish Water is well established as a self-funding utility, the Government and Regulators may wish to assess international experience of the introduction of competition in water and sewerage services to identify whether Ireland could benefit from competitive markets in the water sector at a later date. With this in mind, [PricewaterhouseCoopers] recommend[s] that, when undertaking the detailed design of the new organisational structure for Irish Water, the possibility of future retail competition should be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">This is clearly evident in this Bill, which provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation will set the prices and the tariff for water. This is giving that remove away from the control of the prices. Moreover, one should recall how the Commission for Energy Regulation has worked in the past. On its establishment in 1990, Ireland had the second cheapest electricity in Europe. Over the years, it has increased the price of electricity and approximately 67% of the overall increase therein is directly attributable to the Commission for Energy Regulation bumping up the price to make it more attractive for competition to come into this market. Is this what will happen in the future in respect of the pricing of water? Will the Commission for Energy Regulation bump up this price to entice water companies into this country to pitch for our utility?</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> On the legislation itself, I note section 5(4) provides for the distribution of shares in Water Ireland. It provides that one share shall be given to Bord Gáis and the remaining two shares should go to the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Finance. While the Bill provides that Bord Gáis cannot sell its share without the approval of the Minister for Finance, what about the other two shares? There is no mention of how they might be disposed of and no restriction is placed on their disposal. The Government already has decided to sell off Bord Gáis and the retail network. In the future Members will see that the Government will decide to sell off Water Ireland as well, as part of the break-up of Bord Gáis and the removal of our public utility.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The European Union rules are very clear in this regard. If one pays for a service or commodity, it must be opened up for competition. Consequently, the Minister of State should come clean to the House, through this Bill, as to what are the Government's future intentions. If the intention is to retain Water Ireland in public ownership, that should be included specifically in the Bill and provisions made to ensure it cannot be removed from public ownership.</p>

This is the very least one should expect from the Government. This Bill should protect this vital natural resource and should not set it up for privatisation. It should make sure that the control of this natural resource is protected and vested in the Irish people. As I do not think this Bill will achieve that, I will oppose it.</p>

As Deputy Pringle and others have stated, this is evidence of the furtherance of the neoliberal agenda being under way. It is the first step towards the setting up of Irish Water. The appointment of John Tierney to an executive post has already taken place. I know John Tierney from Fingal County Council and while he is a very nice man, he has no expertise whatsoever in respect of water. Moreover, even before this Bill came before the House, a recruitment drive has been under way.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">A new recruitment drive already is under way, in which staff in the local authorities are being invited to avail of jobs in a secondment process to Irish Water. A total of 80 positions are on offer at present, covering 15 different categories and grades of work. These jobs are being advertised for engineers at various levels and qualifications below those at which such people would work in the local authorities. People are being recruited for a junior engineering position but are being asked to undertake work that would be done by someone at a higher grade in the local authority. A process of downgrading jobs and so on already is under way and certainly, were I a union official in the local authorities, I would be advising staff to boycott that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> The entire premise on which Irish Water was established was based on the so-called independent report from PricewaterhouseCoopers. However, as has been articulated in this House many times previously, that report was not independent but was seriously flawed in that the conclusions reached on the reason Irish Water was needed were based on a false analysis of Scottish Water. Incorrect information was submitted with regard to the scale of the water pipe infrastructure in Scotland and incorrect figures also were given for the workforce inside Scottish Water. Although these points have been challenged previously in this House, the Minister simply shrugged his shoulders and basically ignored the figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> In the aforementioned report, which led to the foundation of Irish Water or the Government's decision to set it up as a so-called independent entity, one was told the reason it was necessary to do this was there is a demand from investors for clean water supplies. There is absolutely no basis to the argument that any investor has ever shunned Ireland because of a lack of clean water. Moreover, one was told that climate change is leading to a threat in Ireland's water supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Water that is unaccounted for and a lack of rainwater harvesting in public buildings is more of a threat to our water supply than the fact that we have not yet established Irish Water. The population projections given are more suited to the Celtic tiger years than the reality of population growth in the coming period. The establishment of Irish Water is not necessary to achieve compliance with the EU water framework and the work could be done based on the expertise that already exists within local authorities. I will not repeat the points made by Deputy Pringle.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> This legislation will allow the Government to introduce water meters under a con and environmental cover, with the idea that it will eventually lead to water conservation. This is completely and utterly false. Perhaps I will finish up now and we can revisit the debate at another time.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">I wish to make an important announcement for the information of the House. The Government has met in the past hour to consider a proposal from the Minister for Finance to once and for all remove the promissory notes relating to the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. This proposal follows the conclusion of discussions between the European Central Bank and the Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> When Fine Gael and Labour formed a new Government in 2011, we promised to renegotiate the bailout programme inherited from the previous Government to secure a fairer and more affordable solution to our banking and sovereign debt crises. In particular, we committed to replacing short-term, emergency Central Bank lending secured against the promissory notes used by the previous Government to bail out the worst Irish banks with longer term, more affordable financing that reduces the burden on Irish taxpayers and restores confidence among other potential investors in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> The promissory notes, in this Government’s view, represent a highly onerous and unfair legacy of the banking crisis. Under this promissory note arrangement put in place by the previous Government, Irish taxpayers were due to pay €3.1 billion next March and every March until 2023 and declining payments until 2031 to cover the massive private losses of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. Including interest costs, the lifetime cost of the promissory notes would have been almost €48 billion. I am pleased to announce today that Ireland has reached a conclusion to its discussions with the European Central Bank that delivers on our commitment to put in place a fairer and more sustainable arrangement. This is the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> There is the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, as legislated for by the Oireachtas this morning. The remnants of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide – stains on our international reputations and dents to our national pride – have now been removed from the financial and political landscape. Their closure bookends a tragic chapter in our country’s history.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The annual promissory notes payments are gone. The liquidation this morning caused the Central Bank to assume full ownership of the €25 billion in promissory notes and other collateral held as security for the funds provided by the Central Bank to the IBRC. Under the agreement reached today with the European Central Bank, the promissory notes are being exchanged for long-term Irish Government bonds with maturities of up to 40 years. The first principal payment will not now be made until 2038 and the last payment will be made in 2053. The average maturity of the Government bonds will be over 34 years, as opposed to the seven to eight year average maturity on the promissory notes. In effect, we have replaced a short-term, high-interest rate overdraft that had to be paid down quickly through more expensive borrowings, with long-term, cheap, interest-only loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> In addition, by agreement with the ECB, the liquidation of IBRC has caused the Central Bank to take ownership of the €3.4 billion bond used to settle the promissory note last March. As a result, there will be a €20 billion reduction in the NTMA’s market borrowing requirements in the next decade as we seek to restore the economy to full employment, and a very large reduction in the debt servicing costs of the State over the next generation. The average interest rate on the new bonds will begin at just over 3%, compared with an interest rate of well over 8% on the promissory notes. This will result in a reduction in the State’s general government deficit of approximately €1 billion per annum over the coming years, which will bring us €1 billion closer to attaining our 3% deficit target by 2015. This means that the expenditure reductions and tax increases will be of the order of €1 billion less to meet the 3% deficit target. This plan will lead to a substantial improvement in the State’s debt position over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> Today’s outcome is an historic step on the road to economic recovery. It secures the future financial position of the State by reducing the burden on Irish taxpayers arising from the bailout of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. Step by step, this Government is undoing the disastrous banking policies that brought this State to the brink of national bankruptcy.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_407">The agreement has reduced Ireland’s vulnerability from the huge debts taken on by Irish taxpayers as a result of the cost of rescuing failed private banks. Irish citizens can look forward once again with positive expectations. The legacy banking debt hoisted on the Irish taxpayer is a heavy burden and the promissory notes in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide served as a millstone around the neck of the Irish taxpayer. It was referred to often in this House and this burden served to erode confidence and limit the economy’s ability to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The new plan will likely materially improve perceptions of our debt sustainability in the eyes of potential investors in Ireland, leading to lower interest rates and faster growth than would otherwise have been the case. A successful Irish exit from the bailout by the end of this year would prove that a combination of intensive national reform efforts and European solidarity can deliver results.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Let there be no doubt, this is no silver bullet to end all our economic problems. After the catastrophic economic management of the past decade, there is still a long way to travel in our country’s journey back to prosperity and full employment. The damage done by these financial institutions will take many years to rectify. Even as the lower interest rates resulting with this agreement reduce Ireland’s deficit, a very large and unsustainable gap between Government revenues and spending remains to be fixed; that gap is unrelated to our banking crisis. Only we in Ireland can fix this problem by reforming the way our State and country works.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> We continue to negotiate to improve other core elements of the onerous bailout deal inherited from the previous Government. Today, we have secured a vastly better deal on the cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. Tomorrow we continue our efforts to seek European assistance to recover as much taxpayers’ money as possible from the other financial institutions bailed out by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">That is an important consideration that should not be lost on people. </p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Eurozone leaders, including Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande, have publicly recognised the unique circumstances behind Ireland’s sovereign debt crisis and mandated the Eurogroup to address these issues. What today shows is that the more Ireland is prepared to help itself, the more others will assist us along the difficult path we still have to travel. It is a step forward in accelerating our path back to economic recovery and renewed job creation. It can give us confidence that our goals are achievable and our hopes realisable.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> It is important to recognise the independent efforts of the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, his staff and officials from the European Central Bank in securing this agreement. I am confident it will contribute hugely to the ongoing rebuilding of trust between Irish and European authorities in the management of the banking crisis and other challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Today’s result has been brought about by a strong and determined collective effort by the entire Government. We made perfectly clear 18 months ago that this outcome was one of our principal economic objectives. I thank the Tánaiste and all Ministers for their contribution to it. Most of all, I publicly thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his officials for leading these negotiations to a successful conclusion. The general public may not be aware that the staff of the Department of Finance worked through the night on many occasions in the past 18 months. Their dedicated service to the State in their tireless, persistent and patient work over that period should serve as an inspiration to all public servants.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">Together with a small team of officials, he has given himself fully to the task and this result is a tremendous tribute to his skill and determination. Those involved in "Project Red", as it became known, are aware of what it took to get this done. I thank them on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland. I also thank the officials in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform who worked directly with the troika on this and other issues. I mention, in particular, the officials in my Department, our ambassadors and diplomats in the eurozone missions and beyond, who have put this issue at the forefront of their agenda for months. That we have reached this point is the result of the hard slog by them, every Minister of the Government and, in particular, the Taoiseach who seized every possible opportunity to make Ireland's case. This is a good day for Irish diplomacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> I have been involved in negotiations in one form or another for all of my adult life but I have never forgotten the lesson I learned in my first days as a young trade union official, namely, that one should never organise an ice cream strike in the middle of winter. In other words, when one is in negotiation, one should not play one's hand until it is strong. When this Government came into office our hand was not strong. While many inside and outside this House demanded that we act when our hand was weak, the Government took a different approach. We knew and understood that we first had to repair Ireland's reputation abroad. We worked hard to do this, explaining what had happened to our country and what the Government would do to put it right. We made clear that while we were willing to deal with our own problems, we were carrying an unacceptable share of other people's mistakes. Over time and with patience and hard work, this message has got through and it is on that basis that we are able to make this announcement today. </p>
          <p eId="para_421"> It has been a long and difficult slog to get to this point but it has been worth it. This package of measures will make a marked difference to Ireland's debt sustainability, our prospects of regaining our economic sovereignty and the process of economic recovery. We will reduce our borrowing requirement by €20 billion over the next ten years. We will reduce our deficit by an annual figure of €1 billion from 2014 onwards. We are tearing up the promissory note and we have wiped Anglo Irish Bank off the map. We are converting the promissory note into long-term bonds which have an average maturity of approximately 34 years. We are bringing far greater certainty to the financial landscape and righting a wrong that was done to the Irish people more than four years ago. </p>
          <p eId="para_422"> This deal is a tribute, in the first place, to the endurance and patience of Irish people who have understood that difficult decisions and sacrifices had to be made to secure economic recovery. This agreement lifts a considerable burden from their shoulders.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">However, this deal is also a testimony to the Deputies in this House who have had the courage to support the Government in the difficult work we have had to do.

I thank them today for what they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Today's announcement is not an end in itself but another major step on our way back. As the Taoiseach stated, we have further work to do on the separation of bank and sovereign debt and we will do that work from today onwards. This is an important step forward, which shows we are succeeding, making progress and will succeed.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">The position of the Fianna Fáil Party, which has been absolutely consistent from the very start, is that Ireland deserves a significant easing of the burden of bank related debt. Over the past two years, the European Union and European Central Bank have radically changed their policies towards dealing with failing banks. Today, states are able to close down banks and burn bondholders without the fear of contagion, which was the defining characteristic of the crisis from 2008 to 2010. The Taoiseach acknowledged this at a meeting with President Hollande in Paris last year when he stated it was the imposition of this policy by the ECB which prevented the burning of bondholders at that particular time. No amount of grandstanding can change that reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> It was the absence of these policies by the European Central Bank and others which was directly and specifically responsible for the level of debt carried by the State and the State being pushed out of the sovereign debt market. The new and more pragmatic leadership at the ECB has perhaps been the most significant game changer in the past 12 months in relation to the eurozone at a wider level. I note the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is acknowledging this. </p>

          <p eId="para_430">-----with his more pragmatic approach to the European Central Bank, ECB. This has changed the atmosphere across Europe and the external perception of it. Last year's existential crisis in the eurozone has eased considerably. It is not out of the woods yet, but it is in a significantly better position than it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> The banking union was agreed last June. It has been a significant development, although we await the actual realisation and meat on the bone of that proposal. GDP growth has been slower than expected, making our debt dynamics more worrying and concentrating minds within European institutions, including the ECB.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Ireland is sticking to the bailout programme plan despite all of the condemnation of same in an earlier period. The Irish people have taken a great deal and proven resilient in the face of the additional taxes, cutbacks and so forth with which they have been confronted. We would welcome any easing of that debt position. Although we have not had time to analyse the full details of whatever deal has been announced, we look forward to a deeper and more independent analysis and closer scrutiny of same. From what the Taoiseach has stated, it appears that the deal will improve our cash flow and funding positions in terms of how much the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, must borrow in future. This is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> The deal gives greater certainty to our capacity to leave the bailout programme. In realistic and broader terms, however, this will not make a significant difference to the everyday life experience of people on the island. It just means that we will be borrowing on the markets as opposed to borrowing at good rates from the ECB. This will be the only difference after moving out of the bailout programme, as the disciplines of the market will continue to exist in terms of one's fiscal position.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> From what the Taoiseach has stated, the deal represents a modest easing of the budgetary situation to the tune of €1 billion. We have €5 billion to go if we are to reach the 3% deficit target. This seems to have been eased by €1 billion. In this respect, what is the situation as regards compliance with the deficit target, does the Government have the flexibility to apply the €1 billion to reducing, for example, the €3 billion plus correction anticipated in next year's budget and will the deal mean fewer taxes than would otherwise have been imposed in the next budget? Will the deal have a direct impact on the €5 billion adjustment that is due in the next two years? Will it lessen the correction? People on the street and at home would like to hear that it would. They are concerned about the amount of taxes that they must pay, the various cuts in education, health and so on and the challenges facing a range of sectors in society. We need more clarity on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> On the basis of all reasonable economic, social and equity concerns, Ireland has a significant right to debt relief in this regard. We were the first to take a hit to prevent contagion in the eurozone. Our country was dealt with unfairly.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">At last year's June summit, it was clearly stated that there would be a separation of sovereign debt from banking debt. It has not been done in this deal. In many respects, the link is being cemented. Last June and in the context of the "game changer", the Government gave a clear commitment that the ESM would retroactively fund our investment in our legacy and pillar banks and that significant relief would be forthcoming in respect of the banking debts on our books. At some stage, will the Taoiseach outline to the House when the possibility of the ESM investing in our legacy banks will be addressed?</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> We have been clear - the ECB did not deal with Ireland fairly from the outset. Europe's policies on burning bondholders and the creation of mechanisms such as the ESM to recapitalise banks did not exist when the banking collapse occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The situation has changed. Ireland deserved a fair deal and a better deal. The question is whether the deal goes far enough and to what degree it affects people in terms of their taxes and cuts to fundamental services on which they rely in their daily lives. Our welcome is very much a qualified one, awaiting a more detailed and independent analysis of the impact of the deal. Any alleviation of the Irish debt situation is welcome and we support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">Last year, we had to endure Ministers telling us there was a seismic shift and that the State had secured a great deal in Europe on the separation of sovereign debt from private, toxic banking debt. Today, they come before the Chamber and tell us that they will replace the promissory note with a sovereign bond for €28 billion with no write-down whatsoever. So much for the separation of toxic banking debt and sovereign debt. The question most people want answered is how it will affect them. People are angry that they have been lamped and asked by the previous Administration to pay the toxic debt of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide. What they expected in the mandate they gave the parties which now form the Government was to get a deal which would mean they would not have to pay the debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The Taoiseach has come to the Chamber today to say to every single man, woman and child in the State that they will pay back every single penny of the toxic Anglo Irish Bank debt. He said it will be done by this generation and future generations of taxpayers. We are supposed to jump with joy at the fact that it is a long-term bond, a 40-year bond with average maturities of 34 years. This week my youngest son began to crawl. He was not even born at the time the promissory note was issued by Deputy Martin and his Cabinet colleagues, yet when he will be 40 years of age the State will still be paying back the toxic debts of Anglo Irish Bank. The Taoiseach said this is a fair deal. He said it is about easing the burden on taxpayers. What about those children who had no hand, act or part to play and who did not benefit from the boom? Does the Taoiseach consider it is fair for them to be lamped with this burden?</p>

          <p eId="para_501">The Taoiseach has said that not only will the full €28 billion will be paid back in a sovereign bond but €1 billion of interest will be paid on top of that every single year. The payment will no longer be circular because the Central Bank will not hold the bond for a 40-year period. Bondholders will get the interest paid by the State. One could ask what all of that will mean. When one gets rid of all the spin, the €28 billion from the promissory note will be paid back in a sovereign bond and €34 billion of interest will be paid on top of that. Fair play to the lads. What they have done is turned a €28 billion promissory note – the cost of the toxic debt of Anglo Irish Bank – into a €64 billion sovereign liability to the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">I appreciate that the Government would like to spin to the effect that it got rid of the toxic debt but sometimes it can be difficult to listen to hard truths. People want to know what the deal will mean for them. They want to know what it will mean for the person in mortgage distress, the mother whose child is planning to emigrate or the person who is unemployed. Does it mean they will not pay back the debt? Under the Government’s proposal to turn the promissory note into a sovereign bond that will be put out into the market, every single man, woman and child will pay approximately €14,000. That is not the deal the people were waiting for. That is not the mandate the people gave the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party. What we wanted was a debt write-down. As I said last night, the Government has wound down Anglo Irish Bank but it has not wound down the debt. What we have found out today is that instead of winding down the debt, the Government has cranked it up. It has placed liabilities on the State and on this and future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> I will conclude with a number of questions because the detail is still scant and we must tease it out and parse it. The Taoiseach indicated that the deal will assist us in reaching the troika targets by approximately €1 billion. He is aware that under the Government’s plan next year’s budget involves €3.1 billion of tax increases and cuts. More austerity will be heaped on top of the €30 billion of adjustment that took place in the past six budgets. Could the Taoiseach confirm that only €2.1 billion will be required as a result of the initiative he announced today?</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Could he also tell us the net present value of the promissory note replacement and the net present gain in that regard? For how long has the Central Bank agreed to hold on to the sovereign bond? Serious questions must be asked. This time last year the Government said it would not pay the promissory note. We know from Mario Draghi that he took copious notes at yesterday’s European Central Bank dinner and its meeting today. The question remains as to how the deal will be a benefit to people. How can it be presented as a fair deal when the overall mountain of debt on the Irish people has been increased? The Taoiseach might decide to shake his head but he has not announced an interest-free bond. He has not announced that the Government will issue a zero coupon rate bond. If that were the case it would cost €28 billion. The Taoiseach has said there will be an average interest rate of 3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> That is what is happening. When one gets rid of all the spin, although Fine Gael’s Labour Party colleagues applauded the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Taoiseach, the Government has doubled the liability on the State and the people.</p>

Let us look at the one in four people who are in mortgage distress, who have either interest-only repayments or are in mortgage arrears. Look at the 100,000 people who were forced to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul simply to put food on their table or oil into tanks to keep warm during the winter months.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">They are the reasons and the mandate that the Government had to say to the ECB that we are not paying this back. I watched Mario Draghi's press conference and he was like a Cheshire cat. There is no more ELA because the ECB got what it wanted, hook, line and sinker. It will be paid back in full and bondholders who will buy or hold this bond in the future will also get full payment on this toxic debt and the interest on top of it. Shame on the Minister, shame on the Taoiseach and shame on the Tánaiste. This is not the mandate they were given.</p>

Like the other speakers, I want to pay tribute to the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the officials in the Department of Finance for their hard work and endeavours, but sadly they have not delivered. What have we got? A child who is born today will get a lovely birthday present in 25 years time, in 2038 - a noose around his or her neck. That is what will happen. We are kicking the can down the road. Why did the Government not act on the mandate it got less than two years ago? This time two years ago its members were out canvassing. According to the Tánaiste, hell's fire was not going to be hot enough for the bondholders. Satan was stoking the fire and the Tánaiste was going to be hotter than that and he was going to burn them, but no bondholder has been burned. </p>

          <p eId="para_603">Obviously, the whole thing is a bit farcical at this stage. I do not know why the Government and the Whips have not adjourned this business and allowed us to discuss the key issue of the day. However, we will now attend to these matters which are, in many ways, as important and will also have long-standing implications but which are clearly being overshadowed by the other events of the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Clearly, the key plank of this legislation is to allow the Government to introduce domestic water meters. No doubt it will be surrounded by publicity and spin, that this will be a great step forward in terms of water conservation in Ireland. That, however, is a complete and utter joke. The Minister of State has already said that the Government intends to begin a programme of introducing water meters later this year. In the context of the legislation on the property tax, the Government is envisaging a scenario whereby, having pushed through that draconian legislation which enables Revenue to put its hands into the pockets of workers, social welfare recipients and pensioners to take that property tax from them, at around the same time, Irish Water will be visiting houses and housing estates to install water meters. What a recipe for an absolute and utter social explosion of resistance. It is patently obvious that it will be resisted the length and breadth of the country because ordinary people are not stupid. They know full well that a domestic water meter does not conserve water. All of the research and studies show that when water meters are introduced, initially, but temporarily, they may succeed in reducing water consumption by around 10%. All of the analyses, by Engineers Ireland and others, refers to that figure. The best case scenario is a 10% reduction in domestic water consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> All of us agree that there are very few people in this State who go out to work in the morning and leave their taps running because they could not care less. That does not mean that all of us could not do more to conserve water, however. Of course we could, but simple measures of education would be sufficient to deal with that. Our children are much better at conserving water than we are. They have been educated to turn the tap off when brushing their teeth and so forth. Education measures can assist and they work with our young people. We can all do better in this regard but we do not need a charge or a measure to do that - a simple education programme would do the job. The key reason for the excess use of water in domestic properties is the way in which those properties were designed. The lack of dual-flush toilets in older properties, for example, means that Irish toilets consume vastly greater quantities of water than toilets in other European countries. The lack of rainwater harvesting and the use of grey water facilities and so on are also an issue. If such measures were implemented, they could reduce domestic water consumption by around 50%. If the Department was really serious about reducing domestic water consumption, a programme to introduce such conservation measures, by way of a grant scheme, would be far more effective than any meter on a property. </p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Domestic consumption only accounts for a small percentage of the overall treated water consumption in this State. We must go back to the big-picture issue of unaccounted-for water and leaks. Let us look at the figures in that regard. The figures for unaccounted-for water across the local authorities in 2008 was 43.44%, in 2009, it was 44.5% and in 2010, the figure was 42.3%. It is an absolute and utter crime that treated water is going back into the ground. The figures for all of the major urban areas in 2010 are shocking - in Cork city, the leakage rate was 55%, in Dublin city, 46.36%, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, 28%, South Dublin was top of the range at just over 20%, Fingal, 30%, Galway city, 48%, Waterford, 47%, Limerick, 57% and Donegal and Kerry, 53% and 59% respectively. If we want to conserve water and save money, that is where the investment has to go. The Government has made a major propaganda argument about the jobs that will be created by the water meter installation programme but far more jobs would be created if the Government put crews to work, fixing the leaks in the water mains. I am not just talking off the top of my head in this regard. The studies and works done by local authorities over the years prove that this is the case. They also prove that such work can have a far greater impact on the amount of water saved than the introduction of water meters because domestic water consumption accounts for only 16% of the overall water supply. If the Government introduces measures which conserve only 10% of the domestic water supply, the real reduction in consumption is only about 1% in terms of the overall supply. In contrast, if the Government introduced measures to fix the water mains, which could reduce water loss in places like Dublin city from around 41% down to 30% or even 20%, as in South Dublin, then the real saving would be about 20% in terms of the overall water supply. That is where we should go. The studies show the fallacy of introducing domestic water meters.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The dogs in the streets know the reason for this. The only logic to the enormous cost of putting a meter on each property is to measure usage, charge for it and, in the future, privatise the company and sell it off. It does not matter what commitments are given today. Even if we believed the Minister and thought he was great, his successor could privatise water supply at a later date. That is why the Bill will be so strenuously resisted.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I take issue with the claim that jobs will be created and with the reliance on private operators for the installation of meters. I am sure the Minister is aware of evidence of a number of ground works contractors who did inadequate work during the boom. Many bad developers left leaking pipes and inadequately connected water mains all over the country. What assurances do we have that the Minister will check the records of the companies that will be engaged in these works and the other works they were involved in? Will contracts be awarded to companies whose previous work was unsatisfactory? This is an important issue and needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> Considerable expertise exists at local authority level. We could employ thousands of workers in a direct labour scheme that would ensure the fixing of mains and in a programme of enticing householders to conserve water in their homes by implementing measures to allow water consumption to be reduced. It is a scandal that schools are paying for water and that we do not have a proper programme of rainwater harvesting on public buildings. These all expose the myth. </p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Talk of a free allowance of water is a gross insult to the tax paying public. As Deputy Pringle said, Irish people pay for water. It is acknowledged in the derogation granted by the EU that we pay for water in a different way, through central taxation. It is offensive to suggest we do not. There has been no clarity regarding the proposed free water allowance. Figures that have been spoken about, however, indicate an amount that would allow the average household to flush the toilet or wash the dishes. They would be lucky to get a shower out of it. That is not a great way forward. </p>
          <p eId="para_611"> The Government has not learned lessons from the previous attempts to introduce water charges in the 1980s and 1990s, which were met with significant opposition throughout the country. Opposition to a further attempt to introduce water charges in the three Dublin local authorities in the 1990s forced the abolition of water charges for the whole country. At that time, because the issue was so emotive, the law was changed to stop the Government from disconnecting a water supply without going to court. The Bill appears to remove that delimiting power and threatens disconnection of water supplies. This is to facilitate the continued bailout of bankers, bondholders and so on, which is what is behind all of this. Public services will not benefit from this measure. It is part of an overall neoliberal agenda that is being foisted on workers throughout Europe, privatising essential public services and fleecing ordinary people in order to pay debts that were not ours in the first place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_612">With the agreement of the House, I will share my time with Deputy Anthony Lawlor.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Can I be the first Government backbencher to welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance and commend them for their great work in the last couple of years to get a deal on the promissory notes? This is a great step for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I am pleased to speak on this important topic. Few things in this world are as important as the constant availability of clean water. Of all the technological innovations of the 20th century, the introduction of a clean water supply into family homes and businesses was, perhaps, the most significant. Such is our understanding of the importance of clean water for health, sanitation, food production and a number of other uses, that charitable organisations exist with the single purpose of securing clean water supplies in less developed nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> In Ireland today, we take the availability of clean water for granted. We forget the process collected water goes through before it reaches our homes, safe for human consumption. On rare occasions, however, an event suddenly brings to mind how precious the supply is and how easily it can be disrupted. Being from Galway, I recall the cryptosporidium crisis of 2007 which shut down large parts of the water supply network in the city and county from St. Patrick's Day until Galway race week at the end of July, and people in Galway were advised not to drink tap water. That had a very negative effect on householders and on the wider economy, with many businesses suffering. Tourism is, of course, an important part of the economy of Galway. </p>
          <p eId="para_616"> Cryptosporidium was chiefly caused by lack of investment in the water and waste water network. Government failed the people, at local and central level. We can trace the chronic lack of investment, with the corresponding waste through leakage of treated water, to the failure of the national Government to introduce a stable funding source for local government following the removal of domestic rates in the 1970s. </p>
          <p eId="para_617"> Thankfully, the cryptosporidium crisis has been consigned to the past and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, working with the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, has, in a short period of time, undertaken a major investment programme in Galway. An upgraded Terryland water treatment plant has ensured a quality supply of water for Galway city and its environs and a new reservoir at Tonabrocky which serves the city and its environs is under construction and well advanced. The city's Mutton Island treatment plant has been developed over a number of years and there has been a €20 million investment in water and waste water projects in Connemara. </p>
          <p eId="para_618"> To fund this, a new model is required, and part of the funding is coming from the European Investment Bank which works for member states and recognises that, whatever the economic climate, investment in the water supply network is crucial. The Bill, however, goes further to ensure a new continual stream of investment in our water services. It creates Uisce Éireann, or Irish Water, a new subsidiary of Bord Gáis that will co-ordinate the delivery of water services. Rather than having dozens of different authorities doing different things in different ways, we will have one clear point of responsibility for the provision of our water supply nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> The country has suffered over a number of years from under-investment in water. When I joined the local authority in 2004, my fellow councillors and I received a list of the projects included in the water service investment programme. It detailed every town and village in the county and gave the year when works were to take place. A year later, we would find that very little had been done, another list would be drawn up, and so on. The previous Government did much work and investment and this has been continued under the Minister, Deputy Hogan. </p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Deputy Clare Daly mentioned leaks. We have a history of leaks across the country. In the city and county of Galway, however, great strides have been made to combat the problem of leaks. We have seen investment by the Minister in leak detection. In Galway city, for example, there is a district metering programme which divides the city into districts so the local authority can better know where leaks are occurring and deal with them. </p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I welcome the Bill and the fact that it will provide for clearer investment opportunities in water and wastewater services in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">There are many other issues people have mentioned that I would agree with about the need to improve rain water harvesting.</p>

          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_623">I might not get the opportunity next week so I welcome the deal that has been done by the Government, particularly the hard work done by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. I have just heard some of the nitty-gritty and it will be an exceptionally good deal over a long period of time and I congratulate the Government on the extremely hard work it has put into this.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for listening to our remarks on this Bill. I spoke about this as a local authority member for some time. When I was on Kildare County Council, there were problems in Naas as a result of the well that fed the town being contaminated. There was an outbreak of serious illness in the town, but thankfully since then Naas has linked into the main treatment plant at Osberstown and the quality of the water has improved dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> People are nervous about how much they will be charged. I have no problem, however, charging people for water because we invest €1.2 billion in water infrastructure. From a Government expenditure point of view, that is not sustainable. It is for that reason that I welcome the introduction of water charges. To encourage people to be more frugal in their use of water, a nominal amount should be available free and after that they should be charged for it. This investment will mean we have sustainable water supplies in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> While the investment is being made, a lot of money will be spent locally. I want to see local businesses being given the opportunity to contract for these jobs that will be available. There is a problem at present that companies must have a turnover of €2 million, which is beyond many small businesses. I hope the Minister of State might consider reducing that figure to encourage small businesses in the community, which is our objective. A turnover of €2 million is an extraordinary amount to ask for.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I encourage people to use water more frugally. Once they do that, expenses on a day to day basis will fall. The Government should consider giving a grant for water harvesting. There are many schemes to promote it. In most households, only 30% of the water that is used needs to be treated. If we reduce the amount of water being used in a house by 70% and replace some of it with rainwater or water that has been harvested, significant savings can be made. There should be a grant scheme for people to put in place water harvesting facilities so they can tap into the rainwater supply.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_636">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on Second Stage of this important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> The establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary company of Bord Gáis will allow it to take over responsibility for the delivery of water services from local authorities and will facilitate the installation and maintenance of water meters in dwellings across this country. It is one of a number of major structural changes to the water sector in Ireland that are proposed in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Many rural Deputies will be well aware that paying for water is nothing new in rural areas, where people not connected to town or city supply lines are obliged to pay through a meter for their domestic water through a local group or private scheme. I acknowledge the community spirit of the many group water scheme secretaries and other office holders in these group schemes for their work in keeping together these schemes and for working with their respective local authorities to ensure their neighbours have a supply and that the necessary paperwork and infrastructural renewals are updated.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> There is some local concern among private and group water schemes regarding the full roll out of Irish Water. These concerns centre on the taking in charge of the schemes by Irish Water and the implications for the users. The IFA recently welcomed the announcement that rural dwellers on these schemes will not be hit by any additional water charges. Mr. Harold Kingston, chairman of the IFA environment and rural affairs committee, stated that the IFA recognises the importance of a good quality water supply for the future competitiveness and growth of the agrifood sector and welcomed the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government's recognition of the substantial investment by people living in the countryside and the decision not to impose additional charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> There is another view that some of these same group schemes will become customers of Irish Water rather than the local authority and there are concerns that charges for water and connection will increase. Up to 10% of domestic water users are either on a private or group water scheme and I would welcome from the Minister in his contribution to this debate as much clarification as possible around the future of group water schemes to clear up any misunderstandings.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> As a member of Sligo County Council for many years, I know the cost of producing clean water for onward supply to the consumer. In Ireland, it costs over €715 million a year to provide water in our taps. The only return comes from commercial users such as farmers, industrial businesses and small commercial users. A hotel in my constituency faces annual charges for water in and water out of over €30,000, a massive figure for a relatively small business that only opens on a seasonal basis. This has to change and I fundamentally challenge the view that water should be free to domestic users. I see no lobby group calling for commercial consumers not to pay for water, yet those same people argue against domestic water charges. What if there was a call to charge electricity to commercial users and not to domestic consumers? It would be laughed at, and rightly so, but I argue that at a cost to the Exchequer of over €700 million for water, the user must pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> We are the only country in the OECD where households do not pay directly for the water they use. Our current model of water provision, where unlimited quantities of an expensive product are provided at no charge, is not sustainable. The decision to give every household a domestic allowance based on the size of the household is only fair and this will encourage consumers to treat water as a commodity like electricity to ensure any usage is not excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Many of my former colleagues at local authority level are concerned about councils losing their role in the provision of water to the consumer. Many will remember the winter of 2010-11 when we were hit by temperatures as low as -15° Celsius and consumers turned directly to local councillors for assistance when they found no water in their taps. I would like to see some provision for local authority representatives to be accommodated on the basis of their representational mandate to ensure that they can have direct access to local and regional personnel from Irish Water. I would suggest something similar to the current HSE regional forums which give some members the opportunity to represent their local authority on a regional basis to ensure they can make a case for the provision for water infrastructure in their area.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> I am also concerned about staff who are currently working with local authorities. Some of them are concerned about their jobs after 2014. Those staff, as I have seen at local level in Sligo County Council and Sligo Borough Council over the years, know every area in the town. It is vital that Irish Water maintains the work force, and not only for a short period.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The introduction of leakage incentive targets to link future water infrastructure investment by Government to a reduction in water leakage is something I warmly advocate. I further hope to see in the future the introduction of water conservation incentives to encourage home owners, business people and farmers to reduce water bills and consumption by harvesting water for use at a later stage. No doubt the Minister will encourage this.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> I note that the Government's plan, Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-16, shows a decline in Exchequer capital investment in water and wastewater services from €435 million in 2011 to €371 million in 2012 and a further decline to €296 million by 2014. One of the main purposes of this Bill is to ring-fence funding for capital spending on water infrastructure and I believe this can be achieved in the long term. The United Kingdom, where there is a similar structure as proposed in this Bill, has 25% less staffing costs alongside half the leakage levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I note the December IMF report, on the Irish Water proposal, states: "The Government's budgetary perspective will be based on Irish Water becoming substantially self-funded over time." Given the current economic deficit, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will very much welcome a saving of €1.2 billion going into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">That is my wish, with the permission of the House. I thank the Acting Chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. It is widely accepted that across the political divide there is a recognition that clean water is a scarce resource, it is an expensive resource to produce, and it is right that there is an appropriate legislative framework in which the water resource is managed. There are and will be greater challenges as the population grows and as the need for water, particularly in areas around the east coast, especially the Dublin conurbation, is addressed. Dublin City Council has pursued various activities to ensure the future secure supply of clean water and there has been much debate in that regard. Dr. John Tierney, who was recently appointed head of this new water body and whom I wish well, is somebody who has had a view on how the east coast in particular should be provided for, but I disagree fundamentally with him. I disagree fundamentally with Dublin City Council on its desire to extract water from the River Shannon, particularly from Lough Derg, and it is something about which I have considerable concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> Unfortunately, the Bill is a reflection of the slipshod way the Government has sought to deal with really important issues. I would appear that it has learned nothing from the fiasco of the household charge. It seems the Government is rushing, if the House will pardon the pun, to plug the leak in the public finances. It sees a soft opportunity to levy a water charge - it is another tax - rather than putting in place an appropriate methodology to charge for that water resource. I do not want to be overly political, but it appears that they are making it up as they go along. The Government started out from the initial position that it wants to raise additional revenues, and my party accepts that.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">-----on charging for water and the importance the Government attaches to that in terms of control of usage, conservation measures and resources that need not come from the central Exchequer that will provide the Government with the capital investment to upgrade the pipe network and all that goes with it. There is no issue in that regard. The Government, however, sees its only role here as getting its hands into people's pockets and taking the money in another way without having thought out what it is ultimately trying to achieve, which is to put in place a national infrastructure for the provision of water.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The service is disjointed but it is working reasonably well. There have been problems in Galway, Ennis and other parts of the country, and the existing system worked to an extent, perhaps belatedly. Various contamination issues were addressed effectively with capital investment, but this also was done on a reactionary basis rather than with a properly planned, solution-driven approach to putting in place an appropriate network of water delivery. It seems the Government is following the age old way of doing it in an iterative way with the central aim - which is what Government and local authorities are often accused of - of merely grabbing the money without having the appropriate infrastructure in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The Minister has taken shortcuts. There was no appropriate tendering process to decide the company that would run this. Bord Gáis is a fine company and its chairman is a wonderful person, but I am somewhat concerned that Irish Water is now a constituent part of Bord Gáis. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, will be aware, through wearing his NewERA hat, that elements of Bord Gáis are due to be privatised. Was that the reason Irish Water was slotted in to Bord Gáis? Is that a resource the Government hopes to sell on at a later stage? I am concerned about that. That is a concern that exists in other jurisdictions. As the Minister of State will be aware, there are some very large companies that see water as a resource and that its provision can be a profit generator.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> I have not seen any comprehensive analysis on the cost of metering. Some studies show that metering is helpful in the short term regarding conservation. I agree with metering but I am not so sure that the analysis stands up to support metering long term. It does for a while. It restricts the usage and it encourages conservation behaviour, but some studies I have seen seem to suggest that over a relatively short period of time consumers go back to their old behaviour. That is something I would like to see thrashed out and I am not so sure it has fed in to this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> No doubt the piped network is antiquated in some parts of the country. The area that I know best has some very old piping and a significant amount of water is being lost. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, knew before he came into this House, through his experience at local authorities, the cost of treating that water and that so much of it is lost to the ground on an annual basis. When water leaks are identified at surface level, they are repaired quickly but, sadly, much of the water is lost into the ground and never comes to the surface and, therefore, it is never seen and is not identified. That is a considerable drain on resources and we must look much more carefully at that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> There is some uncertainty about the employees who currently work with local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I am not saying that necessarily should be the driver, but they need to be taken into consideration. I commented earlier on the decision to liquidate IBRC. Overnight, workers were told they were out of a job and there is a process there. The Government needs to reflect and give some sense of security to these people. If there is no security, let them know that now so that they can make those life decisions for themselves. The Government needs to set out clearly an appropriate charge. We are discussing metering and a change in the way water will be delivered with, effectively, the introduction of a charging regime for domestic users. However, as Opposition Members we have no concept of how much that will be. While I am not having a go at the Minister of State, it would have been helpful-----</p>

          <p eId="para_669">In another era it would not have been such an issue. As many people did with building in better times, they laid the foundation and never knew how much it would cost by the time the roof was on. It is the other way now with the additional charges and with the change in economic circumstances, and people are hard pressed. While we are talking about the introduction of water charges, people are rightly worried. I have a broad acceptance of charges for water versus property taxes and household charges. People see they are getting something in return here and they understand the concept of the cost associated with the delivery of that service. They understand it is a scarce, limited and expensive resource to produce and can understand paying for it, but they would like to know how much. Obviously the metering will give them the capacity to decide themselves. At the earliest opportunity the Minister of State will need to provide at least a charging policy so that people can have some concept.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">I do not doubt the Minister of State's integrity in that regard, but it would have been helpful to have provided that information so that people would have an estimate of the cost and whatever free allocation they might get.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> There are thousands of apartments in Dublin city and I understand it will not be possible to meter those units individually, which gives rise to an equality issue. People will feel that those living in apartments can use all they want and just pay a flat fee. While I am not having a go, there are many bits and pieces that should have been at least outlined more comprehensively before the Minister of State decided to bring the legislation to the House. While I know the Minister is under constraints and that there is pressure to reach targets defined in the memorandum of understanding, I would have thought that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in consultation with the Minister of State and his officials would have been able to present a more comprehensive set of measures that met with the expectations and the desire for information, considering the challenges that will be faced by the public at large in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">Yesterday, we debated a Bill that provided for the creation of another quango. I made some points on how that Bill might be changed. Today, we face the same question about another quango. The Bill makes reference to a board of directors and all that goes with it, which will be very costly. I see it every Thursday at the Committee of Public Accounts. I gave the example yesterday of the energy, communication and aviation regulators all getting approximately €180,000 per year. Some of their staff are getting in excess of €100,000 a year. They are meant to regulate the industry and have consideration for the taxpayer, the end user, the customer. In this case I wonder how much of their costs - I am sure all of their costs - will be considered when striking the rate for a cubic metre of water. However, that matter is not clarified in the Bill. The Bill before us yesterday, as with this one, lacked any great detail. The experience at committees of this House is that when we discuss these matters with the regulator the last person to be considered is the end user of the service - in this case water - and the payer for the service of the regulator and all the costs involved. That is the first person in terms of paying for the increases. We need to focus on the other side of the balance sheet. We need to minimise the costs of the commercial or bureaucratic structure before we ask the consumer for an increase or more money, in this case, for water. However, that does not happen. The history of charges and regulators indicates that the customer ultimately pays a substantial amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> The Bill makes no reference to the amount of water that will be given free to a household. That should be specified because once responsibility is handed to a company, it is only interested in profitability. For an example of that, we need look no further than the local authorities which charged businesses €3 per cubic metre for water in and water out. Speakers on the Government side have highlighted the various SMEs who have to pay a staggering amount of money in water charges simply because they are asked to pay for the total cost. With the exception of the Comptroller and Auditor General, nobody considered that this was all treated water at a very significant cost to the State being put through an infrastructure that was so badly damaged it was delivering very poor value for money for the State. However, as long businesses, including SMEs, were paying, nobody minded the infrastructure. Even though it was highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it still was not changed. Unless these details are specified in the Bill, there will be no controls and we will be back in committees of the House arguing on behalf of the consumer that they are getting short-changed given the services and costs involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Section 15(1) on accounts and auditing makes no reference to the Committee of Public Accounts or to a right of that committee to investigate costs or the accounts. It makes reference to other committees and states that the subsidiary is also required to keep "special accounts as the Minister [for the Environment, Community and Local Government] may, with the consent of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, from time to time direct." That is three different Ministers commenting on the accounts but no real accountability. It does not require it to submit its audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General and be taken up by the Committee of Public Accounts. That facility and arrangement need to be clearly specified in the legislation. It must be unequivocal with no ifs and buts so that we can audit every cent of taxpayers' money used in the administration of this utility company. In local government in excess of €4 billion goes through that system with no accountability to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is unacceptable. Every Bill presented to this House should address the accountability issue appropriately and beyond any doubt.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">A number of things need to be said about the deal on the promissory note and its replacement with long-term Government bonds. There will be grave disappointment that the total amount of debt remains unchanged. Given how policy in Europe is evolving, it will not be long before a system is put in place whereby the cost of further banking crises will be met by a central eurozone fund, in other words, a system whereby all member states in the eurozone will contribute and which provides for burden sharing. This is the essence of the banking union, which is coming down the track. This needs to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> In converting the promissory note to Government bonds, we are now fully accepting that the new regime will not be retrospectively applied to Ireland. That is the bottom line. The deal that has been done confirms that, in essence, the entire stock of Anglo-related debt will be borne by this State alone, a reality to which recognition must be given. Given the European Central Bank's insistence that this remains Irish debt and needs to be fully borne by the Irish State, the question that then arises is how best to pay it. This is essentially what the Government has been seeking to renegotiate over the past number of months. There is no doubt the replacement of the promissory note with long-term Government bonds with maturities of between 25 and 40 years eases the burden of repayments. There is no question about that. I believe independent analysis will support that assertion.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> To properly assess the impact of this deal, we need the Government to publish the full details of it and to publish an updated economic and fiscal outlook. The last occasion on which this was done was in respect of the budget last December. The updated economic outlook needs to show, for example, the revised general government debt, the projected deficit, the Exchequer balance and the impact of this deal on the budgetary adjustments. We need those details and we need them as quickly as possible. The Tánaiste might say in his response how long the Irish Central Bank will be allowed to hold these long-term Government bonds, which is the key issue at the heart of all of this. As long as the bonds are held by the Irish Central Bank, the true interest rate to the State is reduced because part of it will be circular. However, the European Central Bank will want its money back as quickly as possible and will not, I am sure, allow the Irish Central Bank to hold those bonds indefinitely. The Tánaiste might also comment on the interest rate issue. I assume it is a floating interest rate linked to the ECB re-financing rate and is, in essence, a variable interest rate. </p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The net effect of the deal will be a €1 billion saving on the budget side. It is €1 billion that can be realised in one year on a one-off basis. How does the Government propose to use this money? Will it use the €1 billion as a cushion to achieve its overall budgetary targets or will it seek to renegotiate with the troika a reduction in the budget adjustment planned for next year, which is currently €3.1 billion? That is possibly the most fundamental question we would like to have answered.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">I thank Deputy McGrath for his acknowledgement that the agreement concluded will ease the burden of repayment on the Irish taxpayer. On the broader issues which he raised - there may be confusion about where this fits with the decision taken in June to separate bank and sovereign debt and the progress on banking union - the Government has always said there were two elements to the bank debt issue, the first of which is the promissory note, which is the €3.1 billion required to be paid every year for ten years to what was in effect a dead bank. This issue has been dealt with in the agreement concluded with the ECB. The second element is the recapitalisation of the pillar banks, which issue will be addressed in the context of the establishment of banking union. The Deputy will be aware that the single supervisory mechanism must be in place by 2014. Other issues, including definitions of legacy debt and so on, are currently under discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> On the specific questions asked, the Irish Central Bank will sell the bonds only where such sale is not disruptive to financial stability. There is a schedule of sales, which if the sale conditions are right, will amount to €500 million up to end 2014, €500 million in the next four years, €1 billion in the following five years and €2 billion per annum thereafter. As I stated, such sales will be only in circumstances where they are not disruptive to financial stability. The interest rate will be a floating interest rate. We expect it to be between 3% and 3.5%. </p>

          <p eId="para_683">Yes, this year. The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank interest rate arrangement is slightly less than 1%. The balance between the 1% and 3% to 3.5%, which will be profits, will be returned by the Central Bank to the Exchequer. The net effect is as stated. This is a basket of bonds, the average duration of which is 34.5 years, and €1 billion off the deficit. In terms of the deficit reduction target, it is 0.6% and a reduction of €20 billion on our borrowing requirement. It is proposed - this matter was raised last night by some Deputies - to arrange for a full debate on this issue in the House next week, at which time the Deputy will be able to pursue those and other details.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I ask that the Government release the full details of the deal as soon as possible. Some of the information just given by the Tánaiste forms part of the crucial details. The schedule of disposal of the bonds by the Central Bank into the markets is at the core of the value of this deal. We need that information as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> My point in relation to the June summit - I am fully aware of the negotiations with respect to the ESM, the pillar banks and so on - was that if that agreement was to be implemented in its truest form, this would mean the cost of bailing out former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide would be dealt with retrospectively under the new regime. It is accepted that is not now going to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> On the €1 billion saving on the budgetary side, which was confirmed earlier by the Taoiseach, how does the Government propose to utilise it? Will it use it as a cushion or as headroom in its budget numbers to achieve the 3% target as set out or will it, in discussions with the troika, point out that the Irish people have taken enormous pain in recent years and that it wants to use that money to reduce the severity of future budgets, in particular a reduction of well below €3 billion in budget 2014? That is the key question. </p>

          <p eId="para_687">On the June deal, it is important it is not seen as a type of gift from on high. The June deal was achieved because we worked for it. The Deputy will be aware that Ireland was one of the few states which, in the early part of the discussions with its European partners, argued strongly for a change of European policy in respect of bank debt. We secured that change in European policy at the June summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">No doubt the Deputy recalls the stability treaty referendum. I remember going out on the steps of Government Buildings on the day the result came in and the Taoiseach and I stated clearly on that occasion that our next target was to secure an agreement at European level on the separation of bank and sovereign debt, which we secured in June and it has been extremely helpful. It is important that we do not just regard the June deal as something that happened anyway. It happened because we worked for it and managed to persuade other parties of the value of it. In respect of the €1 billion off the deficit, this agreement has been secured and the issue of framing the next budget will be a matter to be considered in the course of time by the Government. I acknowledge Deputy Michael McGrath's positive response, but I was a little amused at his suggestion that perhaps we might seek further renegotiation with the troika on the terms of the bailout. What a short time two years is. Two years ago we were in the middle of the general election-----</p>

          <p eId="para_697">To put this in context, this is a promissory note inflicted on the Irish people by a Fianna Fáil Government to pay off the private debt of a toxic bank which is now under criminal investigation. Last June the Tánaiste said the Government had succeeded in separating sovereign debt from bad bank debt and that the legacy debt would be dealt with. What the Government has succeeded in doing, and has announced today, is to turn the €28 billion promissory note into sovereign debt which could reach up to €60 billion. This debt has been tied to this generation and if adult children are starting work now they will be paying until 2053, which is their entire working lives, and their children will also pay for it. Instead of removing this burden from the shoulders of the Irish people the Government has doubled it.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Little wonder there is sweetness and light from Fianna Fáil on this issue given that it created it. Every penny of the debts of Anglo Irish Bank will be paid by Irish people as part of this deal. Any young people lucky enough to get a job in the economy today will be lumbered with this for as long as they are able to work. Does the Tánaiste accept the Government has failed to separate bank debt from sovereign debt? Does he accept that under this deal the total cost of bailing out Anglo Irish Bank has increased? Does he think it is fair that citizens are being asked to pay for this? Does he acknowledge that austerity will continue as part of the Government's policy?</p>

Deputy Adams's colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, who now has much to say about it, was then a Senator and he stated he supported it because the Bill was in the national interest. He also welcomed it as a decisive move.</p>

Deputy Adams's party was an enthusiast for tying the bank debt to the sovereign in 2008. The Government has been working since we came into office to separate it. It is not easy. There are different elements to it. We have secured an agreement at European level on the separation of bank and sovereign debt. We had to renegotiate the terms of the promissory note and we have succeeded in doing this. There is some difficulty in understanding some of the basics. If I offer Deputy Adams €1,000 which must be paid in March and I offer him another €1,000 which must be paid in 34 and a half years' time, which €1,000 will he take? By any standards the agreement secured is to the benefit of the Irish taxpayer and, as Deputy Michael McGrath has acknowledged, it will ease the burden on the taxpayer.</p>

It would be far better if the Tánaiste just stood up and told us straight that what the Government has done is turned this into sovereign debt and pushed it up the pipe. It has passed the burden onto our children and grandchildren. This would be the honest and straightforward way of dealing with this as opposed to trying to spin it into something it is not.

          <p eId="para_728">I am answering the question. The Deputy asked where is the benefit to the people. The benefit is that first, there is no longer a requirement to pay €3.1 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned money on 31 March this year and on 31 March every year for the next eight years.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">The second benefit is that the deficit, which is very difficult, is to be reduced by €1 billion. That will have a tangible benefit in terms of the budgetary decisions that we have to make. Third, it will reduce the debt burden on the Irish people and will help this country to recover. </p>
          <p eId="para_731"> Deputy Adams said that we have to tell it straight. There is no way of coming in with a magic wand, trying to zap it all away and say we will not pay, we do not have to pay.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">We did not, actually. I am glad that Deputy Adams made that point because we did not say that. I want to correct that point and I am glad that Deputy Adams has given me the opportunity of doing so. From the very beginning of the crisis at the time of the bank debt, we were often asked whether we would default or refuse to pay if we were in government. We always said we cannot default, we have to renegotiate. We committed ourselves from the outset, including the time that we were in opposition, to the strategy of renegotiation. When the two parties that are now in government committed themselves to that strategy at the time of the general election and when the Government was formed, there were people - including commentators and those now on the Opposition benches who were then in government - who said it could not be done, it would not succeed, we would not be allowed to do it. I have quoted one political figure who expressed it clearly. Some of the commentators, who are now writing about flaws in this and are trying to find some hole in it, were the very people who said at that time that it was fanciful to renegotiate. Yet we did renegotiate.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">We have renegotiated. We have significantly improved the terms of the promissory note. It does not have to be paid every year. It has been converted into a long-term bond, which will reduce our borrowing requirement by €20 billion and takes €1 billion or 0.6% off our deficit. By any standards that is a good agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">A former Minister for Finance wrote a €30 billion IOU for Anglo Irish Bank - which in turn gave it to the Central Bank - without the knowledge or permission of his colleagues, or proper substantial debate in the Dáil, and without the consent of the people. It may very well have been unconstitutional. We all know the horrific consequences this has had for the Irish people. An insolvent Government promised to pay, on behalf of us all, €3 billion for 13 years to an insolvent bank. Any part payment has no basis in equity, social justice or morality for the people. The moral issue here demonstrates just how much the Government cares for the people of this country with the burden that has been inflicted upon them by mistakes made by politicians and bankers to the tune of over €9,000 per person. How often has it been said by prominent politicians and economists across the world that the taxpayer should not have to foot one cent of this bill? We have no legal obligation or requirement to pay any of this debt. The country is being torn apart by austerity. There is a widespread social consensus that any payment is unjustified and unjustifiable. It is fundamentally wrong in this crisis to leave it to 166 people to decide the fate of our nation for the next 15 or 16 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> We should not underestimate the knowledge that the Irish people have acquired on the issue of promissory notes. Will the Government give people a say? They include nurses, gardaí, single mothers, the unemployed, emigrants and the thousands more who are about to leave. Will the Government go to the people in a referendum or an election on this grave economic crisis? The vast majority of people are saying that not one cent of this money should be paid. This debt is an immoral and unjust imposition on citizens, as well as on the future resources of the country. People deserve their dignity and the best way to do that is to let them have a say. Is that not a reasonable request?</p>

          <p eId="para_739">Deputy Halligan referred to the last Government and the difference is this - the last Government saddled the Irish people with the debts of the banks; this Government is renegotiating and easing the debt burden on the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> As regards going to the people, we did so two years ago in a general election. We went to the country on a commitment that we would renegotiate the terms of the deal. As I said previously, there were many people who doubted either that was possible or indeed that we would succeed. I have to confess there were times when it seemed to me that there were people in this House who seemed to wish that we would not succeed.</p>

          <p eId="para_742">We are making progress along a number of dimensions. First, by any standards, what has been agreed today is hugely significant. The toxic bank that has been at the heart of the crisis - Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide in the form of the IBRC - is no more. We have liquidated that.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The €3.1 billion promissory note that was to be paid every March, no longer has to be paid. On several occasions, people here asked whether it would be paid. We have now secured an agreement which is significantly to the benefit of the Irish people. </p>
          <p eId="para_744"> We have also succeeded in persuading our European partners to have a fundamental change in banking policy. That fundamental change was reflected in the conclusions last June on the separation of bank and sovereign debt. It was followed through by the agreement to establish a banking union. Once again there were people who said that would not happen, there would be no follow through, and that some states might not allow it to occur. The reality, however, is that the legislative measures to put in place the single supervisory mechanism is proceeding. As it happens, this country currently holds the Presidency of the European Council and has responsibility to advance that, and we are doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Arising from that, there is another set of discussions we must have on recapitalisation of the pillar banks. Those discussions will take place in the context of the establishment of the banking union and the possibility arising from that of the ESM recapitalising Irish banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Every citizen has a right to go to the courts on any issue but I find it incredible that a Member of this House, no less, went to the courts to try to stop the establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, which is the instrument we are now relying on to see some direct recapitalisation of Irish banks.</p>

They are the people who are bearing the burden in this regard and the duty and responsibility of the Government, which it took on two years ago, is to get us out of that position. There is no point in anyone trying to pretend there is some kind of instant abracadabra solution to the economic crisis this country has been obliged to go through.</p>

          <p eId="para_793">The Government is working its way through that crisis and improving it. The deficit must be reduced and the Government has been doing that. It stated it would renegotiate the terms of the bailout and has done so in several respects. It got a reduction in the interest rate and an improvement on the terms recently at the eurozone and ECOFIN meeting. Moreover, today's agreement constitutes a significant advance and must be acknowledged as such. I do not wish to claim it will immediately end the crisis because of course it will not. However, it is a significant advance. It is a significant change in the terms of the commitments that Irish taxpayers have been obliged to make in respect of what is being paid over to Anglo. One should not underestimate the significance of what the Government has done here over the past 24 hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">It has put an end to Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society and IBRC. It has put an end to the payment of the promissory note - that the previous Government saddled on the Irish taxpayers - of €3.1 billion each March for ten years. The Government has exchanged that for a longer-term bond with maturity of 34.5 years. This will have the benefit of reducing Ireland's borrowing requirement by €20 billion, will take €1 billion off the deficit and constitutes a further 0.6% along the way towards achieving Ireland's deficit target.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The Government has another job of work to do now, to which the Taoiseach referred earlier today, namely, that on the back of the agreement made last June on the establishment of the banking union, further work remains to be done in respect of the easement of Ireland's bank debt. Moreover, that is not the only thing the Government must do as it must also instil greater confidence in the Irish economy. It must get greater investment into the economy to create the jobs that will bring about recovery. This is the reason for the work the Government has done on its budgets, in bringing stability to our financial system and on the negotiation of the bank debt arrangements, all of which contribute to stability. One builds investment on that and creates the jobs that are necessary to bring about recovery. It is all tied together and while it will not happen overnight, in two years the Government has made far more progress than any of the sceptics and cynics thought it would be able to make this time two years ago.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_797">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes. He has a keen interest in this area and will be aware that as a result of the Budget Statement, the Government decided to extend a fuel rebate system to the haulage sector. I was grateful for this decision, having lobbied hard and having worked with the hauliers on it. They brought forward some concrete proposals demonstrating that were a rebate scheme to be put in place in line with other jurisdictions, there were significant revenues to be generated by the State. The approach they took was that many hauliers who travel internationally would buy fuel at home in the event of such a rebate scheme being in place. The Road Haulage Association thought that many of its members were engaged in what might be referred to as fuel tourism, whereby they purchased fuel outside this jurisdiction because it was cheaper elsewhere, with the State losing the entire duty as a result of their decision. The hauliers came forward with a comprehensive and detailed analysis carried out by Deloitte and I was very pleased the Government accepted the position in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_798"> Following on from that decision, there has been an approach from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland which, as the Minister of State is aware, represents bus and coach operators. The council does not make the same argument in respect of fuel tourism but nevertheless has a strong argument. These operators believe that were the scheme to be extended to include them, the cost would be a relatively small amount out of the €70 million that has been set aside in this year's budget. I believe its estimate is somewhere between €2.02 million and €3.79 million per year. This proposal should be considered in the context of the services these operators provide to the tourism sector. The Minister of State is aware of the existence of coach tour business in a wide variety of markets. Initially it was geared to the North American market but in more recent years has expanded into the European and other markets. This is an effort to assist the coach tour business in difficult economic circumstances, much of which are based on the current recessionary environment, in maintaining a quality fleet of vehicles that is appropriate to the kind of service that must be provided to the discerning tourist.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">They have expressed concern to me and others that if the operators of the coaches are not in a position to have quality fleets, the image of the product we offer will disintegrate. These businesses pay VAT on various services and fuel, and they are a significant generator of revenue for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_800"> I support these transport businesses as they have a legitimate case, which should be recognised by the Department and acted upon based on the costing available. I am sure these people have contacted the Department and I appeal to the Minister of State to reflect on the issue. Perhaps in the presentation and publication of the finance Bill, there will be consideration of these coach tour operators.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">I thank Deputy Dooley for raising this important matter. I will not read out a script but I will instead cut straight to the point. We are considering this issue very closely. The Deputy makes a very solid point, particularly about the age of the fleet. Having recently met some coach tour operators, I know the age of the fleet has been increasing because of the cost of fuel in recent years. As the Deputy rightly indicates, hauliers can make a case because of fuel tourism, and fuel can be bought outside the country to make a saving. This is not usually the case with tour operators, although some are involved in activities outside the country. I fully appreciate it is a key export.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> Representatives of these hauliers made a point in a submission which I relayed to the Minister for Finance that there are solid economic arguments in extending the relief to this industry as we have with hauliers. We are considering the question and the decision will be for the Minister for Finance. In other parliamentary replies and in my meetings with the groups two weeks ago, it has been indicated that we are considering this issue in the context of the finance Bill, although that is without giving a firm commitment one way or the other. We accept many of the arguments made and the Minister will come to a full decision when he publishes the finance Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">I thank the Minister for an open and frank response, which I had expected and which is helpful. A detailed analysis should be done, and when the Department and the Revenue Commissioners examine the issue, they will look at it in the broadest extent. I am sure some of the numbers may appear astronomical when one takes into account the entire fleet of commercial vehicles in the State. Nevertheless, there are ways of achieving the objective, and if necessary there should be consultation with the coach tour operators, including the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland. Its members are a solid bunch of people who have worked in a very difficult environment, and they understand the Minister's position. I hope a system can be put in place that could meet their needs to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_804"> I ask the Minister of State to enter into a dialogue with the group, although I am grateful he has met them already. There was a dialogue with the Irish Road Haulage Association, with toing and froing over a period of 12 months, and now a principle has been established, it should be possible for all sides to formulate a workable solution that does not break the bank. We have got rid of one bank today and we certainly do not want to break another. We can help these people, who are such an integral part of our tourism offering. There is no point in laying a greater layer of fat on what we have done but it is the year of The Gathering, and this would be a helpful measure for all concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_805">The Government is very mindful of the Deputy's comments and the arguments he has made so cogently. There is still time and the rebate for haulage will not come about until July this year, when the finance Bill is enacted. Without giving a commitment in the issue, the Minister is looking at this very seriously to see if something can be done. There is very little money around and rebates and breaks of any description have a cost, and we must be able to offset that cost with additional economic activity that may come through the sale of additional better equipped and more modern fleets.</p>
            <p eId="para_806"> I was struck by the argument made that if people are coming to the country for coach tours, we need high specification vehicles in which to bring them around in preference to coaches that are seven, eight or nine years old. The Government understands that and wants to help. We will have to wait and see if we can do this with the finance Bill. The Minister for Finance is mindful of the arguments.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_807">The Minister of State is aware of the crisis in the buy-to-let market, with 29% of the 150,000 buy-to-let mortgages in arrears and 17% in arrears for 90 days or more. This means a staggering 26,770 rental properties are at risk of serious default. One of the most immediate consequences of the crisis is that the people living in these properties are at great risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_808"> When a bank repossesses a buy-to-let property, it appoints a receiver, which writes to a tenant to demand from that point that rent must be paid directly to a receiver and not to the landlord. The tenant is left not knowing whether the terms of the tenancy agreement will be met or if the receiver will take on the full role of landlord. Added to this is the question of whether the term of the tenancy agreement will be kept or a deposit will be returned when a tenancy ends.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> Some receivers appear to be adopting a constructive approach but others are not, with some who act belligerently towards the rights of a tenant. That is unacceptable. As the buy-to-let mortgage crisis worsens, there will be ever more tenants left in a precarious position, and the Government needs to get a handle on the problem. It should immediately instruct the Central Bank to bring receivers and banks to the table to hammer out a clear code of conduct. At the end of this code of conduct must be a commitment by the receivers to honour the terms and obligations of the tenancy agreement. No tenant should be allowed to go homeless as a result of the appointment of a receiver, and no tenant should lose their deposit because of such an appointment. A tenant should not be left without maintenance services because of a receiver's appointment. In the first instance the Central Bank should seek agreement with receivers and banks but there should be no doubt that in the absence of agreement, the Central Bank should impose a code of conduct.</p>
            <p eId="para_810"> In dealing with individual cases I have engaged with Threshold, which shares my concern that this problem is serious and likely to escalate. This means the Government must act now and not wait for the problem to spiral out of control. I ask the Minister to examine the problem, establish its extent and the probable rate of increase as the buy-to-let mortgage crisis deepens and set out a clear plan to ensure no tenant will lose rights or entitlements because a landlord defaults on a mortgage. I hope the Minister of State appreciates the serious nature of the problem and that the Government will take the necessary action to address it before it is too late.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_504" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_811">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter in the manner he has. He is correct in pointing out the scale of the buy-to-let market, and there are approximately 150,000 mortgages through all the financial institutions that are effectively buy-to-let mortgages. The most recent information available to me indicates that approximately 18% of those accounts have been arrears for approximately 90 days or more. For primary dwelling mortgages, the corresponding arrears are between 11% and 15%, so the problem is real.</p>
            <p eId="para_812"> As we begin the process of introducing the schemes we have through financial institutions, we will see more of the buy-to-let mortgages moved on from the banks' loan books. It is an inevitable consequence. The Deputy is more aware than I am of the recent comments of the Governor of the Central Bank in this matter when he correctly put pressure on the banks to get on with the task of moving on some of these properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">It is arguable that we will not get to the bottom of the housing market until such time as much of the buy-to-let market, which is in a difficult and precarious position, has been moved on.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> I will not rehash the various arguments on the general issue as the Deputy is aware of them. We have had the Keane report and the Government wants the banks to fully implement the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act. More important, a new agreement has been reached between the Central Bank and financial institutions to introduce a suite of measures to meet the needs of their customers, whether by writing down or restructuring debt, where necessary. As I noted in the House the other day, the banks are well capitalised for this purpose. When we capitalised them in March 2011 we made abundantly clear that we were providing money for the purpose of substantial write-downs on their mortgage books. There is frustration across the Government that the banks need to proceed with this task and write down more mortgages. I am confident that we will see much more action in 2013 than we did last year on moving on housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_815"> The Deputy referred to a code of conduct for receivers who are given powers to act on the part of the banks. I will refer to the reply provided to me on this matter as it has been issued by another Department. Regarding the protections and rights of tenants in the private rental sector, these rights are provided for in tenancy law, including the 2004 Residential Tenancies Act, which is the main regulatory framework for the private rented sector. It is important that the rights of tenants, as provided for under tenancy agreements and the Residential Tenancies Act, are protected. While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, it is important that the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers do not affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants. This is the point the Deputy raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> It is also important that clarity be given to tenants as to where the responsibilities of landlords, as set out in the 2004 Act, now rest. Clear and legally sound direction must be given regarding to whom the rent should be paid. It should also be noted that receivers who are acting on behalf of an entity regulated by the Central Bank are also subject to the requirements of the consumer protection code.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> To cut to the chase, the view of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, a portfolio that cuts across the financial area, is that protection is in place in respect of how a receiver should act. It is logical that where a receiver is appointed he or she will want to have a rent roll and will want tenants <i>in situ</i> as a means of maintaining the business as a going concern, if that is the choice of the receiver. Ordinarily, the rights that are prescribed for the tenant in a case where the tenant has a rent book and lease agreement still stand and would take precedent. The view of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is that protections are in place under the consumer protection code. However, if the Deputy has specific proposals he would like me to put to the Minister of State, I am all ears. </p>

            <p eId="para_818">I thank the Minister of State for his response. There is a major problem in this area and some form of code of conduct is required to address it. While I accept that other issues arise in respect of the banks, a code of conduct is needed for the receivers who work on behalf of the banks. My party and Threshold are encountering cases where tenants have not had their leases renewed and maintenance and other issues connected with private rented dwellings are not being addressed. This is unfortunate. The receiver and banks should have a role to play in this regard. For example, the receiver could issue a letter to tenants guaranteeing their rents and providing a commitment that the lease will be continued. It is vital to have a code of conduct in place because people are being left at the mercy of landlords and financial institutions. While some of the financial institutions pull out all the stops and do everything possible to help, others are frustrating tenants, for example, by failing to inform them that a lease has expired, with the result that they are in danger of being put out on the streets. Tenants are being left in limbo. A code of practice must be introduced that encompasses all the financial institutions, the borrowers and the receivers who work on their behalf.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">As the Deputy raised the matter, I should point out that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, recently met representatives of the Irish Banking Federation and agreed a draft guide for tenants regarding rent receivers and the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act. This guide, which has the imprimatur and support of the Irish Banking Federation, will be rolled out across all the covered institutions in the coming months. This is an important development in that the financial institutions will be made aware of their responsibilities towards tenants in cases where the property in which they reside has been taken over by a receivership. The guide is backed up by the Irish Banking Federation. We will monitor closely what effect this initiative will have and I believe it will make a difference. The Deputy's observations will be forwarded to the Minister of State immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to raise this important matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, indicated to me that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, would take this matter and I appreciate that he has come to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> This issue, which I have raised several times in the Chamber, relates to the difficulties faced by householders living in or adjacent to areas that have been flooded or are at risk of flooding when they seek to have their homes insured or reinsured. Many individuals living in various parts of my constituency of Dublin Central are being refused insurance cover, having previously obtained insurance, albeit at an expensive rate. </p>
            <p eId="para_822"> I understand the difficulty this matter presents to the extent that we cannot require private companies to act in a certain manner. The Government has been moving in a positive direction on this issue by putting in place infrastructure worth billions of euro aimed at eliminating flooding risk in particular areas. This benefits insurance companies and we need to ensure they are made aware that flooding risks have been reduced as a result of work undertaken by the State and local authorities. This could also provide a means of ensuring that some form of insurance is made available in the areas in question. </p>
            <p eId="para_823"> In November, when I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, he briefed me on negotiations that were taking place between the Irish Insurance Federation and Office of Public Works aimed at agreeing a way in which information could be shared so as to ensure greater insurance cover was provided. This is a major issue. </p>
            <p eId="para_824">However, it is not getting the attention it deserves because it affects a relatively small number of homes. I am glad the Government has recognised this and I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Office of Public Works to do everything they can to resolve the matter and to provide an update to the House on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_826"> I assure the House that the impact of flooding on businesses and householders and the issue generally of flood insurance cover remain to the fore on the Minister of State's agenda. The difficulties that some people have been experiencing in securing insurance cover for flood risk at affordable prices, or at all in some instances, particularly in areas that have had flood defence works carried out, is something that the Minister of State is actively pursuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> To consider the flooding issue in overview for a moment, the strategic focus of the Government through the work of the OPW and local authorities is to alleviate the impact of flooding through the provision of defences to reduce existing flood risk and by taking steps to manage and reduce flood risk in the future through a strategic and sustainable approach under the national catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme. This comprehensive programme to identify and assess flood risk nationally will, in time, provide a level of information that will allow a more informed engagement with the insurance industry in respect of flood risk cover and, in turn, will enable the insurance industry to take decisions on the provision of cover based on the fullest possible assessment of that risk. The CFRAM studies will lead to the provision of integrated flood risk management plans, which will assist the management and mitigation of flood risk well into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_828"> Prior to the completion of the CFRAM programme, the Minister of State has been concerned to ensure that the insurance companies make their assessment of risk in any particular case based on the best available data. In particular, he has often stated that he does not accept that any property protected by significant public capital investment would not be able to receive a quote for insurance at a reasonable cost, the point referred to by Deputy Donohoe in his introduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> Accordingly, following a number of meetings that the Minister of State had with the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, and a number of the main insurance companies, a joint working group has been established between the OPW, the IIF and representatives of several insurance companies to progress agreement on a sustainable format and system to facilitate the exchange of information currently available on completed flood defence schemes. This will ensure that the insurance industry can be fully informed as to the extent of OPW investment in flood protection measures in recent decades and will take that investment fully into account in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_830"> A preliminary exchange of information between the OPW and the IIF has taken place on selected completed flood defence schemes and the standard of protection that they provide. Clearly, it is important that the information be as thorough as possible to verify the level of protection involved. This requires a considerable amount of detailed work on the part of the OPW to collate the required data and present it in an acceptable format.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> The Minister of State is happy to say that the feedback received from the insurance industry on the "template" information provided has been positive. Some relatively minor technical issues remain to be resolved, but he is optimistic that the template format will be agreed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> He acknowledges the commitment by the IIF to making substantial progress through this working group, which has already engaged in this matter in a co-operative manner. The working group will meet regularly to advance and complete its work in the quickest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> While the Minister of State is hopeful that an agreed system of information exchange will significantly improve the situation over time, it is important to bear in mind that the provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, as acknowledged by Deputy Donohoe. The insurance companies cannot be directed to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses. It remains a matter for the insurance market to manage the assessment of risk and the provision of all classes of insurance cover at an individual policy level. This assessment takes account of a range of factors and is often considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_834"> However, avenues are available to those who continue to experience difficulty with flood insurance cover. I am informed that queries or complaints in this regard can be directed through the IIF's free insurance information service. In addition and as Deputies know, the Financial Services Ombudsman deals independently with unresolved complaints from consumers about their individual dealings with all financial service providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_835">I thank the Minister of State for providing that information. I welcome the fact that since I last raised the issue in the House, progress has clearly been made on the way in which information can be shared. I hope this situation will be resolved soon. It is important that we end up with a process that allows the infrastructure provided by the State to be taken into account by companies when deciding on whether they want to insure someone. Given the moneys being invested by local authorities in dealing with this issue, I am gravely concerned that regard is not being given to that infrastructure. I thank the OPW for the seriousness with which it is taking this matter. I want the issue progressed and I will raise it in the House again in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_836"> While it is for an insurance company to decide on whether it wants to offer cover, perhaps we could consider a system through which companies would provide cover to areas that could be at risk while taking this possibility into account when determining the magnitude of the premium to be charged. They would do this instead of providing no insurance at all. The stark reality facing many of my constituents is that they can get no cover at all despite the fact that infrastructure to prevent flooding is either in place or will be in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_837">The Deputy makes the case well, particularly his point on the necessity to have a process by which public infrastructure funded by the State should be factored into the question on the provision of cover by insurance companies. The Minister of State has made considerable progress in this matter and has received a great deal of co-operation in his work and that of the OPW. I note the Deputy's intention, which I am sure will be carried through in his usual way, to follow this matter up in future to ensure it remains on the agenda of the House and the OPW. The Minister of State takes a great interest in this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention, if it is indeed necessary to do so, SI 236 of 2009, which provides for minimum standards of health care. It goes without saying that the standards contained in the statutory instrument are to be welcomed and are desirable. The statutory instrument reads: "The registered provider shall not use premises for the purposes of a designated centre unless the premises are suitable for the purpose of achieving the aims and objectives set out in the statement of purpose". The statement of purpose, contained at paragraph 10, reads:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_839">The registered provider shall ensure that residents are provided with:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_840">...</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_841">(<i>c</i>) privacy, insofar as is reasonably practicable, to the extent that the resident is able to undertake personal activities in private;</p>
            <p eId="para_842">As the Minister of State is undoubtedly aware, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was tasked with extrapolating more detailed national standards from this provision. No one could take issue with the statement that all elderly people in care in public and private facilities should have sufficient privacy and dignity to perform whatever functions they require. Under HIQA's extrapolation, however, existing bedrooms that are currently shared must have at least 7.4 m per resident.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Within six years of implementation of the standards, there are to be no more than two residents per room, except in high-dependency rooms, which shall have up to six highly dependent residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> Since getting elected I have spent time visiting the State facilities for community care across County Clare. There are three facilities, in Raheen Hospital, Stella Maris and Ennistymon. I spent a lot of time in St. Joseph’s Hospital in Ennis for personal reasons. I express my thanks to the staff of St. Joseph’s for the excellent standard of care which they provide. I am pleased to say the standard of care was vindicated in a recent HIQA investigation in St. Joseph’s at the end of 2012. An inspection was carried out on 27 and 28 November. However, the fact that St. Joseph’s, like the great majority of such facilities across the country, is a relatively old establishment, unsurprisingly, it was found not to comply with the standard of having only two residents per room.</p>
            <p eId="para_845"> While I was there I took the opportunity to discuss the issue with residents. A close relative of mine who was there likewise, discussed matters with her fellow residents. There is not unanimity among residents on the facilities. Not all of them would like to be in single rooms or rooms of two people. In many instances, people prefer to be in larger rooms. That is not to say the standard should be lowered in any way or that people do not want their privacy to be respected. Of course they do. However, to extrapolate from respecting privacy to putting people in single and double rooms exclusively is questionable. I question whether it is feasible. It has been acknowledged by the HSE that there would be great difficulty in bringing St. Joseph’s into line with the requirement of single and double rooms. Likewise, with the facilities in Kilrush and Raheen, and to a slightly lesser extent in Ennistymon. I speak of County Clare but I am sure the situation is mirrored across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_846"> I do not for a moment wish to appear to advocate a lower standard for residents in such institutions. That is not the case at all. However, I wonder about the extent to which the views of residents have been canvassed and their opinions sought when it was determined that it was in their best interests to be in single rooms. Many people would love to get out of private facilities where they have single rooms and to get into public facilities where they share rooms and have companionship, regardless of the reason they are in the facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> A second issue to which I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister of State is the manner in which the inspections are carried out. I refer to a facility that is not in my constituency; it is in the constituency of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, namely, St. Anne’s in Woodford on the Clare and Galway border. A follow-up inspection was carried out on 19 October 2011 and, by and large, it was unfavourable. Fire hazards were not raised at all. In February 2012 a further inspection was carried out and the facility was closed within 24 hours. I do not understand how no issue relating to fire hazard could arise in October 2011 yet the following February the facility was to be closed within 24 hours, which created considerable difficulty for many elderly residents who had to be moved. Some of them had spent a long period of time there and the nature of their departure created much turmoil for them and their families. Nobody from HIQA was prepared to meet with any of the relatives to explain how the closure came about. There seems to be no redress.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_848">I thank Deputy McNamara for raising the issue and for his insights and observations on it. I will make some general remarks at the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_849"> The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality, long-term residential care where that is appropriate. If it becomes necessary for an older person to move to a nursing home, their safety and well-being is of paramount concern. We must ensure that the highest standards of care are provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment, and that we meet the needs of those who require our services in the very best way possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is the independent body responsible for promoting quality and safety in the provision of health and personal social services for the benefit of service users. On 1 July 2009 statutory responsibility for inspecting and registering nursing homes was given to HIQA's chief inspector of social services. That is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, Care and Welfare Regulations and the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland. Members will agree that it is important to have effective mechanisms to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality residential care. Residents, their families and the public need to be reassured that the care people receive is monitored. The Health Act 2007 provides that, with a regime designed to protect the public through an independent inspection and registration system for residential services.</p>
            <p eId="para_851"> Patient safety and quality assurance in nursing homes is secured by setting quality standards, reinforced by regulations that specify how the best service possible can be delivered in an effective and appropriate way. The national quality standards to which the Deputy refers are an essential component in ensuring the quality and safety of residential care for the older population. There are 32 standards under seven groupings: rights, protection, health and social needs, quality of life, staffing, the care environment and governance and management. They are patient-centred, providing a blueprint for the provision of a higher standard of care delivered against a set of clear and comprehensive criteria. In summary, the standards promote health, well-being and quality of life, and older people are entitled to their effective implementation and monitoring and for effective steps to be taken if they are not met.</p>
            <p eId="para_852"> All nursing homes for older people, whether public, private or voluntary, are subject to the same core standards for quality and safety. As Deputy McNamara indicated, HIQA carries out inspections across the nursing home sector to ensure that the standards are being met and that residents are receiving the best possible care.</p>
            <p eId="para_853"> I expect we would all agree that lessons had to be learned from some very unsatisfactory and well-publicised incidents in nursing homes in recent years and from reports such as that of the Leas Cross commission of investigation. Our system of regulation and inspection was established for the sole purpose of ensuring safety and quality of care for nursing home residents. While standards of care are, thankfully, generally very good, we cannot and must not be complacent when it comes to the protection of older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> The Deputy raised a query on one of the categories of requirement concerning nursing homes. It is an interesting point, in particular on the extent to which there was consultation with older people themselves in respect of the standards. Deputy McNamara would agree that we can only operate on the basis of standards that are put together in a rational way. They cannot be nursing home-specific or area-specific; the standards must be national in order for them to be understood and properly monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_855"> As the Deputy is aware, the current standards were approved in 2009. They were developed by a working group that was chaired by HIQA, which importantly comprised the regulator, service providers of private, voluntary and HSE nursing homes, older people's advocacy groups, people involved in the care and treatment of older people and the Department. There was an important and, as the Deputy indicated, necessary, input on behalf of persons directly affected, in particular the active and effective advocacy groups for older people who operate in this country. I reassure the Deputy and the House that such groups who are engaged in the issue were consulted. It is important that they should be. There is no harm in there being continuing debate on the issue but I reassure the Deputy and the House that it is something that was taken carefully into account when the standards were being put in place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_856">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. There was not a sentence in it with which I could possibly disagree. We all agree that we want to have the highest possible standards of care across the health system, but especially for elderly people who contributed to the State, built it up and frequently created excellent facilities from what were work houses across County Clare and turned them into care facilities of which any country could be proud. The standard of care provided there is second to none.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">I know anecdotally, although the Minister of State will not be particularly interested in anecdotal evidence, that treatment is frequently better in public facilities than in private facilities, hence the huge queue for treatment in public facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_858"> On the issue of patient-centred standards, if one were to take a survey of patients in care, I wonder whether they would want to be in single rooms or prefer to be in rooms accommodating four, five or even six patients. I wonder when the time period applying to these standards runs out, as it inevitably will, whether a detailed survey on that issue will be carried out. I accept these points are based on my observations and are anecdotal as opposed to being based on statistics and rational evidence and that it does not meet any of the tests, but from what I have seen, I think many people would prefer to be in communal rooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_859"> It is important that we have an independent body but it is also important that an independent body is not beyond reproach or certainly not beyond accountability. Efforts by families members of patients moved from St. Anne's to get in contact with HIQA were singularly unsuccessful. I do not blame HIQA for that because it believes that to safeguard its independence it cannot engage in a dialogue, but there must be some mechanism by which people who feel aggrieved or feel there is a discrepancy between two reports can have their concerns addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_860"> Inspections are important but they must be carried out uniformly. There is not a uniformity apparent to me with regard to these two reports. I appreciate I am bringing up these specifics to the Minister of State for the first time and that HIQA is independent and therefore there is very little that he can do. I urge HIQA to examine the uniformity of its inspections and also to examine how it deals with relatives of patients who are unhappy with the results of the inspections, even if they were carried out in the very best interests of the patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">The Deputy would not expect me to comment on or refer to any of the individual inspections to which he has pointed, but I repeat the comment and observation on how the particular standards play out in particular nursing homes. I take the Deputy's point, that it may not always be immediately clear to us if we walk into a nursing home that the standards are wholly appropriate when we view a particular human situation, but I think we can be sure and reassured that the standards did not come from nowhere, that the standards were put together on a rational basis, that they make sense, that people were consulted on them and that nothing is set in stone. I have taken careful note of what the Deputy said. I am sure there is a mechanism to provide for a review - I do not have it immediately to hand - but I am sure that a review is contemplated in all of these kinds of standards. It may well be that in the future the kinds of insights that the Deputy has raised could be taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_862">1. <b>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl</b> asked the <b>Minister for Defence</b> the total amount of pay and allowance and other remuneration for the Defence Forces in 2012; the total savings he hopes to make in this in 2013-2015; the method by which he will procure such savings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Defence<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_863">Remuneration for the Permanent Defence Force in 2012 amounted to €459.76 million. This consisted of €424.76 million on pay and €35 million on allowances. An additional €3.5 million in remuneration for the Reserve Defence Force was also expended in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_864"> As the Deputy is aware, talks on an extension to the Public Service Agreement 2010–2014 began last month with a view to achieving savings in the order of €1 billion from the public service pay and pensions bill in the period to the end of 2015 to underpin the necessary fiscal consolidation. During these talks the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, set out a requirement of savings from each sector in the period to the end of 2015 with savings of €35 million being sought from the defence sector. This equates to 3.5% which is the defence sector’s proportion of the total public service pay bill for 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_865"> The Government is committed to seeking agreement with staff representatives on the measures to be introduced to achieve the necessary savings in the public service pay and pensions bill. Discussions have commenced, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission and led by officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, between public service management and staff representatives on a new agreement on measures to be introduced to achieve the necessary savings in the public service pay and pensions bill. In parallel with central discussions to identify those savings which would apply across all sectors, defence sector management and the Defence Forces representative associations continue to discuss how additional measures could help to deliver savings and productivity gains to contribute to the defence sector’s proportion of savings to the €1 billion target.</p>
            <p eId="para_866"> As these discussions are still ongoing, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the specifics are confidential to the parties involved and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_867">I thank the Minister for his response. We are conscious of the priority the Government has in this area of the review of the Croke Park agreement and we are conscious of the need to continue to achieve savings across the public service. In tabling this question I am asking the Minister to be an advocate for the members of the Defence Forces. I am asking him to recognise that the Defence Forces have been to a very large extent a pioneer in the area of public service reform. The Minister has achieved significant reform in a very short timeframe. I am conscious of the fact that between 1997 and 2007 expenditure on the Defence Forces decreased by approximately 50% as a share of the national income.</p>
            <p eId="para_868"> I am also conscious, as I am sure is the Minister, that the allowances paid to members of the Defence Forces are, by and large, part of core pay and therefore must be protected. In the work he is doing in this area, is the Minister conscious that a significant number of members of the Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement and that fact indicates that the pay of these serving men and women, of whom this State is rightly proud, is at a level that cannot bear further reduction? My critical question is, notwithstanding the needs to achieve savings, whether the Minister is willing to be a personal advocate for the members of the Defence Forces on this particular issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_869">I give the Deputy every assurance that I have great respect for the fantastic achievements in recent years made within the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces in the areas of modernisation, effecting change and effecting substantial cost savings, which are evident right across the board. The Department of Defence is a model for public service reform that could well be replicated in other Departments. A great deal has been achieved. In the short time I have been Minister, which is less than two years, we have had the reorganisation of the Defence Forces, moving from a three to a two battalion structure. We have had the closure of Army barracks with which we have dealt now, happily, and that will not be revisited. Four Army barracks have been closed. There is also the reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force. Substantial efficiencies have been effected by all of the events that have happened in implementation. We have also had the very beneficial decision made many years ago that now applies whereby when the Defence Forces sell property owned by them the proceeds can be reinvested to provide proper resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> I am very conscious of the reality that some members of the Defence Forces are resorting to supplementary welfare allowance to supplement their finances. It is important we acknowledge that basic line pay and military service allowance constitute core play in the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The question of what other allowances might be considered to be part of core pay is a matter for discussion between the Department and representative associations for the Defence Forces. It is important to understand that the term "allowances" in the defence sector covers a variety of payment types that are different from each other. Some are intended to reimburse expenses and do not actually form part of remuneration at all. Some payments are made in recognition of particular technical or professional qualifications while other allowances recognise particularly onerous duties, whether at home or overseas, which fall outside the norms taken into account in setting basic pay, while also reflecting the fact that the Defence Forces do not receive overtime.</p>
            <p eId="para_872"> I assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of this issue and that, in the context of the public finances and the savings to be achieved, it is important that we engage and look constructively at savings that may be effected. I very much welcome the constructive engagement of the representative bodies. One key decision that was made was that the strength of the Defence Forces would be maintained at 9,500. The Government made the decision, at my request, in the lead-in to the 2012 budget. That decision was designed to ensure that we maintained the strength of the Defence Forces but maintaining the strength leads to certain consequences, namely that we must have the funding available to meet the basic and core pay requirements. Nevertheless, it is important that we constantly examine where savings can be effected. There is a remit from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to engage and constructive engagement is taking place. I do not want to say any more about that but I hope that we will, in the context of that engagement, be able to identify savings that can be implemented and applied without in any way undermining the effectiveness or the strength of the Defence Forces.</p>

Can we take it that the Minister would accept that a rather crude, pro rata percentage cut across the board of 3.5%, which has been spoken of and alluded to in his own response, is not the way to approach the particular circumstances of the 9,500 members of the Defence Forces?</p>

            <p eId="para_875">2. <b>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</b> asked the <b>Minister for Defence</b> the total amount allocated to the Reserve Defence Forces' budget each year since 2005; if his attention has been drawn to the recent suggestions that the Reserve Defence Forces are being wound down; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_876">In regard to the total amount allocated to the Reserve Defence Force each year from 2005 to 2012, I propose to circulate a tabular statement setting out the information requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> With regard to the future of the Reserve Defence Force, the Deputy will be aware that a major re-organisation is currently under way. This re-organisation is a key element of the response to the findings and recommendations of a value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was published last November. The re-organisation is based on joint proposals from the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General, which I accepted. The value for money report found that the current Reserve organisation was not fit for purpose and required radical reform. Significant issues such as low uptake of training and a high turnover of personnel combined with a low strength level served to adversely impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Reserve. The review highlighted a range of issues that needed to be addressed in order to improve the effectiveness of the Reserve Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> A new “single force” concept will see Permanent Defence Force units having Reserve components, rather than a parallel Reserve as at present. Reserve units within barracks will be supported by their parent PDF unit and the 16 units outside of PDF installations will be supported by dedicated full time PDF personnel. This concept offers significant potential advantages in terms of training and development of the Reserve. The initiative of locating Reserve officers within the Defence Forces management structure will likewise underpin the future Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_879"> The re-organisation of the Reserve Defence Force is in response to a compelling case for reform and will dovetail with the significant changes that are occurring in the PDF organisational structures. They will ensure a better Reserve and enhance overarching Defence capabilities. The high level group with responsibility for implementing the re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force is now implementing the re-organisation of the Reserve. The contribution and commitment of all members of the Reserve is appreciated and I sincerely hope that all members of the Reserve will continue to serve within the new organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_909">I managed to get my hands on some of the figures that I requested. I had not realised that my party had submitted a Parliamentary Question on the issue not so long ago. The response received indicates that funding for the Reserve Defence Force reached a peak in 2006, when the allocation was just over €13 million. The latest figures for 2011 indicate that the funding had dropped to €4.386 million, which is almost a third of the level in 2006. Those figures do not lie. It is clear that there has been, sadly, an incremental erosion of the role of the Reserve and the funding for them. The phrase "value for money" is a most unfortunate one because often what it means, when one strips away the varnish, is straightforward, simple cutbacks.</p>
            <p eId="para_910"> I have spoken to members of the Reserve Defence Force, as I am sure the Minister has, not just in Donegal but elsewhere and have asked them about their impression over the last number of years. They are very saddened by what is happening because the Reserve Defence Force are a link of patriotism between our Defence Force, of which we are immensely proud, particularly for their peace-keeping role around the world, and our local communities. This is particularly the case for young people. I represent Donegal North East and was told that at a Reserve Defence Force open day in a local secondary school, over 100 young people expressed an interest in joining. However, due to the restructuring, that is not going to be practically possible for many of them because the training facilities are now centralised and are a considerable distance away from places like north Inishowen. In many rural parts of Ireland it will no longer be practical for young people to participate in the Reserve Defence Force and to give, in their own way, patriotic service not just to the Defence Forces, but to their local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> I am afraid that the figures do not lie. We need to be honest about what has been happening in recent times.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_912">The reduction in the allocation to the Reserve Defence Force over the period in question was addressed in the value for money report. The key variable in determining the level of training costs over the period 2006 to 2009, for example, was the uptake of both paid and unpaid training by members of the Reserve. As the uptake of training was on a voluntary basis, associated costs were demand led. The costs incurred for paid training were less than those anticipated due to the lower uptake of paid training and less than anticipated strength levels. The reality is that there was a designated strength level for the Reserve which was never achieved and far too few members of the Reserve were engaging in the recommended minimum seven day's training. This issue was addressed very substantially in the value for money report, which is why the reforms are being introduced. The cut in the number of Permanent Defence Force support staff accounts for the bulk of the savings that are being effected, following on from the value for money report. The money available for training activity by the Reserve is being maintained in order to ensure sufficient paid training for a strength level of 4,000 personnel. I am hoping, ultimately, that as a result of the reforms we will have 4,000 personnel who all participate in the minimum seven-day training programmes and that instead of us having a nominal strength, we have a real strength.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">In the most recent year, 2011, only 2,500 members of the Reserve were engaged in seven full training days, although gratuities were being paid to approximately 5,000 members. </p>
            <p eId="para_914"> The real problem is that we have individuals involved in the Reserve who take up the training days and provide for the operational possibilities the Reserve is designed to provide for.</p>

            <p eId="para_929">On 17 January 2013, the Council of the European Union established the European Union training mission, EUTM Mali, which will provide military training and advice to the Malian armed forces to improve their military capacity and their effectiveness in guaranteeing the country's territorial integrity. Training will also be provided in international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians and human rights. It is envisaged that the training component of the mission will be made up of approximately 250 personnel and this will be further supplemented by additional troops who will be deployed to provide force protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_930"> Unlike the EU-led mission to the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, EUTM Mali, which is being launched in support of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2071 and 2085 of 2012, will not have any combat functions and is totally separate and distinct from any combat support being provided to the Malian armed forces by France and other countries. It will be conducted at the invitation of the Malian Government and in close co-ordination with the UN, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, and other key partners. </p>
            <p eId="para_931"> The Council has asked the mission commander, General François Lecointre, to carry out preparations for the early launch of the mission. To this end, force generation for the mission is currently ongoing at EU level. All member states have been invited by the mission commander to provide contributions to the mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_932"> Ireland is currently considering the provision of a small number of Defence Forces personnel to the mission. Any participation by Ireland in this mission would most likely be limited to a small contribution of trainers and would be subject to Government approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_936">It would be a serious mistake to send troops in any form to Mali. The mission to Chad, where Irish troops were the second biggest contingent, was really to further French interests. At that time, we were told its purpose was to protect internally displaced people and refugees from Darfur. In reality, the EU troops were used to free up the forces of the dictator and allow him to crush the rebels while the rest of the EU was doing some other work.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> The Tuareg people have been in a long struggle for autonomy in northern Mali. The idea that the troops are going in to quell terrorism is a myth. Research indicates no record of al-Qaeda activity in the area until it was orchestrated by the Algerian intelligence services, backed up by the United States and with the full knowledge of the EU, which encouraged fundamentalist atrocities so that the situation could be used to enable an intervention and open up and exploit the area's mineral wealth and oil. Is that not the real agenda? Would we not be making a serious mistake to further France's interests in that regard? We are talking about gold, uranium, diamonds and oil, and not humanitarian issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_938">The Deputy has an extraordinary view of the world. Anyone who watched what happened in Mali, particularly northern Mali, where barbaric atrocities were carried out on the local people, people were herded into stadiums with their arms chopped off and women were made to cover their heads, threatened and not allowed to engage in normal life, would recognise that there was a major problem in Mali. It is extraordinary that the Deputy should suggest that al-Qaeda was operating in Mali because it was encouraged by the United States to do so and that the European Union encouraged atrocities. The Deputy has a strange, conspiratorial view of what is happening in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_939"> The reality is that there were substantial difficulties in Mali. The Malian armed forces lacked the capacity to deal with those difficulties and the Malian Government sought assistance. The United Nations, with which the Deputy appears to disagree, passed motions to provide for trainers to train the Malian forces, not only in dealing effectively with military matters but, by way of the comprehensive approach that is adopted, to ensure that training is provided in international humanitarian law and with regard to ensuring the protection of civilians and human rights. Ireland has an important role in this. We can contribute in a small way with a small number of troops, just as we have done with EUTM Somalia, where we helped to bring about a degree of protection to people in Somalia and Mogadishu by ensuring that Government has trained and appropriate forces available to it. The Government is giving active consideration to deploying a small number of troops on this training mission.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">I am glad my view of the world is not the same as the Minister's. My opinion is shared by people such as Jeremy Keenan, who is an acknowledged expert on the Saharan peoples and has written many articles on Algerian state terrorism and atrocities in northern Mali. He has shown how Washington helped to foster the Islamist uprising in Mali, and so on. We know atrocities have been carried out against civilians but the idea that the French are in Mali to protect civilians and that their real goal is not to exploit mineral resources is laughable, and we should not have anything to do with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">I am of the view that the preparation for a new White Paper on Defence will benefit greatly from an informed and wide-ranging debate on Ireland’s defence policy. To that end I decided to initiate the preparation of a Green Paper on Defence. When published, the Green Paper will initiate and inform a broad consultative process as part of the development of a new White Paper. A draft Green Paper was submitted to me recently for my consideration. The approach taken is to assess the defence and security environment and on this basis to pose questions to inform the debate on defence policy. I will shortly bring a memorandum for Government to Cabinet seeking formal approval to publish the document and to initiate the consultation process to inform the White Paper on Defence. The views of members of the public and other interested parties on defence policy and defence provision will be welcomed during the consultative phase. The new White Paper on Defence is scheduled for completion in early 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_946"> I welcome the fact that the Minister has embarked on a consultation process. Can he give us a sense of the timelines involved? How quickly will he start the consultation and how long will it last? </p>
            <p eId="para_947"> With regard to something that has interested me since the Government was formed, will the Green Paper address the reality that a Minister for Justice and Equality also holds the Defence portfolio?</p>
            <p eId="para_948">Could that be explored as an issue in the Green Paper and the subsequent White Paper? Is there any other democracy where the person who is in control of the police force is also in control of the military? Are there any powers the Minister for Defence might normally hold of which the Minister has been divested by virtue of the fact he is also Minister for Justice and Equality?</p>

            <p eId="para_949">As far as I recollect there are no powers the Minister of Defence has normally of which I have been relieved. On the assumption that I remain sane, I assure the Deputy that I have no intention of posing any threat to the State by virtue of my being in this unusual position of being Minister for Defence and Minister for Justice and Equality. The two Departments are entirely separate but in the modern context there are interesting overlaps. International terrorism and the threats that may be posed to this State, or the threat those engaged in terrorism might pose to other states by locating here, create an overlap of concerns for both Departments. Cybersecurity also leads to overlaps and it is beneficial at European Union level to participate in summits for both Defence Ministers and Justice Ministers. At EU level there should be greater connectivity in dealing with some of these issues where there is clearly an overlap.</p>
            <p eId="para_950"> The White Paper will deal comprehensively with defence issues. The Deputy suggests my having both portfolios poses a risk to the defence of the State. It is a matter for the Taoiseach of the day to determine how to appropriately appoint Ministers and what positions they should hold. All Members of the House will find the Green Paper on defence interesting. I must bring it before Cabinet before it is published. It sets out defence issues as they are today and raises questions in the context of the today's world and will result in a very interesting conversation.</p>
            <p eId="para_951"> I would hope by the end of this month, or if not, certainly early next month, depending on Cabinet pressures, that the paper will be published and we will enter the discussion process. I look forward to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality taking up the matter to engage in public discussion on the Green Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_952">On the Minister's dual role, are any of his European partners in the same position as the Minister with both portfolios or can he point out any developed democracy where a similar situation prevails? I accept the Minister does not represent a threat to the security of the State. The gardaí might not be thrilled about the threat the Minister represents to them and I hope the Defence Forces do not have cause arising from the pay claims to have any concerns. The precedent appears to have been set in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">My recollection is that a ministerial colleague from one of the smaller EU states holds both portfolios. I will inform the Deputy in writing. I am thinking of two states and I do not want to be mistaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_954"> I note with interest that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Niall Collins, keeps complaining that we recruited 600 new members of the Defence Forces during 2012. It seems to be a regular cause of complaint on his part, with him suggesting we should recruit for the Garda Síochána and not the Defence Forces. It is worth noting that Deputy Ó Fearghaíl never complains about recruitment into the Defence Forces. It might be a good idea for the Deputies to discuss that issue with each other so they can co-ordinate an approach that does not suggest we should stop recruitment into the Defence Forces or that it is a legitimate criticism of my occupying this office that we brought Defence Forces numbers back up to 9,500 rather than letting them fall well into the 8,000s as a consequence of Fianna Fáil failing to recruit in the years prior to my appointment.</p>

            <p eId="para_956">The Naval Service plays a vital role in the State's fight against drug smuggling as a member of the joint task force on drug interdiction, together with the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda Síochána. While the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention of drug smuggling, and responsibility for the prevention of crime rests primarily with An Garda Síochána, the White Paper on Defence in 2000 provided a security role for the Naval Service and Air Corps to assist these authorities in this important work. This is another area in which the two Departments overlap. The joint task force on drug interdiction was established in 1993 as a Government measure to improve law enforcement on drugs and it consists of members of An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service and the Naval Service. </p>
            <p eId="para_957"> Naval Service maritime patrols and surveillance operations are carried out on a 24-7 basis with a commitment to having a minimum of three ships on patrol at all times. In the last ten years, the Naval Service was involved in two significant drug interdiction operations, one in 2007 in Dunlough Bay and one off the west Cork coast in 2008. These inter-agency operations resulted in the seizure of 3.2 tonnes of cocaine which had an approximate street value of €1.2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_958"> In addition, the Naval Service, as a member of the joint task force, is committed to an international initiative, the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre – Narcotics. The centre, which was established in 2007, has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. It was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international coordination force with access to national tasking agencies. </p>
            <p eId="para_959"> Also, the acquisition of the two new offshore patrol vessels for the Naval Service, to be delivered in 2014 and 2015 respectively, together with a continuous process of refurbishment on the other vessels, will ensure that the service can continue to carry out its drug interdiction and other roles in the challenging sea conditions off our coast. </p>

            <p eId="para_960">The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had the opportunity to visit Flag Officer Mark Mellett and his team in Cork late last year. I was mightily impressed with Flag Officer Mellett's vision for the Naval Service. The innovation displayed and the partnerships the service has formed with academic and other institutions are remarkable. The service has set itself the objective of being the world leader, a high ambition but when we see the operation in Cork, and the way the service has worked to develop operations in conjunction with engineering companies, where it can look at machine gunnery without having to go to sea by working with computerised models, is incredible.</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> When we see the operations the Naval Service carries out and the way it goes about its work, it is a service to be proud of and we must give it the resources it deserves. We are all aware of the operations and great successes it has enjoyed in recent years but we are seeing heroin and other drugs on the streets now and the concern is that much of this comes by sea. We must support one of the most innovative sectors of the public service and we must give it what it needs to do the job.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">I agree with everything Deputy Mac Lochlainn says. The Naval Service is an outstanding arm of the Defence Forces and Flag Officer Mark Mellett is doing a fantastic job.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">There is their linkage with the private sector in seeking to participate in developments that would be of use to the Naval Service and which may result in products being created which could provide job creation opportunities. I am proud of the sophistication of what is happening in the college there.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> The Deputy can be assured that I am extremely supportive of everything that is happening there, as is the Government. I very much welcomed the visit that members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality paid to Haulbowline. It gave an interesting insight into the innovation that is taking place. I would certainly encourage Members who are interested in these areas to pay a similar visit.</p>

            <p eId="para_974"> Two critical pieces of property exist here, in Columb Barracks in Mullingar and, grounds with which I have particular affinity and about which I have concern, the Magee Barracks in Kildare. What is important about these two pieces of property is their strategic locations in respect of the two significant towns where they are located. We all wish to see Columb Barracks in Mullingar developed for employment generation and we would urge the Minister to continue with whatever initiatives he has in mind there.</p>
            <p eId="para_975"> Significant local dissatisfaction exists in County Kildare at the fact that the 65 acres of Magee Barracks, which is located centrally within the town, remains undeveloped. Indeed, far from being undeveloped, it has become a focus for ongoing anti-social behaviour. One accepts that to come up with a plan for the strategic development of 65 acres of land in a town the size of Kildare in the current climate is a major challenge.

            <p eId="para_979">I would be an enthusiast for the disposal of both barracks if there was an appropriate proposal made in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_980"> There has been a long history of engagement with State agencies on Magee Barracks since its closure in 1998. In 1999, at the request of the then Department of Foreign Affairs, part of the site was made available for use as a temporary accommodation for some 265 Kosovar refugees. In 2000, at the request of the Reception and Integration Agency of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, part of the site was made available for use as temporary accommodation for asylum seekers. In late 2000, at the request of Kildare County Council, part of the site was made available for use as a temporary halting site for members of the Traveller community.</p>
            <p eId="para_981"> In July 2003, the then Government decided that the former barracks would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. On foot of this announcement, Kildare County Council prepared a local area plan for the site which encompassed a range of uses, including community activities. The Department had been involved in the process of transferring ownership to Kildare County Council and the final contract for sale was sent to solicitors for the local authority in 2009. However, the local authority subsequently contacted the Department to state it no longer wished to proceed with the development and had no interest in taking possession of the property, and the property was returned to the Department of Defence in its entirety. The question of putting the property up for auction is being actively considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_982"> On Mullingar, some discussions have taken place with potential buyers from the State sector. However, no firm interest has been shown at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> When I became Minister, there were particular problems with the site in Kildare which was being accessed and there were difficulties with regard to parts of the property which were in a dilapidated condition. It is regrettable that what is a major site was left for over a decade vacant and used for a variety of purposes with no direct plan being put in place for its development. In the current economic climate, it is obviously a matter of great difficulty in dealing with this but I would very much welcome a re-engagement by Kildare County Council. For example, in Clonmel, the local authorities have come together with my Department and there has been substantial engagement with a view to putting together a plan for the future use of Clonmel barracks. I would very much welcome Kildare County Council showing a similar interest in this site and its potential with a view to some practical arrangements being put in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">I acknowledge the Minister's role in securing the site although, unfortunately, it continues to be breached. The Department incurred significant expenditure in attempting to secure the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_986"> I deplore the fact that Kildare County Council did not achieve ownership of the site when it was offered to it in 2009. It is a disgrace that the local authority did not proceed at that time. I put it to the Minister, given that he is now the owner on behalf of the Irish people, that it is incumbent on him to be proactive in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_987"> I would suggest that Kildare County Council has a role, but so, too, has the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Gone are the days when we want to see this site developed for affordable housing. That proposition is certainly a dead duck and it is not one about which I was ever wildly enthusiastic. However, it is a site that has considerable potential in terms of job creation and, perhaps, recreational amenity facilities, as it has for educational facilities. The Minister has a role and I would call on him to be proactive in engaging with his ministerial colleagues on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">It is an important site with significant potential. It is unfortunate that its potential has not been realised more actively.</p>
            <p eId="para_990"> Since I have become Minister, my Department has done everything possible with regard to the various vacant sites by circulating State agencies and Departments and making it known that sites are available. The site in Kildare has been vacant for a long time. Deputy Ó Fearghaíl's party was in government for the major portion of the time when this site was vacant and did not succeed in doing anything other than having it used for temporary purposes and effecting what I could describe as a degradation of the site because of the different purposes for which it was designated and, ultimately, arrangements that were envisaged to be implemented with Kildare County Council never came to pass. However, I would very much like to see something happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_991"> We have taken similar steps with Mullingar to the steps we took in Clonmel and in Cavan. Cavan barracks, when it was closed, was taken over by the local VEC, which is already functioning there.</p>
            <p eId="para_992"> Unfortunately, similar interest was not shown in Mullingar either. I would encourage the local community and the local authority to look at possible uses for what is an historical barracks on an important site. There are some limitations on how it can be used because some of the buildings are designated buildings but it should not be impossible with an active engagement to identify appropriate uses. It is not something the Department of Defence can do on its own. My Department does not have a role in developing these sites.</p>

            <p eId="para_996"> The primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist An Garda Síochána when requested to do so. The Defence Forces, in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, keep the threat level under continual review.</p>
            <p eId="para_997"> There has been no request from An Garda Síochána for additional assistance such as would warrant a general increase in the level of Defence Forces personnel deployed in the Border regions.</p>
          </speech>
          <summary eId="sum_64">In my capacity as Minister for Justice and Equality, I assure the Deputies that resources will not be an issue and every effort is being made by An Garda Síochána to bring to justice the perpetrators of the most heinous crime that resulted in the very callous and barbaric murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe. The Garda Síochána has not indicated that there is a need for an engagement by the Defence Forces in the manner the Deputy is suggesting and, ultimately, it is a matter for the Garda authorities.</summary>

            <p eId="para_998">I ask the Minister to keep the matter under continual review. We are all very conscious of the activity of criminal gangs along the Border. We are aware that some of them describe themselves as dissident republicans. We know they are criminals and that their activities are particularly nefarious. Should the need to arise for the military to be involved in supporting the civil power, it is important that it could respond quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_999"> There is a level of disappointment in the Border region that we no longer have a military presence between Finner Camp and Dundalk. The Minister will also be aware of the disappointment over the closure of the very modern and well-equipped Dún Uí Néill camp in Cavan. I accept the Minister's assurance that should the need arise, the necessary military participation and involvement will be available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1011"> I addressed the question of possible Defence Forces participation in the EU Training Mission for Mali in answering the priority question earlier. Force generation for the new mission, which was established by the Council of the European Union on 17 January 2013, is ongoing at EU level. All member states have been invited by the mission commander to provide contributions to the mission. While Ireland is positively disposed towards the mission, no decision has been made at this stage as to whether Ireland will participate in the mission. A number of important factors are under consideration such as participants, potential partners and, most importantly, how the issue of force protection, medical services and medevac will be addressed in Mali. A detailed threat assessment by the Defence Forces will be required. Discussions with partners and the EU on Ireland’s possible contribution to the mission are expected to be concluded shortly. Any participation by Ireland to this mission would most likely be limited to a small contribution of trainers and would be subject to Government approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">In the context of what I said earlier, we are now past the days when individuals are simply deployed on UN peace missions to train forces without taking what I would describe as a comprehensive approach in dealing with issues relating to the protection of civilians in conflict. The protection of human rights is an essential part of missions because it is now widely recognised that it is very important that these issues are properly addressed. In the event of our possible participation, the numbers will be small, but if we participate, we will contribute in providing trainers. We are discussing a mission whose overall objective goes beyond what I would describe as simple military training but extends into other areas, in particular the protection of civilians in conflict zones, the protection of human rights, the importance of human rights and the importance - if I could emphasise it - of not violating human rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_1014">Given the total lack of democracy in Mali at the moment and the ongoing discrimination and human rights abuses against Tuareg people in north Mali, is it appropriate for Ireland to be interfering? Should a small independent country, such as Ireland, not stay neutral and not send troops to support one side in a civil war, which is pretty unlikely to be confined to Mali? The French have been very eager to move in, but I am not sure we should be supporting this. France is probably the last country that could sort out Mali's problems, having created quite a few of them in the first place as a former colonial power. The French may have been invited in by the Malian Government, but it is a government brought to power by a military coup last year and not one elected by the Malians. The Malian troops are now trading atrocities and human rights abuses with the rebels. While I have no intention of standing up for the rebels either, I would like to see Ireland stay neutral and out.</p>

            <p eId="para_1015">I draw the Deputy's attention to what I said earlier, which is that our UN resolution is to provide for a UN mission, which it is, to train the domestic Malian forces so that they are fit for purpose and able to carry out their duties and able to protect that population effectively. It is not the role of Ireland to make decisions or engage in matters that relate to the particular government in an individual country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016"> I find the Deputy's concept of neutrality interesting. I am not sure what is the moral platform on which one stands back and watches people being brutalised, arms being cut off, women being raped - as has happened in northern Mali - and women being discriminated against and treated as second-class citizens while fundamentalists impose Sharia law and try to turn the population back to the 7th or 8th century, although I believe in the 7th or 8th century there was a more humane form of Islam than that which Sharia law, in its strictest fundamentalist terms, seeks to impose on populations. I see this as a human rights issue and a neutral state participating - as I have said, it is not finalised that we will participate - in a UN sanctioned mission whose objective is to ensure that human life is protected and that individuals are not victims of atrocities. I do not have any respect for a concept of morality where one stands back and watches people being killed, people having their limbs chopped off, women being raped and then pats oneself on the back and claims to be morally superior having simply watched it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1017">I am not talking about moral superiority and I do not approve of any of the violence on behalf of the jihad rebels at all. I am not a fan of war of any type. We have seen the disasters of interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. Military intervention by outside forces exacerbates the problems. The past decade has demonstrated beyond doubt that such interventions do not necessarily solve crises, let alone deal with the causes of terrorism, but deepen them and generate new conflicts. More military interventions will bolster authoritarian regimes and their rhetoric further poisons community relations in the intervening states. It seems to be a price we have paid repeatedly. If Africans were left to solve their problems, the death toll would be lower at the end of the day.</p>

            <p eId="para_1018">The Deputy seems to be of the views that when there is a UN-mandated mission this State should not participate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">This State has an honoured tradition of participating in missions of a peacekeeping nature and missions that can contribute to conflict resolution and the protection of civilian life. It is particularly interesting that the Deputy fails to make any reference to the UN mandate. I do not know if he believes that our Defence Forces should ever participate in peacekeeping missions or that we should play no role in the outside world and never seek to provide any assistance to anyone. Not only is this a UN mission, but all 27 European countries, all of which are democracies, taking account of what is happening in Mali, recognise the need to contribute to the UN mission and to engage and try to provide the type of training necessary to ensure that the Malian army is properly trained, does not engage in human rights abuses and that civilians are protected. I believe we should give careful consideration to whether we participate in this mission. As I stated, no final decision has been made. On the basis of the approach taken by the Deputy, we would not participate in any UN missions in any location in the world. The reality is the only parts of the world which require UN peacekeeping or conflict resolution engagements are troubled parts of the world wherein, sadly and tragically, there is and has been violence and lives have been lost. The purpose of a UN mission is to seek to facilitate addressing that particular difficulty.</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">Last week, an interesting conference was held in Dublin. One of the participants at that conference was from the African Union. There is a general recognition that there are great difficulties in Mali and a need to provide assistance there to protect individuals. The Deputy appears to be of the odd view that the European Union is becoming increasingly militarised despite that every European Union state is spending less on its defence forces than was the case in previous years, is reducing the numbers within its defence forces and European Union member states of the United Nations are participating a great deal less in UN missions by providing troops to assist in such missions. The reality is that there is far greater participation in UN missions in Africa by African states and by states in other parts of the world. The Deputy is speaking not from a position of knowledge, but of presumption and perception, which is not borne out by the facts. </p>
            <p eId="para_1022"> As I stated earlier, Ireland has a proud record of participating in UN missions.

            <p eId="para_1024">The Minister's narrative might be convincing if there was any consistency in it when he decries human rights abuses, violence against women and so on inevitably attached to the word "Muslim" or "Islamic". Where is the consistency when this type of abuse is perpetrated daily in a regime like Saudi Arabia to which the European Union, the United States and so on sell arms weekly? There is no problem in that and no military intervention there, even when it is crushing a democratic movement in Bahrain, because that particularly brutal Islamist regime happens to serve the interests of the Western powers in the region. This exposes the claim that these interventions are prompted by humanitarian concerns. There is a nasty civil war going on in Mali but the Malian state and Malian military are not the good guys in this. The Tuareg people have legitimate national aspirations which they have expressed in four different rebellions since 1960. They are an impoverished nomadic people who have suffered badly at the hands of that rotten regime. Let us not forget that the French, who are leading the military intervention in Mali, also backed the dictatorship of Ben Ali until it was overthrown in the revolution of the people. Also, they happen to be sitting on a lot of gold and uranium.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025"> The United States has forces in 35 countries in Africa. There is a scramble going on for the mineral resources of Africa and the Islamist bogeyman is being used as a justification for military intervention.

            <p eId="para_1027">I will be brief. I have no idea why Deputy Boyd Barrett is shouting at me. I am not responsible for all of the conflicts that are taking place in Africa, many of which are tragic. I am merely dealing with the issue raised, which relates to the United Nations resolution that trainers should be provided to the Malian armed forces. As I said previously, we are considering allowing a small number of our Defence Forces to participate in that mission.</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">I am annoyed because the Minister in his initial response to my question as to why Question No. 9 had not been grouped with these questions gave the rather disingenuous response that it was about battle groups when it also relates to military missions to Africa. The Minister knew precisely to what I was referring. The Minister is not being honest in terms of the manner in which he is dealing with the points being raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029"> The point being made is that this is not some sort of good guy-bad guy conflict in respect of which we should be training the military of the Malian State because they are the good guys in this. Atrocities against the Tuareg people have substantially escalated - I accept there have been atrocities on all sides - since the French military intervention commenced. It is worsening the situation and will drive ordinary Malians into the hands of the more obscurantist elements. This is not simply an issue of good guy-bad guy. This is a nasty civil war, in respect of which the French have their own agenda. We should not be involved in the scramble by imperial powers in African countries because the losers will be the ordinary people of Mali and Africa generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_1031">As the Deputy proceeds with his ideological diatribe, what he chooses to ignore is the atrocities taking place in northern Mali, which have been well depicted not alone in media articles but starkly on our television screens, including interviews with individuals who are the victims of atrocities and whose limbs were missing. We know that a fundamentalist group claiming to have links with al-Qaeda is engaged in substantial criminality in the region and is bringing individuals to stadiums, cutting off their limbs in front of spectators and then bringing in doctors to provide medical attention after the limbs have been chopped off.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032"> If the Deputy believes that the United Nations should ignore things like this, that it is in the interests of the people living in that area that they be subjected to that sort of fundamentalist atrocity and wishes to be blind to the fact that there is a problem with fundamentalist Islam, that is his choice.</p>

My remit as Minister for Defence this evening is to deal with the issue raised of whether we will participate in a UN mission in Mali and is such warranted. A number of European Union states have taken the view they will participate. We are giving active consideration to participating. It is unfortunate that when the Deputy addresses areas of great international difficulty, he always has a blind spot whereby he ignores some of the atrocities committed in areas-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 30 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044"> Two invitations have been received by Ireland to participate in future EU battle groups. One invitation has been received to participate in the Nordic battle group 2015, together with Sweden acting as framework nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia. The second force generation conference was held in Sweden in early December 2012. The proposed contribution to this battle group will be a reconnaissance company with associated HQ staff appointments and supporting elements. The model envisaged for the battle group gives command of a multinational reconnaissance group HQ to Ireland, resulting in a raised profile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045"> The second invitation received is to participate in the EU battle group 2016, with Germany acting as framework nation, Luxembourg, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. Discussions are ongoing with the participants on Ireland's potential contribution to this battle group. Any participation by Ireland in the Nordic and EU battle groups in 2015 and 2016 will be subject to formal Government approval at the appropriate time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046"> Separate from battle group participation, Ireland has received an invitation to participate in the European Union training mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, which will provide military training and advice to the Malian armed forces to improve their military capacity and their effectiveness in guaranteeing the country's territorial integrity. I have already addressed the question of possible Defence Force participation in EUTM Mali. While Ireland is positively disposed towards this mission, no decision has yet been made. Any decision on participation will be a matter ultimately to be determined by government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2013-02-07T19:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1047">Perhaps it was an innocent mistake on the Minister's part, but the reference in the question was to our military involvement in Africa. It is worth saying, and I have a later question which we probably will not reach, that there is an alarming drift towards greater involvement by this country since the Government has come into office in military affairs and supporting a militarist agenda, including, for example, the invitation to NATO's deputy assistant secretary general for political affairs and security policy to address a defence seminar as part of one of the first events in the EU Presidency. It was not mentioned that he is linked to NATO; mention was made of the UN and the EU, but he is one of the main spokespeople for NATO. This is indicative of the alarming closer synergy and relationship between NATO and the European Union which is not being acknowledged. It was not mentioned when he was speaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048"> It is in this context that we are concerned about so-called humanitarian missions which are often sold as humanitarian but involved in these missions are states and powers - in the case of Mali it is France and in the case of Africa generally it is the United States - who have interests and who tend to be extremely selective in what dictatorships and terrorists they oppose and which Islamic extremists they find problematic and which others they do not find quite so problematic. It is not invention or conspiracy on our part. President Jimmy Carter's main military adviser and his foreign secretary, Brzezinski, wrote a book in which he outlined in detail how the Carter Administration backed the Taliban and the establishment of what later became al-Qaeda, because it suited it in the strategic battle during the Cold War against the Soviet Union. As he put it, what is stirring up a few mullahs compared to the defeat of the Soviet empire. I put it to the Minister that the same carry on is going on in Mali and Africa generally, and a neutral country such as Ireland should not even consider being involved in this type of intervention.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">I will deal with the only issue of substance the Deputy raised. As part of Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council in 2013 a seminar was organised to discuss and examine how more effective co-operation and the building of partnerships across regional organisations and between these organisations and the United Nations could be fostered. This was undertaken to enhance the effectiveness of UN mandated peacekeeping operations, something I regard as being of particular importance. A wide range of speakers-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1053">I do not know whether the Deputy wants me to reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054"> A wide range of speakers was invited to attend the seminar, including from the European Union, the United Nations, the African Union, NATO and academia. Close co-operation between NATO and the United Nations and its agencies is an important element in the development of an international comprehensive approach to crisis management and operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055"> It is important to note UN Security Council resolutions have provided the mandate for NATO's operations in the western Balkans and Afghanistan in which Ireland participated. More recently, NATO's operation to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack in Libya in 2011 was carried out in support of UN Security Council resolution 1973. NATO has also provided support to UN sponsored operations including logistical assistance; the African Union's UN endorsed peacekeeping operations in Darfur, Sudan and Somalia; support for UN disaster relief operations in Pakistan following the massive earthquake in 2005; and escorting merchant ships carrying World Food Programme humanitarian supplies off the coast of Somalia. It might come as some surprise to the Deputy that NATO is an organisation which is quite different now and has evolved from the one he would have probably disliked because he would have favoured the Soviet Union in those days.</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">Like the EU and the African Union, NATO shares a commitment with the United Nations to maintaining international peace and security. The two organisations have been co-operating in this area since the early 1990s, which the Deputy seems to have missed. In view of this, I decided to invite a speaker to provide the discussion with the view from NATO and how it actively enhanced co-operation with the United Nations. Without the attendance of a representative from NATO, the debate and those attending would have missed an opportunity to hear first hand the views of the organisation. I spoke at the opening of the seminar and I attended and listened to a number of sessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058"> I am of the view that the attendance of all the regional organisations including NATO was very worthwhile. Attendees heard the full range of views of the organisations concerned and how these organisations can enhance their co-operation in engaging in UN missions in the interests of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance.</p>
