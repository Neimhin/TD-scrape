#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I request that Dáil Éireann be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to address the crisis in funding for Teagasc created by the Government and the loss of important research centres and advisory offices, such as Corduff in Fingal, and the need to take stock of where expert advice is now needed to ensure farmers and food producers generally are equipped for the significant challenges that lie ahead in this sector.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 12 – motion re Referral to Joint Committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the draft Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour; No. 19 – Local Government Bill 2003 [Seanad] – Order for Report, Report and Final Stages; No. 20 – Statements on European Council, Athens, to be taken not later than 2.10 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, or the order of the Dáil of 7 May 2003, that No. 12 shall be taken before Private Members' business and shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on No. 20 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 80 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: the statements shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes and the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Lab our Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; Members may share time; immediately following the statements, the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall take questions for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I have raised matters such as this previously. There was not a Whips' meeting and I understand no information is available to this side of the House as to what this is about. The Fine Gael Party Whip has asked for information. The proposals in respect of the Civil Service code of standards and behaviour have not been given to us, so we are being asked to approve sending a matter to a joint committee without knowing what we are sending. This practice is not good for the House. Opposition parties are entitled to have the relevant information before we give it formal approval.

Yesterday and consistently on the Order of Business we have raised the fact that matters are passing through this House without sight of Members. It is outrageous that we are referring material to committees without any deliberations or access to information. The whole approach of the Government in this area is minimalist to say the least and is highly objectionable.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	7	As a member of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I and my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, have, on a number of occasions in the course of debates on various Bills on financial services regulations and other matters, pointed out that when public appointments are being made, as is the case in many of these Bills, there is no clear code of conduct for civil servants, particularly where—

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Members of the House are entitled to receive the draft code, of which we on the Committee on Finance and the Public Service have had no sight, despite raising this important matter of public interest during its debates and discussions of various Bills. It is a shame it is not available to the House this morning.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Hear, hear.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The motion in question is a draft done under the SMI process. The intention is to send it to the joint committee to be discussed and, if necessary, returned to the House. While I do not know whether members of the committee will receive the draft today or tomorrow, they will certainly receive it.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	16	It is clearly appropriate that a committee should discuss the code before we start to debate it here.

Is that what she said?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	20	It is a matter for the House to decide what is discussed here. It will be referred back to the House. It will be discussed by the committee in the first instance.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	22	This party has raised on a number of occasions the serious concern throughout the country about the abuse of drink and drugs. Those concerns were highlighted by comments made by the President in the US yesterday.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I remind the House that a long-standing rule is that the President is outside the realm of debate in the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I know that. Those concerns were expressed by the President in the US.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	25	As the Deputy knows, there is a long-standing rule that the President is outside and above debate in the House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I am aware of that. I am only making a passing reference to the urgency of the  issue. Deputy Deasy published an action plan to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency. Why is it only proposed to publish the Intoxicating Liquor (Codification) Bill before the summer recess? What is the Abbottstown Sports Centre Authority Bill?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	27	That is a good question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Does it deal with the aquatic centre or is it for something more expansive? Do the Progressive Democrats have a view on it?As regards the Proceeds of Corruption Bill, the Government Whip said on 27 January that this Bill would ensure that assets acquired through corruption or whose value was enhanced by corruption would be frozen by the High Court. However, the Bill has now been moved from section A to section C. The Government has yet to approve the heads of the Bill. Why is that the case in view of comments made by the Government Whip that it was urgent and that it would be published quickly because of its essential value?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The content of the legislation is not appropriate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	30	As regards the Proceeds of Corruption Bill, a number of issues arose which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had to discuss with the Attorney General. That has delayed publication of the Bill.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Why?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It has taken longer than anticipated to resolve the issues which arose. As regards the Abbottstown Sports Centre Authority Bill, there is a swimming facility there. The heads of that Bill have not come before the Government yet. As regards the Intoxicating Liquor (Codification) Bill, the Bill will be published this month.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	33	As regards the Proceeds of Corruption Bill which, as Deputy Kenny said, is now listed in section C, I have the press announcement of 27 September last year when the Government announced with great fanfare, following receipt of the Flood tribunal report on the Ray Burke module, that it would do the devil and all about the proceeds of corruption. I have two pages of flowery prose from the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin. She said a person's house was not safe.

I also have a second question which is in order. Why did the Tánaiste go around the country promising to make the Redundancy Payments Bill retrospective? Why did she tell the workers in Castlecomer in Kilkenny—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	42	That does not arise. The Deputy is out of order

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	45	It is important to deal with this issue because, as usual, Deputy Rabbitte is wrong.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	46	He is not wrong.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	53	It is important. The Tánaiste would know it was important if she was being made redundant.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	54	—the unions were in no doubt that it could not be made retrospective legally.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The Tánaiste told them.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I did not tell them. The Deputy is playing politics around the country with people who are losing their jobs.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I welcome the announcement today by a German company in north Dublin to create jobs. Perhaps the Tánaiste will tell us about the fate of Enterprise Ireland and the indigenous sector which is not doing as well as the pharmaceutical sector.On promised legislation, is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform correct in stating that legislation will be published to ensure that members of the Garda Síochána can be seconded to the Police Service of Northern Ireland or is legislation already in place and there are other reasons for the delay? I am not aware of primary or secondary legislation which would assist in furthering the secondment.

I do not know if that covers the query the Deputy raised. There is also other legislation promised in relation to the reform of the Garda Síochána.

There has been a number of reports and announcements on this matter as well as a Cabinet meeting last Tuesday. Why is there a delay in honouring the promise and commitment the Tánaiste made before Easter about the publication of the heads of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	84	There is no delay. I said the heads of the Bill would be published after Easter. They will be published shortly. They are ready to go to the Cabinet. They have been drafted in conjunction with the interim board which has been established and they have come to hand now.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Tánaiste told the nation this morning that it is a tragedy we are so under-borrowed. However, she told the country the exact opposite when my party argued that 12 months ago.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Will she bring in a mini-budget now? Can we debate the question of the degree to which we are so tragically under-borrowed?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I will send Deputy Rabbitte a copy of my party's manifesto which dealt with this issue.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	90	That is fiction. It should get the Booker prize.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	91	It is not. The Deputy's predecessor would not debate the issues with me so I understand why the Deputy is not aware of them.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I stick to biographies. I have no time for fiction.

The Redundancy Payments Bill was mentioned earlier but the information was not shared with the House. Will the Tánaiste confirm that that Bill will come before the House in coming weeks?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	95	That was raised this morning and yesterday.

Whether it has been raised or not, that information has not been provided to Members. I seek confirmation, arising out of the efforts of the Whips to press for this legislation, that it will come before the House in coming weeks.The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority (No. 2) Bill gives a commitment to establish a statutory financial services ombudsman. Yet, although the heads of the Bill are agreed, our information is that publication is expected in mid-late 2003. What is "mid-late"? One might as well say North-South. Will it be published in 2003? Many of us fear that will not happen this year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Dáil will meet Friday week to discuss the Redundancy Payments Bill because it is important. Regarding the second matter, it is intended to publish the Bill later this year, probably in the autumn.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	99	On promised legislation, will the Tánaiste throw some light on the situation wherein the Government launched its road safety strategy in 1998 but to date, three fixed speed cameras have been rolled out around the country even though firm commitments were given at the time? When will we see the road traffic (amendment) Bill?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Next year.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I refer to legislation within the remit of the Tánaiste's Department. Following the litany of appalling incidents, including deaths, on building sites last year, the Government proposed to amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act with a new Bill. When I raised this matter in the last session, I was told repeatedly that it would be published in April. We are now  in May and, according to the new list of legislation published yesterday, the Bill will be published in late 2003. Why has this important Bill slipped and when will we see it?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	103	It will be published later this year. The reason is pressure on the parliamentary counsel's office, where there is a host of legislation. Enforcement of the existing legislation is important in this area and we have applied new resources to this.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I raise the status of a Bill on road openings that appears to have gone missing. It is long awaited by local authorities, as 43 agencies can open up roads by referring to local authorities rather than seeking permission. Is this a case of the Government creating a further pothole into which legislation falls?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I understand that legislation is not being pursued at the moment. I could read out information which the Deputy probably has himself. The effectiveness of the Communications Regulations Act 2002 is dealing with the problem.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	106	In an adjoining jurisdiction a journalist was arrested recently in the middle of the night by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I note No. 31 on the list of Bills, the criminal justice (protection of confidential information) Bill, which is to replace the Official Secrets Act 1963. When are we likely to see this Bill? Given the importance of this issue and the concerns of Members of the Oireachtas about the protection of confidential sources, will the Tánaiste consider a White Paper on confidentiality and official secrets to precede the Bill?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The legislation to which the Deputy refers is for next year. The issue of advance proposals is one that should be addressed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children indicated that he expected the three major reports on our health service will be published during this session. Given the deepening crisis in our health service, will the Tánaiste give an undertaking today that there will be a debate immediately following the publication of those reports in this session? We must consider the serious issues which have arisen and the way forward. Clearly, the Minister for Health and Children has lost his way and needs some help.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	109	That matter might well be discussed by the Whips.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I am sure the Tánaiste would like to give an undertaking. As I understand it, the Whips do not determine this. It is a matter  for the Government and I ask the Tánaiste to give that undertaking—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Sorry, Deputy—
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Is the Tánaiste going to stay silent?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I must be in order, like the Deputy.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	114	When it suits the Tánaiste.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Hopefully, it is all the time.Obviously it would be desirable to discuss those reports shortly after they are published and the Deputy can take it that that will be the view of the Government.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	116	The Minister for Transport is preventing Dublin Bus from improving by bringing in new services in rapidly expanding areas like Blanchardstown. He cites the introduction of competition down the line. At the same time the transport reform Bill and the transport (companies) Bill are not scheduled for publication until 2004. Are our hard-pressed commuters to wait another full year—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	117	A question appropriate to the Order of Business, Deputy.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	118	It is very appropriate because I am asking about legislation. We know the Minister was not responsible for the missing brandy and cigars but he is responsible for the missing buses on crucial routes. When will the legislation be brought in and what will be done in the meantime, while the Minister's Thatcherite plans on privatisation are being hatched?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Deputy knows we are all fans of competition; look at the wonderful competition he provides here. The Bills are scheduled for next year.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	120	Some of the issues I wanted to raise have been addressed already, including the Bills mentioned by Deputy Higgins. I thought that Bill had stalled or been gridlocked.What is the current status of the drug offenders Bill? Also, the air navigation Eurocontrol Bill relates to a 1997 agreement and it must be time to get that off the ground. Another perennial is the ground rent Bill. All of these are Bills of long standing with a great deal of promise, although they are short on delivery.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The air navigation Eurocontrol Bill is due later this year but I do not have dates for the other two.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	122	One of them is there since 1997.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Last year the Taoiseach told us the heads of the housing (private rented sector)  Bill were approved by the Government at the beginning of 2002. All last year until 16 April 2003, when the Tánaiste told the House that that Bill would be published during the recess, a housing (private rented sector) Bill was promised by the Government. There is now a residential tenancies Bill on the list. Are the heads of that Bill the same heads as those of the housing (private rented sector) Bill approved at the beginning of 2002?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Yes, it is the same legislation and will be published this session. There is a change in the Bill title but the heads are the same.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The intoxicating liquor Bill has been prioritised again and the President has remarked at home and abroad on the need to do something about it. Are we definitely going to see the Bill this session? Will the Tánaiste tell the House why it is coupled with an amendment to the Equal Status Act 2000? The view abroad is that that is intended to take away the protections in that legislation in terms of admission to licensed premises from certain minorities who feel they would be discriminated by it. Is that the intention?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	126	As I said earlier, it will be published this session. I understand there will be changes to the Equal Status Act in light of experience and implementation of that Act. The detail of the Bill is a matter to be discussed in another fora.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I cannot go home for the weekend without again stating that the ADM workers have not received any money for nine weeks. I plead with the Tánaiste to intervene with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this regard.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Deputy will have to find another way of raising that matter. There are many opportunities open to her to do so, the Adjournment debate or parliamentary questions.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	129	It is a valid question.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I am sure the Tánaiste is not cold to their plight.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I asked on a number of occasions in the last session about the current position of the prison service Bill. I was told in the first instance that the Bill was on its fourth draft and I was later told there had been no progress on that draft. There is no indication in current published legislation of a date for publication. Given the disgraceful structure of prison visiting committees and the situation in our prisons, will the Tánaiste explain what is the delay in producing this necessary reforming legislation which affects human rights?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Half of Cahirciveen would go on the dole.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I cannot give a date for when the Prison Service will be established as an independent body. Work in that regard is ongoing in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	134	What does that mean?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I do not have a date and I cannot give the Deputy something I do not have.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	136	Is the Bill in its fifth, sixth, seventh or eighth draft? Will it happen in the Tánaiste's lifetime?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	137	I am sure that like me Deputy Higgins wishes to live a long time.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I was struck by the remarks made by Deputy Martin Brady last night in relation to micro-managing hospitals. Deputy Brady is not here this morning following his massive efforts last night.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Very perceptive.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I do not know who writes the scripts. When are we likely to see the medical practitioners Bill. Deputy Brady said the Minister for Health and Children would have difficulty with micro-managing hospitals.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I have nothing to do with it.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I move:That the proposal that Dáil Éireann approve the draft Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 29 November 2000, be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service in accordance with paragraph (2) of the Orders of Reference of that committee, which, not later than 3 July 2003, shall send a message to the Dáil in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 85, and Standing Order 84(2) shall accordingly apply.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I wish to share time with Deputies Michael Moynihan, Brendan Smith, Moloney, O'Connor and Kelleher.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	147	Is that agreed? Agreed.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Fine Gael motion on SARS. Before dealing with the substance of the Opposition motion, it is critically important that we put the SARS issue into proper context and perspective.The portrayal of SARS and the SARS epidemic by not alone the Opposition but certain sections of the media has been wholly disproportionate to the threat which SARS poses to this country. This is not to downplay for one moment the significance of SARS as a worldwide health threat. Indeed, it poses such a threat in the Far East. In terms of Irish public health, it does not pose the level of threat portrayed by the Opposition. Let us look at the facts.The SARS phenomenon is a peculiarly south-east Asia phenomenon although there was an outbreak in Canada. In a population of more than  three billion people the disease has been contracted by fewer than 6,500 people. There have been 450 deaths. During that period, tens of thousands of people have died from other communicable diseases such as AIDS and malaria. In the European Union, with a population of more than 300 million people, there has been less than 30 probable cases. There has not been one single death from SARS in the European Union. In Ireland, there has been one probable case and no deaths. Yet, in the face of all these facts some would have us believe that the black plague and Ebola type virus and judgment day is upon us.Before we debate the substance of the Opposition motion or the merits of the Minister's response we have to have some degree of perspective. The Minister's response has been proportionate, timely and effective. Let us look at the timing of the response. The outbreak was formally notified to the health authorities on 16 March, less than two months ago. Within days of that notification, the National Disease Surveillance Centre issued protocols and a warning to all hospitals and health professionals. This was the appropriate response given the circumstances of the situation facing us. Some people would have had us close all our airports and ports and adopt foot and mouth like measures appropriate in that case but not in this one.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Health was not high on the agenda.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	150	The appropriate course of action was to disseminate information to hospitals, health boards and health professions. They are the people charged with dealing with this issue and are the ones who required the information in the first instance. Within days of that immediate response and within ten days of the first notification, an expert group was established to monitor the situation and to make ongoing recommendations. That group has met more than 17 times on a twice weekly basis. This response, before one case of reported or suspected SARS in this country, showed the appropriate degree of urgency required in the circumstances.The recommendations of the expert group have been speedily and effectively implemented by the Government and health boards. It is important to point out that the Government has been wholly and completely supported by the World Health Organisation in each and every action taken by it. That includes measures such as protocols, guidance for laboratories, the appropriate travel advice and public advertisements. All this points to one inevitable conclusion: the Government and ministerial response has been proportionate to the threat posed, timely in its response and effective in its results. For the Opposition to suggest otherwise flies in the face of the facts. All this was done in the context of the very difficult circumstances posed by the public health doctors strike which did not help mat ters. It is extremely unfortunate and regrettable to link the public health doctors industrial dispute with the SARS issue. That strike, like any other in the public service, particularly in the health services, is a source of concern. However, the fact that this dispute coincides with the evolving issue concerning SARS should not be used as political ammunition by the Opposition.I fully support the Minister's contention that the public health doctors strike and the industrial relations issues which arise from it should be dealt with on their merits and on the basis of the benchmarking report and Sustaining Progress. While I do not wish to go into issues concerned with the public health doctors strike, it is important, for the reasons I have explained, to say that the offer on the table taken with benchmarking and Sustaining Progress represents an extremely substantial offer to the doctors and should, in my view, form the basis of further negotiations and utilisation of the industrial relations machinery.Despite some of the hyperbole and exaggeration and, indeed, the invective, not alone by the Opposition but also in certain sections of the media, all the facts point to the Minister's response being proportionate to the threat raised, timely and effective in its outcome.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and in the brief time available to me I will deal with two or three issues related to the SARS epidemic and the hysteria created regarding SARS a couple of weeks ago. Everybody, including politicians and the media, has an obligation to ensure that the cases they are reporting or the issues they are putting before the people are not hyped out of all proportion. Certainly there were one or two days on which, if one was listening to the media, one would have thought we would be besieged by SARS within a matter of minutes. All of us, particularly those of us in the public eye, have an obligation to ensure we bring forward a measured response to it.I welcome what the Minister has done in setting up the expert committee, and issuing various press releases and press briefings it has given. It has interpreted the guidelines given by the World Health Organisation on the SARS epidemic and leaflets and the information have been given out at airports and points of entry. A pile of information has been put out there. There was a public deficit of information and, as the previous speaker stated, this is a SARS epidemic, not in a European context but in an Asian context and we should be mindful of that.One of the other issues I want to deal with this morning is the impact on the Special Olympics, on which some towns have taken different positions. I know, first hand, the amount of work which has been put in by the Special Olympics committee, by the organising committees and by all those background staff. They have put in enormous work to ensure the success of the Special  Olympics in 2003. This is a massive opportunity for Ireland to show what we can do for the Special Olympics and what we can do in sports. All the host towns right around the country have had committees working throughout the past 12 months to ensure that the visitors who will come to participate in Special Olympics get the royal treatment they so richly deserve. While we have to be mindful of public health and of the threat of SARS to the health of the nation, we must wait until at least two to three weeks before the Special Olympics commence before we take a decision on going ahead with the games or on stopping certain countries participating. The Minister and the various committees set up will be mindful of all the trojan work which has been done in getting the Special Olympics here.There are several Departments working on the special committee which has been set up to co-ordinate the measures regarding public policy and the protection of public health. The information in the public arena at this stage is far greater than it was on 18 March or in February when the first threat of SARS arose, when few people thought it had any implications for this country. There have been parallels drawn with the foot and mouth disease crisis. The reality is that when we ensured that foot and mouth disease was kept out of this country, we all said, "Oh yes, they made the correct decisions at the time, it was great."  At the time of the hysteria about foot and mouth disease, however, there was as much concern and it is definitely not fair when the Opposition stated that animal health was given a higher priority than human health. This Government, and particularly the Minister in recent weeks, have done ferocious work and made great efforts to ensure that the safety and health of the individual is put to the top of the agenda. I commend the Minister for that. The information which is being co-ordinated and put before the people has to be welcomed in this instance.On the hysteria which was created, we public representatives and the media have a duty not to overstate the concerns facing the public. I appeal to the Minister, to the Government and to all the host towns to ensure that taken into account in whatever decisions are taken regarding the Special Olympics is the trojan work which has been done by the committees throughout the length and breadth of the country on this. I commend the Minister and the Government for setting up the committee to advise the people on the public health threat.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important subject matter. First, I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Ministers of State in his Department and their departmental officials on the work they have done in the past six weeks or so in ensuring that there was an active campaign to prevent the spread of this serious illness to this country. I am  glad the Minister outlined last night in his contribution that the World Health Organisation fully endorsed the measures which have been put in place in this country to prevent the establishment of the disease here and to prevent its spread. At European level, we can be fairly confident and assured that, fortunately, there have been no deaths from this illness throughout the European Union. The Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, mentioned on a radio programme the other night that the spread of this disease throughout Asia, in particular, and the measures taken to prevent its spread to Europe, show that there is a need for better co-ordination at European Union level on disease prevention measures in general and on the improvement of the public health systems.I agree with Deputy Moynihan that at times there was mass hysteria in the media and some of the chat shows on national radio, in particular, and on other radio stations were doing a great disservice to the public at large. I know many of the commentators in the national media assume on to themselves expertise on practically every subject under the sun, but I did not know they had gained expertise in SARS. There was much misinformed comment. At times it frightened people. In the area of public health, we public representatives or people who have access to the broadcast media or to the written media have a serious obligation to ensure that we speak in a knowledgeable fashion about any disease which poses a serious threat to public health.I am glad the Minister outlined the measures which have been put in place from early March by his Department and by his officials in ensuring that the various SARS issues would be addressed cogently and properly here. The Minister established the expert group and that expert group worked in collaboration with, and under the guidance of, the World Health Organisation. The first reference to this I saw on television was a reassurance for the public at large, where Mr. Sheehan of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital spoke with great authority and great expertise. He outlined the problems, and the measures being taken here and throughout Europe, to deal with and to prevent the spread of SARS. He imparted his knowledge in a manner which people with no medical or nursing knowledge could understand and he introduced a great sense of balance into the debate.I am glad the Minister stated last night that he will bring to Government proposals to reform the health services. As a small country with a small population, we have far too many health structures. The acute hospitals throughout all of the 26 counties should work under a hospitals agency. The remit of the health boards is far too wide. They must deal with acute hospitals, nursing homes for the elderly, community welfare problems and providing personnel such as occupational therapists and others to deal with the processing of housing grants and grants for the disabled. There is need to streamline the services and the work of the health boards. The area of  primary health care needs to be addressed and one issue which has been brought to my attention constantly, particularly by parents of young children, is the lack of access at times to GPs and to the primary health care sector after hours. In my area we have the "doctor on call" system, which has also been organised in other parts of the country. That is a positive system that works quite well. Doctors cannot work seven days a week and 24 hours a day as many were asked to do in the past. When the Ceann Comhairle was practising as a GP he did not have the opportunity to cease work at 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening. Working seven nights a week was surely good training for politics. Given that both parents are generally working, if GP practices were available until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening it would relieve some of the pressure on accident and emergency departments. While GPs should not have to work all hours of the day and night, a better balance can be struck which would assure the public of access to the health service.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on the issue of SARS and how it has been handled in recent weeks. I am forced to recognise it has been of great concern for members of the public, not least for those who will participate in the forthcoming Special Olympics.I was delighted to be able to attend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on 1 May. Those who attended heard the contribution of Dr. Jim O'Flanagan, the CMO at the Department of Health and Children, and his colleagues. I was pleased to hear the reassurances they gave, which were accepted. After hearing their contribution I was satisfied with the action taken by the Minister and officials at the Department of Health and Children.For reassurance purposes it is worth repeating the action that has been taken. When the existence and possible implications of this condition were first identified in March, at the request of the Minister staff from the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Department spent the St. Patrick's Day festival weekend making the appropriate international contacts and sought out the required information regarding SARS. They put in place the initial comprehensive public information professional guidance required in the State. That we have satisfied the guidelines of the WHO confirms the appropriate, considered and responsible action by the Minister.The Minister does not need me to come to the House to congratulate him on his ability as Minister for Health and Children. Nevertheless it is worth recognising that on receipt of the initial report following the St. Patrick's Day festival weekend, the Minister established an expert group under the chairmanship of Dr. O'Flanagan to advise him on the issue and to make recommendations as to the appropriate actions to prevent the establishment and spread of SARS.  At that juncture the Minister had the foresight to recognise what needed to be done and clearly the action was taken immediately to put the public mind at rest. The recommendations, which have been published on public notices and on the Department's website include: accurate well informed easily accessible readable information for the public; and sound practical preventive measures including such basics as washing of hands, identification, etc.Ignoring the condemnation in radio phone-ins, overall I am satisfied that the leading authority in health matters recognised that the Minister was to the forefront in making all the necessary arrangements to prevent the spread of SARS and more importantly to put the public mind at rest. If the public had been in the same room for the meeting on 1 May, they would have been reassured that the Minister and his officials were to the forefront.I wish the Minister well as he tries to tackle the issue of health reform. I flag one issue that will affect all public representatives and specifically Members of the Opposition who have called for health reform. When that health reform comes about and once it affects Members' vote gathering abilities in their constituencies, they will not sign up to that reform and will side with the public focus groups which will demand services in each county. I have experience of that over the years. I am well aware of the implications for public representatives when the cancer strategy was rolled out. Local public representatives were more concerned for their futures rather than for the future of the health service.Based on our experience of SARS and the whole health programme, we must learn that we cannot have health services at every crossroads and in every county. We must turn our backs on the day of flying the county flag and the ability of a public representative to be judged on what health services he can secure for his county.I wish the Minister well. He has given good sound leadership in the Department. He has a tough road ahead.

As he moves on gloriously as Minister for Health and Children, I beg him to ignore the pretence of those flying the county colours and ensure that what we have put into the programme for Government will be delivered on the ground. I am certain the way forward is to ensure that we have a regionalisation of services.I wish the Minister well. I am more than satisfied with the way he has handled the SARS issue. I am disappointed with those who have tried to use the SARS issue to create difficulties for the Minister, but he has proved his ability and mettle. I look forward to his continuous reign in the Department of Health and Children for the next four years.

I heard the leader of the Labour Party suggest that Charlie O'Connor needs a little therapy because of certain Government policies. As all my colleagues know, I am fit and well, very calm and happy to support the Minister this morning.  Both in the debate here in the past two days and elsewhere I am worried by the hysteria, which upsets people. I ask my colleagues to be a little calmer, do as I do, represent their communities and do not panic because this is an important issue.People often refer to war-time. Let us get behind the Minister on this issue.

I would probably do the same myself – although a little more responsibly. Let us get behind the Minister and understand he has a tough job to do. It is in all our interests that that job is done. Like my colleagues, I have much contact in my constituency and in my local hospital at Tallaght. I am very pleased with the assurances I am being given by the senior consultants at Tallaght Hospital who have made clear that in a situation where they would have difficulties, they are in a strong position to respond.I wish to use the example of Tallaght Hospital to make a point about the rest of the country. The winter vomiting bug has been a problem in a number of hospitals in recent years yet strangely there have not been any problems in Tallaght Hospital, nor indeed in St. James's Hospital. The reason for this is that a modern infrastructure exists in these hospitals.I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in the House and urge him to take this lesson on board. If we provide a new and proper infrastructure and sufficient single isolation wards in our hospitals then the professionals who are dealing with infection can respond in the proper manner. Both Tallaght and St. James's hospitals have shown the way. When Cherry Orchard Hospital was closed as an infection hospital, provision should have been made, and should still be made, to provide more single room accommodation in all hospitals. That is true in Dublin and elsewhere and that is the message we should put out.Like other Members I have a background of involvement in a health board. I am privileged to have been a member of a health board since 1994. I took a decision to step down from it and let other colleagues get involved. I look forward to the proper reform of the health service. The announcement being prepared by the Minister is something we should welcome.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. I urge everybody involved in the Special Olympics to heed the advice of the Department with regard to bringing athletes here from around the world. While it may be necessary to have a voluntary quarantine system in some countries prior to the arrival of participants, every effort should be made to ensure that the Special Olympics goes ahead and that resources are made  available to ensure it is a successful event. There is no doubt that there has been a great effort put in by the athletes who have been in training for many years and by the communities here who are hosting the various participant countries. I urge everybody to have a calm, rational debate on this issue.SARS is severe acute respiratory syndrome but in this country it is sensationalist, alarmist reporting syndrome because that is what we have had for the past number of weeks. Certain elements of the media and the Opposition have been most disingenuous in trying to hype this out of all proportion. This has happened to such an extent that people in the Chinese community have reported a drop in trade in restaurants because of the extreme fears that have been generated by irresponsible reporting. There is no doubt it is a highly contagious, infectious disease of unknown origins. At the outset people were justified in having major concerns but I have confidence in the mechanisms that have been put in place. Some elements of the media have realised that we were not as at risk as was thought heretofore. I commend the Minister and the Department for trying to fight a rearguard action because of the sensationalist and alarmist reporting by certain sections of the media. They were eventually able to reassure the public. The Minister made some decisions back in March when nobody knew of SARS. It shows that he and his staff were on top of their briefs. I again commend the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is present.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	173	There are some who believe that SARS is a load of hype and that those of us who have expressed concern are being alarmist and hysterical. The contributions from Deputies Power, O'Connor and Kelleher would seem to indicate this. Although we, on the Opposition side, have been branded in those terms, the charge is not warranted. If we look at the facts relating to SARS we know now that the virus is both stronger and more contagious than previously thought. The mortality rates are higher; they have gone up from around 10% to 20%. There is no definitive test for SARS. It affects people in different ways. Obviously the most vulnerable are those over 60 but one of the first victims was a healthy 46 year old – the doctor who discovered the virus. Why did it affect that particular individual who was very healthy?The greatest alarm has been caused by the statements made – and I do not think they were alarmist – by some of the Chinese leaders who now believe that once it gets into the countryside in China we will have a serious problem because they simply cannot cope in those areas. Furthermore, those in the WHO believe that once it gets into Africa we will have a real epidemic. We have seen the problems in regard to AIDS in Africa. I was in Johannesburg last summer and it is a mass ive problem which is out of all control at this stage. That is not being alarmist. Those are the facts. Once SARS gets into the African continent we are looking at a serious problem because of cheap air travel and new immigration patterns. The globalised world we live in will mean SARS will spread quickly.I called on the Taoiseach to recall the Dáil as I wanted to ask questions of the Minister. I wanted the Minister to come to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to answer questions and I put down priority questions to the Minister on this issue. Those questions were not allowed. We will not get an opportunity to ask questions of the Minister even in this debate which is all about statements. That is most regrettable because, as Deputies, we need to reassert the primacy of politics. If we cannot have accountability here – and I put a lot of the blame on the Government parties on this one – they are making this House irrelevant as a consequence.I said at the health committee that there was a mixed message in regard to the SARS case here which led to the perception of bungling. We were told that the test was negative yet it was put forward as a probable case. As Darina O'Flanagan said, there is no definitive test, which means we are very much in the dark about SARS. Dr. Kiely came before the health committee and said that the infectious disease regulations had been changed on 28 March and SARS was now a notifiable disease. However, when Dr. O'Flanagan came before us she said:There is an urgent need for a structured out-of-hours public health service to manage SARS. The legislation allowing for quarantine and other public health measures needs to be reviewed, including designating suitable facilities for quarantine. There is also a need for a formal review of the requirements for isolation beds to deal with SARS and other emerging infectious diseases. A cascade system for rapid dissemination of advice to health care professionals is required.Does the Government have any plans to update the legislation and for the current legislation to be reviewed? I ask the Minister of State to note it as I would like a reply to this question.I reject the allegation that the IMO and the public health doctors are being opportunistic. The Brennan review was agreed and signed off by both the Department of Health and Children and the chief executive officers in April 2002. The review group was of the view that there was a need for a formally structured out-of-hours cover arrangement. What Dr. Fenton Howell said needs to be looked at. There is currently no safe way to deal with SARS. There is no out-of-hours structure which is what is required. We were told that this was hampering the way we are dealing with SARS. It is absolutely vital that we deal with it.

No matter how one defines the word "crisis" they cannot deny that there is a massive crisis of confidence among the public in the capacity of the Government and, indeed, of the State, to deliver and provide for the health needs of our people. That is a fact. The responsibility for that lies, in the first instance, certainly in recent years, on this Fianna Fáil – Progressive Democrats Government which, since 1997, has failed miserably to grasp the nettle of real and fundamental reform of the health services in this State and to ensure that we have a health service based on equality and fairness. That is what we critically need. It is no wonder there is a crisis of confidence, therefore, in the entire political system. That is evident in every walk of life today when health services, such a fundamental need of every human being, are in such a state at present. In recent days, there has been an announcement of the further closure of 250 beds in the five teaching hospitals in Dublin.Twelve months ago, this Government went before the electorate promising to do away with waiting lists within two years. However, we now have a situation in which waiting lists are going to increase as an inevitable consequence of the closing down of hospital beds. This morning, we learned that another ward of 25 beds is about to close at this country's major children's hospital in Crumlin. As a result, there will be catastrophic effects on children from Dublin and all over this jurisdiction. Some 2,000 fewer procedures will be performed in regard to the surgical needs of children in this State as a consequence of that decision. That is the information we have this morning from doctors at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin. This is an outrage. This is the backdrop also to the closure of essential services in hospitals such as in Monaghan and Dundalk, an issue which I have raised in this House time and time again. That is now being employed as a template for further contraction and closure of essential services in other hospitals around the country. Is it any wonder people are concerned to see our health services in such a state? We have seen the public reaction to the advent of SARS, which cannot be viewed in isolation from all the other elements to which I have referred. All of these matters must be seen in context.This Fine Gael motion, which I support, was prompted by the initial mishandling of the threat of SARS, which has compounded the crisis of confidence in the capacity of this Government to deliver on health. In my view, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has completely failed to reassure the public that effective measures were in place to prevent the spread of this disease in Ireland if, indeed, it were to have any grip here. Now, it has arrived – we know that – we must take on board the statement by the GPs that the guidelines issued by the National Disease Control Centre were unclear. We must  note that, in the Seanad, the Minister admitted that the World Health Organisation guidelines were breached in regard to a suspected case of SARS here in Dublin. Although he subsequently stated that the patient in question had been given the all-clear, we now know that was not the case. At the very time of that public reassurance, when the Minister was trying to assuage the fears of the people of this country, the SARS threat became mired in confusion and in the bureaucracy which abounds in our health service.

Clearly, from the beginning, there was a lack of control. That is the real concern. People recognised that point. This is not about creating political capital out of real concern and fear. This is about seeking real address of something that may yet prove to have tragic consequences, not only for people in other distant lands but, indeed, here at home.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. Despite the promises made in relation to SARS precautions, I have not yet received a supply of surgical masks in my surgery at Mulranny, County Mayo. The present situation is that Government policy is actually deciding whether people live or die. That is the reality. As the Government is not providing enough money to run the services, there will be less services and people will not have access to them. A recently leaked report has indicated that Waterford cannot have a local radiotherapy unit and that cancer patients must come to Dublin for that service. With the latest cut-backs, there will now be less beds for those people. Where will they get the required treatment, in view of existing deficiencies? The bottom line is that Government is deciding whether people live or die.All of us have been elected to do what we can for people. We are told it is all about people, but is that really the case? It seems to be more about big party politics, money and so on. Is it not time to take the big parties out of the picture? Talk of political consensus is used to exclude me and my fellow Independents. However, in the last election, the people said they will no longer stand for that. They are no longer interested in big parties or big interests; they are interested in their real needs, of which health is the greatest need of all. Health budgets are a life and death issue, in terms of their implications for people on trolleys in hospitals, a situation which continues to deteriorate. Is it not time to take health budgets out of the hands of Government and political parties and, instead, deal with the matter on the basis of a political consensus? My question may sound naive, but I believe such a change is necessary to avoid a continuation of the present situation.The SARS issue simply exposed the problem that there was no out-of-hours public health ser vice. The current strike would not have occurred if the real situation which has pertained for years had been addressed. Fever hospitals have been closed in my county, Mayo, and in Cherry Orchard, Dublin. Cases of gastro-enteritis, measles and bacterial meningitis are unnecessarily infecting other people, in the absence of proper provision. We are wide open to infection. This should not be the case. There has been a gross proliferation of bureaucracy, all because of party political hackery. Our health boards are full of party political opportunism. That is how our health service is being run and it is wrong.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	178	Not surprisingly, the Minister for Agriculture and Food could not answer my specific questions on maternity and accident and emergency services at Wexford General Hospital during the Adjournment debate last night. Accordingly, I now seek detailed answers to those questions from the Minister for Health and Children. Will he clarify whether all accident and emergency departments which do not have a specific A&E consultant could be closed on 1 July? What steps is the Department taking to deal with this issue? Alternatively, we will have to draw our own conclusions as to what will happen.In relation to the motion before the House, there is a fine line between public information and scaremongering. In the context of contagious diseases, SARS is low risk at the moment. Measles is currently causing more harm in Ireland, due to low immunisation rates, which is an ongoing problem. SARS will, eventually, arrive in Ireland and we must have an effective containment response in keeping with the threat posed. There has been a certain lack of clarity on this issue. That could, perhaps, explain the recent behaviour of local councillors in Clonmel, which reminds me of a recent film in relation to the Salem witch hunts of two centuries ago. The less said about that type of mass hysteria, the better for everybody, including the general public. There is plenty of time for a measured response to the issue in relation to the Special Olympics and SARS. In my view, the anxiety of the general public and the media in relation to SARS, is based on the present very real crisis in the health services.

In the case of this Government, the situation appears to be that politicians are indifferent as patients die. I ask the Minister of State to respond to the questions I posed during the debate last night as soon as possible. I ask the Taoiseach to put party politics aside and support the last demand of this motion which would alleviate media, public and Opposition concerns about the health service. We are not  getting clear information. Yesterday when we discussed this matter during Question Time, the Minister broached the subject by saying that he would make available the reports he is due to receive. I look forward to reading them because they may help to clarify matters for all of us.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	181	All we have heard from the Government benches this morning is a strategy of blaming the media and the Opposition. The fact is, however, that there is very serious concern not just about SARS but also about the entire health service, which is suffering from a crisis of public confidence. That crisis of confidence has affected the SARS issue. Incompetent handling of the suspected SARS case in Dublin has done serious damage to the public perception of how SARS is being dealt with. The suspected SARS case was variously described as "negative", "suspect" or "probable", while the patient was missing for a number of hours also. The totally incompetent handling of that case has raised serious doubts in the public mind as regards how the issue is being dealt with by the Minister and his Department.Yesterday we learned that the mortality rate from this illness, far from being 7% or 8%, is approximately 20%, particularly among older people. That is further cause for concern, with the fact that SARS is much more contagious than had been thought previously.The crisis of public confidence in the health service is continuing with patients on trolleys and public hospitals in Dublin having announced approximately 250 bed closures. In addition, the Government has refused to install a radiotherapy unit in Waterford Regional Hospital for the south-east region and it has reneged on its election promise to issue 200,000 extra medical cards. There is a direct threat to our accident and emergency units and maternity departments and, apparently, we will see the relevant reports during the current session.The manner in which the health service has been managed by the Minister and his Department provides serious cause for public concern as regards health services generally and SARS in particular. In addition, an out-of-hours public health service is totally lacking.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to contribute to this motion on the SARS threat and the urgent need for radical reform of our health services. We must face the reality that if one wants a decent health service, one will have to invest in it – to pretend otherwise is to do nothing for patients. We are aware of the problems and many members of the public are sick to the teeth with all the reports and talk of health strategies. They want action and leadership, which is urgently needed from the top.In the middle of a public health crisis concerning SARS, the last thing we want is a Minister who cannot handle industrial relations problems with public health doctors. We need leadership  and confidence but the Government has provided neither. It is a scandal for any Government to be shutting down wards, including 104 beds in the Mater Hospital recently. We have a health crisis, yet the Government is shutting down hospital bed capacity. There is something radically wrong with a Government that fails to provide funding for hospitals when people are ill, but there is something equally wrong with a society that allows this to happen. Irish society is now at a crossroads and faces a clear choice: we can go down the selfish road of tax breaks and tax cuts or we can invest in public services. This is the real world and we have a choice to make.Sections of the Government seem to gloat in the idea of pushing the cutbacks agenda. The political and economic views of George Bush appear to be rampant in our Cabinet. In my own constituency of Dublin North Central I have seen proposals to reduce meals-on-wheels services by 14%, while the home carer's service has been cut by 9%. We can spend €100,000 to lock up a young person in Mountjoy, while we invest only €15,200 on a child's primary education. These are the ethics and values in contemporary Ireland. We seem to be walking away from the noble goal of a just society. We are turning our backs on our own people and are going in a direction that is repugnant to the vast majority. Meanwhile, Ministers are touring the country giving lectures on the state of the nation.We must be vigilant about SARS but we should never make scapegoats of people with disabilities, including those who will be participating in the Special Olympics. We should have a clear public health policy but it must always be implemented with equality and fairness. Informed decisions represent the name of the game. I fully support the public health doctors' efforts to get a fair wage for providing 24-hour cover, seven days a week. The Minister should roll up his sleeves and resolve this dispute. The Cabinet should back him and stop playing these silly games. I urge all Deputies to support the motion.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Yesterday, in response to our analysis of the health situation, the Minister said that talk was cheap. However, should I repeat the Minister's words to an 80 year old lady in my constituency who needs oxygen around the clock? She also needs home help and had such help for 17 hours a day, but due to the North-Eastern Health Board's cutbacks that allocation was reduced by seven hours. Following a protest, four hours were restored. Is it right to tell that lady that talk is cheap or that her case does not count for the Minister? Is that the way to treat the sick and elderly in the north-eastern region or, indeed, anywhere in the country?The budget for the North-Eastern Health Board's service plan was rejected by members of that health board, yet the Minister's signature is on a document insisting that the strategy should stand. The impact is clear – 85,000 hours of home help have been cut from the health board's  budget this year. That represents 85,000 fewer hours of caring for the sick and elderly who cannot help themselves. The cutbacks will affect hundreds of people who need care, including home help. Talk is cheap to them because there has been no action by the Minister. All they get is more pain, suffering, isolation and no concern for their future.Incontinence pads are being rationed in the North-Eastern Health Board area. One lady has been informed that the board is going to cut back on the amount of such pads to be issued to those who require them, so will bowel movements be made to order now? Talk is cheap but such decisions are breaking people's hearts as well as the carers who look after them. As the Minister knows, home carers are active for much longer than just the hours for which they are paid. They provide care and concern far beyond the hours which are now being cut. The cutbacks are placing carers in an invidious position because their income is being cut, yet their primary concern is to care for the sick and elderly.The Minister's administration of the country's health services is both shameful and disgraceful. His budgetary approach is based on the existing level of services as of 1 January 2002 but he has forgotten the promises that were made in the run-up to last year's general election. Many of the services got into difficulties last year, but the Minister provided extra funding to the home help service in the North-Eastern Health Board area. The funding provided for 2003, however, was based on the amount provided at the start of 2002 rather than the amount that had been provided by the end of that year. This shameful cutback relates to very important matters.I bring to the attention of the Minister the case of a gentlemen whose wife has had a stroke. She is in a bed in an acute hospital that needs the bed for other patients, but she cannot go home. The adjustments to her house that are needed cannot be made because the Government has not provided funding for the disabled person's grant. Her bathroom needs to be adjusted so that it can be wheelchair accessible, a downstairs room needs to be converted into a bedroom and a carpet needs to be replaced by new flooring that can bear the weight of a hoist that needs to be installed. The Minister has said that "talk is cheap", but what do his words mean to her? The Government has not taken action on this issue.Since January of this year, 90 applications for the disabled person's grant have been approved by the North-Eastern Health Board in relation to County Louth. The grant is needed to bring sick people home and to provide better facilities, such as downstairs toilets and heating, for those who are unwell and living at home. That no money has been granted by the Government for the disabled person's grant is causing untold pain and suffering across the country.I also bring to the attention of the Minister the case of a man whose wife is at home, having had  a stroke. She cannot benefit from the disabled person's grant. The toilet and the bedroom are upstairs and she needs to be carried up the stairs each night, but her husband is not always able to do so. He telephones me about the issue when he is exhausted in the mornings. When I contact the health board to ask the officials what is happening in this case, they tell me that money is not available to look after the lady in question. The matter has been examined by the health board, which has determined that extra facilities are needed. Such cases are replicated in thousands of homes across the country. This shame reflects on the Minister's administration and his comment yesterday that "language is cheap". His remarks are cheap because they are doing absolutely nothing for these people. That is what is wrong.I spoke about the health board cutbacks of about €1 million in the home help system, but can I provide another figure? More than €250,000 has been spent on taxi fares relating to acute hospitals in counties Louth and Meath, money which should have been spent on other services, such as the disabled person's grant. I do not doubt that taxis are essential for elderly persons or those with no transport late at night, but the Department of Health and Children needs to examine whether it is getting value for money. Talk is cheap, but the Minister should ensure that he is getting value for the money he is spending. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed.I will give another example, which relates to nursing home care. People's access to the nursing home of their choice is being restricted on a month by month basis. Subventions are not available to those in acute hospital beds if the quota for that month has been exceeded by the health board, which means that such people cannot leave hospital to go to a nursing home for which they are prepared to pay. It would be cheaper for the Minister if they could do so, as they would not use up an acute hospital bed. They cannot go home because they cannot adjust their homes as a consequence of the shortfall in the disabled person's grant scheme. It is a shameful and disgraceful situation.Another issue relating to nursing home care has been brought to my attention by the members of the Irish association of nursing home owners, whom I met a week ago. They told me that health board officials in some parts of the country are going into private nursing homes to bring patients to the board's hospitals. That may be fine for some patients, but it is unacceptable to take people out of a nursing home, away from a community and the care they are receiving there, if they have happily lived in it and been fully subvented by the health board for four or five years. The Minister needs to look at that situation. The health boards are trying to save money where they can, but the Minister is not providing the money they need. As I have said, last year's budget was supplemented during the year. The level of services being provided at the end of 2002  should have been the starting point for 2003. The Minister's actions are completely wrong and shameful.I also bring to the Minister's attention an issue I have raised many times. I refer to the quality of care in nursing homes and the health boards' inspections of nursing home care. I stress that 90% or 95% of nursing homes are excellent. This talk is cheap because I am talking about something the Minister can actually do. He can insist that health boards place on their websites reports about nursing homes that have been compiled by officials. Such a measure would ensure that the excellent quality of care would be transparent and made available in the 95% of cases I have mentioned and that details of the 5% of nursing homes that do not provide good care would also be accessible. Officials from the health boards can tell the Minister that the care provided is disgraceful in some cases. People will not avail of nursing homes that provide inadequate care. This is a cheap, simple and easy thing for the Minister to do.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	186	It is appropriate that we should discuss this problem in the House today. It is unfortunate that speakers on the Government benches have criticised my party for putting down this motion, as it would have been negligent of Deputy Olivia Mitchell and Fine Gael not to have discussed health issues, particularly SARS. Nobody needs to be reminded that there are major problems in the health service. Those who are trying to avail of it are particularly aware of the difficulties. It is important that such problems are continually raised in this House as long as they remain, if that is what is needed to achieve a resolution.It is obvious that the criticism being aimed at the Minister for Health and Children relates to the initial handling of the SARS crisis. A certain impression was created when people encountered news reports of the epidemic, even if its import may have been exaggerated by the media, which needs to sell its stories. The impression among the general public was that nobody was in charge. People do not just look at the national media, as CNN and Sky News are quite popular here. The world has become a very small place and people can receive information from all parts of the world. Their opinions are influenced when they see people affected by SARS throughout the world. I saw this morning on CNN, I think, that the first case of SARS has been reported in Russia. The syndrome is spreading to many countries and it seems inevitable that there will be a case here, although I hope this will not happen. If the  proper procedures are not in place and people do not have confidence in the measures that are being taken, there will be mayhem and a further loss of confidence. It is very important that people can have confidence in the Minister's stewardship of the health service and this crisis.This year's staging of the Special Olympics will represent the first occasion on which it has been held outside the United States. As it will be the biggest event ever to be staged by Ireland, it is very important that it should go ahead. Similarly, it is important that all necessary precautions are taken to ensure that people coming here are free of SARS and that quarantine facilities are put in place if they are required by athletes and their family members from the infected countries.We should be as vigilant about the SARS aspect of the Special Olympics as about the other preparatory work, which has been excellent and one of the greatest examples of what this country can do regarding the organisation of a major event. However, SARS is an aspect of that event which worries people. While it is easy to criticise the people of Clonmel and say they jumped the gun or were hysterical, they were concerned and people have a right to be concerned. There is no point in Members coming to this House to criticise people for being concerned about their health. We must do something about the problem and ensure that the necessary precautions are put in place so that we could cope with a crisis if it arose.The criticism of the Minister with regard to the handling of SARS is linked to the wider issue of the health services, and I am sure the Minister accepts that. I have referred several times in the House to the situation in County Kerry. I realise that Deputies have referred to their home bases and I take this opportunity to raise what is happening in my county regarding the health services. Despite assurances from the Minister for Health and Children, other Ministers and local representatives before and since the last election that there would be no closures in Tralee, the hospital is now faced with the closure of a ward containing 30 beds from June to August. That is the busiest time of the year in Kerry, when the population doubles and accident and emergency services are put under particular pressure.As a result of the closure, there will be no elective admissions despite the hospital having one of the longest waiting lists in Kerry for out-patient admissions. Procedures for gall stones and hernia operations will not take place for three months, except in emergency cases. It is unfair that the people of County Kerry should be subjected to this type of treatment. Bed closures in Dublin are a major concern but there are closures all over the country. The people of Kerry are getting the rough end of the stick in regard to medical care in the Southern Health Board region. The Minister looks after his own city and county well but County Kerry is not getting a fair deal.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I compliment Deputy Olivia Mitchell for bringing this matter before the House. I am delighted that SARS is being debated. From the day the motion was put forward, there was some small bit of action from the Department of Health and Children. The Minister's handling of this issue, and that of his Department, was nothing short of disgraceful and it was only taken off the agenda over recent months by the war in Iraq. That was wrong. SARS is a serious disease. It is the first time since the period 1915-19 that the world has witnessed an uncontrollable disease. The consequences of foot and mouth disease and the precautions it necessitated were witnessed recently in this country. However, in this case, where people's health was at risk, no precautions were put in place. People were walking in and out of this country going to China and elsewhere and nothing was done until a couple of weeks later. That was wrong. The Government should have acted immediately this disease was notified to the World Health Organisation.With regard to the health services generally, I am surprised that the Minister has stuck with this Government despite the way it has hung him out to dry. If I was in the Minister's position, I would tell the Taoiseach to give me the resources to deal with the health services or I would resign.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	192	There is a new trend in the health services. People are being told that they are to be called the following week for their operations in the Mater, Beaumont or other hospitals, but they must telephone the hospital on the morning of the operation to make sure a bed is available. People are fasting and working themselves up for an operation but on the morning that they ring in to the hospital, no bed may be available. This discourages patients and upsets their families. There is no point in the Minister pretending this is not the case. People have telephoned in to find no beds available for the emergency operations they need.Despite that, the Minister lectures Fine Gael and the country that people should be doing more for themselves, particularly those who could keep family members at home to save the State money. The Minister says he has no responsibility for the health boards but he has. The issue of home helps is the greatest national scandal. I know of a man waiting for major stomach surgery who rang his  hospital last week to ask whether there was a bed available for him – there was no bed. The health board knows he needs an operation but it told this man that he cannot be given home help at this time. However, when he has his operation he can be given home help. He needs the home help now because he is sick. When he has surgery, he will need medical help and he will get that as well as assistance at home. He needs that help now also, not to be told when he rings the hospital that there is no bed available for his operation.The Minister should call in the chief executive of every health board and tell them that it is a Government priority and Government policy that money must be put into the home help service. The Government cannot say that it wants people to keep their families at home and then, when they make an effort, the State lets them down in terms of resources. For example, I recently spoke to a man who had been receiving 7.5 hours of home help per week. He got a telephone call from the health board yesterday and was told that that help was being taken away. That man needs medication daily and cannot cook or wash. He was getting some service from the health board until a health board official rang him to say that he can no longer have home help. What kind of society would do that? The Minister should tell the Taoiseach today to put in the necessary resources or he will be on his way to Cork.

The essential ingredients of that plan are as follows: a prompt and ongoing public information campaign alerting members of the public to the signs, symptoms, causes and transmission modes of SARS and travel advisories regarding travel to and from affected areas; detailed guidance provided to health professionals regarding the diagnosis, clinical management, surveillance and contact tracing for suspect and probable SARS cases, and to airline crew and cleaning staff regarding the possible in-flight care and follow-up procedures for a suspect case of SARS; and a comprehensive operational framework established to provide an integrated public service-wide response, comprising an expert committee to provide clinical advice and guidance regarding the management of the disease and other public health issues, an interde partmental planning group to co-ordinate cross-sectoral issues, a health service implementation group to ensure a prompt and integrated response at regional level, and a communications group to co-ordinate all communications relating to SARS, in particular, information to the public.Our plan is kept under constant review and is updated almost daily in light of information and guidance from the World Health Organisation. As the Minister pointed out to the House, experts from the WHO have endorsed the measures which we have put in place to prevent the establishment and spread of SARS in Ireland. However, SARS is a new and unpredictable condition and the outbreak continues in the most populous country on earth. This is a serious cause for concern and we cannot, therefore, become complacent. It is my Department's intention to continue with and indeed bolster our plans should that become necessary. We are determined to continue to draw upon the most up-to-date international and national information and expertise to inform our approach to this disease, collaborate with our European Union and World Health Organisation partner member states in the fight against SARS and to maintain a state of readiness to deal with the illness as it evolves.I now wish to turn to the strike by public health doctors, who are members of the Irish Medical Organisation. A national strike by any group of health care workers will always have implications for our health service. I wish to state again both on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government our serious concern at the national strike action by public health doctors in pursuit of a 30% pay claim.It should be noted that groups of staff at every level across the health system enter claims about a variety of issues related to their terms and conditions of employment. Such claims cannot be conceded simply because they have been demanded. I also wish to put on record that this claim has been lodged in relation to the current duties and responsibilities of these doctors and is separate to any pay increase that the Irish Medical Organisation has indicated it will demand for the implementation of changed working practices that may be required in the future.It is important to clarify again the background to the current dispute, especially in view of the ongoing variety of selective historical accounts that are being circulated.The regional public health function was established in 1994 with an agreement that a review would be undertaken within two years of the public health departments being established. This process took longer than expected. Consequently, the review began only in 1999, the Brennan report being published in April 2002. The IMO was an equal partner and co-owner of this review process. The HSEA and the Department of Health and Children accept the recommendations contained in the Brennan report. However, the report reflects the diverging views between the parties on the issue of consultant status for public  health doctors. The chairman's role was that of facilitator to the working party and not that of an arbitrator. His comments in relation to the status of directors and specialists were no more than a personal view and, as such, had not the status of a recommendation.The Brennan report acknowledged that there might be a need to revisit its recommendations following the implementation of proposed changes recommended by the health strategy and the primary care strategy. These changes, and the forthcoming reports on health service structures, will have significant implications for the future role of public health doctors and, as such, must be taken fully into account in any negotiations process.In 2002, the Public Service Benchmarking Body recommended increases of up to 14.2% for public health doctors based on their current duties and responsibilities. The benchmarking body acknowledged that it was not in a position to take account of the issues raised by the Brennan report in relation to the restructuring of public health service provision.Management has made an offer of 10.5% to the IMO. With benchmarking and the Sustaining Progress national agreement, the application of this increase would result in increases of up to €29,000 for public health doctors between now and 2005.Despite the HSEA asking the IMO to have all outstanding issues referred to the Labour Court, the IMO refused and began strike action on 14 April. This action has continued, despite management indicating its willingness to discuss the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Public Health Review Group, including the development of a structured out-of-hours system.I acknowledge that the professional input made by public health doctors to the management of infectious diseases and other public health threats is significant. I also believe that the response of the health system is hampered by the absence of their input. My Department and I have done and are doing all in our power to facilitate the resumption of negotiations on the outstanding issues.I again take the opportunity to appeal to the IMO to call off its industrial action and, in accordance with the terms of Sustaining Progress, to participate meaningfully in negotiations under the recognised industrial relations machinery with a view to having outstanding issues resolved as speedily as possible.With regard to the reform of the health system, the Minister last night outlined the three reports currently pending which will inform the formulation of a comprehensive reform programme for the health system. He indicated his intention, in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to propose an integrated reform programme to the Government, based on the findings and recommendations of these reports, in due course.

Many speakers in the debate concentrated on the Minister's ineptitude in handling the SARS threat but the Fine Gael sponsored motion is much broader than that. The motion also deals with the failure of the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Government to effectively manage our health service over the past number of years. That was a period of unprecedented prosperity yet there has been a serious deterioration in our health services.The Minister may continue to issue press releases stating that there is no problem but his PR people and his spin doctors are losing the battle. To quote Deputy Ring, if he paid the real doctors as much as he is paying his spin doctors we might have a better health service, with fewer people on waiting lists and lying on hospital trolleys. The Minister should put money into the services and dispense with his PR team because he and the Government are losing the PR battle.The editorials in every newspaper yesterday condemned the Government on its disastrous handling of our health services. They cannot all be wrong. An article yesterday in The Examiner stated that the sick are being told to endure the infirmaries and the electorate is being screwed by the most dishonest and disreputable Government this country has had to endure since the foundation of the State.Where now is the Government's health strategy, launched in technicolor before the general election?

The Taoiseach vowed that the strategy would deliver major improvements in the health service throughout the country. The Minister, Deputy Martin, said it would immediately benefit a substantial number of people. That was all before the election but, one year on, the health strategy has delivered nothing.One of the promises of 3,000 additional acute hospital beds is already gone. Instead, we have bed losses and ward closures in every hospital in the country. Another promise was to reduce waiting lists. There are no waiting lists figures available from the Department of Health and Children but a decision by the five Dublin hospitals to reduce patients by 14,000 this year will increase waiting lists. That is happening in other hospitals throughout the country also.The empty Government promises have done nothing to stop the decline of a terminally ill service. It was a con job before the election. Up to the time of the election it was spend, spend, spend but since the election it has been cut, cut, cut. I know what I am talking about and I will  give the Minister the figures from the health board with which I am most familiar, the Western Health Board.In June last year there was a deficit of €16.6 million. In other words, up to the time of the election the Western Health Board had to spend €16.6 million more than its budget. By the end of December, when the election was over, there was a saving of €24 million and the Western Health Board had a surplus of €8 million.That is a scandalous position. Was there collusion between the Minister and the executives of the health board or did they take it upon themselves to spend everything up to the time of the election, pretend everything was okay and then cut back after the election? That is what happened. How was there a saving of €24 million in the six months following the election? In the second half of the year, the budgets for mental health and services for older people was under-spent by €4 million. Community care was under-spent by €2 million. A total of €17 million was put into the corporate contingency fund. That €17 million was already cut from the community care, mental health and services for older people budgets, including housing grants for the elderly. What kind of accounting systems operate in the Western Health Board if there can be a deficit up to the election and a surplus of €8 million at the end of the year?As there was a surplus of €8 million in the Western Health Board, the Department made provision for a further €2 million but a reply to a Dáil question stated that given the financial pressures elsewhere in the system and the projected outturn for the board, it was considered appropriate to stick to the original budget. In other words, the Western Health Board, as a result of its bad bookkeeping, lost a further €2 million. Will the Minister wake up to what is happening in health boards throughout the country?One cannot get respite care for the elderly or a home help for a few hours since the election. In the first half of last year, I had no bother getting those services for people from the Western Health Board because it was running up a deficit of €17 million. Since the election one can get nothing because not alone is it sticking to its budget, but it is saving the €17 million it overspent before the election. Did the Minister ask the heath board why it did this prior to the election? Did the board get the nod to pretend everything in the garden was rosy? The health board's housing staff were forced to work under extreme pressure from management to stall and refuse many genuine hardship applications for grant aid. The Minister should wake up to this. The people will not be conned. They know this happened. They will take it out on the Government the first opportunity they get. Perhaps the Minister should take Deputy Ring's advice and have a little word with the Taoiseach.

The Minister's first comment was it was about politics and the blame game continued with various Government speakers blaming the media and public hysteria. Lack of confidence in the system to respond causes public hysteria and the public has lost total confidence in the Department of Health and Children as administered by the Minister.Deputy Martin and his ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Malley, are both nice guys.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	205	There is nothing funny about this issue. This motion relates to public concern about the health service and the confidence of the public in the Minister's ability to provide a service when it is needed and it is not about politics or the blame game.With regard to SARS, the public was concerned about how competent was the Department in providing what was required to address the issue. The example set was a patient who was brought to hospital, sent home and returned to hospital by taxi. No restrictions were in place and the public's reaction was panic. People know well the Department and the Minister are not in control. This motion is about the lack of public confidence in basic health services and not about the blame game. The Minister repeatedly points out that more and more money is spent every day. That is one of the underlying reasons the public has even less confidence in the system. By his own admission, more money is being spent but nothing is happening.There are countless vacancies in vital services throughout the State. However, another 250 hospital beds will be taken out of the system in response. There has not been enough nursing or general medical staff in our hospitals since the previous Administration took up office yet the nursing organisations are considering sending nurses abroad because of bed closures here. This is farcical and the two Ministers present must know that. When they return to their offices, surely the will examine what are the causes of these problems and ask their officials what, in God's name, is going on.The debate is not about blame and politics. It is the Government's last resort when it blames the media, public hysteria and the Opposition for the ills that beset its Departments. Never has such an appalling mess been made of a Department in the history of the State than that of the Department of Health and Children under Deputy Mar tin's stewardship. He is a nice guy and this is not personal. While I hate saying this, both he and his Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, are appalling failures. The motion is about their failure to provide an adequate and secure health service to the public.

They ask us what is going wrong and why they cannot rely on the health service and be assured that when they are ill, they will be safe and secure in calling on various health agencies.A few weeks following the agreement of the much vaunted new partnership programme, public health doctors are on strike. What kind of agreement was it? The Minister signed the agreement and hailed it as the last resort in resolving his problems. Suddenly the mortar has come unstuck and the reality is there is no agreement. The Minister has papered over the cracks and provided nothing. This is the second time he has perpetrated such a move on an unsuspecting public in 12 months following a similar dispute prior to the general election.The State is supposed to provide services to look after its people. Various initiatives have been introduced to compensate for our lack of ability to do so. However, sending patients overseas to avail of services that are available here is the laugh of all laughs.

In one sense luck played a part in that he has been extremely lucky in his mishandling of the SARS issue, in that what was a disaster—
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Of course, absolutely.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	210	—could so easily have been a catastrophe. If SARS had been more virulent or more infectious, it is possible there would have been very few of us here to tell the tale.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Come off it. This is classic hysteria.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	212	It is not. The Minister continuously failed to grasp the point. Nobody knew how dangerous SARS was but the public expected the Government to be able to handle a health threat and it was not. The issue is the health service was unable to respond.I was amused by Fianna Fáil backbenchers having the gall to tell us not to be political and to support the poor, old Minister. When they were not content with blaming the Opposition for over-reacting, they blamed the media and members of the public who called "Liveline" and  other programmes. It was everybody's fault expect the Minister's and Fianna Fáil's, as is always the case.The motion is not about scaremongering or harking back to something that should be swept under the carpet. The health system was ill-equipped to deal with an infectious disease and that lesson must be learnt. The public demands that the Minister learns it and demands of us that we make sure that he learns it. Last night the Minister cited the fact that there was only one probable cause as proof of how well he handled the issue. He entirely missed the point again as the motion is about his incompetence and the public's concern that if he failed to manage a manageable disease on the far side of the world, what hope has he of hauling the health service out of the mess into which he has allowed it to slide.No matter what fine talk there is about politics, governance and democracy, the bottom line is people elect governments to look after them. They pay no attention to what we are doing 90% of the time but they want to know that there is somebody to look after them if a disaster was to occur. When Marian Finucane invited a Minister of State on to her radio programme last year to discuss the national emergency plan, nobody believed there would be a nuclear accident. However, they assumed if one occurred, somebody would be in charge and would know what to do. The realisation that there was no plan sent people into a panic. That has also happened in regard to the health service and there has been a complete loss of confidence in the Government.The Minister would like to think that SARS is yesterday's news and it is time to get on with the next business but the worry for all of us is how will the health service respond to the next threat. Will there even be a health service? Unfortunately, in the modern world, we are constantly exposed to the danger to chemical or biological attacks and new diseases can spread at a frightening pace because of our mobility. We want reassurances that the Government will be able to deal with future attacks and there will not be mismanagement with confusing and contradictory messages being given to the public.The Minister is happy that his spin doctors are back in place and doing the necessary work for him on SARS. However, there are more gaps to be plugged in the health service than merely in regard to his public relations. The health service is in crisis but there is little sign that the Minister, the Taoiseach or the Government backbenchers recognise that. The Taoiseach only shows a passing knowledge of what is going on in the health service.The imperative now is for the Minister to start earning his salary. His first job is to resolve the public doctors dispute and then he must publish the reports on the reform of the health service. Reform is the only thing that offers any hope.  The reports must be acted on and cannot be left, as the health strategy was, as worthy documents which might have saved the health service if only  the Minister bit the bullet. I commend the motion to the House.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, to delete lines 14 to 27.I set out my objections to this Bill on Second and Committee Stages when we had a fairly detailed debate. I will not refight the war. My party's opposition to the Bill is based on four issues. The first relates to the constitutionality of the Bill. On Committee Stage I requested the Minister to make available the Attorney General's advice on the matter. However, he chose not to do that. There is a reasonable question mark over the Bill's constitutionality. I outlined my fears on Committee Stage and I said it would be a political hanging offence if the Bill was subsequently deemed to be unconstitutional.There is a precedent for making the Attorney General's advice available. The Taoiseach made it available when there was an issue about the constitutionality of the Shannon stopover. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation and make the legal advice available. I set out on Committee Stage on 17 April the legal advice I received. There is a reasonable fear about the constitutionality of the Bill.I also oppose the Bill because of the U-turn on the issue of directly-elected mayors. I tabled amendments on Committee Stage which sought to run on a pilot basis elections for directly-elected Lords Mayor in Dublin and Cork. However, the Minister has not been forthcoming in that regard.As regards the rights of Oireachtas Members, I know the Minister has laid down guidelines. However, I had hoped he would make specific regulations before the Bill was passed to allay the fears of many Members in the House.The fourth reason I oppose the Bill is that I expected this proposal to be part of a broader package of local government reform. The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would introduce a package of reforms either later this year or early next year. I accept his word on that.We are discussing these issues against the background of a growing financial crisis in a number  of local authorities. Cork County Council fears it will not be able to buy a shovel for some of its maintenance people by July or August. Where will it get the resources to fund ongoing general works? Cork County Council is only one example of what is happening nation-wide. There is a serious financial crisis in local authorities. The Minister is giving powers to managers to make up deficits by imposing charges. He is taking the right to raise charges away from councillors. I fear that managers will impose savage increases next year and the year after to make up deficits. The people will suffer when domestic rates are reintroduced. I said on Second Stage that we are moving back to 1977. This discussion is academic as far as the people are concerned. I oppose the Bill on the grounds I have stated. I hope the Minister accepts my amendment.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I know the Minister was looking for me the last day, but I am here today. I spent that day discussing the Bill and when the Minister left the House, I did not make any comment because he had explained why he had to leave. I was disappointed the Minister and some of his backbench colleagues commented on where I was.During the debate that day I referred to the General Council of County Councils. As a paid up member of that organisation, I disagree with and am upset by its view. I referred to Mr. Kenny whom I have known for a long time. I am fond of him and I hope I did not cause him any offence. I explained my position to him and he accepted it. I would not offend him because he is only a paid official. It was wrong of the General Council of County Councils to send him out. The chairman of that group should have been sent on behalf of the councillors. Mr. Kenny has done an excellent job and I do not have problems with him. However, I have problems with the General Council of County Councils because it did not consult me to find out my view.More than 128 Oireachtas Members are affected by the dual mandate which is unconstitutional. Many Members of the Dáil and Seanad have expressed reservations about the Bill. I hope the President studies it when it is referred to her next week. I was not surprised I got an ear infection last week given that I have been listening to many Fianna Fáil people complaining about the Bill. They do not have the courage – I could use another word – to vote against it. They do not agree with it and they think it will be political suicide for them.The Minister and the Department said that a package is in place for people who retire from county councils now or next year. Is that the only package on offer or is there a secret package for Senators? Will the Minister provide funding during the summer months for conferences for Senators? If the Minister were to do that, it would be outrageous. I fought for the Senators here because they were being foolish, particularly the Fianna Fáil Senators. They allowed the Minister to take them away from those who elected them – the county councillors. They need help and back-up but their silence cannot be bought. I ask the Minister to confirm whether there will be a package at another stage, as that would be very wrong.I have given 25 years to local government and for 16 of those years I did not even draw expenses, as we used to put our expenses into a civic fund for visiting dignitaries. I had no problem with that but there was an incident with a public official and we stopped the practice. Members have drawn their expenses ever since but for 16 years I did not draw my expenses. As a Deputy I do not get paid as a councillor and I should not; that is not an issue.Constitutionally, the Minister and the Government do not have the right to say who can or cannot stand for public office. The British Government tried to introduce a similar measure but it received legal advice that it could not do so. The political parties then introduced the measure themselves and I have been saying the same here for a long time. This is a matter for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. There is no reason for it to be introduced in legislation. Let Fianna Fáil make it a party objective that Oireachtas Members cannot be councillors and Labour and Fine Gael can do the same. There is no reason to bring this into law.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Deputy Ring should speak through the Chair.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	222	As Deputy Allen said, Fine Gael opposes this measure for a number of reasons. I would withdraw my challenge tomorrow morning if the Minister were to put in place a mechanism whereby I would be guaranteed a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister would refer on to my county manager, just as I am guaranteed a reply to parliamentary questions to the Minister himself. If the Minister were to do that I would withdraw my challenge, but otherwise I will continue. The Minister and his officials will tell me they have no responsibility in this area but we have responsibilities. We are the elected assembly. This is the Oireachtas and we make the laws.I could bring in a letter that I wrote to my local authority in November and to which I received a reply last week. That is what we have to put up with and that is why I am concerned – we will lose contact with people on the ground. There  was a massive turnover of Deputies in the last election and in the election after next there will be another massive turnover. Councillors will be on the ground while Deputies will be up here acting as legislators. I would love to be a legislator. Nobody can question my record on legislation and whether one agrees with me or not I have spoken on most Bills here. People cannot say I have not made a contribution, although I may have to read those contributions from the record when I am not in the Dáil myself.One cannot lose contact with people on the ground. It must be unconstitutional for the Minister to say to me that, as an Oireachtas Member, I cannot stand for the council. If I were in the council I could stand for the Dáil; if I were in the European Parliament I could stand for that parliament, stay in the Dáil until the next election and stand for the council the same day. That is a contradiction in itself.I have a top legal team in place. If the President does not refer this to the Supreme Court next week I will call a press conference and reveal my team, one of whom is a constitutional lawyer. There is also another lawyer of high reputation. I will win the case and then it will be up to the political parties to make the decision. It is wrong to go through with this Bill and even at this late stage it should be withdrawn.I have great respect for President McAleese and she has my full support as President. I ask her to refer this legislation to the Supreme Court when she signs it into law to get a judgment on it. There is great concern among Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael backbenchers as well as the Independents about the constitutionality of this measure but if the Supreme Court approves of this I will be the first to acknowledge I was wrong. It would not be my first time being wrong in politics; we all make mistakes.What the Minister is doing is wrong. He is taking us away from our natural constituents. The Dáil is not like the British Parliament, where the MP never meets his constituents. I had the honour of being on the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body and I remember sitting next to an MP from Luton or wherever. He would have three or four staff with him giving him briefing documents on the issue of the day. I have one secretary in my constituency and we receive part funding for another secretary; those are the resources we have. I am a front bench spokesman for Fine Gael but I had to write up my own speech because I cannot take my secretary away from constituency. Whether we like it or not, when constituents ask us about potholes, medical cards or council roads they want a response. They do not want to hear we are legislators – they do not care. When they elect someone to the council or the Dáil, they expect a response.Senators are elected by county councillors and I cannot understand why the Senators are allowing the Government to forbid them to sit on the council, next to those who elect them. This measure is not right and it will be thrown out by  the courts. Some Fianna Fáil backbenchers support me, which I appreciate, and they want me to take this case. They are not doing this because they want to be on the council but because it means political survival for them.If this Bill showed real local government reform we might think differently. However, it should not be called the Local Government Bill but the ending of the dual mandate Bill. That would be honesty. The Minister and his predecessor promised us directly elected mayors and cathaoirligh but that did not happen either.I intend to challenge this measure. It may cost me money but I will do so and I hope to win the case. I hope the Minister does not live to regret this because, although he is not a bad person and does the best he can, if he loses this battle I will be calling for his resignation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Before calling Deputy McCormack, I remind Members there is a long-standing convention in the House that the President is not invoked in political debate or controversy. Also, we are on Report Stage and I would be grateful if Members would respect that.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I was aware of the first matter and I will respect the Chair's second request.This problem could be solved if the Minister could lay out the guidelines by which he proposes to protect the rights of Oireachtas Members who will no longer be local authority members. That would solve most of the problems. It is obvious that the Minister has given certain assurances to Government backbenchers who did not wish this legislation to proceed. They have received certain assurances and if we all knew what those were there might be no need to oppose the Bill. We oppose the Bill on the issue of directly elected mayors but that could be sorted out also. Will the Minister lay out those regulations?I was a member of Galway County Council for 27 years. I stepped down voluntarily on the last occasion and did not take redundancy because I remained a member of Galway City Council. I was in the unique position of being a member of a county council and a city council. I no longer have the same rights as a county councillor. I will give an example – I will not delay the House. I recently sought a copy of the county development plan – I would normally have received a copy of it the week it had been published – and was told I had to pay €45 for it as I was no longer a member of the local authority. I do not mind paying €45 for the plan but I no longer have the same rights as an elected representative in the same area which I represented in the county council for 27 years. I was told I had to pay €25 extra for the maps. I also do not have the same right of reply in relation to inquiries or representations which I am obliged to make as a public representative to the local authority. A member of a local authority – I am currently a member of one and was a member of another for 27 years – has a statutory  right to put down what is called a prior notice and planning application whereby one is notified by the planning authority two of three days before a decision is taken if there is a difficulty with the application. The decision is not changed, one is merely notified of it. A person who is no longer a member of a county council does not have that right.I would like the Minister to ensure that I retain my rights when I stand down from the city council. I will be obliged to do so in the next election if this Bill is in accordance with the Constitution. I do not know if the Minister is at liberty to do that. One of the difficulties I have as a legislator is that we debate legislation – as we are now doing – and are told the Minister will include other provisions by way of regulations at a later date. We do not know when passing legislation, what will follow.People often point out that one voted for or against particular legislation and that one was a Member of the Dáil which introduced it. A regulation can be introduced at any time without recourse to what we are now discussing. It is obvious Government backbenchers who are not here are satisfied with the assurances the Minister has given them in regard to this legislation. Perhaps he could give us the same assurances as his backbenchers who are accepting this Bill. I ask that the Minister, at the first opportunity, spell out what regulations are to be introduced to protect councillors. I am not concerned about the person who replaces me on the local council. He or she will be as good a local representative as I have been. I and other Oireachtas Members will be a loss to councils from the point of view that my experience is useful when dealing with matters relating to the Oireachtas. More importantly, my experience as a sitting member of a local authority speaking on this Bill concerning local authority matters is far more valuable than a Chamber full of people who are no longer members of local authorities – there are 128 such people between the two Chambers. Such people will have less interest in the legislation being passed. Legislation should be scrutinised by people who are active members of local authorities at the time it is going through the Houses. That is one of the disadvantages.We are trying to salvage crumbs at this stage. I follow Deputy Ring's line of reasoning in regard to the loss to the Oireachtas of not having sitting members of local authorities in the House. If the Minister does not wish to have 128 such Members, perhaps he might consider having 115 or, even 50 of them. If other parties follow the lead of the Green Party in suggesting to their members that they no longer stand for local authorities, we would have less county councillors in the House. It is important that we have some members of local authorities in this House. We are now dealing with Report Stage of this legislation and must accept it will be passed. Perhaps the Minister might outline – in order to allay fears on this side of the House – what regu lations he will introduce to ensure we retain our rights when dealing with local authority matters. I want the same rights for Oireachtas Members in respect of the constituency they represent as those afforded to members of a local authority with the exception of their not being able to attend or participate in council meetings. Whether or not the Minister likes it, we will have to continue dealing with such matters because that is our profession and duty. It is my duty to deal with legislation, as I am now doing, and to sit in my office from 8.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. on Monday to deal with issues raised by local people. That is why I am seeking assurances from the Minister regarding the rights we will have in dealing with local authority matters. Simply making suggestions or issuing guidelines to local authorities is not good enough. I want the position spelled out in regulations. While current county managers may be fair in terms of affording people their rights under such guidelines, their successors may operate them any way they like. The Minister should clearly spell out the regulations.

Nonetheless, we are concerned – such concerns have been put on the record before – at the dropping of directly-elected mayors. We believe such a move would be a great step forward for towns and cities around the country. That idea has been dropped despite great pronouncements over the years that it would happen. We need look no further than the example of London where a directly-elected mayor is providing vision and leadership and is showing the way forward. The Minister is taking a retrograde step.Many years ago, Barrington said that the function of national Government should be foreign affairs and defence and that local government should deal with many of the other issues on a local basis. That, I believe, is a point well made. I have ten years experience in local government. It is unfortunate that the Minister, given the Government majority, is not taking the opportunity to really devolve power to local level. It is a missed opportunity and I am saddened by it. However, I welcome the Bill.On the information issue, it is important that local authorities are responsive. I have encountered the same problems as Deputy McCormack with the county council of being unable to obtain a draft county development plan without paying for it. The cost in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown region is €200. As a Member of this House, I should be allowed to have access to all documents and draft documents being brought before a council. The draft development plan is one of the most important documents in the Dublin area in particular, given the various tribunals under way. It is my duty to comment on such a plan because it examines the vision for the county. It is an area into which, as a national legislator, I should have some input. It is similar to a freedom of information issue. Members should be privy to docu mentation and be able to obtain it without paying a significant financial penalty.The dropping of the directly elected mayors proposal is a huge retrograde step. From travelling and living abroad, I have seen what a strong local mayor can do in the larger cities and the smaller towns around Europe and the US. Electing good people as mayors who can lead a five-year programme as opposed to the 12-month changeover in place here, where a chain is simply shifted from one person's neck to another, is a hugely dynamic and interesting area of city and town management. Our system does not represent management, vision or leadership. The Minister missed a huge opportunity by not pursuing the directly-elected mayors proposal. No other Fianna Fáil Minister in the last generation has had such a majority with which he or she could proceed with legislation like this. It shows a lack of courage and a lack of conviction on the Minister's part and I regret that. Nonetheless, getting rid of the dual mandate is a good move and the Green Party supports the Bill on that basis.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I would remind Members that we are dealing with amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and Members should confine their comments as far as possible to those amendments.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I commend the Minister on bringing forward at least half of this Bill, namely the first half which ends the dual mandate. We have heard about experienced members on local authorities, but how will that experience be gained unless we make way for new members coming in? The public will benefit from a significant increase in work because councillors, who have been getting some form of remuneration since 1999, will be able to devote more time to the council and deliver a better service to their constituents. While I am not criticising current legislators in any way, the Bill will certainly free up more of our time to dedicate to this function.I cannot say whether or not I will be supporting this Bill because it remains to be seen how the Minister will deal with the amendments. I have a number of other issues to deal with, Chairman, but they relate to other amendments. I want to voice my support for the sentiment of the first half of this Bill.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The discussion so far on this has referred to the Bill in general. The Bill is really a pathetic little piece of legislation. It certainly is not local government reform. There are two measures being provided for here, the first of which is the abolition of the dual mandate to which I will return.The second is the dropping of the provision for directly elected city and county mayors which is being done for electoral reasons. When the measure was initially invoked by the Minister's predecessor there was an expectation that a Fianna Fáil gauleiter in every city and county  would emerge as the elected mayor with at least the power to ride shotgun on the county manager, tell him or her what to do, etc., and run the county or city in the Fianna Fáil interest. That does not appear to be a likely prospect now, given the degree to which the public is reacting to the lies it was told 12 months ago at the time of the general election. With that prospect beginning to fade, the measure to have directly elected city and county mayors is being dropped. It is being done for political reasons and there is no point in anybody disguising that fact.It is also being done in a very regrettable context where this Government is presiding over a fundamental change in local government in this country. What would be recognised as local government in most other countries does not exist here and what we are rapidly moving towards is a system of local administration, with government and decision-making increasingly made at the centre and with few or no decisions being allowed to be made at local level. That is reflected in the degree to which powers are being transferred from elected councils to county managers. It is reflected in the fact that the executive or management side of local authorities is strengthened by the appointment of new directors of service, with a whole apparatus around them, while the elected side is being played down. Those are issues to which we will probably return.The specific measure we are debating in the context of these three amendments is one to abolish the dual mandate. When that proposal initially surfaced here in the House two years ago, the Labour Party took a position on it. As a party we took the view that on balance – there are arguments for and against whether it should be abolished and many of these have been rehearsed here – we would support the abolition of the dual mandate. We took the view that it was necessary to do that by way of legislation because no matter how much we would like to think that there would be some kind of code of honour between political parties in the House as to whether Members would stand for both local authorities and the Oireachtas, the reality is that the nature of political competition will not allow that to happen. Therefore, again on balance, we took the view that it needed to be done by way of legislation and we indicated we were prepared to support that when it was before the House previously. That remains our position – we are consistent in that.There are, however, a number of issues that arise from the proposal to abolish the dual mandate. The first, which has been referred to by a number of colleagues so far, is the question of public representation and the rights of public representatives, in this case to have access to local authorities but in a wider case to have access to public bodies generally and to get responses from public bodies generally. It is the case that many public bodies – local authorities are only the most recent converts to this view – are increas ingly becoming unresponsive to public representatives.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	229	That is correct.

God forbid that they would have to be contaminated with having to answer a telephone call or a letter to a public representative.I want to make clear that public bodies who are adopting that attitude are the very ones who are adopting an arrogant attitude to the public. They are the very same public bodies who will not respond to correspondence from citizens, who will not answer the telephone and who send somebody who rings in with a query from one answering machine to the next.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	231	That is right.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Whenever we dispose of this legislation, one of the things we will require is legislation which will put an obligation on all public bodies to respond to, first, the public because after all they are the ones in whose service the public service is working and who are frustrated, and second, the people who are elected by the public to represent their interests. The democratic rights of the public need to be asserted.On this nonsense which has started to develop in public bodies, that "we are independent professionals, we do not respond to public representatives", a sense of accountability and a restoration of a sense of public service is required, of which elected representatives of the people are ultimately the guarantors. That is the first issue.The second issue relates to the question of political competition. A number of colleagues here have referred to, for example, the position when this legislation goes through – we will talk about the constitutional question later. In such cases, there is concern about the question of political competition as between people who are or are not members of local authorities, etc.The question of political competition must be addressed. It will have to be addressed in the context of the disadvantage that Deputies, and indeed Senators, who are in Opposition now suffer as against officeholders in Government. It is no longer tolerable. There was much talk around the time of the formation of this Dáil that additional resources would be provided to Deputies and to Opposition parties, etc. I do not see any sign of that, which is the Minister for Finance's responsibility. In the absence of such resources, however, let me say this. It is not tolerable that officeholders have an entire army of civil servants,—
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Spin-doctors.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	234	—spin-doctors, consultants and PR people, some of whom are directly involved in their constituency in the servicing of their own individual constituencies and some of whom are doing so, albeit indirectly, in a very thinly disguised way. I have seen no evidence that resources will be provided to Opposition Members or spokespersons. I put the Minister and his colleagues on notice that from here on the question of five or six civil servants in the constituency office of a Minister doing constituency work and another number of PR people, etc. will be an issue to which we will return in this House and in public debate outside.I refer to the question as to whether it is constitutional to abolish the dual mandate. We can all express opinions on that here and ultimately either if the President decides to refer the issue or if Deputy Ring or anybody else decides to take a case, it will be a matter that will be decided in the courts.The Minister has a responsibility to tell the House what is his advice. I agree with Deputy Allen that so far the Minister has failed to tell the House explicitly what advice he has. On Committee Stage he gave us general responses on this, but he has not circulated that advice to us nor has he put his advice on the issue of constitutionality on the record of the House. On Committee Stage the Minister was quite flaky in response to the direct questions as to what advice he had from the Attorney General in response to the points that came up both in the Seanad debate and on Second Stage here. I again invite the Minister to explicitly tell the House.As my colleagues have said, the Minister carries the can for this. There is nothing unusual about legislation going through the Oireachtas and subsequently, because of something to which nobody had adverted is found to be unconstitutional. It would be quite different for the Minister to bring legislation before the House and assure us it is constitutional. The constitutional issue has been raised in a number of different ways and the Minister has proceeded with it. If it eventually goes down in flames, the Minister will carry the can for that. He should put on the record of the House verbatim the advice he has from the Attorney General – if he has such advice about which there is some doubt.My amendments specifically address the distinction between the question of the dual mandate per se– that is the simultaneous holding of membership of a local authority and membership of the Oireachtas – and the right to stand for election. In amendments Nos. 2 and 3, I am proposing to leave in place the prohibition on simultaneous membership of a local authority and the Oireachtas, but to allow for the right for Members of the Oireachtas, if they so choose, to stand for election to a local authority.I will outline a practical scenario. A Member of the Oireachtas might come to the conclusion that he or she no longer wanted to be a Member of the Oireachtas, but wanted to remain active in  representational politics and might want to stand in a local election. Under the Bill before us, that Member of the Oireachtas would have to resign his or her membership of the Oireachtas before standing for election. That seems constitutionally questionable at least. I am proposing a formula whereby a Member of the Oireachtas could still decide to stand for election and the issue of dual membership would only arise if that person were elected to the local authority.My amendment No. 3 provides that if such a person decides not to take up the local authority seat, the seat would go to the person next highest in voting order. The Minister seemed to find some general favour with that and could see the point of it when we debated it on Committee Stage, but put up the argument that election regulations would have to be changed and so on. He is exaggerating that and in any event, there is plenty of time between now and the local elections in the middle of 2004 to make whatever consequential changes are necessary in the election regulations to facilitate this.At the very least my two amendments would help to protect this Bill against constitutional challenge if the Minister is so inclined to look favourably on them. He gave a not entirely enthusiastic undertaking to look at it before Report Stage. I saw no amendment to deal with this in his name and therefore I tabled these two amendments again on Report Stage in the hope that the Minister will accept them.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I agree with Deputy Gilmore's point about the responsibility of public bodies to elected representatives. In my 16 or 17 years in public life, there has been a change of approach in the response of various public bodies. Some of this has been as a result of responsibility having moved away from Ministers to various authorities. Even at that level we have less input. In direct representations there is a move to question our right to pursue issues with the implication that we are interfering with their work and delaying them. Sometimes we hear the response that they are wasting their time in trying to deal with queries from councillors and Deputies when they should be doing real work. The people want us to make those representations.In all democratic countries representations are made by national and local politicians. Some years ago a study found that in Britain where most of the MPs live in London, 50% of their time was spent writing about issues of concern to their constituents. The issue of constituency representation may occasionally be frowned upon by the highbrow media, which suggest that is not part of our work. However the people decide what they want us to do. They want us to represent them on individual, community and national issues and they want us to legislate as well. We must ensure we adopt that role. As the Minister knows, at election time people vote on the candidates' performance in making representations for their constituency.Some professions look with disdain at representations by a councillor or Deputy. For example, a few months ago a constituent came to me who was extremely concerned about her child who had a psychiatric illness and was suicidal. I wrote of her concerns in detail to the health board and this was passed to the psychiatrist. After receiving that, the psychiatrist criticised the woman the next time he saw her for involving politicians and tying him up in all sorts of paperwork. This was a very concerned mother who was deeply distressed about the treatment her child was receiving, as was I. I could give many more examples.Because of my representations in that area, a manager of a health board at deputy chief officer level asked me to attend a meeting to discuss my representations on the basis that I might be interfering with the confidentiality of the relationship between the health board and the constituent.Because I did not kowtow to him and accept what he was saying he put it in writing and asked me for a reply which he got – he sent me a further letter, copies of which I have, about his concern at my representations. That is endemic in the public service. Yesterday I got a phone call from a constituent who wanted me to get information from a planning officer. He had telephoned the planning section of the local authority five times over two weeks and each time got an answering machine saying the call would be returned, which it was not. The planning section in my local authority is usually good and responsive. I regularly find that people no longer answer telephones. Answering machines tell the public to leave their number and someone will respond to them, but they are not responding. That is the experience right across the board.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I appreciate that. I fully agree with the Minister, but surely it is intolerable that any aspect of the public service, be it a Department, local authority, health board or any other board which is responsible to the State, would treat the public in that way. They are the servants of the public and are being paid by the public through their taxes. It often amazes me in clinics to hear how people are treated when they apply for a simple thing like a grant or something that should be easy to get. We do not receive the same treatment because we are public representatives. What training is being given to staff? This applies only to a small section of people. I do not wish to tar everybody with the one brush. In fairness to the majority who do a good job, it is those who do a bad job that are highlighted to us. Nobody will come to us to say he or she met a public servant who did a great job. People ring when they are in trouble or dissatisfied. I expect that it is a small minority which is responsible for this, but it  is a significant and growing one. I am pleased the Minister has agreed with me on that point and with the other statements that my colleagues, including our spokesman, have made in that regard.I wish to touch on the advantages of a dual mandate. If there is one area in which Members of this House are expert, it is local government. The different State bodies and Ministries are extremely complex and I do not fully understand how they work. I understand local government because I have been involved in it for up to 17 years. It is a most complex area. The Minister will accept that up to 80% of our queries are in regard to local government issues. As public representatives, we have more expertise in local government because of our involvement in it. We bring that expertise in here. If there is one debate in which Members will always have an interest and express an opinion, it is in the area of local government because of our education as local government representatives.The dual mandate gives us another platform to bring up issues. If, as sometimes happens, the county manager or whoever is responding to the query, blames the Minister, stating: "The Minister did not give us that", "the regulations are this" or "the regulations are that", they know that we have another platform. We can put down a parliamentary question to the Minister. People have to be careful in regard to TDs and Senators who have another forum to query a matter. It is an advantage to local government that we can bring issues of concern to a higher level, not alone in the Minister's Department but in other Departments as well.The same applies to health boards. I was on a health board for seven years and I had the same experience. Issues of concern at that level could be brought up to a different level. That will come to an end. Who will be happy about it?

The managers for a start, although not all managers. I do not want to tar everybody with the one brush. Local government officials will be happy. At the moment if they express an opinion or give information they know that there are several people at local government level who will take it up at a different level by tabling a Dáil question or Adjournment debate matter and so on. There is currently a level of scrutiny of local government officials who will be pleased to see it removed.The civil servants are another case in point. They will be delighted to know that we will be less informed about the developments in local government as TDs and Senators. Again, this does not apply to all of them. There is a group of civil servants who will be delighted that the Oireachtas will be less well informed about what is happening on the ground. Some 80% of the concerns of those who contact us are about areas of difficulty for individuals or their communities.I do not know the Minister's view of Better Local Government. There is a problem in the health service, which I accept is not the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. We all know that the basic problem is that administration and non-coalface activities are gobbling up all the available resources. The same situation is developing in local government. There are now more managers, changes of position, alteration of job specifications—

There is so much contact to be made all over the place before any decision is made. I see it happening and I am even losing track of it at this stage. Concerned local government officials have spoken to me about the bureaucracy and the inherent inefficiency in decision-making. Consultation is important but over-consultation can inhibit decision-making. It is happening. If this continues to develop, I foresee a situation in five years' time when the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be under the same pressure as the Minister for Health and Children is today. The money will be gobbled up in all these systems and the services will be reduced. It has moved in that direction. The Minister has time to re-examine this area before it is too late.We had a manager who worked well in our local government area. There was a change of manager which we found out about six months later. We were not told about it because there was a change of manager with a different idea of how things should be managed. I experienced a time when the management of local government was unquestionable. I remember Dick Haslam who was a manager in Limerick, and he went to Cork afterwards. He was a brilliant manager. We had untold confidence in his ability to manage the business of Limerick County Council. The public also had confidence in him. It was akin to the confidence one would have in a senior manager in one of the biggest companies in the country. He was extremely successful. The job has become so complex with Better Local Government and—

Deputy Gilmore put forward  the argument that Oireachtas Members should be allowed to stand in local elections, following which they could decide as to which position they would retain. I cannot imagine a situation in which very many would resign from this House in favour of membership of local authorities. I am certainly not aware of any within the Fianna Fáil party and I doubt if there are any among the 166 Members of this House.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Perhaps the Deputy would like to encourage them.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It would be wrong to allow Oireachtas Members to stand in local elections. It would result in parties putting forward their best vote catchers, who would subsequently resign in favour of a party colleague. In fairness, the electorate should know, in advance of the election, that those elected will continue to serve and should be in a position to pass judgment on them.When this Bill was first mooted by the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, there were heated exchanges in all parties in regard to it. The greatest concern on the part of Members was the fear that, if they were not on a local authority, local councillors would gain an unfair advantage which might cost votes in a future election. That is a very real fear and, accordingly, it is important that Members of the House have access to local authorities and are kept up to date on developments.There is not any substantial public concern as to whether we are members of one or two elected bodies. However, eliminating the dual mandate will allow for an increase in the number of public representatives and that can only be good for democracy. I have no difficulty in accepting the new situation and will resign my local authority seat when this legislation is enacted.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank Members for their contributions. I believe we covered almost every aspect of this Bill, other Bills, the Departments of other Ministers and various other matters on Committee Stage, which is rather unusual. However, all of us appear to be in good humour today. I respect the many legitimate and deeply held views expressed by Members during the debate. So be it, but I happen to hold a different point of view. From the beginning, my position on the issues has been clear. I have acknowledged that the scope of this Bill is narrow and I did not pretend otherwise. It is narrow and quite specific, but it is a very important step in the separation process, as it were, and development of the local government system. It is a key element in delivering that system.Deputy Gilmore referred to certain changes and suggested the Government might be under pressure, resulting in the elimination of directly elected chairs. When I took office in the full flush  of last summer, my view on this issue was very well known. It is not simply a reaction to some subsequent change. I and other Deputies have been around long enough to know that the tide comes in and goes out, moods change and situations change. It would be very foolish to draft legislation or attempt something fundamental simply on the basis of the mood of the moment. My position is a very principled one. It would be entirely wrong to tell those who are democratically elected to any forum that they cannot democratically elect the cathaoirleach or mayor, as the case may be, of their own council from among their members who have been democratically elected by the public.

That is my view and I am now in a position to do something about it. I gave it a great deal of consideration and my position was known. That is not the system we use in this Parliament. Following our election to the Dáil, we do not use some other method of electing a Taoiseach. There are different styles and systems in other countries. Our system is that we elect our Leader, the Taoiseach of the day, from among those democratically elected. The same system should apply in a local authority, as I believe all councillors would agree.

People see local government, in many respects, as very central and important in their lives. I refute one of the themes which has come forward in various aspects of the debate. Some people seem to believe that, in order to be involved in local politics and issues, one has to be a member of a local council. That is absolute nonsense. Like Deputy Power, I have had experience of both situations. I have been in this House while not being a member of a local authority. I have been on a local authority when I was not a  Member of this House. I have served in Opposition. My ability to represent the people on local issues has never been predicated—

I do not have much time to reply to the debate. My ability to represent people has never been predicated on being a member of a local authority. In my capacity as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as is the case with other Ministers, Deputies are constantly putting questions to me about matters which are hugely germane to local authorities and local areas. That will not change. That situation will pertain into the future. One does not have to be a member of a local authority. As a public representative, I have dealt with local authorities and health boards for many years. That is not predicated on my having to be a member of a local authority to do so.

I fully agree with the views of Deputies and Senators as to the facilities which should be available to them. Members need far more, in terms of researchers and office support. I agree absolutely with that. In fairness to the Minister for Finance, he has come a long way in terms of facilities for Deputies, over the past five years. I like to think I played some role in that regard in relation to Leinster House 2000, when I had the opportunity. Prior to that, the matter had been on the desks of successive Ministers of State but nothing was done about it. I took that ball and ran with it at the time. Such issues must evolve. In relation to the Oireachtas set-up which is being discussed, including the possibility of a Secretary General and so on, I am sure all of those issues will come to the fore again and will have to be dealt with. However, that is not for me to deal with.Deputy Ring asked a specific question as to whether there is some other deal which has been done elsewhere. Certainly, there is not I can assure the Deputy, nor am I in a position to do such a deal. The only issue I have dealt with is  the straightforward package I have put forward. Senators have legitimately raised issues in the context of their facilities. There is a review of the Seanad currently in progress and it will become deeper towards the end of the year. I accept there are quite legitimate issues in terms of how Senators carry out their functions, but that is a matter for them to deal with. I am not in a position to go beyond that. I accept, as I have already done with Members on both sides of the House, that facilities need to be better. As a Minister of the Government, I have no difficulty in putting that on record and, as I have said, the Minister for Finance has accepted that by consistently improving the situation in recent years. I have examined Deputy Gilmore's proposal regarding the two amendments and while I am interested in it, I wish to keep the matter consistent with all the other exclusions. We have a raft of exclusions concerning people who can or cannot stand but I will not go through them all again. I want to keep the legislation on all fours in that regard. Members of the public are the only ones entitled to remove someone from this House, unless somebody is declared bankrupt or is appointed a judge. I do not think I can insert anything in the legislation forcing a Deputy to resign his or her seat because it would involve major constitutional issues. I hope the Deputy will accept that point.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	264	Together with the Taoiseach, I attended the informal meeting of the European Council in Athens held on 16 April. We were accompanied by the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche. I would like to pay tribute to the Greek Presidency for its excellent organisation of the informal European Council, the ceremony for the signature of the accession treaty and the European conference that followed.The declarations adopted by the European Council on 16 April and by the European conference held on 17 April have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as has the Presidency statement on Iraq. The Greek Presidency set the date of 16 April for the signature of the treaty of accession for the ten accession countries. The ceremony, which took place under the Acropolis, marked a true milestone in European history.Earlier in the day, the informal meeting of the European Council adopted the Athens declaration, restating the principles on which the European Union was founded. These principles are freedom, democracy and the rule of law, respect for human dignity, liberty and human rights and a Union devoted to the practice of tolerance, justice and solidarity. The declaration was a useful reminder of what the European Union stands for.The signing of the accession treaty marked the end of a long and bleak chapter in European history. It acknowledged that countries that had been artificially cut off from mainstream Europe had earned the right to membership of the Union based on the principles on which the Union was founded. It reaffirmed, once again, the value and success of the European Union.Once they have completed their respective ratification procedures, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia are set to become members of the European Union from 1 May next year. These countries attended the informal European Council on 16 April and, henceforth, until the date of their accession, they will attend all EU meetings as observers.The outcomes of the referenda held to date have been positive. Already three countries, Hungary, Malta and Slovenia, have voted for membership. This represents a strong vote in favour of the European Union by their people. I welcome the fact that our new partners will take their rightful place in the European Union. I am particularly pleased that it will fall to Ireland's Presidency to mark their entry as full members next year. This will be an honour and a privilege. Meanwhile, accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania continue and I look forward to progressing them during our Presidency. The European Council meeting in December 2004 will consider whether negotiations can open with Turkey.The informal European Council meeting focused on the work of the European Convention. The European Union must be seen by our citizens to work; that is why the work of the convention and the Intergovernmental Conference that will follow, is so important. It is why the Government is taking the work of the convention so seriously.Prior to the European Council meeting, a group of 17 current and future member states met. The meeting was hosted by Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium in the absence of the current President of the Benelux countries, Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg. Ireland was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche. The meeting was a follow-on from one which the Taoiseach and I attended in Luxembourg on 1 April.The 17 countries agreed a number of fundamental principles which we want to see reflected in the outcome of the convention. These principles draw largely on the Benelux memorandum of last December and on a paper drawn up over recent months by many like-minded states at the convention, in the drafting of which Ireland played a major role.The group of 17 set out its strong support for a European Union that will work in the future at least as effectively and democratically as in the past. The principles that we reconfirmed are the need to ensure the equality of member states and  to retain the balance between the institutions, without creating new institutions.At the European Council meeting we set out our views as to how these principles could be preserved and strengthened. While there are some differences among us on points of detail, we shared a wish to see the following: a strengthening of the Community method and of the Commission; a more open and transparent process of election for the Commission President; the retention of the formula agreed at Nice, especially the requirement for equality as between member states, for the membership of the commission; and a single external relations representative, with Council and Commission membership.The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, addressed the members of the European Council at the outset of the meeting. His presentation focused on the work of the convention from the point of view of the European Parliament. An exchange with the President of the European Convention, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, followed. President Giscard outlined his plans for the European Convention and the drafting of the constitutional treaty. He confirmed that he would present the final report of the convention to the European Council in Thessaloniki, Greece, on 20 June.The session with President Giscard focused on key institutional issues. Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg spoke on behalf of all who attended the breakfast meeting earlier. He set out the principles which we want to see reflected in the outcome of the convention.Along with many others, the Taoiseach underlined Ireland's support for these principles. He said, as did others, that he hoped as much consensus as possible would be reached but where this was not possible, the convention should set out options. Those of us who wish to see a strengthening of the Community method are aware that there are other points of view. These points of view were also put at our meeting in Athens.It is important that due weight and attention are given to all perspectives by President Giscard and by the convention's presidium, in particular to the strong message conveyed by the group of 17. We will continue our efforts along with others, therefore, to ensure that the fundamental principles on which the Union was founded and on which the Union's success has been built, are reflected in the text that will be presented to us next month.As the convention enters the final and decisive phase, intensive work is continuing across the range of issues it is addressing. Next week's plenary session will debate the vital issues of the Union's institutional arrangements, foreign policy and defence. The Government's representative at the convention has submitted extensive proposals in response to texts published by the presidium in these areas. We will continue to work extremely closely with like-minded countries – and, of course, our allies vary from issue to issue – to  ensure that the outcome of the convention is a balanced and appropriate one.On 17 April a meeting of the enlarged European Conference, which took the new neighbours initiative as its theme, was held in Athens. Ireland was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. That meeting involved all the countries associated with the new neighbours initiative, both from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. Member states, the candidate and accession countries and Russia also attended. In all, some 40 countries were represented at the conference.The European Conference recognised that the countries and peoples of Europe have come a long way towards forging a Community of values based on democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms. It underlined the importance of preventing and combating common security threats, including organised and transnational crime, trafficking in human beings, terrorism and communicable diseases. This is an initiative that Ireland welcomes.The Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, addressed the European Conference on the subject of Iraq. The Presidency had earlier issued a statement which set out the European Union's views on the responsibilities of the coalition, the opportunities presented to the people of Iraq and the contribution which the international community can make to the process of shaping the future of Iraq. The European Union reaffirmed its commitment to the need for the United Nations to play a central role in that process, and its own commitment to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of that country.The Taoiseach and I had a bilateral meeting with Kofi Annan on 16 April. During the meeting the Taoiseach underlined the principles on which our policy is based. We agreed that the first concern must be the well-being of the Iraqi people. They have suffered greatly and deserve a better future. The Taoiseach assured the Secretary General of Ireland's readiness to assist.On 16 April, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, provided the Dáil with a comprehensive statement of our efforts to assist the humanitarian situation in Iraq. There is no need, therefore, to go into detail about that now. I will say only that as regards the longer term reconstruction and administration of Iraq, the precise nature and timing of UN involvement is a matter which must be considered by the Security Council and other competent UN organs. The Government's concern is that the needs and interests of the Iraqi people must be paramount.As the European Union undertakes its largest expansion ever and as it prepares for the future, we must ensure that the Union will work well. The enlarged Union of the future must work at least as effectively and democratically as it has in the past. This will require give and take by everyone. The European Union has a track record of success. We will have to enhance our own long- term national interests, as well as the interests of the Union, by crafting compromises and structures that will ensure that the European Union continues to succeed. In this context the outcome of the European Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference will be of the greatest importance for Europe and for Ireland. I can assure Members of the House that the Government will grasp the opportunity of enlargement to deepen our national engagement with the European Union.On the margins of the informal European Council, the Taoiseach and I met Prime Minister Blair and Foreign Secretary Straw. We discussed developments in the peace process at that time.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Italian Presidency of the European Union will commence in 24 days' time. We have been given to understand that the report of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and the Convention on the Future of Europe, to be produced at Thessaloniki, will address many issues, but not all of them. Some of the policy issues may not be ready for the Thessaloniki meeting. There is a proposal for a gap in proceedings between the end of the convention and the commencement of the intergovernmental conference. It has been suggested that the Intergovernmental Conference will deal with the next stage of European integration and the updating of the treaties, perhaps by means of a constitutional treaty unlike any we have seen heretofore, which could be concluded during the Italian Presidency. It seems that there will be a very tight timeframe, but I do not underestimate the Italians as they have a great capacity to deliver on the day. I advise the Minister, however, that we should make haste slowly if we want to have a proper and adequate debate in this area.It is time for us to be upfront with the public in relation to the issues. I refer not only to those issues that have been put forward by other member states, but also to the issues that we face as a Government and a Parliament. There are differing views in this Parliament about the future role of Ireland in Europe.

I favour challenging the hypocrites in this House who think they have a God-given right to be bigots. They feel they have the right to decide what is right for Ireland and for themselves. They place their own electoral advantage and publicity-seeking before the interests of Europe or Ireland. Some 60 million Europeans died in two world wars in the first half of the last century and the concept behind the EU is to ensure that never happens again. The EU is about peace and stability, which are the prerequisites to prosperity. Certain people in this House, who are not prepared to open their minds to other arguments, make exaggerated and  bigoted claims. They will not put forward their own arguments but prefer to depend on—

This seems to suggest that there will be a front line straight away and that the children of politicians will not be there. Such bigoted, closed-minded nonsense, which has passed here for too long, is comparable to that heard in Northern Ireland which we in the Republic have condemned for the past 75 years. It is time for Members of this House to open up their minds to new issues and ideas and to consider the viewpoints of others. If an argument does not stand up to scrutiny, we should hear the argument against it. I would like to raise a particular point in that context. I believe that the time for a comprehensive debate on Irish neutrality and defence issues has long since passed.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	279	The Government has presided over a form of political lockjaw, which it calls a "triple lock", on defence and security issues. This alleged policy is so pure that it means that Ireland will not participate in peacekeeping exercises that have the support of the United Nations if they are not sanctioned by a UN resolution. We are disabled and not facilitated by this triple lock of Government approval, Dáil sanction and UN sanction. We were unable to participate in an EU peacekeeping force that was sent recently to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is probably a future EU member, despite the fact that the force replaces NATO. The force is supported by the European Union and the United Nations, although the UN's support is not based on a formal resolution. It is nonsense. As a sovereign state, we should decide these matters for  ourselves, based on the merits of each individual case. We should not have bound our hands in this way. It is time to end this sham and the Defence Acts should be amended accordingly.It is time to end Ireland's pretend neutrality and to do so in the context of a European entity. Not only should Ireland be part of a European security architecture, but it should be one of its architects, helping to design a security and defence system that suits our view of what Europe and Ireland need. We cannot do this without an open and healthy debate. If we do not participate in designing a common European defence, the rules will be made by others. Those joining later will take on responsibilities based on the rules made by others. Similarly, those who participate in economic and monetary union are setting the rules and those who join later will do so under the rules made by others. The current convention document, to which the Minister referred, proposes a similar process. The document says that there will be a common defence.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Furthermore, the document says that those who wish to participate in the common defence should sign a declaration of their intent to do so. Anybody who wants to join later will have to sign the declaration. These issues are set out in the document which was circulated to the convention by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. They are being discussed by member states and by EU institutions, including the European Council, but they are taboo here. I saw no reference to the issues in the Minister's speech. Why are they taboo? Why are we not discussing them? Parliament is supposed to be about putting forward different points of view.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The former leader of the Labour Party might be very interested to know that the Secretary General of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions supports my view. I will not embarrass any other senior trade union officials by naming them. Deputy Quinn should not presume that everybody holds the outmoded view of those in this House who have stuck to outmoded mantras without explaining themselves on the floor of the House.I have said for a very long time that if the current convention proposals go ahead, there will be a European common defence for those who are willing to join it. Anyone who wishes to join later will have to take it or leave it – they will have to sign the declaration and join on that basis or  stay out. That does not suit us and we should be seeking to make the rules in a way that suits us. I am keen to put forward my view on this matter as I have held it for some time. Before the Nice Treaty, the Amsterdam and Maastricht treaties contained references to the possibility of the eventual creation of a common defence, if it could be agreed and ratified by all the member states. The treaties genuflected in the direction of the merger of the Western European Union and the EU and, to that end, Javier Solana was secretary general of both the Council of Ministers and the Western European Union, as well as being the EU's high representative for common foreign and security policy.There was a change of mind in the context of the Nice Treaty and the Western European Union was put on the back burner for some reason. This idea is now coming forward again but it is proposed that this will be undertaken through the European Union treaties. I have no difficulty with that. However, if the Article 5 commitment of the Western European Union were to be a full provision of a future EU treaty, any country signing up for the declaration on common defence would automatically have to come to the defence of another member state if that state were attacked. Perhaps I am foolish, but I believe that if a member state was attacked at present, we would probably voluntarily come to its aid, and I would have no difficulty with that. However, I see a difficulty in any automatic requirement that we would come to the aid of another member state if it is attacked.If this goes ahead, we will be either within or outside a common defence. It might be all right to say that we would stay outside a common defence but who will defend us if Ireland is attacked? If there was retaliation against Shannon tomorrow morning, we would not be able to defend ourselves because we are not equipped to defend our neutrality.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The self-seeking appeasers in this House, who tell the people what they want to hear, year after year, will wake up some morning to find that we have a crisis on our hands which we have not equipped the Defence Forces to deal with or joined an alliance to protect against. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth and the appeasers will very quickly change their tune.There is nothing wrong with security and defence. The first duty of a Government and a Parliament is to provide for the security and defence of its citizens. We have a duty as a member of the European Union to participate in and provide for the security and defence of other European Union citizens also. My concern is that we do that on terms acceptable to us. We can only do that if we stop burying our heads in the sand, stop the Paisleyite mantras about security, defence and neutrality, and have a proper debate.There is a way to do this. If there is a merger between the Western European Union treaty and the European Union treaty, or a new treaty which would provide for the contents of both, it is the Article 5 commitment which would create the biggest problem. If we could work to have that as the protocol to a future treaty, we would then have the maximum cover. We would be part of an alliance which would give us defence if we needed it and we could participate, on a case by case basis and by our own decision, in the defence of other member states, if we signed up for everything except the contents of the protocol.That will not come about unless we seek to bring it about. We are saying no, that we are not going to get involved in this debate and that there will be some continuation of the previous policy, which, as far as I know, is not based on any principle other than that of becoming full charter members of NATO the day after partition ends, as described by Sean McBride when he was Minister for External Affairs in 1949. No other principle has been spelled out although other people, such as Mr. Patrick Keatinge, have analysed how policy has developed since then.The time has come for us to say in what circumstances we would participate in a common defence of the European Union. We are now making the rules. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, is in Europe as is Deputy John Bruton, with Deputies Gormley and Carey who are there as alternates. They are doing a good job and trying to participate as best they can. The Committee on European Affairs regularly meets them to review developments and make suggestions. However, this Parliament needs to start hearing the case for a common defence. It is unhealthy and wrong not to do so.I may well be a million miles wrong in my views, and if I am, I would like to hear the arguments against them. However, I am determined to stand up in the House and put those views forward. It is the role of parliamentarians to put the case for and against policy. If my policy is wrong  on this, let me be told where it is wrong without being personally abused and told that my children or the Minister's children will not be in the front line, or without the Minister being told that he will have blood on his hands.We are taking about the safety and security of our citizens and the citizens of Europe, and how we participate in ensuring that security. I am happy to have the opportunity to raise this issue because it is on the agenda – this is the first time it has been on the agenda in such a firm way. The convention states that there will be a common defence. That may or may not remain true at the intergovernmental conference but if it is to remain true, we should seek to bring about a common defence based on rules that suit us. That should be in the context not just of our view of what Ireland needs but Ireland's view of what Europe needs.

Having regard to the burden that will now encompass 25 countries – in effect 27 or 28 if Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey are included – it may be necessary for additional resources to be made available. On behalf of the Labour Party, I would support additional revenue and personnel being made available. I have direct experience of two presidencies and know how enormous the burden is.I welcome the work undertaken by the group of 17 and acknowledge, however belatedly – let me be generous about this – that the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, has made up for lost time. There was apparent indifference at the beginning of the convention but Ireland is now on board and in line with regard to the protection of the Community method.The Labour Party recognises and endorses the validity of what is known as the Community method. By that, I mean the institutional relationship between the role of the Commission to have the exclusive right to initiate legislative proposals and the consequential responsibility of the Council of Ministers, representing the nation states, and the European Parliament, representing the citizens of Europe, to respond legislatively to those proposals. This is the unique genius of the European Union and is why we have had, among other things, 50 years of peace on the Continent and the outer islands of the Union. It is because of the unique form of non-intragovernmentalism. I urge the Minister to maintain the current stand of the Irish Government and that of the other 16 Governments in that regard.If there is one glorious, elegant and architecturally famous monument to the failure of intragovernmentalism on the Continent of Europe, it is the Arc de Triomphe. No other piece of archi tecture inscribes in its stone so many failed battles with horrendous casualties on all sides. When the bigger countries, which have lost their memories of real war, start to talk about intragovernmentalism, they should be reminded of that arch of defeat, not triumph. I endorse the Government's current efforts in this regard.I recognise that the Union is now considering ten new member states and possibly two more. Subject to correction, I think that Ireland only has embassies in five or six of the ten. We have one now in Cyprus but we do not have any in Latvia, Lithuania or Malta. The Minister, in his response, may refer to the Slovak Republic of Slovenia but it is essential that we have full residential embassies in those countries sooner rather than later. Will the Minister, when replying, indicate what the timetable will be to ensure that in the coming years we will have embassies in all member states, including Bulgaria and Romania?I turn now to the work of the convention. Deputy Mitchell may have been incorrect in his countdown of 24 days. We have the month of June in addition to what is left of May before the Italian Presidency. Whatever about that country's elegance in design and efficiency in automobile engineering, its efficiency in terms of political management is not something I admire.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	296	It is a short period of time. The convention should proceed, and I endorse what the Minister said. It should give us as close as 80% of a draft constitutional treaty. I am using the phrase "constitutional treaty" rather than "constitution" because it distinguishes between Bunreacht na hÉireann and the constitutional settlement which will be an amalgamation of the existing treaties. From the point of view of the referendum that will be before us in two years' time, it is important to make that distinction before extreme Nationalists or conservatives on this island say that the Constitution of the Republic has been dismantled by virtue of the proposal for a constitutional treaty. That is a discussion we might have on another day.In so far as the Irish Government has a role to play in the convention, the Minister should suggest that in those areas where there is not agreement within the convention, the convention should give two or three options to the incoming Intergovernmental Conference so that when it convenes after the period of reflection, some time in the middle of October under the Italian Presidency and, presumably, under the Irish Presidency – we will have a treaty of Dublin – the detailed discussion will have been hammered out in the convention and the net political points presented to the Intergovernmental Conference for political resolution.In that context, no more than five or six will hit the Minister's table at that time, some more criti cal than others, but one of the most critical is one in which the Irish Government played a creative role, on which I salute the Minister and his colleagues, and that is the proposal for the election of President of the Commission. As far as the Labour Party is concerned, we want the present institutions to remain. We do not like the idea of a president of the Council. It smacks of the intragovernmentalism I condemned earlier. The efficient management of the work of the Council is a separate issue but we are talking about one President and one Commission. How does that presidency, within the triangle of relationships involving the Council, the Parliament and the Commission, become consolidated so that the young people in the Public Gallery, some of whom will probably be voting for the first time in the European elections next year, can have a sense of ownership or participation in the selection of that president.Earlier this week, on behalf of the convention on Europe, I spoke in Wicklow and described the grubby, smoke-filled rooms in which the deal over the President of the Commission, Mr. Santer, was turned around. The president that everybody wanted was Ruud Lubbers, the Christian Democratic retiring Prime Minister of the Netherlands. He was blocked by Helmut Kohl because the Netherlands, particularly Mr. Lubbers, had some reservations about the precipitous unification of Germany. Anybody living in the Netherlands would have reason for concern about an 80 million population German Federal Republic on their borders. He was blocked, although he was the best choice. John Major decided that he did not like the federalist, integrationist caricature of Jean-Luc Dehaene and they ended up with the man who did not want to be President of the Commission, Mr. Santer. We know what happened to that Commission because Mr. Santer was not the best man for that job.The Labour Party supports the election of the President, ultimately by direct universal suffrage, but the proposal from Deputy John Bruton is premature. We do not have yet a sense of a European policy that will enable that to happen but we should not, in the constitutional settlement of the convention and the treaty, rule out its possible evolution towards universal suffrage. In the meantime, therefore, the idea of the electoral college put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, now has broad support from most of the 17 that the college would elect the president. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that in his reply.I further propose that the nominations for presidential candidate take the following form. They would have to be nominated by a recognised European political party and, in addition, by at least one third of member state Parliaments and the European Parliament. For example, this Parliament could nominate more than one candidate for president. There would be no limitation, as such, on the number of candidates we would nominate but there would be a threshold of eligi bility to get the nomination so that we would not have one-off, unrepresentative persons putting themselves forward.In support of what the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, said, the election should take place on the one day across the three time zones that constitute the European Union and the Dáil, meeting in public session, presented with three or four candidates on the electoral board above us, would, like our STV by-election system, vote for the candidate presented. Each national Parliament, irrespective of size, whether it is Estonia or the Federal Republic of Germany, would make the same choice on the same day within the same three or four hours, and the European Parliament would do the same.There will be 26 units when the next presidential contest takes place – the 25 member state Parliaments and the European Parliament. In the unlikely event of a direct tie, say, 13-13 – the Parliament of Malta would have the same value as the House of Commons in Britain – the deciding vote should be determined by the plurality of the European Parliament. If people make that decision, President Prodi, President Santer, President Jenkins or President Jacques Delors will take on a much greater relevance to the people in the Public Gallery, in the street or those working in this Parliament in that they will be able to say they voted for or against that person. That is what we should do as a first step towards closing the gap in the democratic deficit.I understand and respect the passion and sincerity with which Deputy Mitchell outlines his concern, perhaps his obsession, with mutual defence. Most of the citizens of this country, whether they are from Limerick or Dublin, want mutual defence in Moyross or wherever. They want security on their streets and in their homes. The world has moved on. I cannot conceive of any nation attacking the European Union and I certainly cannot conceive the Government providing the necessary expenditure required to have the sort of army that would enable us to in turn bomb Afghanistan if we were attacked in the way the United States was attacked on 11 September 2001. If Deputy Mitchell is saying we should recognise that Europe has a responsibility to enable itself to provide peace and security out of territory or out of area, to use the NATO phrase, I would say "Yes" to that. This State has been doing that through the United Nations. The fact that the United States has systematically undermined the United Nations by its excessive use of the veto within the Security Council on the one hand and its consistent refusal over time to pay its fair share of financial resources to that institution on the other does not mean that the United Nations has failed as an institution. It simply means that one of the main members of that organisation has consistently undermined it.In retrospect, the tragedy is that when the Berlin Wall came down and the Cold War came to an end, not just was the Warsaw Pact dissolved but NATO was dissolved also.The world would be a better place if there was no NATO and there was a northern hemisphere defence union in its stead comprising a north American, EU and eastern Asian-CIS pillars, which would not carry the baggage of American imperialism, aggression and exploitation that can be seen in Iraq. Deputy Gay Mitchell is smiling.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I refer the Deputy and others, lest they are under any illusion about America's bona fides, to the company that Vice-President Cheney formerly presided over as chief executive, and from which he made his personal fortune. That company has been given the contract by the US not only to quench the fires in the oil fields in Iraq but to take responsibility for the production and distribution of Iraqi oil. That is imperialism in my lexicon.The notion that the sovereign republic of the US could give out a contract to exploit the Corrib gas field, take the proceeds, deduct its operating expenses and possibly throw something into the kitty of the Irish people, is as repugnant to me as any form of exploitation or invasion. I will not get into a discussion about the rights and wrongs of that issue and a debate about common defence and security is for another day.However, Europe must recognise it is confronted by the sole megapower in the world, which feels, according to today's newspaper reports, that it has the right to write the rules as it goes along. I welcome anything that will act as a counterbalance to the US and such a counterbalance should be the EU operating properly and democratically. The real task in places such as Palestine and Iraq is not how the peace is secured but how the prosperity is consolidated. The US and British invasion of Iraq is evidence of a great military capacity to pull down an infrastructure and a great inability to put something in its place.I ask the Minister to address the questions I put to him and to indicate when the Intergovernmental Conference will conclude.

He used the term in reference to me in a interview on Newstalk 106 recently and that is regrettable. The Minister has direct experience of Dr. Paisley and I leave it to others to judge whether I am in the same mould.Article 2 of the new European constitution refers to European values, which are democracy and tolerance. I hope there will be more tolerance of other Members' points of view in this Chamber.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I also hope there will be more democracy within the EU. How democratic is the convention? I compliment my colleagues on the convention who worked hard. We also worked well as a team. However, the majority of the convention's members spoke against the proposal for a president of the Council yet it has been included as an article in the constitution. No one spoke in favour of a congress yet it appears as a proposal.Kimmo Kiljunen, a Finnish socialist, when referring to democracy in the Union said we have borrowed from other constitutions and concepts and the new Europe comprises the presidency of the US, the congress of the People's Republic of China and the politburo of the Soviet Union. While that is humorous, there is a certain truth to it because there will be further centralisation and less democracy as the Union moves away from its people.The Laaken Summit was about bringing people closer to the Union but that is not happening in the convention. I applaud the work of the so-called "17 dwarves" but I wonder how much headway they will make because they are functioning as a big boys' club and an old boys' network. The presidium was formed and Giscard d'Estaing told the convention he was listening. I stated in my contribution, "You say you are listening, but have you heard us?"  That is not the case.There is an issue regarding the president of the Council. Deputy John Bruton has put forward a sensible solution but my amendment supports the Government position of an electoral college. It makes perfect sense, as Deputy Quinn said, but let us see how far we get.There is also an issue relating to the Commission. The attitude of Giscard d'Estaing and a number of my German colleagues is that they do not want a Commission in which 80% of the commissioners represent 20% of the population. They do not understand where we are coming from on this issue and that is why there is an article in the constitution which reduces the Commission to 14. I predicted this would happen during the Nice treaty debate. I could see this coming because I knew where the Commission was headed. The Government's position is that it will give in on many issues but it will try to maintain the Commission's current composition.Ireland will also give in on defence. I agree with Deputy Gay Mitchell that we are going down the road of a common defence. It has been inserted in the constitution in many different guises. I tabled amendments and I take it the Government has also done so. Article 30.2 states, "This will lead to a common defence when the European Council, acting unanimously, so decides."  However, Article 30.7 states, "Until such time as the European Council has acted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, closer co-operation shall be established, in the Union framework, as regards as mutual defence."  I asked the Minister at the Forum on Europe  about his attitude to this and he indicated it was acceptable.Article X is the solidarity clause. I was a member of the defence working group and I was under the impression, as were many others, that this clause was supposed to be about humanitarian aid in times of crisis. However, the article is intended, "to prevent a terrorist threat."  That is what the Americans were trying to do in Iraq through their pre-emptive strike. Is the Minister concerned that Ireland will be a party to the clause?The same issue is raised in the article relating to a European arms agency, as another mutual defence clause is enshrined in it. I assume Ireland will join the agency but the article states, "A participating Member State, which is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, shall inform the other participating States of the situation and may request aid and assistance from them."  We are being dragged down the road towards mutual defence in a number of ways.The people do not want this. There is still a devotion to neutrality and, while it may be misplaced, as Deputy Gay Mitchell said, if we join the European arms agency, there is no question that our defence spending will increase substantially. Currently, Ireland has the lowest defence spending within the EU at 0.75% of GEP. That will have to be increased to bring it up to the average and to increase what is known as European capability. From my experience on the defence working group this essentially concerns the boosting of the arms trade within Europe. Do we want to be part of that? I say "No".I hope we can continue our work and wish the Minister and my colleagues well. I hope that in the next few weeks we can concentrate our minds and make the necessary amendments. I hope we are listened to and that we see democracy work within the European Union. I hope too that we can involve more people in the process. The best way to do that is to have a European referendum. We should have referendums and plebiscites throughout the Union to see what European citizens think of this new constitution.

While I do not necessarily agree with much of its contents there is some good in it. We need to come up with a way to provide that the matters on which there is agreement are not thrown out if it happens that the treaty is not accepted, as would have happened with the Nice treaty if it was rejected in one country. We must ensure that all the good aspects, which have been debated and thrashed out in the convention up to now and which will be debated  and thrashed out at the Intergovernmental Conference over the next couple of months, are not lost.I also acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche. He has been involved in trying to create an alliance or meeting of minds of small countries in the European Union, and of small countries which are joining it now that the accession treaty is signed, which have a similar history and background to ours. That is good.While it is a restatement of much that is already stated, it is good that the Athens declaration was made. It can be referred to and we can, if we want, call the European project to account for not delivering on some of the sentiments within it. These are to be valued but they are not taken seriously by some of our European leaders.We have an instance already of the Italian Prime Minister saying that he would welcome states with Christian roots to the European Union. That amounts to religious discrimination. Why just Christian values? We know that one of the countries he is talking about is Turkey. We have had many problems with the Turkish regime over the years but the country should not be excluded on the basis of the religious make-up of its people.The declaration also speaks about the Union continuing to enhance its civilian and military capacities to ensure stability beyond its borders. That is totally contradictory to being the Union of a genuine area of freedom. We, in Ireland, need to set a standard or counterbalance towards a demilitarisation of Europe or the world. We should be looking at the non-proliferation or the non-existence of nuclear weapons. The Athens declaration states that we are determined to work at all levels to tackle global terrorism and stem the weapons of mass destruction. It is hypocritical for countries to declare this when many of our European partners are the makers of these weapons of mass destruction and have more in their possession than Iraq could ever have dreamt of possessing. This needs to be one of the prime focuses as we enlarge. We must get rid of these weapons of mass destruction so that they do not fall into the hands of anybody or—

Demilitarisation needs to happen across the board, including in the countries producing the weapons. There is no comparison between semtex and nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons will not prevent terrorist attacks in America, Shannon or wherever. The way to prevent attack is to share the wealth we hold in Europe.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the matter of the European Council meeting in Athens. When one reads and listens to the declaration which refers to ending centuries of conflict, respect for diver sity, mutual understanding, respect for human dignity, liberty, human rights and a Union devoted to the practice of tolerance, justice and solidarity, one gets the impression that the EU is doing a great job and its citizens are all happy with the situation. In reality, for many people, the opposite is the case. When one looks at the recent record of, for example, Britain and Spain on the Iraq issue, and even our own record of privately supporting the war, which meant the death of innocent civilians and 18 year old conscripts with white flags, their statement seems shallow indeed.I praise France and Germany for their position on the war. I encourage Irish people to ignore the recommendations of President Bush in regard to boycotting French products and urge them to buy French wine.Before they got down to business at the Council the members breached their own guidelines and vision. This is unacceptable. European Union citizens deserve better.I welcome the support of our European colleagues for our peace process. I was annoyed yesterday by the spin and comments of the Minister in regard to this process. I have always supported the peace process. Long before there were ceasefires and before it was trendy or fashionable I was directly involved in conflict resolution strategies. I will not accept any lectures from Ministers about my support and defence of the Northern minority.I am not neutral. I am not an honest broker. I am on the side of the Northern minority. If Cabinet Ministers want to be honest brokers, let them join the UN or the Red Cross. Ministers are elected to represent the interests of the people. The Minister should remind his colleague in Cabinet, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, of that situation.With regard to the Athens Summit, I welcome the discussion on drugs and immigration. I am concerned about the fortress Europe attitude within the EU which is creeping into our country. We must also be vigilant in regard to racism. We have seen the rise of the BNP in the local council elections in England. This is a major cause of concern. Fortunately, Ireland does not have that type of party or candidate but it is something against which we must be vigilant.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	314	In relation to the embassy programme, as the Deputy will be aware, we have set an objective of making sure we have formal residential accreditation in the applicant states as soon as possible and have started the process. As we want to make sure we discharge our obligations to the applicant states, they remain at the top of the list in respect of the potential extension of the embassy network. We first have Cyprus, Slovenia and other countries to which to attend. The objective is to have full coverage in the next two to three years.In relation to when the Intergovernmental Conference might start and finish, this will become more clear at Thessalonika. We will see what convention report emanates from the meeting, what level of consensus emerges and what particular problems remain for further discussion at political level at the Intergovernmental Conference.In relation to procedure, the indications are that we will have the report on 20 June, after which there will be a period of reflection. In some Nordic countries the Government is required to receive certain legislative approvals before obtaining a mandate to take part in an Intergovernmental Conference. The Italian Government appeared to indicate that a working group would continue to work on the text of the treaty after the report is submitted to the convention and pending completion of the period of reflection.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	316	Yes. There is a possibility of a summit being called in early October to begin the Intergovernmental Conference. The question of whether it will be completed during the Italian Presidency or continue to our Presidency depends on the level of consensus which can be reached on the content and issues to be addressed. The proposal is to complete the Intergovernmental Conference prior to the accession date of 1 May 2004 as this would feed into the parliamentary elections and the appointment of the Commission and allow everything to come on stream under the new arrangements thereafter. While it is a little early to say what will be the timescale, that is the general plan envisaged.The question of what the treaty will be called is a matter for the Council to decide. As the Deputy will be aware, there is, due to the seminal nature of the treaty, a strong belief among many member states in the Rome to Rome cycle. We take a pragmatic approach. We will take up the obligations of trying to complete the treaty if it passes on to our Presidency and simply concentrate on the need to find a genuine consensus that will meet the requirements of the circumstances, rather than worrying about whether the treaty is concluded during our term.

The Minister referred to aid. Apart from the €5 million in aid allocated by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, has the Government provided any other form of assistance to the Iraqi people?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The UN Secretary General was well aware and appreciative of our consistent position on the war, which we explained. We also explained our vote on Resolution 1441 in October, on which we followed through. The Taoiseach obviously spoke to the Secretary General prior to the meeting in Hillsborough with President Bush and Prime Minister Blair at which he had an opportunity to discuss with them the broad UN position on these matters.The focus of our discussion at the meeting with the Secretary General was not arguments about the rights or wrongs of the war. The Secretary General was strongly focused on the reconstruction effort and the provision of a stable environment in which this could take place. He emphasised to us that he was not seeking that the UN enter Iraq in place of the occupying forces, whom he regarded as the people in situ to secure the environment and who have obligations under the Geneva Conventions of which they are cognisant.He was also focused on discussions with the United States, Britain and coalition forces on how  the UN agencies could enter Iraq in the short-term to undertake humanitarian efforts and the longer-term UN role both in terms of interim administration arrangements which would be endorsed by the UN and the question of the international legitimacy of any subsequent Government which may emerge in the longer term. We were totally ad idem with the Secretary General and very supportive of the manner in which he envisaged this evolving process proceeding. The roll-over of the oil for food programme will come up in June or July and discussions are currently feeding into the Security Council on all the relevant issues.At the informal Council meeting in Rhodes last weekend, I strongly emphasised our hope that the Security Council will discharge its responsibilities, achieve a consensus on all these issues and make sure its role is provided for. Secretary General Kofi Annan has an action orientated programme in mind to ensure this final objective is achieved.Apart from being required for the release of funds under the oil for food programme, UN approval is also required before international financial institutions can get involved in the reconstruction of Iraq and, in so far as the European Union is concerned, for Commissioner Patten's proposals for providing aid. From memory, €700 million will be made available by the EU for a reconstruction programme in Iraq, which roughly corresponds with the moneys being spoken about by the US. These issues are ongoing. Our discussions with the Secretary General were cordial and constructive and we were in full agreement.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Ultimately, what emerges from the Convention on the Future of Europe and the Intergovernmental Conference will be a civilised trade-off in negotiations and discussions between Governments. This is welcome as it is the way business should be done between democratic states. In relation to such trade-offs, the Minister appears to have changed his position in an area of Government policy. On 16 April he stated he would take a constructive view of changing the veto on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Will he inform the House of the reasons for his apparent change of policy and whether it was wise to indicate a possible change in policy, given that the nature of these negotiations is that trade-offs often occur towards the end? What are the principles behind this apparent change in policy?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	320	In terms of the internal and external coherence of the European Union in the future, particularly after enlargement, the policy triangle which will inform the articulation of the values fundamental to the European Union's work are the three principles of a healthy transatlantic relationship with the United States, commitment to multilateral institutions and common European foreign, security and defence policies.Given the military preponderance of the United States in terms of its military power – the sole  super power in the world – when one looks at how the European Union can bring greater influence in terms of its policies and position to many of the intractable problems of the world, whether it is conflicts, development aid issues, world poverty, globalisation etc., it is clear that the influence of the United States in economic terms vis-à-vis the European Union is based on equal partnership. There is a mutually assured damage issue which regulates that relationship in a way which ensures the type of prosperous peace, stability and democracy that we have secured since the European Union was founded.However, in the political and security area the European Union is not making sufficient impact in terms of espousing its values and ensuring that they are respected throughout the world in areas where we can influence issues, such as the Middle East etc. There is a need, therefore, to strengthen the common foreign and security policy if we want to improve the external coherence of the European Union. I cannot think of any issue where our essential national interests are put at stake by ensuring that there is sufficient content and purpose in our common foreign and security policy which is not weakened by the prospect of a veto being available from any one of the 25 member states. These issues must be taken into account as we move from 15 to 25 member states where there are different stages of development. It is not a homogenous Union in terms of its economic status and development. A more diverse and challenging set of proposals and policy issues face the enlarged Union as we move forward.If we want to have influence, if we want the European Union to be an equal partner in the quartet in relation to Middle East policy, if we want our proposals in relation to upholding multilateral institutions as part of regulating the international order, if we want to see what we can do in relation to development aid issues and if we want to make an impact, it is clear that the common foreign and security policy must be strengthened and the veto must be avoided in relation to the establishment of that policy, with the one proviso that if an essential national interest can be identified as being at stake, one would be allowed to be apart from that policy position. It is a matter of procedure as to how that can be done. However, as a matter of principle, I do not see what we have to fear from that. If we want our positions to be advanced around the world, having them as part of a common policy regime of the European Union, not a unified policy to fit all situations, which sets out in substance common principles that inform our policy in any area would greatly enhance Ireland's influence. It would be better than being on our own. We could not do as well in the WTO on our own as under the European Union umbrella. We could not do as well in working with common partners in developing our development aid policies in Africa, for example. It would be splendid isolation.We should be part of that debate and we should be open to matters. We should rationally and intellectually contribute and be constructive. We should be comfortable with that policy direction. The Iraqi situation was the exception rather than the rule. We agree in the European Union on many of the main policy issues in the common foreign and security policy debate. We agree about many of the world's problems. Iraq was an exception. People then tried to draw from that a unifying theory to suggest that the common foreign and security policy had been destroyed and that there was no prospect of re-establishing consensus or unity again. That is an exaggerated view taken from the general proposition which the empirical evidence is against.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I welcome what the Minister said. Do I take it that the formal position of the Government is to cede the Irish veto in respect of a common foreign and security policy if that was the ultimate outcome and that it would be decided by QMV? Has the General Affairs Council discussed the question of the European Union taking up a post on the Security Council? As regards reform of the Security Council, will there be a European Union seat and perhaps a Japanese, Brazilian and Indian seat as well? Has that matter been formally or informally discussed?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	322	What is the bottom line, as far as the Government is concerned, on the Commission? Is it the case that we must retain the agreement reached at Nice or is the Minister prepared to give way on that as well? Does he agree with the assessment of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, that the president of the convention, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, has an autocratic approach? Does he also agree that defining consensus in terms of demographics or population is completely unacceptable?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	323	As the Minister knows, I strongly support Deputy Gay Mitchell's principles in relation to European defence and security. We accept the Minister's bona fides in that area. What impact are recent events in the European Union, whereby a number of states decided to form an alliance in relation to defence and security matters, likely to have on the treaty? To what extent did they influence the discussions which took place in Athens? What role, purpose and function will the alliance have in the future? Would it intervene in a situation similar to that in Bosnia or the former Yugoslavia where all the principal players were still available? Will the new alliance be prepared to intervene? Have questions been raised about that issue?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	324	As regards our position, we are favourably disposed to considering the suggestion of QMV in the common foreign and security pol icy area. We must look at the text, but we are not shying away from it.As regards reform of the Security Council, that question has been with us for a long time. I do not see many of the permanent incumbents on the Security Council changing their position. They are probably open to additions, but I do not think they will withdraw their own positions. Some of the problems with the common foreign and security policy at European Union level arise when the two permanent EU members disagree. Sometimes the sum total of our policy cannot get beyond that threshold. That is a real concern. That is why it is important that we devise a way through an early warning mechanism to discuss these issues in advance of them arising. They have an impact in terms of how the European Union is viewed and they also have an impact on our coherence and on the spirit of the Union which is about trying to achieve consensus through the Community method on such difficult issues.As regards the Commission, it is important that we do not look at this negotiation on the basis of each individual issue. We want a broad institutional balance. We are trying to achieve consensus. We have preferred positions. As regards the Commission, for example, we believe that equality is an important aspect of the Commission. We believe that having dealt with it at Nice, it would be best to leave it. However, we must consider the consensus. We are in the process of negotiation. We cannot negotiate on the basis of saying that we will not accept anything other than this. We must enter into the spirit of negotiation on the basis that we want to maintain the institutional balance because that is at the heart of the workability and efficiency of the Union.There are issues regarding the continuity and efficiency of an enlarged entity. It is in our interests to have an effective European Union which works and a globalised open economy like ours needs a Union with the best prospects of effective decision making. That is important to us. It does not mean that we do not regard the question of institutional balance as being important – we do. It is a matter of getting the perspective and context of these issues together so that we have a negotiated outcome which, as in every negotiation, will probably have pluses and minuses. No-one will be totally satisfied with everything, as there are 25 members trying to reach consensus, but on the balance of convenience or any objective analysis we will want something far more in our favour than against us. That is what we must achieve in any negotiation and it is what I would regard as success.As regards the group of four meeting, the important point is that no group of states try to take it upon themselves to speak on behalf of the Union. By the same token we do not want a form of censorship whereby people do not sit down and discuss things. Governments discuss issues of mutual concern and common perspective all the  time. The important point is that it is brought into the Community framework to add value to the discussion so that again, through the Community method, we obtain outcomes which are consistent with treaty provisions.Regarding security and defence matters, because there are sensitivity issues for us, the retention of sovereign decisions in terms of our participation is a critical factor. That is an important discretion and manoeuvre we retain and it is something we would like to continue to achieve in these negotiations.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Before we come to questions, there is a printing error regarding Question No. 5, which should be in the name of Deputy Lynch.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I propose to take Priority Question No. 1 and Questions Nos. 81 to 84, inclusive, together.The National Competitiveness Council reports to the Taoiseach and me every year on key com petitiveness issues for the Irish economy. In its most recent annual competitiveness report, in 2002, the council acknowledged that, over the last decade, the Irish economy has enjoyed significant advances, allowing convergence across key areas with many of our competitors. A virtuous circle of low inflation, moderate wage increases, lower taxes and higher productivity was maintained and, as a result, the economy has been extremely competitive in recent years.The council does not rank countries as a whole or assign a single position on competitiveness, but rather examines their competitiveness under specific relevant headings or indicators to determine progress, or otherwise, in the areas concerned. For example, the most recent report makes clear that in the period 1997 to 2002, the five-year percentage change in total employment in Ireland was the highest recorded, at 25.3%, and ranked us first among all comparator countries.I am aware that there are various international scoreboarding reports which rank countries regarding various aspects of competitiveness. In particular I note that the last published global competitiveness report, produced by the World Economic Forum, recorded Ireland slipping in the period 2001-02 from 11th to 24th place under growth competitiveness index rankings, while it improved from 22nd to 20th place under microeconomic competitiveness index rankings. In the period 1998 to 2002, which is the earliest starting date recorded in the report, Ireland slipped from 13th place to 20th under these microeconomic indicators.The World Competitiveness Yearbook 2002, which is produced by the Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, ranked Ireland in tenth place, a drop of three places from its 1998 position. Looking to the future and having regard to the difficult economic conditions now prevailing, I agree that we must vigorously address the key competitiveness issues, particularly those that impact on inflation.The Government is already taking measures to improve our competitiveness which will play a critical role in the fight against inflation. These include: strengthening competition across the economy and implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance; increasing investment in research, technology and innovation which will provide the basis for future productivity growth; and continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as broadband telecommunications.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	327	My question was whether there were any new initiatives being taken by the Government regarding improving our economic competitiveness. There was a Cabinet meeting this week at which this matter was expected to be discussed. I do not know if it was discussed or not or whether the Minister emerged with any new proposals to deal with the deterioration in our economic competitiveness. Approximately 800  jobs a week are being lost, many of them as a result of employers having to meet indirect costs imposed by the Government. These include higher indirect taxation announced in the budget, the lack of progress on infrastructure, research and development issues and insurance costs.The Minister and the Taoiseach were told what had to be done in December 2001 by the National Competitiveness Council and that we were slipping in terms of competitiveness. What are the new initiatives the Government is contemplating arising from the meeting this week?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	328	We have developed enormously over the last six years. We cannot hanker back to the days when we had relatively low wages and could compete with the large available labour pool of unemployed people. That meant there was an employer's choice. Today it is different – it is an employer's choice in the main, notwithstanding the change in global circumstances.Unemployment here is among the lowest in the EU at 4.5%. The EU average is 8% and it is 10% in Germany. The bar has risen and we must rise to that challenge. That is why we have made a priority of investment in research. Last year we doubled investment in research in my Department, notwithstanding a reduction of 5% in the Vote.There are some factors which affect our competitiveness because we are so globalised – we trade 180% of our GNP – and which are beyond our control. These factors include interest rates, currency exchanges and so on. There are factors within our control, like matching wage increases to productivity increases, and it is important that that underpins the new programme which has been negotiated, as well as introducing more competition in the economy. As we do that I hope Deputy Hogan and his party will support us. Vested interests must be taken on in areas where we do not have adequate competition and where consumers are paying more than they should for products and services. I am delighted to acknowledge that inflation is on a downward turn but we must do much better, as 4.3% is still too high.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I am delighted the Minister gave me a lecture on what she has and has not been doing for the last six years. It is nice to know she is six years in office and sees no problem with the fact that our competitive position is deteriorating. The Government has put €35 a week on every job in this country since the last election in the form of indirect tax increases. If the Minister and the Government see no problem with our economic competitiveness they are living in an ivory tower. The failure to substantially improve funding for local government means local authorities are imposing additional waste charges and commercial rates far beyond what was expected and beyond the rate of inflation. Those costs are borne by consumers and businesses and are costing jobs. I hope the Minister takes new initiatives  arising from this much-trumpeted Government meeting last Tuesday. Obviously nothing was discussed or decided regarding competitiveness.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	330	In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure CE, or community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,000. There were 24,991 participants on CE at the end of 2002 and this number will reduce to a projected participation rate of 20,000 by the end of 2003.FÁS prioritises CE projects according to the types of services provided and levels of unemployment in the locality and co-ordinates reductions in CE places so as to minimise any negative effects on groups and services most in need of the programme. Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.The Government is aware of the important contribution that CE has made to the development of services for local communities over the years and the difficulties which now arise for sponsor organisations in the voluntary and community sector due to the reduction in the level of funding available for the programme. In this context a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. In addition, the PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes is being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, chaired by my Department. FÁS is also currently undertaking an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the delivery of com munity services and appropriate levels of CE for the future.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Will the Minister of State accept that the decision in 1999 to savage community employment schemes was one of the most socially regressive moves taken by the current Administration? Will he further accept that we have all received sheaves of correspondence from voluntary and community groups across the country? I have with me correspondence from Our Lady's Island work and care group. These are the people the Minister of State says will be protected. Such people are working with senior citizens and youth and play groups. I have a list of people who have contacted me, such as Bridgetown Community Council and the People's Resource Centre. They are fearful of their future and have already been robbed of vital community supports.Will the Minister of State, at this late stage, relent and not axe one in every five community employment positions in the country? Will he accept that the policy now being pursued has brought uncertainty to those schemes and has shown a lack of value and appreciation for the remarkable work undertaken by such groups? He is condemning many people to unemployment.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I accept there are difficulties as a result of the changes taking place. These changes are necessary in view of the overall situation with regard to the employment market. We had a 5.5% rate of long-term unemployment when CE was at its height in 1988 with 39,000 people involved. The figure for 2002 was 1.3% long-term unemployment with CE figures reduced to 20,000. The Deputy will be aware that significant numbers of people in this country are working on permits. We have to take note of the changing employment situation. We are aware of the difficulties experienced by schemes across the country. I suggest there is more fear than is necessary in that the figures are not devastating. Some 20,000 people will be employed in CE schemes at the end of this year. That is a reduction of 24,900 on last year's figure.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	333	One in five.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	334	There has been a reduction in schemes across the country. The reviews I referred to are looking at new policy initiatives which will enable CE, on a more structured basis, to provide a quality service to the community. The Deputy is aware that CE grew on an ad hoc basis to the extent that it was a labour market mechanism for long-term unemployed people. It was never a policy initiative to make it a significant service to the community, yet it has become one. I agree it provides a significant range of services across a whole series of sectors. It is opportune that we review the situation at this point. We need to ensure CE operates on a sound structured basis albeit with a smaller number of people involved.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	335	The Minister of State has rightly and properly acknowledged that valuable community work is being done by CE. Will he also acknowledge that taking away those places means there is no one available to do that work? It makes no sense to rob communities of this support until the Minister of State is in a position to provide the elderly and youth with the services, such as sports and recreation, which he has acknowledged are currently being provided by CE.On the Minister of State's commitment to the FÁS review of CE, I raised a similar question with him in March and was told the review would be finalised shortly. He has used the same phrase today. When will we see it?
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I am satisfied from the discussions I had with sponsors, FÁS and other participants around the country, that we can provide effective community services with fewer people. The review will examine how we can ensure cost effectiveness in the provision of the services now being provided by FÁS. Everybody will accept that some FÁS schemes are not operating cost effectively. It is quite evident we are not getting a return from groundsmen on sports pitches. There is room for a review. The FÁS review has been completed and we expect a draft of it in the next two weeks,
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	337	While I very much regret the recent job losses announced by Pall, Tipperary, I assure the Deputy that the State development agencies under the aegis of my Department are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in south Tipperary, including Tipperary town. The agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, as well as other local bodies and interests in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development in south Tipperary. In that respect, a sub-committee of the Tipperary County Development Board has been set up, in which IDA Ireland, FÁS and Enterprise Ireland will participate, to examine what initiatives can be developed for Tipperary town and ways of attracting potential foreign direct investment. This is the most appropriate forum in which to address the development needs of the area.In regard to the job losses announced by the company, FÁS has already been in contact with company representatives to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made  redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS has offered to make available its full range of support services, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. It will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.In addition, Enterprise Ireland's south-east region office, in association with the management of the Tipperary Enterprise and Technology Centre and Tipperary South Riding County Enterprise Board, has already held a clinic for the staff of Pall who wish to consider self-employment. IDA Ireland will continue to promote Tipperary to potential investors and the agency will also develop its business park in Tipperary town as an additional attraction. Planning permission has recently been secured to carry out an upgrade of the park by improving the entrance road and landscaping the site. An advance technology building of 16,000 square feet will be built on the park this year. Additionally, the former Namco building of 60,000 square feet is available and is being actively marketed by the agency.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Will the Tánaiste accept that special measures are needed to promote employment and investment in Tipperary town? Some years ago, the Tánaiste established a very successful task force in Clonmel at the demise of Seagate. Will she agree that a task force with the authority of her office would be more appropriate than the local initiatives outlined, particularly given that unemployment levels in Tipperary town have reached 12%, three times the national unemployment average? Will she accept that the people of Tipperary town have made huge financial contributions to promoting social and economic conditions in the town through initiatives like the Excel company, the IT resource centre and the Canon Hayes sports centre? In view of those financial contributions and the work people of the town did, the Government would need to complement those measures, particularly by way of a task force with the authority of her office.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	339	It is not feasible, nor would it be practical, to establish a task force in every town that has suffered job losses. Job losses are constantly happening, even in the best days. Thankfully we have also had job gains, and the Deputy mentioned some of them. Even in County Tipperary, notwithstanding the job losses, there are a considerable number of people on work permits, in both north and south Tipperary. Therefore jobs are being created and employers have had to look outside the local market to fill many of these jobs.The immediate challenge is to find alternative investment in the town. I accept that Tipperary town has not done as well as Clonmel, where Guidant employs more than 1,000 people and is expanding rapidly. The sub-group established by  the development board, which includes IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and FÁS, is the appropriate body to look at the issues in the area which can help to promote the attraction of Tipperary town for investment.Of course we must not put all our eggs in the foreign direct investment basket. The vast majority of people who work in the private sector in Ireland work for Irish companies and clearly we must look at possibilities for Irish investment in Tipperary town as well as foreign direct investment.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Will the Minister agree that Tipperary town is a special case because unfortunately the town has been bereft of employment over recent years? We have had nothing but closures in the town and, as I have said, even prior to these closures our unemployment rate was approximately 12%. In those special circumstances of Tipperary town, will the Minister reconsider establishing a task force with the authority of her office and in that regard will she agree to meet a deputation from the local town council?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I am not in a position to establish a task force. We do not have the resources to set up task forces in every area and, notwithstanding what the Deputy said, I cannot make a special case for Tipperary town. I will give consideration to his request that I meet a deputation but, as the Deputy will be aware, I have met a number of deputations from Tipperary. I am happy to meet a deputation – now that I recall, I think I have already agreed to meet a deputation from Tipperary town as soon as possible.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The insurance reform programme, which I announced on 25 October, comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments. Substantial progress is being made on a range of measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market here.I have already brought in regulations requiring insurers to give policyholders 15 working days notice for renewal of motor insurance policies and also requiring no claims bonus information to be provided with renewal notices. These are designed to facilitate policyholders make price comparisons.The interim Personal Injuries Assessment Board is up and running and legislation is being prepared to establish PIAB on a statutory basis. I intend to bring an outline of the Bill to Government for approval shortly and publish it immediately with a view to having the final Bill introduced in the Oireachtas in the autumn and passed by the end of the year.Penalty points for speeding offences have been introduced by the Minister for Transport and it is intended to extend them to other driving offences such as not having insurance and not wearing seat belts. Initial indications are that they have a very positive effect and the Minister is seeking reduced insurance premiums for non-offending motorists in return for access to the penalty point data.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is preparing a Bill to reform the law on personal injuries which will include measures to deal with spurious and exaggerated claims, the issue of costs arising from unsuccessful claims and double compensation.My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a final report will be produced in the early part of 2004.The 31% reduction in the cost of insurance, referred to by Deputy Hogan, was an estimate by the insurance federation of the reduction that could be anticipated if all the recommendations in the insurance reform programme were implemented. In view of the short time which has elapsed since the announcement of the reform programme, it is too early to say what the precise reduction will be. I am, however, determined that significant reductions will be achieved across all insurance headings as a result of the implementation of the programme.It is heartening to note the recent reported comments from a number of the major motor insurers here that further increases in premiums may not be necessary at present and, in one case, that they have already reduced premiums since the beginning of this year. As implementation of the measures contained in the reform programme continues, I would expect this trend to continue.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	343	In her statement on the announcement of the action plan last October, the Minister stated that she would reduce insurance premia by 31% over a period of, I think, 18 months. The Irish Insurance Federation, if it gave her those figures, will therefore have to justify the figures, just as the Minister will.Giving people the opportunity, as consumers, to shop around is laudable, but what purpose is there to shopping around? There are only four or five undertakings in this jurisdiction quoting for insurance at present and therefore there is no competition. If you go into an insurance broker  looking for motor insurance or public liability cover, you will be told about the finite market and implementation of that recommendation will have no effect in the absence of competition in the market.Behind all the spin of the insurance companies, motor insurance premia have gone up by an average of 15% since the beginning of the year, there has been a 10% increase in household insurance premia and a massive 25% increase in public liability insurance. The latter increase is in addition to the 100% increase, approximately, in the premia for public liability insurance cover in the past two years, which is crippling small business.Another sector which is finding this issue increasingly difficult is the community group sector, particularly in the case of playground facilities. I received representations today from Newmarket Community Council. Even though the people in charge of the town park were able to hand over the children's playground facility to Cork County Council to take on the risk of insurance cover, they now cannot get insurance cover. Up to March 2003, they were paying €1,000 a month for it. They are now unable to get insurance cover from the insurance companies for the rest of the year for facilities such as pitch and putt, annual parades such as the St. Patrick's Day parade or even for anything to do with casual labour employed to do the odd job in the town park. It is a worry for those conducting summertime activities and communities, but also for business.If the PIAB is the key proposal in the Minister's action plan, which it is, that needs to be fast-tracked as quickly as possible. The heads of the Bill were supposed to be published after Easter and we are waiting for it. If this is to be the panacea towards reducing costs of insurance, however, it should get the support of every one of us to ensure that this is brought forward as quickly as possible and implemented without delay.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The interim committee is drafting the legislation. It has completed its work and submitted it to me, and I will bring it to the Government with a view to its publication. There is competition, although perhaps not enough, but five companies is four more than there are in some sectors where there is no competition. We will not get increased competition in a market that is archaic and that is why the reforms to which I referred on the courts' side are so urgent.The cost of taking claims here is excessive because of the number of experts and lawyers involved and that is why PIAB will provide an informal cheaper paper-based way of settling claims where liability is not in dispute.On the issue of insurance for community groups, as far back as 1991 the council, when I  was a member, had stopped putting in playgrounds, believe it or not, because it could not afford to take out the public liability insurance on them. There are real issues for communities and local authorities. That is why the reform programme is my No. 1 priority. It is getting more attention than anything else and by the end of this year the Deputy will certainly see results.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I have noted the movements in the recently published consumer price index and wholesale price index to which Deputy Lynch refers. The wholesale food price index is heavily influenced by commodity exports which may not be important elements in the purchases of Irish retailers. Furthermore, wholesale prices of goods supplied to retailers are only one component of the final retail price. It may be that movements in other components of cost at retail level are responsible for the apparent divergence between wholesale and retail food prices. While these statistics are not evidence that consumers are being exploited, we need to examine carefully the barriers to competition in the retail sector. I have requested my Department to pursue this as a matter of urgency and make appropriate recommendations. The Competition Authority will no doubt take into consideration these developments in its ongoing competition enforcement work.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	348	When talking about how consumers in this country are being ripped off it is very difficult to know where to start because they are being ripped off by so many people. The main culprit since last May or June has been the Government. Within the elements in the consumer price index, fish, which should be part of our everyday diet, decreased at the processing stage by 4% and increased at the retail end by 7%. This means an overall increase of almost 12%.The Government met on 6 May because it suddenly dawned on it that the average person was being ripped off at such a rate that it should now be a priority. I listened earlier to the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, being interviewed about this issue on a local radio station. He said that, as a result of the meeting on 6 May,  the Government was about to introduce a major initiative on inflation. While that may not come as a surprise to the Government, it came as a surprise to me.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The most effective way of dealing with inflationary pressures in any market is through enhanced competition and consumers shopping around. There is a huge divergence between the prices people pay for petrol between different areas. However, we may now be so affluent that we have become insensitive to the prices we pay. The same happens in the licensed trade. In an economy where wages are rising and where those wage increases have to be matched by productivity and performance improvements, the tool available to Government is competition policy. Where there are barriers remaining in this economy, the Government is of the view that we must act decisively to remove those barriers with a view to enhancing competition.

In this instance it is not about competition. More than any other country that I have ever visited, Ireland has a glut of supermarkets. The difficulty is that there is very little difference between them in terms of the prices they charge. The Minister mentioned exchange rates and external effects. I am inundated with complaints about the sterling to euro conversion and the price of magazines. However, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is excluded from investigating this area. On the other hand, the only importers of magazines from the UK into Ireland are Easons and News Brothers. This matter has not been referred to the Competition Authority, which intrigues me. That is something the Tánaiste could do immediately and it would have great effect because people are clearly being  ripped off. We probably buy more magazines, either for our children or ourselves, than any other country in the EU. The Tánaiste needs to do something because the average person is finding it impossible to live.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The authority operates professionally and independently. The same applies to newspapers, for which we pay much more than people who live on the neighbouring island and we are all aware of why that is the case. Generally speaking, in either a small market or a large market, competition drives down prices. That is aviation prices are currently cheaper than they were 15 years ago. For example, it is considerably cheaper to travel to London now than it was 15 years ago before competition was introduced. Competition in other sectors will have the same impact.

The HSA, based on the details supplied to it, was satisfied that the project be classed as a lower tier site, which requires an accident prevention policy to be prepared and implemented but not the provision of a more rigorous safety study known as a safety report. The pipeline from the landfall to the terminal site is outside the scope of the directive and implementing regulations, and hence, the HSA's remit.The HSA provided a report to An Bord Pleanála in response to its general request of 16 October 2002, which reflected, inter alia, a focus on the direct effects of fire and explosion at residential properties from an accident at an establishment. In this regard, the consideration of pressure effects on land masses was not a criterion used by the HSA at the time of the assessment.The authority continuously keeps under review its criteria for the provision and content of its land use planning advice under the Seveso directive and, in this regard, is currently studying the inspector's comments in the An Bord Pleanála report.

According to the inspector's report, the HSA could not confirm how many people lived within the area affected, was unable to give accurate figures about the proposed development, was unable to assess the opportunity or test the model in regard to the development and was unable to give any opinion on possible fire hazards adjacent to the development. Did the Minister of State read the inspector's report, which states that the HSA, in this case, had submitted no technical advice on the risks to the community or the environment? I am quoting directly from the inspector's report.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	382	While I share the Deputy's concern at the slight decline in the numbers in industrial employment, I should point out that the issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and not one in which I have a direct function. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards are the relevant agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for industrial development nationally.While the economy slowed last year from the performance of the previous year, in line with deteriorating global economic conditions, Irish economic conditions remained robust when compared to the rest of the EU. However, enterprise development in Ireland is now facing a number of challenges with sluggish growth in the main export markets, increased competition from low-cost locations and some erosion in Ireland's competitiveness on the global stage.While overall employment levels in Ireland increased marginally in 2002 as a result of job creation in the public sector and other non-traded sectors of the economy, employment in firms in the more exposed internationally-traded manufacturing and service sectors contracted by 2.8% in 2002.Companies supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland created more than 23,000 permanent full-time jobs in 2002, a strong achievement in the context of difficult economic conditions. However, these employment gains were outweighed by job losses of just over 31,000, as the economic downturn impacted on our ability to sustain jobs.Total permanent employment in firms supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland reduced from 284,900 in 2001 to 277,000 in 2002. However, this still represents a 50% increase on  ten years ago. Jobs created outweighed jobs lost in financial services and the chemical industry. The largest job decreases were experienced in metals and engineering-electronics and internationally traded services – software.While it is not possible to predict job gains or losses given the uncertain economic environment, the Government and the development agencies are undertaking a number of co-ordinated strategies to sustain and promote growth in industrial employment, including the following: a moderation in pay increases in line with slowing productivity growth, accompanied by a slowing of other price and cost increases; promotion of greater competition in the non-traded services sectors of the economy; continued emphasis on the importance of research and development and of new process and product innovation; and accelerated delivery of vital economic infrastructure for businesses including broadband, roads, electricity and waste management.The development agencies are continuing to work closely with existing clients to improve their productivity and competitiveness. The agencies are also actively identifying and working with high potential start-ups and attracting new foreign direct investment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	383	The outside world will be interested to know that once jobs are declining it is not the Minister's responsibility. When jobs were growing she took full credit. Does she accept that the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show that industrial employment fell by 12,500 last year on an accelerated fall from the previous year? Does she accept that the latest ISME survey published in April – and I know this is a group for which her party has strong regard – predicted up to 20,000 industrial jobs could be lost this year? Does she accept that a staggering 42% of its members involved in manufacturing reported reduced employment this year compared to last? The latest export figures which we have for January show a fall of 9%. All these are indicating significant problems for the manufacturing industry. Does the Minister recognise that fact and what is she going to do about it?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	384	As I said earlier in answer to a previous question, according to a recent international report we are the most globalised economy in the world. We trade 180% of our GNP. We are, therefore, not able to hide or protect ourselves from what is happening in the global economy. Notwithstanding the statistics which Deputy Howlin quotes, and I have no reason to disagree with any of them, the fact remains that unemployment in Ireland is amongst the lowest of any EU country.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	385	It is growing.

For 21 of the 30 years of EU membership it was the highest or second highest and it is now at 4.5%. The rate  in Germany is over 10% and the EU average is 8%.There are a number of things we have to do. We have to remain competitive. The bar has moved up. The things which made Ireland attractive in the past no longer apply. We do not have a large pool of unemployed labour available to employers at competitive rates. Other places can provide manpower much cheaper than we can, including many of the applicant countries to the EU.Enterprise Ireland has established a competitiveness fund to help companies to maintain their competitiveness and, hopefully, to expand. I believe that will be of particular assistance to the indigenous sector.

Many of the problems in terms of the infrastructural deficit could be resolved by co-operation on a cross-Border basis. An official from her Department would need to be assigned to look at INTERREG funding to ensure that roads and utilities such as electricity, gas and so on, in which we are currently lacking, could be brought into Buncrana with cross-Border co-operation. We need somebody to co-ordinate it because it does not specifically relate to employment. When I question the IDA or Enterprise Ireland in this regard I am told it is not their job. If we had a co-ordinator it would make us more attractive to employers in a situation where we are losing employment.

Does she agree that large capital-intensive, high-profit operations such as inter national pharmaceutical industries can survive here but indigenous, labour-intensive manufacturing companies can no longer survive in terms of competitive advantage?Do we not need to review our overall tack on trade policy? It is largely geared towards benefiting those companies which can engage in transfer pricing, making substantial profits for repatriation home, rather than protecting jobs and developing our indigenous industry. Will the increasingly changing pattern allow the Tánaiste to question current Government thinking in that regard?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	396	We cannot turn back the clock in relation to wage levels in the economy, even if anybody wished to do so. I am not suggesting that is what people are saying. The reality is that we have reached a certain stage of development and, as in the case of other countries in that position, there are certain activities which are no longer competitive in such situations. That is the reason the goalposts have been changed and we need to raise our level of skill and innovation in accordance with the new ground rules. In the chemical and pharmaceutical industry labour accounts for a very small proportion of the overall output cost for branded products. For this reason we can compete very successfully. We have nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies, 13 of the top 20 medical devices companies and, I hope, more in the pipeline. In terms of new bio-pharmaceutical facilities, the biggest under construction anywhere in the world is being built in Ireland.We are doing very well on the new business side. The challenge lies in the basic manufacturing sector where wages account for a very high proportion of the overall cost of production. The enterprise fund, to which Deputy Hogan referred, is a fund of €10 million which will be targeted at companies which need assistance to remain competitive. It can involve development of the skills base or assistance with innovation or whatever are the particular requirements of companies. It will be a targeted fund, with money awarded on the basis of applications from companies.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 19, 39, 58, 60, 61, 71 and 89 together.The current round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Doha development agenda, was launched at the WTO ministerial meeting in Qatar in November 2001 when it was agreed that the negotiations would be concluded by the end of 2004 and that progress would be reviewed at the next WTO ministerial meeting, scheduled for Cancun, Mexico in September this year.The negotiations have been ongoing in Geneva for the past one and a half years. Progress has been slow and it has not been possible, so far, to meet a number of the deadlines set for the various phases of the negotiations. It is important, therefore, that the upcoming Cancun ministerial meeting provides a political impetus as the time left for reaching agreement is relatively short. Ireland has participated in the negotiations as a member of the EU team. Our priority has been and is to see the process of trade liberalisation continue in a fair and balanced way and the WTO continue to provide a stable and consistent framework for the regulation of world trade.Central to our approach and that of the European Union is a commitment to respond positively in the negotiations to the concerns of developing countries. This is an essential part of the Doha agenda. It is very clear we will not have any agreement unless we can show clearly to developing countries that they are being treated fairly. All of the various proposals made by the European Union so far have reflected this and we support the continuation of this approach. This is important in terms of access to world markets for the exports of developing countries, special treatment for developing countries in the implementation of trade regulations and support for their full participation in the operation of the WTO.Among the issues under negotiation are agriculture, services and the so-called Singapore issues. On agriculture, the European Union, in line with the Doha declaration, wants improved market access for all, lower trade distorting subsidies, reductions in all forms of export aid, full consideration of non-trade issues such as food safety and the environment and preferential targeted treatment for developing countries. The Union has submitted proposals to achieve these goals. On services, it is concerned to get greater market access and open up trade in services to foreign providers. The development of a skilled, high value-added service sector is now a central feature of Irish enterprise policy. Ireland, therefore, has a strong interest in opening markets worldwide to international trade in services and fully supports EU proposals in that regard. Another important issue in the services negotiations is to have regard to the development  dimension, not to undermine developing countries' ability to grow their own service sectors.The so-called Singapore issues are of particular interest to the European Union in these negotiations, given their importance for international trade. The Union has proposed that trade rules covering these elements be developed. In recognition of concerns about developing countries' ability to deal with negotiations on these subjects, it has proposed very modest targets, fully taking into account the essential requirement that developing countries economic development policies be respected. Employment and environmental safeguards are very important in the context of international trade and are regarded as such by the European Union. We have supported its efforts to develop and improve coherence and co-operation between the WTO and the ILO and also between the WTO and the various multinational environmental agreements. We will continue to support proposals in this area.As I said, the negotiations cover a wide range of trade issues. Comprehensive co-ordination is necessary in order to fully reflect Irish interests in all EU proposals. My Department consults on an ongoing basis with other Departments, State agencies and sectoral interests, including business and NGOs. In this regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, met representatives of the trade matters group of NGOs on 9 April for a discussion on their submission on the Doha negotiations. I understand the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business will discuss these issues at its meeting on 11 June, at which my Department officials will be in attendance. At a time of global economic uncertainty, progress in the Doha round can make a much needed contribution to confidence. Agreement in these negotiations is vitally important in order to develop the type of international regulatory landscape in which our economic development can continue.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	398	Will the Irish negotiating position be presented to the joint committee? That discussion, which I requested, was scheduled for 11 June. Will the Tánaiste attend the committee meeting on that date, if she is available, or an alternative date in order that the committee can have an input to Ireland's position? Second, does the Tánaiste agree that previous world trade agreements have disadvantaged developing countries and caused additional poverty and marginalisation, rather than alleviating it? Does Ireland have, as a specific part of its negotiating position, the rebalancing of world trade matters to ensure developing countries are treated fairly? In the commitments made in Rio there was to be a shift in support of technology to developing countries to enable them to develop their economies and reach ODA targets. Ireland should be exemplary in this regard, encouraging our EU partners to set an equitable balance to ensure the poor do not suffer in the context of whatever conclusions emerge from Cancun.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I certainly agree that past trade rounds have disadvantaged some of the world's countries. Ireland was one of the first countries to agree to place resources in the development assistance fund to provide developing countries with the technical expertise they need to participate effectively in these negotiations. As the Deputy is aware, our position is one of consensus at European level within a single organisational framework. That is the most effective position for Ireland and Europe.I understand the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Ahern, has been to the joint committee. I agree that the position being adopted should be discussed fully at the committee and will ensure that happens. The Government will be represented at the Cancun meeting by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and Ministers of State, Deputies Michael Ahern and Tom Kitt. I consider it appropriate that the Government representatives should make themselves available to the relevant Oireachtas committee to discuss the ongoing issues in relation to Ireland's participation and the view being taken.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Will an Irish position paper be available in advance?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	401	What we will have is an EU position paper.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	402	Will Ireland's position paper be included in the joint EU position?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	403	Yes, and I will see that it is made available.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	404	When that paper becomes available, will we go beyond having a debate on Committee Stage to actually having a debate in the House? This issue has major implications for the farming community because much of our agricultural future will be decided in September at the Cancun meeting. Likewise, in discussing unemployment, including the loss of manufacturing jobs, World Trade Organisation rules will determine the speed and nature of such developments.There are so many areas, other that those dealt with by the Joint or Select Committees on Enterprise and Small Business, in which Deputies have a keen interest in our position. The Tánaiste should, therefore, consider an open debate in the House to deal with a range of areas, including foreign affairs, trade, globalisation and agriculture.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The purpose of Question Time is to elicit information from the Minister.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	406	Will the Tánaiste lobby the Government Chief Whip so that time may be set aside for such a debate in the House?With respect to the Ceann Comhairle, on each occasion I rise to speak I find myself immediately being restricted in terms of what I can say.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Unfortunately, the Standing Order restricts the Deputy to asking questions.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I asked one question, but I needed to outline why exactly I was posing it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	409	There is no such provision under Standing Orders. Unfortunately, Question Time is limited to six minutes per question and other Members may wish to submit supplementaries.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I would like to finish my question briefly because I tabled four oral questions in this regard. The Tánaiste said that the WTO negotiations take into account ILO and other multilateral environmental regulations. Would she agree the problem is that the ILO regulations and other environmental conditions have no legal, statutory or other basis, whereas the WTO trade negotiations do? We are developing a world with strong trade rules, but no such employment or environmental rules. In those circumstances, would the Tánaiste agree that world trade is now characterised as a race to the bottom, whereby manufacturers operate in countries with the least employment and environmental rules? That is the core problem with the WTO at present, but it is not being addressed by either the EU or the Government.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	411	The Deputy's minute has concluded.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I will have to leave those questions and try to return to them later, if possible.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	413	As regards having a debate on the position Ireland will be adopting, given the technical nature of the issues involved, we could have a more meaningful debate in committee. However, I am not ruling out the possibility of having a debate here on some of the aspects, if it is agreed by the House. The most important thing is that we should have an agreement. I do not subscribe to the view that any agreement will do but, given the uncertainty in the world at present, if we do not succeed by the end of 2004 or by January 2005, it will be a dreadful indictment of our capacity to work through the multilateral system. Coming after the most recent experience, that would be very damaging for international confidence.I do not accept that companies move to where the lowest standards exist. Companies operate where it is competitive for them to do so. We operate in a globalised economy and production tends to take place wherever it is competitive for companies. Companies are increasingly concerned about their global reputation. Labour  standards form an important part of companies' reputations, even where those standards are not enforced on a legal, statutory basis.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Tánaiste's minute has concluded. Does Deputy Eamon Ryan wish to contribute?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I have one further supplementary on this issue. The French have suggested that a moratorium should be placed on export subsidies to sub-Saharan countries until the completion of the Doha round agreement. Would the Tánaiste favour such a moratorium, given that our partners, the French – with whom we tend to take many common positions – have already proposed it?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Not in recent times.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	417	On some issues we share the views of the French and on others we do not. The Irish and French have adopted the same position on agricultural matters due to matters of national interest. However, we are living in an environment where there will be an increasing liberalisation of trade from which the overall economy here will benefit. It is something to which I strongly subscribe.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	418	As I have stated previously, I was very disappointed at the company's unexpected announcement that it is to reduce its workforce by 250 persons at its Letterkenny facility in Donegal because of difficult market conditions and continuing efforts to reduce costs. The redundancies are proposed to be effected during the period 30 May 2003 to the end of July 2003. Meetings are to take place during the coming weeks between the company's management and employee representatives to discuss these matters in detail.IDA Ireland will continue to maintain close contact with the company's representatives and will engage with them in their strategy for development and maintenance of their operations in Letterkenny. FÁS has already met with the company to discuss a detailed programme to assist the employees to find suitable alternative employment. Enterprise Ireland also met with the management of the company, on 29 April, to provide information on supports available to staff who may wish to explore the possibility of starting their own business.Letterkenny has been a priority area in recent years for the State agencies under the auspices of my Department. Working together with local authorities and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, a significant amount of work has been undertaken to improve its attractiveness for investors. The recent decision to select Letterkenny as a gateway under the national spatial strategy will assist in promoting Letterkenny further.A key development for Letterkenny is the construction of a new IDA Ireland 80-acre business park, which is nearing completion, and the availability of new, advanced buildings. This activity has resulted in an increased level of visits by potential investors and a number of companies are in active negotiation. Successful companies such as Prudential and PacifiCare continue to grow and both are actively recruiting in Letterkenny at the moment.I am confident that the ongoing commitment of Government and the State agencies to regional development and the Objective One designation of the north-west, which facilitates the payment of much higher grant levels in the BMW region, will bear fruit in attracting additional overseas and indigenous investment to Donegal.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Does the Tánaiste accept that the textile industry is a very vulnerable sector in the economy? What mechanism does she have for liaising with vulnerable manufacturing sectors to ensure that such redundancies can be avoided? Does she further accept that peripheral regions – including Letterkenny, Wexford or any other area that is far from the centre – must be supported and that this means that the spatial plan must be implemented? Will infrastructural requirements, such as road, rail, water supplies and broadband roll-out, be funded? Further to their recent comments, both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance made a mistake last year in arguing that it was wrong to borrow for infrastructure. That mistake should now be rectified.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	420	Like Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Howlin is inaccurate in recalling what I said last year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I checked it out and I also checked out what the Tánaiste said this morning.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	422	No. I have sent Deputy Rabbitte a copy of our manifesto, in which we specifically said we believe in borrowing for infrastructure.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	423	The Tánaiste accused us of having tax and spend policies.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Yes. It was the fact that the Deputy's party wanted to increase taxes on work which incensed me.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	425	The Tánaiste has increased taxes on work since the last election.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	426	No Government has lowered taxes more than that which holds office at present.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Will the Tánaiste fund the required measures?
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	428	Will the Deputy listen to the answer?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Please allow the Tánaiste to continue without interruption.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	430	It is true that the textile industry is very vulnerable, not just here but also in Europe and other developed economies such as the United States. The textile sector has become vulnerable to very low-cost economies. Notwithstanding that, however, a number of textile companies here are increasing their employment numbers, in some cases by out-sourcing manufacturing and keeping the higher end of the business in Ireland. I recently visited a company in Cork whose employment is growing because of that strategy and the same applies to other companies who are pursuing that strategy through Enterprise Ireland.I agree that we need to invest in infrastructure. It is probably one of the most important things we can do to open up the whole country, which is small but it takes forever to get from one end of it to the other due, in particular, to an inadequate road infrastructure.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Then do it.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I wish to offer my sympathy to those who have lost their jobs. Unfortunately, it is becoming a regular occurrence. At one point, an early warning system was in place for the textile industry, so why was this an unexpected announcement? I hope that the new legislation on redundancy payments will apply to the people affected in this case. I would like to think that those who are retaining their jobs on the basis that they take a cut in their wages will get every support from the agencies to maximise the opportunities they may have. The State agencies should move in to ensure that the maximum number of jobs can be maintained for as long as possible. I reiterate the point I made on a previous occasion – many of our problems in the north-west could be dealt with at a cross-Border level if the Executive was up and running.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The Deputy should ask a question.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	434	We cannot deal with Ministers in the North as a consequence of the Executive not being there. Will the Minister ensure that the two Governments work together to develop the broadband, roads, rail, ESB and gas facilities that are needed to provide opportunities in the Border region? Alternative sources of funding, such as INTERREG, which are not available in other parts of the country, should be used.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Deputy's minute has concluded.

Will the Minister ensure that there is as much co-operation as possible to maximise the opportunities presented by the fact that we have a workforce that would be hard to match anywhere else?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	437	It came as a surprise because the rumours that there would be job losses at the company had been denied by it when it was contacted by IDA Ireland shortly before the announcement on 24 April. In relation to redundancy, a Bill will be discussed in this House on Friday week. I know that the Bill is generally supported across the House and I expect that it will be in force by the end of May, which is when these workers are to be made redundant. That is certainly the intention.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	438	Does the Minister believe that the international trade in textiles is fair or just, when the workers in developing Third World countries who are being used in the out-sourcing to which she referred are earning about €1 per day? Does she consider that to be fair trade and fair competition?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Of course it is not a fair return for one's effort.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	440	That is what is happening.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I do not know if the figure cited by the Deputy is correct, but I am aware that paltry sums of money are being earned even by people with very high levels of skill. Software engineers work for €5,000 or €6,000 per year in places like India. Such statistics will change over time, but it will not happen quickly. We will have to face other competitiveness issues after the changes take place. The reality for the Irish economy and for companies like the one in Donegal that was mentioned is that we have to develop our skills base and to increase value-added activity, as it is known in the jargon, to justify the higher earnings acquired for labour in this economy, which we all support.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I was hoping to reach a later question, but it does not look like we will do so. I am interested in the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's reply to Deputy Keaveney in relation to the application of the new redundancy legislation. I ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to take this opportunity to correct the inadvertent—

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I will ask a question that relates to it. The Minister has said that the Redundancy Payments Bill will apply to this set of workers, but she has also told the Dáil that it will not apply to the Comerama workers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	445	Deputy Howlin, Question No. 9—

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment this afternoon.I wish to look for a moment at the record of the Minister for Agriculture and Food since his return to office. The latest CSO figures show that aggregate farm income dropped by 9% in 2002. Industrial action in the district livestock offices is delaying premium payments and the disposal and sale of animals. The cut of €14 million in the budget of Teagasc has resulted in the closure of facilities across the country. Disease levies have been doubled and roll-over tax relief has been abolished. Support for the rendering of meat and bonemeal has been withdrawn and new proposals for the disposal of such meal have not been brought forward to date.As cattle prices are now coming under pressure, I am calling on the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to withdraw immediately the 20% cut in the meat inspection budget, which will be used and abused by the meat factories to pull back the prices paid to farmers. Attempts by the factories to lower quotes this week on the back of the meat inspection row have already been noted. The decision by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister to cut the meat inspection budget and the time allocations is being dumped back on the farmers by the factories. Meat plants and abattoirs have been told by the Department to reduce the number of days for killing due to the reduced budget for veterinary inspection work. Some factories are killing only three days this  week as opposed to their usual five days due to the lack of veterinary cover available from the Department. Plants cannot survive on three days. One small abattoir has been told it can operate for only two days this week, instead of five, and has been given no indication how many days it will be able to kill in the following week.The only solution the Minister has brought forward is that shifts and days can be borrowed from the allocation for later in the year. However, that is only to postpone the situation and, of course, by doing that the small export plants and the major factories are committing themselves to the 20% cuts. Some factories have already issued protective notice and, unless this problem is sorted out quickly, jobs will be lost. Factories and abattoirs have been told by the Department to cut the number of days because there is not enough veterinary cover available. Slaughtering cannot proceed without that cover.The decision by the Department of Agriculture and Food to reduce the level of veterinary inspections will have a major economic impact on farmers and will further promote the use of third country beef. I call on the Minister to immediately rescind his decision. Not only will this see the price of animals forced down in the short-term but it could also seriously hit the demand for Irish produce on home and export markets with serious long-term consequences. Third country beef already has a foothold in the Irish food chain and this reduction in killing output could further promote such beef if Irish produce is left in short supply.This situation is contrary to the stated policy of the Minister who claimed that he wanted to see Irish produce gain a stronger foothold on foreign markets. We cannot even maintain supply within our own market. The Minister's decision will have a serious long-term impact on exports and supplies of meat to the retail business and supermarkets. Unless the Minister provides the extra funding required for the service or knocks out an agreement with the vets for a more flexible work practice approach, the number of days will be cut and the kill in Ireland in the current year will be cut by 20%. This would surrender more of our domestic market to foreign imported pigmeat and beef.Small export plants will be the hardest hit by this decision because they will lose both markets and jobs. The only solution the Minister has come up with is to borrow shifts from later in the year. That will postpone the problem, not solve it. This problem must be immediately addressed. The work practices involved in the veterinary inspection, where each shift runs for four hours with only three hours on the line, is totally unacceptable. Three four hour shifts are required to cover an eight hour working day, which is the ludicrous current situation.This must be addressed. Funds must be put in place and negotiations must take place with the veterinary inspectors. This decision should be postponed until agreement is reached and a sol ution should not be put off by telling the plants that they can take shifts from the end of the year or the next part of the killing season. That would only increase the pressure. The Minister knows what will happen at the end of the year if shifts are removed. The number of kills would be reduced and the price of animals, particularly of cattle, would completely collapse at the end of the year.Farmers have had a difficult year and it is difficult for them to swallow the tripe coming from Government with regard to the Department of Agriculture and Food. It is imperative that the Minister and his Department take some action to ensure that this decision is rescinded, that negotiations begin immediately with the veterinary union and that work practices are reformed so we can get back to business and allow the plants to kill beef.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	522	By way of background to the issue before the House, I want to explain the context that has given rise to the need to control the cost of the meat inspection service provided by our Department in meat processing factories throughout the State. The meat inspection service comprises a number of distinct elements, all of which involve control of the slaughter and processing of meat products destined for the human food chain. There is a clear and important public health dimension to the work involved and the key responsibility is the need to control the food processing chain within meat plants.Our Department provides a veterinary presence in each plant whose main role is to supervise the processing of meat in accordance with best international practice. Agricultural officers of our Department carry out certain designated functions in this respect and so too do temporary veterinary inspectors who are private veterinary practitioners assigned on a roster basis to the plants concerned. The overall cost of the meat inspection service has increased very substantially over the past five years. The bulk of this cost is funded exclusively by the Exchequer because the fees that are charged to factories are based on a fixed rate per animal slaughtered, which recovers only a portion of the total cost. Moves to full cost recovery have been considered in the recent past but were put on hold due to the market situation prevailing at the time.The cost of the service has continued to rise, and will rise again this year on foot of negotiated wage settlements. The gap between income and expenditure has grown enormously since 1998 when income as a percentage of cost was 53%. Last year, the income ratio to cost declined to 42%. That is no longer sustainable or acceptable in the context of the current budgetary situation and is considerably out of line with other countries.In response to this year's budget allocation, and taking account of emerging cost increases,  our Department set out detailed allocations of temporary veterinary inspectors' shifts for each factory on a quarterly basis. These allocations were based on last year's figures, less 20%. In the first quarter, in order to avoid disruption in processing establishments, we agreed to allow factories to borrow forward from second quarter allocations. We recently agreed to continue this arrangement into the second quarter as a gesture to the industry in the context of on-going discussions with the industry representative bodies, the Irish Meat Association and IBEC. However, my Government colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, is determined and has made clear that the overall budget allocation for the year must be respected and that meat plants will have to plan their operations accordingly.The reduced allocations for the year do not mean that there should necessarily be resulting restrictions in the processing of animals in meat factories but it does mean that the allocation and utilisation in full of scarce resources needs to be carefully monitored to ensure that the system is efficient and that value for money is being secured for the level of investment that is being made both by the Exchequer and the industry.In response to the specific case raised by Deputy Naughten pertaining to a small abattoir which will only be able to kill on two days this week, I visited a small abattoir this week and the only complaint I heard was that there were too many inspectors – up to four at one time – visiting the plant. I cannot understand the problem.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	526	There is a generally held view that the current system is inefficient, that it lacks flexibility, is expensive to run and that it simply does not suit the current day needs of a modern meat-processing sector. There are elements of truth to these arguments but there is no doubt also that the meat inspection service has delivered on its prime role of protecting public health. I pay tribute to all of the staff involved in the delivery of a professional standard of service.Nonetheless, we believe it is time to review the role of the meat inspection service and, in particular, the arrangements relating to veterinary  inspections with a view to streamlining the operation and fitting the meat inspection service, as a service provider, into the operational needs of the industry. We must dove-tail the two and they must work in tandem.

We have considered a range of valuable suggestions as to how such arrangements might be re-focused so that the service can reach higher levels of efficiency, provide greater degrees of flexibility and make maximum use of the resources available, while delivering value for money.The time has come to face up to the reality that a root and branch reform of the service must be embarked upon. Our Department will shortly finalise its plans in this respect and will convene meetings of the main players at an early date with a view to setting this process in motion. Whatever new structure emerges from these discussions, the quality and safety of meat products will be our foremost priorities.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I welcome the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment the grave situation facing the pupils and staff of St. Michael's community college, Kilmihil, County Clare. The school, which is 40 years old, was on the verge of closing in 1967, with only 13 pupils, but in the early 1970s, with the dynamism of its former principal, Larry Blake, the student level grew to 105. In 1976 it received approval for the leaving certificate and in 1986 an extension was built to cater for the increase in student numbers. It is ironic that the then Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science was my party leader, Deputy Kenny, who performed the official opening at the school in 1986. Since that period, no improvement works have been carried out in the college other than necessary maintenance such as dealing with leaking roofs and emergency electrical works, which were safety concerns for the staff.Today, the college has 331 pupils in a school designed for 180. There are eight prefabricated buildings, one home economics room with very old gas cookers, one science room with equipment that one would see in an antique science museum, and one carpentry room with old, outdated equipment that dates back to the early 1970s with worn benches that have seen better times. I saw these conditions last month when I visited the school and would not be surprised if  the Health and Safety Authority closed down the facilities in these specialist rooms.There are 24 dedicated teachers on the staff, all working in extremely difficult, crowded conditions. I commend them on the excellent work they do with the pupils. Even the staff room is used for meetings and lunch breaks.For years the people of Kilmihil and surrounding areas had been campaigning for a new school to relieve the overcrowding. A feasibility study report was completed for County Clare Vocational Education Committee in June 2001 with the approval of the Department of Education and Science. Its finding was that no significant cost saving would be made by the Department for refurbishing and extending the existing building as opposed to building on a nearby greenfield site which was available. In December 2001, however, the Department rejected that option and issued a schedule for the future use of the existing accommodation. The schedule catered for 300 students, even though the college had 331 students. That did not make much sense.In June 2002 the options were discussed again and in November 2002 representatives of County Clare VEC met officials of the Department. They left that meeting happy that the school would be given immediate priority and that the request would be sent to the Minister for a decision in January 2003. Another meeting followed later that week and it was the clear understanding of the VEC that the option of a major extension on the existing site was agreed. The necessary paperwork of agreement by the VEC was forwarded to the Department on 13 January 2003. The feasibility study was amended and forwarded to the Department as instructed. My colleagues and I as a member of the VEC were assured that it would be sent to the Minister for inclusion in the 2003 schools building programme.My understanding now is that option (e) is under consideration by the Department. This involves demolishing the new structure, which was built in 1986 and located in the middle of the existing buildings, and replacing it with a three storey building. This option would cause major disruption for the students and take at least 12 months to complete. There would also be major concerns about safety.The confusion about this matter must be cleared. The building project in the school is a priority. The best option for its future must be clarified and addressed immediately as a matter of urgency under health and safety legislation. The school must be included in the 2004 schools building programme. The Minister should remember that there are 331 students in a building designed for 185 students.
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Tá mé lán-sásta an freagra cruinn, beacht seo a chur ós comhair na Dála ar an ábhar an-tábhachtach seo ag baint le cúrsaí oideachais i gCondae an Chláir.I am glad to have the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on this matter. In  January 2000 County Clare Vocational Education Committee applied to the Department of Education and Science for additional permanent accommodation. In May 2000 the planning unit of the Department, in consultation with the former chief executive officer of the VEC, agreed a long-term projected enrolment figure of 275 pupils for the school based on negotiations and conclusions arrived at by the VEC which was requested to complete a statement of its curricular options based on a long-term projected enrolment figure of 275 pupils, which was done. This permitted the drawing up of a schedule of overall accommodation, which was forwarded to the VEC and accepted by it in August 2000. In February 2002, on a request from the VEC, the long-term projected enrolment figure was increased to 300 pupils.A feasibility study of the best options for the future use of the school with costings was carried out. The existing school comprises a two storey block, built in 1956, and a single storey extension built in the 1980s. There are also prefabricated classrooms. The study put forward four possible options. Two involve extensions to the existing accommodation and two are for new build. New build solutions put forward involve the requirement to purchase additional land. The preferred solution recommended in the study was for a new school on a greenfield site at a cost of some €3.7 million. Following a visit to the school by officials of the Department, the preferred solution was rejected for the following reasons: "It is the professional opinion of the Department of Education and Science staff that the existing site and building, if properly developed, can easily accommodate the extension required".The redevelopment of the existing school provides an opportunity, through creative design, to integrate the entire school in a manner beneficial to the school in terms of management, educational, architectural design and cost effectiveness. The cost of redevelopment would be cheaper by approximately €3.1 million. By contrast, initial examination of the site on offer for a new greenfield site school indicates that it is not suitable.

#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	532	That was the professional advice available to the Department. Additionally, the associated costs with development of the site would be considered excessive. We have two problems, therefore – unsuitability and excessive costs. The school is located on a site of approximately 7.5 acres, which includes an extensive running track, pitches and hard-core play areas.The judgment of the Department's staff is that the optimum strategy in this case centres around the development on the existing site involving an extension of some 1,100 sq m and extensive refurbishment of the existing accommodation. To progress the matter the VEC was issued with a  schedule of residual accommodation, including the extension to be provided, and a schedule of suggested future use of the existing accommodation for its acceptance at committee level. To date, this has not been accepted.

The VEC appears reluctant to accept this decision. It appears to be determined to acquire a brand new school on an adjacent greenfield site.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	535	That is not true.

The Department does not believe this represents the optimum solution in this case. In order to resolve the matter, discussions between officials in the building unit of the Department and the VEC are ongoing with a further meeting scheduled to take place on 13 May 2003. The 2003 capital programme has now been published. It is not envisaged that the Department will be in a position during this year to appoint a design team to the project. It will, however, be considered for the 2004 schools building programme.I hope consensus can be achieved and an agreement reached between the VEC and the Department, that the final detail and schedule can be agreed and that the matter can move forward for final positive conclusion and action thereafter.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	537	I want to put a number of questions to the Minister in relation to James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15. What is the definitive date for the opening of the new hospital wing, on which almost €100 million in public funds has been spent to date? This project was bequeathed to the Government parties, which have been in office for the past six years, by the rainbow Government, when substantial parcels of land were sold for £36 million and this figure was matched, pound for pound, by the Department of Education and Science. A beautiful new building has been complete for a number of months. However, it has remained shut while staff work and patients live in the former sanatorium on the hospital campus.My constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced at four or five functions in the constituency of Dublin West that he has secured an extra €5 million for refur bishment of part of the old surgical block. This amount was first promised by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, during a visit to the hospital some time ago. This is old money, which, like Fianna Fáil's election promises, has been continually recycled and promised and it has apparently finally been issued. The money will have no impact on the opening of the new wing.The Northern Area Health Board announced yesterday that the 20-bed unit 8 west is to close as of this evening. Where will the ten patients who are currently in the unit go? The hospital staff do not know. Yesterday the hospital also announced the closure of the rheumatology department. When I visited the beautiful new building, there were brass plates on the wall outside the rheumatology department. It has been closed before it could even open. This is the way forward for our modern health service. A dedicated day service was available, particularly to many young people who suffer from acute rheumatic conditions, but now they must take up acute hospital services, which means they will have to go on a waiting list and become acute patients rather than be cared for on a daily basis and maintain their ordinary working and family lives. Such bad management and poor political accountability will cost much more in the long-term than it will save in the short-term.As is the case throughout the health system, the wheels have finally come off the trolley in terms of medical services at JCMH. This is a shameful disservice to the wonderful care given by the medical staff at the hospital, which is widely praised and recognised as among the best in Dublin. The staff and patients of the hospital deserve better.Rarely has as much been promised to so many people as was promised by the Minister for Health and Children during Fianna Fáil's election campaign last year and rarely has so little been delivered, despite the investment of €100 million. The beautiful new hospital wing contains beds that have been made up with the pillows plumped up and waiting to receive people who desperately need improved services. However, the Government is unable to deliver on the solemn election promises that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, made to the people of Dublin 15 last year.

Given the significant level of additional investment in services up to and including 2002 – and the fact that activity exceeded the planned activity level in 2002 – the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 must involve some containment of activity in order to manage within budget. Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996, health agencies are required to deliver a level of services consistent with their approved budgets. That legislation was introduced by the Deputy's party.With regard to specific services, the ERHA has identified cancer services, cardiovascular services and renal services as high priority specialties to be protected.

Yesterday, the Adamstown plan was passed in a cynical, rubber stamp exercise, by the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats alliance on South Dublin County Council, aided by some well-meaning but misinformed members of the Labour Party. The vote was meant to be held on 12 May but due to incompetence, or deliberate misinformation by council planners, it was put through yesterday. This took everyone in Lucan by surprise, including some of the local representatives who had clearly been informed otherwise.The Minister is no doubt aware that Adamstown is the most ambitious project undertaken of its kind in the country. We are talking about a new town the size of Drogheda, adjacent to Lucan, which is the fastest growing town in the country. With a projected population of more than 20,000, the impact of Adamstown needs to be considered carefully or it will create the largest traffic jam this country has ever seen. Its impact will spread into north Kildare and will affect south Meath, Clondalkin, Newcastle, Palmerstown and Blanchardstown. God knows how many towns will be affected if it is not managed carefully.Lucan is already suffering in terms of a major problem with infrastructure. There is a severe shortage of school places. It has one of the poorest public transport services in any urban area and a chronically congested road network. Added to this the Government has now sanctioned the new town of Adamstown by means of a strategic development zone designation. This has to be grotesque, unprecedented, bizarre and unbelievable.Residents and community groups in Lucan tried to adopt a positive outlook. They did not say "No" to housing or "Not in our backyard". They just asked that it be delivered correctly. The Government, and Fine Gael and Labour to their shame, have delivered it but delivered it wrongly. It is interesting that yesterday when 50 motions were tabled to try to make Adamstown sustainable not one amending motion with which the manager disagreed was passed. Some 25 of the most far-reaching motions tabled by my Green Party colleague, Councillor Fintan McCarthy, were grouped into one debate.There were no guarantees in this debate regarding operational capacity for roads, rail or schools. We may have a railway station but can  Iarnród Éireann guarantee capacity down the line? We may have a QBC but will Dublin Bus provide the buses? We may have school buildings but will the Department of Education and Science sanction them? We may have a road leaving Adamstown, incidentally going down the so-called outer ring road through a residential area of Lucan, a folly which I will not discuss now, but this road goes straight onto the N4, yet there are no guarantees regarding the widening of the N4.There have been no guarantees either about the widening of the M50, the provision of a much needed interchange at the M50 to allow free-flowing traffic or an overpass at Palmerstown which would have a knock-on effect. There have been no guarantees of funding for any of these. Will the Government give this funding?The checks and balances in the Adamstown plan, which is well put together in some ways, are all internal. They do not go an inch beyond its narrow borders. This plan is in line with a plan which was designed, apparently, before the transport framework plan was published. This plan was supposed to be published before the manager's report to give people a chance to make submissions based on its findings. However, the transport usage plan was published afterwards. Were the planners planning in a vacuum?I am offering the Minister a chance to redeem himself this evening after his interview with The Irish Times in which he hummed and hawed about taking direct action. Groups such as LTQL, the Finnstown input group etc. have acknowledged the detail that goes into the internal workings of the plan. However, Adamstown will fail unless the required infrastructure is provided. I call on the Minister to use his powers to suspend or freeze Adamstown's designation as an SDZ and to put a halt to any other processes until such time as the planning legislation is strengthened considerably or until he can give a copperfastened guarantee that the money will be provided to Iarnród Éireann for railway carriages for Adamstown, fore tracking and electrification work, schools and the M50. The Minister's colleague, Deputy Curran, has said this will be provided, but I have no reason to believe him given that he betrayed people locally previously. The Minister should say whether this is the case.I ask the Minister to heed these words lest they come back to haunt him in five or ten years when we may have another Ballymun-type structure. We want a sustainable town with the operational capacity in place to ensure it works. The least we need is an environmental impact statement. Ms Patricia McKenna, MEP, has passed the matter on to the EU as an EIS may be needed under EU law.I ask the Minister to show leadership and to tackle the issue of Adamstown. He must make sure it works or freeze the plan until he has the money to do so.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I thank Deputy  Gogarty for raising this important issue. He mentioned my colleague, Deputy Curran, whom I compliment on his involvement in this project. He spoke to me and other Ministers today about the different elements important in the context of this development. Deputy Curran is well up to speed and keeps his colleagues equally informed.South Dublin County Council yesterday voted to adopt the planning scheme for the Adamstown strategic development zone. Adamstown is an important residential site, with a potential housing yield of 8,000 dwelling units. These will be close to Dublin city, within the metropolitan area, thereby avoiding the generation of urban sprawl or long-distance commuting.The scheme that the council has adopted sets out clearly how the area will be developed into a new community over the next few years. I am pleased the council followed my suggestion of setting up a steering group comprising local stakeholders, including residents and providers of transport services, to oversee the implementation of the SDZ over its lifetime.I will outline for the House the reasons Adamstown has been designated by the Government as a strategic development zone. The fundamental goal of Government housing policy since we took office has been to put in place a range of measures that would create the conditions to increase the supply of housing to meet demand. One of the many initiatives taken by the Government to increase supply was the designation of large residential sites as strategic development zones to fast-track them through the planning system.Three sites were designated by Government order as SDZs for residential development on 19 June 2001. This followed an evaluation by my Department of proposals submitted by the relevant local authorities in conformity with certain criteria. These included not only the numbers of houses that would be delivered, but also the potential for comprehensive planning offered by the nature and scale of the site and the location of lands proximate to existing or proposed public transport corridors. The Adamstown SDZ site, for which a local area plan has already been adopted, delivered on all these points.Not only will Adamstown deliver 8,000 housing units but the planning scheme also provides for schools, community and child care facilities, shopping and parks, all important components to ensure a high quality living environment. It is also important that the phasing of the development has been carefully thought out so as not to impact adversely on the existing community. The SDZ site will contribute to an improved level of amenities which will benefit the wider area as well as the site itself.Adamstown is strategically located, adjacent to a rail line, is in close proximity to the outer ring road and is served by two quality bus corridors. I am advised that it is intended to enhance  this infrastructure. Development of new bus services in the greater Dublin area is currently under consideration in the context of the statement made by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, to the public transport partnership forum. Bus priority will be considered by the quality bus network office which is now responsible for the delivery of on-street bus priority measures as set out in the DTO's strategy document Platform for Change. On the rail side, planned upgrading of the Kildare line will significantly increase passenger capacity and benefit commuters to and from Adamstown. larnród Éireann is in discussion with the developers of Adamstown about the provision of a railway station at the site. I understand that the developers have agreed in principle to fund the cost of the station.The Deputy has asked for the Adamstown designation to be suspended. Under Part 9 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, I have no powers to suspend the operation of the designation. I remind the Deputy that the Oireachtas passed the relevant provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 without division and without opposition from the Green Party. The designation and implementation of SDZs has been clearly contemplated by the Oireachtas and it is not now consistent for the Deputy to seek to suspend it. I urge now that parties get behind the implementation of the SDZ for the good of the community that will be created there.The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 May 2003.

The programme reflects the commitments given in the Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: the establishment of a ministerial committee, chaired by myself, to oversee implementation of the reform programme, including the 67 recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report; the publication, last October, of the action plan to give effect to the MIAB recommendations within a target timeframe – a number of the recommendations have already been implemented, some by the insurance industry and some by the relevant Departments and progress on the other recommendations is continuing – the publication, last October, of the report of the implementation group on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board; and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on an interim basis. The chairperson and ordinary members of the interim PIAB board were appointed on 27 Nov 2002. I intend to bring the general scheme of the Bill to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis, to Government shortly for approval to draft.

EU law prevents Governments from intervening in relation to premium levels or risks that insurers are prepared to underwrite.Notwithstanding this, several of the recommendations in the report from the Motor Insurance Advisory Board relate to equal status, whether in the general context of compliance with the Equal Status Act 2000, or in a more specifically targeted sense, in terms of, for instance, the prohibition on discriminatory action in relation to age and gender. As a core function of the Equality Authority is the elimination of prohibited discrimination in the areas covered by the Equal Status Act 2000, the MIAB report was referred to the authority for appropriate action.The Irish Insurance Federation has incorporated a number of the MIAB recommendations in relation to insurance providers in their code of practice. These matters concern equality, transparency and information issues for consumers.

The Bill was published on 7 May 2003.The proposed new legislation will allow for the following: the distinction between service under and over 41 years; two weeks pay for every year of service; the bonus week will be retained; rebate of 60% to the employer; simpler method of calculating service; changes in treatment of absences from work; treatment of service abroad; simplification of application forms; new IT system, including e-government aspect; and employees of insolvent companies to make claims for minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme without having to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.It is my firm intention to bring the increased statutory payments into effect at the earliest possible date.Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the existing statutory redundancy terms remain operative. Backdating is not possible because the redundancy scheme places obligations on employers and confers rights on employees. The legal advice from the Attorney General's office is that obligations, such as increased statutory redundancy, cannot be assigned to employers retrospectively.It is proposed that, when the Bill is introduced in the Oireachtas, I will announce the date from which the new redundancy terms will be effective, thereby giving advance notice to all employers and facilitating the introduction of the new redundancy terms soon after the Bill has been enacted by the Oireachtas.

The agency actively participates on and supports the Listowel Development Group, an initiative which brings together all of the resources relevant to the promotion of Listowel and includes the key development agencies for the region, together with representatives of local industry.IDA Ireland has designated Listowel as a priority town in the Mid-West Region and the agency is committed to securing a new project for the town. The agency is aiming to attract a project from a complete range of IDA target sectors in either manufacturing or internationally traded services. I officiated at the sod-turning ceremony for the 16,600 square foot facility in September 1999 in Listowel, which was completed in September 2000. Since its inception, IDA Ireland has been actively marketing the BES building in Listowel through its property division and its network of overseas offices. There have been a number of visits by overseas companies to the building, as well as viewings by members of the agency's international services division who have also met with the promoters of the building. While these efforts have not yet resulted in the securing of a suitable inward investment project, IDA Ireland is continuing to actively market the BES facility and Listowel to potential clients. However, it is the client who makes the final decision on where any project will locate.At present, we are facing slow growth in the world economy with considerable political and economic uncertainties. This makes it all the more difficult to attract foreign direct investment. However, IDA strategies have proved very successful to date, even in the most difficult of times.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA in North Kerry, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs for the people of Listowel.

The National Framework Committee on Family Friendly Policies which is made up of representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority, and public service employers, as well as a number of Departments, was set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and charged with implementing the National Framework on Family Friendly Policies contained in that agreement.The focus of the work of the committee was to support and guide the voluntary development and implementation of family-friendly policies at the level of the enterprise. The social partners recently agreed that the work of the national framework committee should continue under the latest national agreement, Sustaining Progress.The research project was carried out by a consortium made up of Trinity College, Dublin, Goodbody Economic Consultants and the Institute of Public Administration, in order to gather information on the types of family friendly policies in organisations, the level of availability and uptake of family friendly working arrangements in Irish workplaces, attitudes to family friendly working arrangements among employers, employees and work colleagues and to identify existing research available in this area.Resulting from a survey of 1,006 employees, the researchers found that 62% of the male employees worked an average of 41.1 hours per week and 38% of the female employees surveyed worked an average of 38.6 hours per week. These hours are well within the terms of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which stipulates that an employee may not work in excess of an average of 48 hours per week. The committee intends to publish the research, which is entitled, Off the Treadmill – Achieving Work/Life Balance, in the near future.

This compares with 28 notifications in the same period last year, 30 in 2001, and 43 in 2000.The reduction in notifiable mergers is due to a number of factors. First, there has been a significant downturn in world-wide merger activity since 2000.Second, the notification threshold was increased from about €25 million, IR£20 million, in annual turnover to €40 million with effect from 1 January 2003 under the 2002 Competition Act. This was the first increase in almost ten years and it removes the burden of notification and associated costs from mergers involving smaller companies which are less likely to impact adversely on competition.

Imports in January and February also fell, by 24% and approximately 20% respectively, in comparison with the same periods last year.The growth in trade since 1990 has been one of the key factors in Ireland's overall economic growth, and developments in global markets will remain crucial to our economic growth in the future. The Government remains committed to doing all it can to ensure that Irish exporters are in the best position possible to take advantage of market opportunities, wherever they arise.In this context, a decline in exports is of concern and the reasons for the decline must be examined carefully.The statistics indicate that exports began to slow from August last year. For the year as a whole, exports grew by 1%, all of this growth came in the first part of the year. The figures recently released for January and the preliminary figures for February indicate that the trend emerging since August last year has continued into this year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 42 and 45 together.The National Competitiveness Council, which was established in 1997 as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, reports to the Taoiseach and myself every year on key competitiveness issues for the Irish economy.In its most recent Annual Competitiveness Report, in 2002, the council acknowledged that, over the last decade, the Irish economy has enjoyed significant advances, allowing convergence across key areas with many of our competitors. A virtuous circle of low inflation, moderate wage increases, lower taxes and higher productivity was maintained and, as a result, the economy has been extremely competitive in recent years. This can be observed when assessing the level of GDP or GNP per capita in Ireland compared with other countries. OECD data shows that Ireland now has the second highest level of GDP per capita amongst member countries. While GDP measures overstate Irish income, the data indicate that Ireland is now amongst the richest countries in the world.In particular, it should be noted that in the period 1997 to 2002 the five year percentage change in total employment in Ireland was the highest recorded, at 25.3%, and ranked us first amongst all the comparator countries.It is true that the report finds that Ireland is seventh highest out of 16 countries considered in relation to ‘nominal compensation per employee'. However, the council themselves recognise that labour costs as an indicator can be viewed in two ways.First, and from the point of view of competitiveness, lower labour costs can be seen as having a positive impact. On the other hand, labour costs reflect what employees earn, in turn reflecting the overall standard of living. The overall objective of policy is to improve living standards. Accordingly, higher sustainable wage levels and improved quality of life are the objectives of policies to improve competitiveness.

IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. Since 2000, almost 2,600 jobs have been announced for the north-west region and 1,722 new actual jobs have been created by overseas companies. A total of 812 of these jobs have been created in County Donegal. Unfortunately, during the period 2000 to 2002, net employment in overseas firms fell by just 78 people. I also learned with regret recently of Unifi's announcement that it is to reduce its workforce at its Letterkenny facility in Donegal.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	575	The Irish Labour Market Review 2002 was produced by FÁS at the request of the Tánaiste. It provides information and analysis about the labour market and points towards desirable labour market policies for the future. The review contains recommendations on measures to expand the supply of labour one of which states that: "a greater commitment to flexible, family-friendly working arrangements, such as part-time work and teleworking, combined with adequate child care provision, are needed if female participation rates are to rise over the medium term."I believe that the development of family-friendly policies is best addressed on two fronts. First, through the work of the National Framework Committee, allied to a partnership approach in the workplace between employers, employees and trade unions. Second, through appropriate legislative measures. There are, of course, various family-friendly statutory entitlements including maternity leave, adoptive leave, carer's leave and parental leave.In order to support and facilitate family-friendly policies in the workplace, the National Framework Committee for the Development of Family-Friendly Policies at the Level of the Enterprise, was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The committee comprises representatives of ICTU, IBEC, public sector employers, the Equality Authority, a number of Departments, and is chaired by my Department. The social partners recently agreed that the work of the national framework committee should continue under the latest national agreement, Sustaining Progress.The challenge is to establish family-friendly policies that reflect the reality of the workplace and meet the many diverse needs of employees. Family-friendly working arrangements are in the interests of employers and employees because they contribute to the needs of the business as well as meeting the needs of employees with family responsibilities.For employers the benefits include: retention of skilled staff; reduced absenteeism; improved productivity; a more highly motivated workforce and also helping employers to be seen as an "employer of choice". Employees on the other hand benefit through having greater opportunities to better balance their working and family lives; greater equality of opportunity between men and women; and a fairer sharing of family responsibilities between men and women. A partnership approach in the workplace is the best way in which this issue should be addressed, in order to achieve tailor made solutions to the benefit of the workforce and the employer.

They appear to be based on a misunderstanding both of economic migration policy and of the recent changes to the eligibility criteria for granting work permits.It is Government policy to ensure that the recruitment of overseas labour through the employment permit system continues to reflect the changing realities of the Irish labour market. At a time of slower economic growth and a higher level of redundancies, policy must adopt a more questioning approach to applications for employment permits in respect of non-EEA nationals. Our first obligation remains to the Irish and broader EEA labour force. The new eligibility criteria for employment permits will continue to be reviewed in light of experience and labour market developments.Applications to renew existing work permits where the employee is being retained by his or her employer will not be affected by the new restrictions subject to the usual compliance by employers with employment rights legislation.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	577	The new work permit operational procedure is based on a structure that allows national and local FÁS labour market intelligence to influence decisions relating to the eligibility-ineligibility of work permit applications within particular occupational disciplines. Based on data of registered job seekers by occu pational discipline supplied by FÁS on a quarterly basis, local FÁS labour market area groups advise on the occupational disciplines which should be considered eligible-ineligible for work permit application purposes. This decision-making process also includes consideration of the particular local labour market area characteristics and the experience of FÁS in processing vacancies advertised, where there is likely to be an eventual work permit application.As regards the overall recruitment process, FÁS will facilitate employers in as far as possible in their recruitment efforts. This includes referring potential candidates to registered vacancies, notifying European public employment services of the vacancy and running a large number of recruitment events for various occupational sectors across Europe. This will assist employers in attempting to source local or EEA labour to fill positions in advance of any potential work permit applications. Employers are free to seek the required personnel through other agencies or channels. Where specific skills are required employers should also consider the option of training Irish or other personnel from the EEA.

Part of this transition has involved job reductions and losses in long established employers. This reinforces the importance and urgency of attracting in the more modern industrial and higher value-added activities.

Efforts by the liquidator to sell all or part of the assets of the company as a going concern have been unsuccessful to date.With the exception of a small number of claims received recently, my Department has processed all valid claims received from former IFI workers in respect of statutory redundancy, loss of wages and holiday pay entitlements. The Employment Appeals Tribunal has heard claims covering the majority of former employees under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973-2001. Decisions in these cases will issue to the parties within the next few weeks. There are a small number of former employees whose claims await hearing and these will be heard in due course.All applications from employees to the ex gratia fund of €24.5 million, established by ICI and the State, have been processed. Payments were made in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the trustee of the fund. They were endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.The liquidator has also advised me that, based on legal advice received, he has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements to enhanced redundancy payments. It is estimated that these claims increase the total value of unsecured creditors compared with the statement of affairs produced by the board in November by more than €60 million. Any dividend payable to the workers concerned will be reduced by the amounts received from the ex gratia fund of €24.5 million provided by the shareholders. It is expected that these additional claims will reduce the prospective dividend to unsecured creditors generally. The amount to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for the liquidator and does not imply any commitment by the State to pay enhanced statutory payments.

I chair the review group and I share its view that the limited liability, which attaches to being a company director, is a legal privilege that the law ought not make available to minors. Being a director carries responsibilities and duties and it is necessary that those who are accountable and answerable should be of an age to understand these duties.

However, job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for my Department's enterprise development agencies of which I have no direct function. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and the Donegal County Enterprise Board are under the aegis of my Department. They are responsible for industrial development in County Donegal.IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. Since 2000 it has assisted in the creation of 812 jobs in County Donegal. Unfortunately, during the period 2000 to 2002, net employment in overseas firms fell by just 78. Recently Unifi's announced that it will reduce its workforce at its Letterkenny facility.These job losses are largely as a result of the globalisation policies of multinational companies on the one hand. They are also due to the restructuring process which is going on in indigenous companies in Ireland whereby activities, and hence jobs, at the lower end of the value-added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context.The IDA's overall strategic response to this new competitive circumstance has been towards a broader vision of what constitutes FDI. There is less emphasis on job numbers and a much greater focus on job quality, higher value-added activities and making Ireland a centre for innovation. There is also an emphasis on the strategic management of value chains rather than just a manufacturing or basic service location.

It recommended, inter alia, that an independent ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards be established.The newspaper industry has always linked its acceptance of this recommendation to changes in the law on defamation.In December 2001 the Government approved a general scheme of a Defamation Bill. Arising out of the current programme for Government my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in September 2002 established a legal advisory group on defamation to assess the legal changes which may be required if Ireland's defamation laws are brought into line with those prevailing in other states. This initiative was designed to give effect to the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government. It indicated that the Government would, in the context of a statutory press council and improved privacy laws, move to implement reforms of libel laws designed to bring them into line with those of other states.The advisory group's work has proceeded in parallel with work on the December 2001 scheme. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received its report at the end of March. These developments will lead to the establishment of a suitable mechanism for investigating complaints of breaches of press standards.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	591	On 28 April 2003, liquidators on behalf of the company made formal application to my Department on behalf of 76 employees for payment from the Social Insurance Fund of their statutory redundancy lump sum entitlements. This application will be treated as a priority case and every effort will be made to ensure that all eligible employees receive their payments as soon as possible. All payments will be tax free.As the employees concerned have already been given their notice of redundancy, the calculation of the statutory payments will be based on the existing statutory entitlements under the present legislation, that is, the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2001. The new redundancy payment levels will be payable on the coming into force of the Redundancy Payments Bill 2003, which has already received Government approval and is being treated as priority legislation. Although every effort will be made to secure its successful passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible, it will not be applicable to the employees of this company.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented EU Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, provides for an annual leave entitlement of four working weeks per annum for full-time employees and pro rata entitlements for part-time employees as well as an average hourly working week of 48 hours averaged generally over a four-month period. The Act also provides for an entitlement to nine public holidays per annum. Notwithstanding these provisions, it is possible for employers and employees to negotiate a longer annual leave entitlement or a lower hourly working week between themselves if they so wish. I have no plans at the moment to increase the statutory minimum annual leave or public holiday entitlement nor to lower the threshold on weekly working hours provided for in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I refer the Deputy to my reply to two similar questions, Question No. 165 of 18 February 2003 from Deputy Howlin and No. 147 of 25 March 2003, from Deputy O'Shea. Investigations into allegations made in respect of the particular company remain ongoing. The investigations involve a number of companies.The employment regulation order or registered employment agreement system, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2001, does not regulate terms and conditions of employment for the meat industry. Accordingly, from an employment rights perspective, wage regulation will be in accordance with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	595	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and is one in which I have no direct function. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and the county enterprise boards are the agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for industrial development in the north-west region. The information sought by the Deputy is contained in the following tabular statements with the exception of statistics for the county enterprise board, which follow.From 1996 to date, the total number of jobs created in county enterprise board assisted enterprises for the north-west region were as follows: Donegal, 646; Sligo, 671; and Leitrim, 296. This amounts to a total of 1,613. Figures for job losses in county enterprise board assisted enterprises are not available.

Replies were received from all three in the matter. I can confirm that based on the information provided, there have been no breaches of our export control rules by any of the companies involved.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	597	Internal reports such as that to which the Deputy refers are generally an operational matter for Enterprise Ireland and its board. Naturally, I am always interested in hearing the views of clients and I am satisfied that Enterprise Ireland also values such views and reacts to those views accordingly. Indeed, since its establishment in 1998, Enterprise Ireland has consistently sought regular feedback from clients regarding not only the issues facing them but also their views of Enterprise Ireland's impact, especially with regard to the agency's delivery and performance.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	598	The ESRI's quarterly commentary must be seen in a broader global context. As a small, open economy, Ireland is very much influenced by developments internationally. The short-term forecast of upward pressure on the unemployment rate reflects the current slowdown in the general economic climate that has been characterised by uncertainty in terms of the world economy and a slowdown in the hi-tech, telecommunications and financial sectors. However, most if not all commentators – ESRI, Central Bank, the Department of Finance – agree that in the medium and longer term the forecast is for more sustainable growth and job creation. It is important, therefore, that we continue to focus on the issues that will maintain Ireland as a competitive and dynamic economy. Indeed, the ESRI commentary points out that the current social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, should help to reinforce dis-inflationary trends in the economy.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The interdepartmental and agency review group on public safety has examined the State's approach to public safety. The recommendations of this group included the proposed establishment of an agency to deal specifically with public safety regulation. The current situation is that the regulation of public safety is currently being dealt with by a number of Government Departments and public bodies. The situation requires careful consideration and it may well be that the issues involved require some form of a more co-ordinated approach, rather than the establishment of a brand new agency.

Details of the directives, including, as far as has been decided, the proposed transposition instruments, are available on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie/ecd/eudirectives. The website also contains information on directives in respect of which infringement proceedings have been commenced.A letter of formal notice, under Article 226 of the Treaty, has been issued by the European Commission in the case of six, and a reasoned opinion in the case of another two, of the outstanding directives for which the deadline for implementation has passed. However, seven of these directives have since been transposed. I am committed to achieving a high level of transposition of EU directives that require to be transposed by my Department.

The Deputy should note that, as the High Court award in this case arose from a civil action by way of a plenary summons, the Labour Inspectorate of my Department has no role in pursuing this particular aspect of the matter.The Labour Inspectorate continues to pursue the employment rights aspect of this case. Inspectors have interviewed the employer concerned and have examined some records in accordance with the relevant employment legislation. The investigation process will conclude in the coming week. My Department will then be in a position to decide as to the appropriate next steps.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	602	This legislation is in the later stages of legal drafting, after completion of which Government approval to publish will be sought. I hope to be in a position to seek such Government approval before the summer recess. The new legislation will strengthen provisions dealing with the consultation and participation of employees and safety representatives on matters of health and safety at work. It will also make provisions for dealing with training, instruction and supervision for employees in matters of health and safety. In relation to penalties, the Act will provide for very significant increases in the fines and penalties imposed for breaches of legislation.I am conscious of the high accident rates among the construction sector. However, although the new legislation will provide a solid platform for increased safety in all sectors, legislation alone will not provide a panacea for all the safety related problems that exist in the construction sector. If workers are prepared to take unnecessary risks, or forced to take unnecessary risks, no amount of safety procedures and legislation will prevent accidents occurring. I urge contractors, site managers and foremen to redouble their efforts to ensure a safe working environment for their workers.

One of the tasks of the interim board is to contribute to the preparation of the requisite legislation to put the PIAB on a statutory basis. The preparation of this legislation necessitated contact with a number of interested groups and their views were considered in the formulation of the legislation and taken on board where appropriate. I intend to bring to Government shortly the general scheme  of a Bill to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis. I will be seeking Government approval for the drafting of the Bill and also for publication of the general scheme so that the views of interested parties can be elicited.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I have no plans for legislation in the area of ticket touting. I am not convinced that legislation is the answer to this objectionable practice. Rather both suppliers and purchasers have their parts to play.The primary responsibility for the sale of tickets lies with the governing bodies or the event organisers and the onus is on them to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of those tickets. Consumer legislation protects purchasers from false or misleading advertising, labelling or price indication and ensures the consumer is armed with sufficient information about a product or service, including price. In the area of tickets the Consumer Information (Advertisements for Concert or Theatre Performances) Order 1997 obliges event organisers to show the full price, including all hidden charges, when advertising a concert or theatre performance.Against this background and in a free market economy it is ultimately a matter for each consumer to decide whether he or she is prepared to pay over the odds for a good or service which he or she wishes to purchase.

There have been five new projects in north Dublin – including expansions – announced within the past 12 months.Just over a fortnight ago, on 23 April, I was pleased to announce that Accenture, Ireland's leading management consulting and technology service company, plans to create an additional 150 jobs in Dublin before the end of the year. The company, which already has its European service centre in Dublin, is expanding its operations in response to increased demand. The services provided by Accenture cover a broad range of areas, including software development, web services, business processes, IT outsourcing and application management. Approximately half, 70, of these jobs will be located at Harbourmaster Place, Dublin 1, with the remainder going to Grand Canal Plaza, Dublin 4.On 14 April 2003, I announced that Overture Services Inc., the global leader in commercial search services on the Internet, has established its new search services and operations centre in East Point Business Park, Fairview with the support of IDA Ireland. The Dublin centre will employ a multinational workforce of nearly 100 editors and customer service representatives by the end of 2003. The investment is a further boost for the Government's strategy to make Ireland a leading player in the digital media industry and will strengthen our standing as a prime location for global Internet services.On 21 February 2003, it was announced that multinational company Ingersoll Rand Company Limited aims to create 200 new jobs in Dublin over the next two years in its global export sales and service trading company, Ingersoll-Rand International Limited, IRI. The announcement was made by the Taoiseach at the launch of Ingersoll-Rand International, which took place in the company's new facility in Airside Business Park, Swords. This company is a diversified multinational manufacturer of industrial and commercial equipment and components for the global markets of security and safety, industrial solutions and infrastructure.On 14 November 2002, the Taoiseach announced the creation of up to 150 new jobs by 2004, in a new €30 million facility at the Hertz European Service Centre in IDA Business Park, Swords. This development will provide job opportunities from entry to management level, across a spectrum of sectors, including reservations and sales, customer service, human resources, training and development, facilities management, administration and various accounting and finance roles.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Since my reply on 18 February 2003 to the Deputy's previous question, I have visited Ballinasloe and met the workers of Square D and local representative and development groups. I am currently following up on a number of issues raised by the worker's action group and I will be responding to those issues very shortly.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and is one in which I have no direct function. IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Laois County Enterprise Board are the agencies under the aegis of my Department with responsibility for industrial development in the Laois area.IDA Ireland, the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland, is acutely conscious of the relative performance of County Laois in recent years and is actively marketing and promoting Laois as a location for inward investment through its network of overseas offices. IDA Ireland believes that the new business park at Portlaoise, with its offices and technology buildings, will be of great assistance in attracting overseas investment to the county and intends to market the business park to the international services and health care sectors. A 25,000 sq. ft. advance technology building, which is the first unit on the park, has been occupied by ebm Ireland Limited. Construction of a second facility, a 17,000 sq. ft. advance office building, will be completed towards the end of 2003. The agency has also applied for and received planning permission for a further two advance technology buildings of approximately 25,000 sq. ft. each.

The budget for 2003 will necessitate some reductions in the levels of activity compared to 2002, particularly in the area of community employment where, in line with Government policy, numbers will fall from 25,000 at the end of 2002 to 20,000 at the end of this year.The management of FÁS programmes and schemes is a day-to-day operational matter for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act 1987. FÁS, taking into account policy guidelines, will decide on the priorities between schemes and activities from within the 2003 allocation. In this context FÁS will be required to maximise the benefits to its client base of the available funding through greater efficiencies. FÁS was advised in December 2002 that it must keep within the approved allocation and that no additional funding will be made available in 2003.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	612	An application for payment was received in this case on 25 March 2003 and is being processed in accordance with the targets set down in the Protocol on Direct payments to Farmers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	613	The issue of the 20% balancing payment under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 30 April 2003. To date over 55,000 farmers representing 88% of applicants have received over €37 million in balancing payments. It is estimated that the amount outstanding to some 9,000 farmers is approximately €10 million.The delay in issuing the balancing payments arose due to the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes with effect from the 2002 scheme year and also because of problems with the overshoot of the special beef premium national quota. While the requirement to apply penalties across all bovine premium schemes under amending Regulation 2419/2001 will mean later balancing payments for 2002 and future years, the penalties that will be applied to the bovine schemes for irregularities and late lodgment of area aid applications will be much lighter than those that applied up to now.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I regret that the industrial action taken by members of the CPSU is continuing and inconveniencing farmers in the five counties involved. However, I understand that the union has agreed to ease restrictions in relation to herds affected by brucellosis and tuberculosis which may alleviate the hardship somewhat. I wish to assure the Deputy that I am anxious to have the dispute resolved so as to restore the Department's normal services in the areas concerned as soon as possible.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	615	The person named submitted two applications in respect of a total of eight animals under the 2002 special beef premium scheme on 4 and 27 November, respectively. Advance payments issued in respect of both applications on 20 February 2003 and balancing payments issued on 7 May 2003.The person named has been paid 80% of the slaughter premium. The balancing payment of slaughter premium will issue shortly in respect of two heifers. National envelope top-up on the two heifers slaughtered will issue in early June.The person named applied for premium for seven animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme. An 80% advance payment amounting to €1,255.24 issued on 16 October 2002. The 20% balancing payment for €313.81 issued on 7 May 2003.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	616	The person named applied on 29 cows and six heifers under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme for small scale milk producers on 14 June 2002. He declared that the total number of cows on his holding at the time of application was 34, and that he held a milk quota of 21,997 gallons.Under paragraph 12 of the terms and conditions of the 2002 suckler cow scheme, the number of notional dairy cows required to produce the milk quota held is that quota divided by 876 gallons. However, the person named purchased additional milk quota under the 2002-03 milk quota restructuring scheme, and his reckonable quota for the 2002-03 milk marketing year was 35,397 gallons, requiring 40.4 notional dairy cows to fill this quota. As the total number of cows in the herd at application was only 34, no payment could be made.The person named has requested my Department to carry out a review of this decision which is being undertaken at present. The result of this review will be made known to the person named as soon as it is complete.

In this regard, my Department has been and continues to be involved in a number of fora engaged in trying to quantify the extent of the problem, the relative contribution of use of antibiotics in human and animal populations to its development and in designing strategies to address the problem based on current scientific knowledge.For example, in terms of advancing the state of knowledge about the problem, my Department is engaged with other agencies, such as FSAI and the universities, in a number of specific projects designed to gather detailed data. The projects form part of an EU-wide co-ordinated approach to designing strategies to combat the problem.Also, the approach adopted by my Department for a number of years reflects the recommendations of the EU scientific steering committee based on the current state of scientific knowledge. Under this approach, for example, new antibiotic veterinary medicines are evaluated by the Irish Medicines Board to determine their potential contribution to antibiotic resistance prior to approval.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	620	My Department is in contact with the European Commission in regard to the cutback to be applied to the special beef premium arising from the overshoot of the national ceiling on payments. No decision has yet been made on how the cutback will be applied, that is, whether the rate of premium will be cut or the number of animals per farmer will be reduced.Irrespective of which method is used, the same rate of cutback as is applied to the special beef premium payments will also have to be applied to any extensification premium payments due on those animals to respect EU regulations. Accordingly, it makes no difference from an extensification premium point of view whether the rate of special beef premium is cut or the number of animals is reduced as a corresponding decrease will apply to extensification premium payments

As part of this process, my Department has engaged in an extensive consultative process.Having received submissions from a number of interested parties and having had a number of follow-up meetings which had been requested by some of the parties, my Department is finalising proposals for prospective changes to the relevant legislation to take account of the recommendations of the IMB and, in so far as possible, the views expressed by interested parties.

Proposals for such an amendment will be formulated and submitted to the Commission later this year, once the current consultative process on REPS is finished. It is anticipated that the process of securing Commission approval for higher REPS payment rates could take six to nine months. It is intended that farmers already in REPS will be able to avail of the new rates, but they may be required to adapt their REPS undertakings to conform with the terms of any amended scheme that may be approved by the Commission.

I have allowed meat plants some flexibility in the use of these resources to enable them to meet their commercial commitments. In doing so I have made it clear that the overall budget allocation for the year must be respected and meat plants will have to plan their operations accordingly.My Department is reviewing the operation of the meat inspection service with the aim of improving its efficiency and cost-effectiveness and to respond to the current commercial requirements of the meat industry.

The December 2001 survey showed that 900 people with a disability were employed in the Civil Service, equivalent to 2.8% of total numbers.The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness committed the Department of Finance to reviewing the operation of the 3% employment target throughout the Civil Service. The Department commissioned Goodbody economic consultants to carry out research into the operation of the target and the career progression of people with a disability in the Civil Service. The report is now available and provides much useful information about the position of people with a disability working in the Civil Service.

The national spatial strategy is an important element which will be given appropriate consideration as part of the deliberative process. Other issues must also be considered, including the concerns of staff regarding their futures, managements' concerns in relation to delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility and the many submissions received on behalf of towns around the country.Given the range of these considerations it is not possible for me to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on this matter.

He is not, therefore, liable to pay income tax in 2002 and 2003. It is understood that €964.90 in income tax was deducted from the taxpayer's pension during 2002. Arrangements are being made to refund the full amount deducted.I am further informed that an exemption certificate has been issued for 2003. The Department of Defence will implement this certificate with effect from the taxpayer's next pension payment date, that is, 20 May 2003, and all tax deducted from the taxpayer's pension since 1 January 2003 will be refunded on that date.

As I have said previously, a wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, have to be considered before a final decision is taken on a new programme of decentralisation. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. Given the wide range of considerations, it is not possible for me to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on this matter.

These organisations include Concern, Goal, Trócaire, the Red Cross family, UNICEF and the World Food Programme. The focus of Irish assistance is on the distribution of food, repair of water and sanitation systems, supplementary and therapeutic food for children and building the capacity of local partners.

I am not aware of such a proposal at this time.In responding to humanitarian crises, it is Ireland's customary policy to favour the local purchase of foodstuffs and other materials. However, given the seriousness of the current humanitarian crisis in Iraq and the paramount importance of saving lives, we would be willing to consider the use of EU intervention stocks for this purpose in Iraq, subject to agreement on the legal and technical requirements for the release of such stocks.

These are self defence, Article 51, and collective enforcement action authorised by the Security Council in response to threats to or breaches of international peace and security or acts of aggression, Article 42.Article 51 of the charter recognises the right of states to take action in pursuit of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations. The charter requires states taking such action to notify the Security Council immediately.It is widely accepted that the right to self-defence encompasses an entitlement to take limited and proportionate action where necessary to counter the threat of imminent attack. In any case, it is clear from the charter that the right to act in self-defence is recognised only until such time as the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed  between my Department and the education partners.The enrolment of the school in question has decreased from 86 pupils on 30 September 2001 to 79 pupils on 30 September 2002. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2003-04 school year. The school also has one resource post and one shared learning support post. As the agreed appointment figure for the third mainstream class teacher is 82 pupils, there is no basis on which my Department may sanction an additional teaching post to the school in question.An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing teacher allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. A circular outlining these new procedures issued to all primary schools.The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board on 9 April 2003. I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 10 April 2003.

The payments in question are the restructured categories of principals' and deputy principals' allowances which became effective in the pay of serving teachers from 1 September 1996.My Department's position is that these restructuring increases are not payable to teachers who retired before the increases became effective in pay. This position is in accordance with long-standing policy on public service pensions in regard to restructuring increases and is consistent with the advice of the Department of Finance which has overall responsibility for pensions policy.

ComReg informs me that it has issued a series of directions to, and with respect to, the incumbent operator with the objective of paving the way for the introduction of retail flat rate Internet access services in the Irish market by the end of June 2003.I am confident that there is sufficient interest among operators in the product to ensure that retail prices will be pitched at a competitive level, thus allowing for a greater number of people to avail of the product and maximising the benefit for all users of the product.

A full assessment of all bids is ongoing. However, I am satisfied the level of interest expressed in AER VI, combined with projects proceeding under the previous AER V round, will ensure the 500 mw target is delivered.

These guidelines state that it is essential that well planned discharge policies and procedures are in place. Most patients are able to return home with little or no support, while others will require a package of care to support them and some patients with complex care needs may require continuing care from the community mental health service which may include supported housing accommodation. A clear discharge plan designed for the safe discharge of patients should be in place. This will include documentation and a pre-discharge checklist to ensure all appropriate  information is given and all appropriate services are arranged prior to the patient's actual discharge.Immediately following discharge, a discharge summary should be sent to the general practitioner and to members of the psychiatric services providing aftercare, setting out the principal details of the patient's management and treatment while in hospital, including medication on discharge and whether and for how long it is to be continued. The patient too should be supplied with a standard information form giving information on the drugs prescribed, the name of his or her general practitioner and the telephone number of the mental health centre or service where staff can be contacted and a domiciliary visit or other intervention carried out in case of an emergency. The type of aftercare planned for the patient should be discussed with the patient taking into account the patient's diagnosis, needs, physical and emotional and personal preferences. Arrangements must be made for the first review of the patient post-discharge.An aftercare plan for the patient should be recorded in detail in the patient's case file and available to each member of the professional team responsible for the patient. The discharge plan should be drawn up by the patient's treating consultant psychiatrist and should fully consider and provide for the immediate and long-term needs of the patient and include an assessment of the risk of the patient harming himself or others. Aftercare should be properly co-ordinated and supervised under the general direction of the patient's treating consultant psychiatrist. A mechanism should be in place to review patients who have been lost to follow-up and everything possible should be done to find out what has happened to the patient and to take appropriate action.The main difficulty in relation to adult homelessness has been in the Dublin area and, to address this, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has appointed a director of homelessness who is working closely with the three area health boards in implementing the provisions of Homelessness – An Integrated Strategy, May 2000. The work of the three area health boards includes measures to improve mental health services for people who are homeless.Since 2000 the Department of Health and Children has allocated €18.34 million to health boards to deal with homelessness with an additional €2.66 million allocated for 2003. The recently published health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, includes a commitment to prepare a new national policy framework for the further modernisation of mental health services. Work on the framework is expected to commence later this year. All aspects of mental health service provision, including services for the homeless, will be examined and the need for additional research in this field will be among the matters for consideration.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	662	The problem of antimicrobial resistance has been identified by many countries worldwide as a major threat to public health. The World Health Organisation has recognised antimicrobial resistance as a cause of prolonged morbidity, increased case fatality and lengthening the duration of epidemics. The EU called on its member states to prioritise the development of a strategy to combat this problem.In 1999 my Department asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre, NDSC, to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC gave detailed consideration to these issues and drew up a strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, which I launched on 19 June 2001. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including a strategy to control the inappropriate use of antibiotics. The SARI recommendations can be grouped into five main categories: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, monitoring of the supply and use of antimicrobials, development of guidance in relation to the appropriate use of antimicrobials, education of health care workers, patients and the general public, and development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community setting.The strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland recommended that a national SARI committee be established to develop guidelines, protocols and strategies in relation to antimicrobial resistance. The committee will also provide advice to the regional SARI committees. This committee has now been established and held its first meeting in December 2002; its membership is drawn from a wide range of experts in the field.

Self-employed persons who satisfy the criteria of eligibility may also be considered, subject to the above age limits.In cases where application is made on the basis of obtaining or retaining employment or self employment, the board must be satisfied that the applicant is capable of holding down a job, has the physical capacity to drive the vehicle and is qualified to hold a driver's licence, full or provisional.However, qualified persons with a disability who are incapable of driving or who have been medically advised not to drive and who have to be driven to and from their place of employment will only be considered eligible for a grant provided that they will be driven by another named person to and from their place of employment. The car must be purchased in the name of the person with a disability.The medical criteria for obtaining the motorised transport grant are as follows: the applicant must have a severe disability and the applicant's disability must impede him-her from using public transport.

My officials are continuing to examine details of vaccine injury compensation schemes in place in other countries. On completion of this examination, further investigation will take place into the clinical and administrative aspects of the most relevant models examined and a report on the issue will be prepared. At that stage I will consider the introduction of legislation for such a scheme.

The Act will bring Irish law in this area into conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The main vehicle for the implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001 is the Mental Health Commission which was established with effect  from 5 April 2002. The establishment of the commission was welcomed by Amnesty International in its recent report.The Mental Health Commission has an important role to play in improving the quality of our mental health services. The primary functions of the commission are to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained persons are protected. The Mental Health Commission is now working, along with officials from my Department, to put in place the structures required for its new role. The commission will shortly appoint an inspector of mental health services. The inspector will be required to visit and inspect all approved centres at least once a year. The inspector's annual report and review of the mental health services will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, along with the commission's annual report.It is noted that the WHO is currently drafting a manual on mental health legislation, the recommendations of the WHO will be considered in the context of any further legislative amendments in the mental health area.

These are concerns which the Government shares and which it intends to address.The Amnesty report acknowledges the significant advances made in this country in the provision of community psychiatry, nursing services, community residences, day hospitals and day centres since the publication of the landmark 1984 report, Planning for the Future. This Government is committed to ongoing improvements in the mental health services, to the further development and expansion of community mental health services, to increasing child and adolescent services, to expanding the old age psychiatry services, to providing liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhancing the support provided to voluntary agencies. The Amnesty report also acknowledges the funding which is being made available by Government to support groups and organisations such as Schizophrenia Ireland, Mental Health Ireland, GROW and Aware to heighten awareness and develop support services for service users and carers.

The health promotion unit of my Department is fully committed to the promotion of positive mental health and to stigma reduction initiatives.The unit has developed strong links with each of the health boards and supports the health promotion efforts of mental health organisations like Mental Health Ireland, Aware, Schizophrenia Ireland and GROW. These organisations are committed to raising public awareness of mental health issues, to educating the population with regard to these issues and work to eradicate the stigma associated with mental health.While there are no plans at present to develop an education and awareness campaign on mental health, I am fully committed to providing continued support to the health boards and to voluntary organisations in their mental health promotion efforts. In the meantime, I will review the need to develop such a campaign.

While my Department has obtained the views of the Health Insurance Authority in relation to lifetime community rating, work on preparing regulations to implement such a system must be viewed in the context of wider considerations relating to maintaining the established common good principles of our private health insurance system. These principles relate to community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.

Its objective was to ensure that the health service is responsive to the needs of the individual patients and that there is a code of practice in place which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services. Implementation of the standards specified in the patients' charter is a matter for individual hospital management and my Department has not received any significant level of complaints in this respect.

Preparation of heads of Bill for a new Medical Practitioners Act is well advanced, and the statutory provisions in relation to the registration of medical practitioners are among the many issues being carefully examined in this context.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.I have made enquiries with the North Western Health Board and have been informed that the present roster system for psychiatric nurses with Sligo-Leitrim, west Cavan mental health services is no longer capable of meeting the needs of a modern mental health service.The North Western Health Board is addressing the issue and has proposed a revised roster to both trade unions, PNA/SIPTU, who represent psychiatric nurses in the region. To date, one union has rejected the proposals and the issue is being addressed through the normal industrial relations mechanisms. It is the intention of the board to introduce revised rostering arrangements at an early date. The scenario as described can arise within the present rostering arrangements, however local nurse management facilitate staff with the opportunity to take days off or annual leave prior to commencing night duty.In relation to the provision of job sharing and flexible working arrangements within the mental health services, the North Western Health Board provides the same opportunities to psychiatric nurses as other employees. By its very nature psychiatric nursing must be provided on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis. It is the policy of the board to facilitate staff where possible. The revised roster proposed by the board addresses inadequacies identified in the present system and will make a positive contribution to family friendly working arrangements. The new roster provides for psychiatric nurses to work no more than four consecutive days.

Any payments to be made as a result of this implementation will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship experienced by taxi licence holders arising from the liberalisation of the taxi market. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship.The design and administration of a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel and the arrangements to facilitate the making of payments to eligible persons will be progressed as quickly as possible so as to ensure that applications are dealt with on a confidential and objective basis. In that context, I have already asked Mr. Jimmy Farrelly, who I recently appointed as the interim chairman of the Commission for Taxi Regulation, to progress as a priority the implementation of the findings of the panel report.At the meeting with the delegation from the EU Committee on Petitions on 4 April 2003, I explained that the Government has approved the implementation of the taxi hardship panel recommendations and that every effort will be made to put in place a structure to facilitate the commencement of payments on the basis of those recommendations as soon as possible. There are no current proposals for any payments beyond the recommendations of the panel report.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	694	There are a number of strategies and plans designed to attract passengers to public transport based on the transformation of existing public transport structures and major investment programmes. These include the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, A Platform for Change, the strategic rail review, the Cork area strategic plan and other local land use and transport plans. Furthermore, the national spatial strategy highlights an important role for public transport particularly by improving links between the gateways and hubs and developing enhanced services nationwide.Central to the success of my transport plans are measures to tackle congestion and of course there are already good examples at local authority level where steps are being taken to alleviate traffic problems. Bus priority, parking restraint measures, traffic calming, walking and cycling are just a number of the measures which have been taken but clearly much more needs to be done to overcome congestion. The Dublin Transportation Office has commissioned a study on demand management for the greater Dublin area due for completion by the end of this year, which will assist the Government and the GDA local authorities in strengthening the response to growing travel demand and problems such as long distance commuting. The current phase of the study involves public consultation and I am awaiting the outcome of this study before issues such as congestion pricing are examined at Government level. In the meantime we will continue to make progress on investment and development of our public transport system in areas such as the Dublin suburban rail network, inter-city rail services, Luas, quality bus corridors and structural and regulatory reform to ensure the best possible service delivery to the customer within available resources.

Fares on public transport have decreased significantly in real terms in recent years and there is no evidence to suggest that current fare levels are a deterrent to the increased use of public transport.

As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of child care service delivery during this period. The equal opportunities child care programme was established by my Department in April 2000 as a seven year programme to increase the number of child care facilities and places, to improve the quality of child care services and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care services. The total funding allocated to my Department for these purposes during the seven year period of the programme is €437 million, including €317.4 million provided under the national development plan, co-funded by the European Union.The equal opportunities child care programme has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of men and women in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, training and education.The programme provides capital grant assistance to community – not for profit organisations and to private child care providers to increase the supply of child care places or enhance the quality of existing places. It offers staffing grants to community-based – not for profit organisations which have a focus on disadvantaged families and offers supports to the national voluntary child care organisations and to other groups which are working to improve the quality of child care in Ireland.

The group received a feasibility grant to enable them to further develop their proposal and a major application for grant assistance was subsequently received from the group. This proposal for an integrated child care service sought very significant funding under the three measures of the equal opportunities child care programme, namely, capital, staffing and development and training.All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process by ADM Limited on my behalf to ensure they meet the objectives of the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06. As is the case with all large-scale capital applications, the project was referred by ADM Limited for an external evaluation by a building specialist. This project was appraised by an external evaluator and was submitted to the programme appraisal committee.

Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group. The report is in the process of being finalised at present.The position in relation to the issue of parity of pensions for members of the Garda Síochána who retired prior to 1 January 1993, who do not receive the unsocial hours element in their pensions, and those who retired prior to 1 October 1982, who do not receive the rent allowance element in their pensions, is that the commission examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of the Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations, but, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved.Having regard to the commission's report, I have no plans to introduce amending legislation at this stage nor do I intend making ex-gratia payments to the Garda pensioners concerned.

The schemes are prioritised into two groups of which Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford form the first tendering priority and Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo form the second tendering priority.The tender for the first group of four towns is well advanced. It is expected that work on the tender for the second group of seven towns will begin during the second half of 2003. In the case of Carlow and following successful tendering and award of contracts, it could be expected that work would begin on the installation of the system during the second quarter of 2004 at the earliest, subject to the availability of funding.

Local Garda management is satisfied that the current opening hours of Ballinrobe Garda station are adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area. Accordingly, there are currently no plans to alter these opening hours.The extension of the current opening hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties. Such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. The Office of Public Works has estimated the construction cost of the new station at €1,008,000.

Grant assistance of up to €100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this prospectus were made available, on request, to both Roscommon Chamber of Commerce and Roscommon County Council.A code of practice, drawn up in co-operation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, and detailed technical specifications, drawn up by the Garda Síochána, are almost complete.

It sets out a prompt, fair, confidential and effective redress mechanism for targets of bullying. While it is agreed that the policy outlined in this document should also be applied in the case of prison officers, it is necessary to adopt specific arrangements for prison staff in view of the special statutory arrangements which apply to such staff in relation to potential discipline matters and investigations in relation to same. The final issue of a policy specifically designed for the Prison Service is currently the subject of discussions between management and prison staff associations. The Prison Service has also sought the advice of the Health and Safety Authority in relation to this matter. It is hoped that discussions with the staff associations will be completed shortly.The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform recognises its obligation to create and maintain a positive working environment where every employee has a right to be treated with dignity and respect. The Irish Prison Service takes a serious view of bullying in the workplace, and is anxious to ensure that any employee found to be engaged in such behaviour faces the full range of disciplinary sanctions available.The Prison Service leadership has raised awareness of the issue by ensuring that each prison institution has a safety statement in place which is brought to the attention of all staff. This statement includes a section dealing with bullying and harassment in the workplace. The Irish Prison Service has also put on record its support for the dignity at work charter, and a copy of this charter together with the Civil Service policy document referred to above has been circulated to safety co-ordinators and safety representatives at each institution for information pending finalisation of discussions on a specific policy for prison staff and the requisite statutory provisions arising.

Victimisation – where an individual is treated less favourably as a result of having participated in processes under the legislation – is also prohibited by the measure.The Act covers all goods and services which are available to the public, whether on payment or not. "Services" are defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment, travel, transport, professional services, education, disposal of premises and provision of accommodation and private registered clubs.Under equality legislation, there are two independent bodies with statutory roles: the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, ODEI – the Equality Tribunal. The Equality Authority which has the role of working towards the elimination of discrimination, provides information and advice to any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on any of the grounds covered in the equality legislation, whether in an employment or non-employment area.A person, including a foreign visitor, who claims that he or she has been discriminated against in the non-employment area may seek redress by referring the case to the ODEI – the Equality Tribunal. The director has the power under the Equal Status Act to refer the case for mediation or to investigate and decide such a case. If the director finds in favour of the complainant, she may make an order for compensation for the effects of discrimination and-or order a specific course of action to be taken. Complaints of discrimination are considered, in the first instance, by the ODEI – the Equality Tribunal. I should point out that the ODEI – the Equality Tribunal is an independent statutory office set up under the Employment Equality Act 1998 and that the director and her equality officers and equality mediation officers are independent in the performance of their functions. I have no statutory function in relation to such investigations and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any individual cases.Once a case has been determined by the director, the complainant or respondent involved may appeal against the decision to the Circuit Court. I am satisfied that the equality infrastructure put in place on the coming into force of the recent equality legislation and the avenues of redress provided in the legislation are adequate to respond to discrimination in our society.

The current position is that Garda district officers, superintendents, or acting district officers, inspectors, take personal charge of all fatal and serious injury traffic collisions to ensure that personnel with appropriate experience are assigned and that the collision is investigated thoroughly. In addition, all technical assistance is availed of, including photography, mapping and scenes of crime examination. Once an investigation has been completed it is then a matter for the law officers to decide on whether further action is appropriate.I am satisfied that there are experienced personnel, competent to carry out thorough and comprehensive investigations of fatal and serious injury traffic collisions available throughout the Garda Síochána and I have no plans at present to alter the current arrangements.

The council was informed on 26 November 2002 that it was not possible to give approval to the proposal given the high construction cost of the house and was requested to re-examine the design of the dwelling with the object of effecting savings on cost and to seek new tenders for the house.The county council sought new tenders for the dwelling and a revised proposal was submitted to my Department on 24 February 2003 seeking approval to accept a tender. The associated drawing was recently received in the Department and a decision on the revised proposal will be conveyed to the county council shortly.

It is proposed to find a suitable alternative date for a meeting before the end of May.The agenda for this meeting is to discuss outstanding issues with a view to finalising agreed habitat management arrangements for callow lands. As part of this agenda, the report of the expert team on losses and costs for landowners arising from implementation of the draft prescriptions will be presented and discussed. I hope that discussion of the report will enable all outstanding issues to be resolved.

An Agreed Programme for Government has stated that we regard the continued existence of Sellafield as an unacceptable threat to Ireland; that it should be closed, and that we will use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.The Government has taken a demonstrable initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions, in relation to the Sellafield MOX plant under the OSPAR Convention and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS. These actions are proceeding on schedule and are challenging operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental and safety grounds.In relation to the OSPAR case, oral hearings took place before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in October 2002 and a determination in the case is awaited. Oral hearings in respect of the UNCLOS case are expected to take place over three weeks beginning on 10 June 2003.

The fund will be used to support a wide range of environmental activities and initiatives, such as: the development of waste recycling and recovery infrastructure and financial assistance towards the operation of such facilities; the establishment of a national waste prevention programme, a market development programme and a recycling consultative forum; a new waste education and awareness campaign; and better enforcement of environmental legislation.Since November 2002, I have allocated over €22 million in capital grants towards 71 local authority recycling projects. To date, the Louth local authorities have received the following allocations: a sum of €1.035 million in respect of a civic amenity facility on Newry Road, Dundalk, and a sum of €187,000 in respect of the expansion and upgrading of the existing bring bank network. I intend to announce further allocations later in the year as local authorities develop proposals.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-05-08 00:00:00	Prelude	716	Initial results from the national litter pollution monitoring system published by my Department in February 2002 showed that food litter accounted for 11% of all litter pollution, with chewing gum comprising almost 70% of food litter items. More comprehensive data produced by the system will be published shortly by my  Department and will confirm that chewing gum is a significant element in litter pollution.Under the Litter Pollution Act 1997, primary responsibility for management and enforcement responses to litter pollution lies with the local authorities. Accordingly, it is a matter for each local authority to decide on the most appropriate public awareness, enforcement and clean-up actions in relation to litter, including in relation to the problem posed by chewing gum.An Agreed Programme for Government provides that consideration will be given to the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other areas. Final decisions have not yet been taken on products to be targeted as a priority in this regard.

This arrangement allows for the development of a funding and working relationship between the project and the State body with a view to that project's eventual mainstreaming. Mainstreaming is an important feature of the LDTF process whereby projects, which are deemed to be achieving their objectives, have their continued funding taken over by a designated Department or agency. Decisions on mainstreaming of local drugs task force projects are taken after they have been piloted and successfully evaluated.In regard to the projects in question, the channel of funding for the community policing forum in the north inner city, which was contained in their first action plan, was Dublin City Council. That forum dealt with estate management and community policing issues. Upon completion of a successful evaluation, the city council agreed to mainstream the project.The forum in the Finglas-Cabra task force is contained in their second action plan and will be funded through the Garda Síochána during its pilot phase. No decision on mainstreaming this project will be taken until it has been evaluated after the pilot period.

In 2003, the level of funding available in my Department's Vote for drugs projects increased by 16%.The Deputy should note that 129 projects contained in the first round of LDTF plans have been positively evaluated and were mainstreamed through other Departments and agencies in 2001. Consequently, they are now responsible for their continued and ongoing funding.

The intention would be where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed, thereby enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies.Qualification for continued funding will be dependent on the successful evaluation of each project by the services steering group, which has been set up to examine the projects, and sufficient funding being in place. The work of the steering group has been completed and recommendations have been made to the NAC with a view to making final recommendations to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at its June meeting. The development groups will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.The position regarding the funding of additional proposals is being considered by the national assessment committee which is having discussions with the relevant Departments and State agencies involved.The Cabinet committee recently considered a number of issues in relation to the operation of the fund, including its future funding. The matter remains under review.

As part of its terms of reference the committee was asked to examine and make recommendations and report to Government on: the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers; and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering.The national committee published its report, Tipping the Balance, on 16 October 2002. The report is an extremely detailed and comprehensive report covering many aspects of volunteering. The report contains wide-ranging recommendations which impact on many State and other bodies. Its major recommendations relate to the development of a national policy on volunteering and the establishment of a volunteering support and development infrastructure. Given the complexity of issues covered in Tipping the Balance and the wide-reaching implications associated with its recommendations, a thorough examination of the report is required. The process of examination and consideration is continuing in my Department.

Where there are delays in processing an application a person may seek payment of supplementary welfare allowance during that period.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the health boards, provides for the payment of a basic weekly allowance to eligible people who have little or no income. An assessment of a person's means and needs is carried out and where there is a shortfall in a person's income a payment may be made to bring that person's income up to the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.The decision to pay supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for the appropriate health board and would normally have regard to any hardship factors.
