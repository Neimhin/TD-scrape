#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	0	We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. He is joined by Mr. Ciaran Wright, senior auditor. Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Pat Deering. Last week we did not approve the minutes of the meeting of 8 November as there was one slight change to be made to the wording. Are the minutes of that meeting agreed to? Agreed.Are the minutes of 29 November and 6 December agreed? Agreed. The next item is matters arising out of the minutes. There is not anything specific because the correspondence will cover most items. The first item of correspondence in category A, briefing documents and opening statements, is Nos. 1788 A and 1791 A, from Mr. Seán Ó Foghlú, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 6 December 2018 and 11 December, respectively, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today's meeting on the provision of school transport. We will note and publish these. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next item, No. 1790 A, is an opening statement from Bus Éireann. We will note and publish it. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next item is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, as well as follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication. We held over three items from last week's meeting for further review. The first item was from Ms Mary Lawlor, public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 29 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee on Project Nantes with a breakdown of the €24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser. We requested a note from the parliamentary legal adviser on section 172. We will deal with that, not today but as soon as possible. We will consider that letter from NAMA as part of the briefing we will get from the parliamentary legal adviser. We note and publish this. The next item is No. 1767 B from the clerk to the committee of the Committee on Procedure, dated 30 November 2018, forwarding a complaint on matters raised by the committee in advance of the recent presidential election. The complainant believes the committee raised the matter of presidential expenses in order that it would become an issue in the election campaign. We agreed to note and publish a redacted form of the correspondence last week so as not to identify the person involved. However, I propose that the committee draft a letter to the Committee on Procedure and a similar one to the individual who raised the matter stating that the committee's consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation accounts 2016, Vote 1 - President's Establishment, was within the remit of the committee and that the committee's work highlighted important issues regarding transparency in the funding of the Office of the President. Is that agreed?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	1	Part of our problem was that it was not looked at until close to the election. We need to consider how we knit that into our work programme at the appropriate time.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	2	What I am suggesting to the committee is that the Vote for the President's Establishment is done as part of the group of Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach at the Estimates committee. We will take it as part of the day we have the Department of the Taoiseach here dealing with its Votes. There is a number of Votes associated with the Department of the Taoiseach, such as the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Central Statistics Office. There is quite a bit in the group of Votes under the Department of the Taoiseach and this is an associated Vote that is always taken as part of that group in the Estimates debate. We will group it as part of the meeting we will have with the Department of the Taoiseach because that Department discusses it at Estimates time. I propose in the work programme to take that group early in the new year.

I will make two points. Was an audit committee established within Áras an Uachtaráin as part of the changes that were made?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	4	That is correct, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	10	For 2016, there had not been a meeting but, certainly, during 2018 there have been meetings.

The President himself stated that once the election was over he would have no difficulty in publishing details of that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	12	I understand that there has been an announcement that they will be publishing something soon in relation to that allowance.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	14	For the benefit of those watching, we dealt with Vote 1, which is voted expenditure by the Oireachtas, and the Accounting Officer for the Department of the Taoiseach is the Accounting Officer. That Accounting Officer is who we had previously before the committee on this topic and he is who we will have present when we deal with the Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach, and we will include that as a specific item. It is important, however, to clarify what the Deputy has said. That allowance is paid directly from the Central Fund and does not go through voted expenditure at all, and that was one of the issues. The Central Fund is managed by the Department of Finance. We will specifically have to deal with that amount with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance when the Secretary General is before the committee. What is known as the Central Fund, the finance accounts of the State, does not go through the Oireachtas for a vote. The main other such items that are not voted through the Oireachtas, including that allowance that we spoke about, include interest on the national debt, contributions to the EU, payments for judges.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	16	The spending of it is not subject to audit by me.

Everything the Deputy is saying will be dealt with.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	20	Perfect.

Rather than us pre-empting our discussion in the spring, I am merely saying it must involve the two Secretaries General to deal with the full aspect of expenditure in Áras an Uachtaráin, those of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	22	That goes as far back as the 1990s. When the Accounting Officers appear before us, it would be useful for them to give some understanding of why it was decided to do it that way. Just as that is an anomaly, there may well be other anomalies. It would be interesting to see how such anomalies originate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	23	It goes back to 1938 with the establishment of the Office of President.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	24	It was escalated in the mid-1990s.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	25	It increased very significantly in 1997.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	26	We will certainly come to that. We will get a briefing on the background. I guess it was done in order that there would not be a controversial debate on the floor of the Dáil about such expenditure in an Estimates process. What was valid in 1938 may not be valid in 2018. That is a matter we will discuss when we come to it. We will look at that Finance account specifically. It is always a concern to me that large items are paid through this account and never discussed on the floor of the Dáil. People will have heard me say this previously. We will pay special attention to that account this year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	27	The committee will recall that there are quite significant net allied services from the Office of Public Works and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The committee may need to plan a little around how best to interrogate the total expenditure for the service.

Is it agreed to write to the person on the basis that the matter falls within our remit and we are not getting into any of the politics? We are merely getting the facts. Is that okay?
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	32	Yes.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	33	The next item is No. 1768 B from Mr Ciarán Breen, director, the State Claims Agency, dated 30 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee regarding medical negligence, open disclosure and CervicalCheck and Thalidomide-related litigation. We held this over from the last day. There is useful information in this correspondence that will feed into our periodic report. We asked for a breakdown of various aspects of the claims. The agency does not want to identify hospitals and talks about groups of hospitals. We do not want to go there at this point in time - we can consider the matter next year. However, there are two items. It gives a breakdown on the number of claims for maternity services and the total number of claims. One issue I had asked was, how much, out of what it pays every year, goes to the wards of court. It has given the figures: in 2015, 2016, 2017 and up to 31 October this year, it was €101 million, €81 million, €126 million and €87 million, respectively.The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has done a report on wards of court which the Dáil will debate in the new year. However, this is very interesting information that we have never seen before. It seems to be the practice that in serious cases it is agreed in the court that the person be made a ward of court. It looks as though a very high percentage of the payments made by the State Claims Agency are actually paid to the wards of court fund. This prompts another question as the wards of court fund is outside the reach of public scrutiny whereas when it is in the State Claims Agency it is within public scrutiny. I suggest we ask for one further piece of information in relation to that table 3, namely the total other payments for compensation so we can see the percentage of total payments to wards of court. I asked a question merely on guesswork but I am stunned at the amount of money that is going directly to wards of court. It illustrates the scale of the issue.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	34	I have said previously that a number of things were conflated when the State Claims Agency was before the committee. The whole issue of open disclosure is an area that we will have to examine thoroughly. I understand the State Claims Agency has a function in supervising or assisting or advising some parts of the public service in mitigating against claims arising in the future.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	35	It is a risk management advisory function.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	36	It would be useful if this played a part in our examination. Entities such as the Air Corps would fall into our examination when the State Claims Agency is again before the committee. It would have done some supervision and there are issues which certainly require scrutiny. There is also the matter of open disclosure in non-clinical claims. We need to look at a range of things including CervicalCheck, the wards of court and the difference in the types of hospitals where claims arise. The other component is also important. If we are to prevent future claims we must look at how they do their work on risk assessment. If that fails, we will end up with claims that we should not have.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	37	The Deputy is absolutely correct. We have had some engagement with the State Claims Agency but we can see there is work to be done on the costs of the claims, prevention and minimising, what has been done and the lessons learned. That has not been done before in the Oireachtas. I am not saying that we will do a special report, although we might, but we will examine it in 2019.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	38	I wish to raise something tangential to this. Where something happens in a hospital, and inevitably things do, there is an internal and external review. Claims often arise from these incidents but there is no record of those reviews. I raised this at the last meeting. For instance, in response to a question about external reviews - I did not ask about internal reviews - the Saolta Group in Galway has stated it has no record of external reviews carried out in the last ten years or the cost. That is the official answer.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	39	For the hospital.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	40	Yes, an external review of something that happened. The case of Savita Halappanavar is the most obvious example.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	41	I understood its main point to be that it does not have a central record so it cannot easily answer what is the aggregate cost. However, for any individual case, it could check the files relating to the incident where there is evidence.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	42	One would presume that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	43	I am presuming that.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	44	It ties in if we are looking at the reviews and we need to know the costs, what arose and what has been learned from them. I am struggling to know where to go with the answer. It was a simple question and the response was clear that it had no record. The question related to the number of external reviews and the cost.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	45	One core element of a governance structure is a risk management capacity in an organisation. What a risk management capacity should do is identify those types of issues, the learning points and ensure that there is follow up and that any continuing exposure is dealt with. There should be some kind of oversight in an organisation of where things might have gone wrong, have lessons been learned and if changes have been implemented. That might be the area on which to focus when addressing Saolta, and to ask if Saolta does not have the information, what is its risk management function doing if it is not doing that.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	46	The State Claims Agency said it would give a report back to the hospital but hospital managers come and go and there is no central learning process. Sometimes the State Claims Agency reports to the hospital. The reports the Deputy mentioned are commissioned centrally sometimes and they do not go to the hospital. There is a gap.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	47	I do not know but there is a simple question of how many external reviews have been undertaken in the last ten years, what did they cost and by whom were they carried out. That information should be readily available and passed on in terms of openness and accountability, and the information should be fed into the State Claims Agency, which ought to be aware of this. Otherwise, how can it do its job?
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	48	Does the Deputy want the committee to write directly to the HSE on this matter?

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	50	On a related matter, the committee wrote to Portlaoise Hospital for a breakdown of the review there. We told them it cost €399,000 and they wrote back saying it was €399,000. We formally asked for that breakdown some weeks ago and will ensure that we get it in due course. The next item of correspondence, No. 1754, is one held over from last week when we discussed it briefly. It is from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing and Local Government. This was the instance where, as I mentioned, the credit policy of the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme was heavily redacted. It was so voluminous that we had said that we would hold it over for consideration but I wish formally to note and publish the document rather than leave it hanging until the new year. We had a preliminary discussion last week but this is just to sign-off on it formally.

We have not made any progress. Correspondence No. 1775 B is from Dr. Des Fitzgerald, President, University of Limerick, dated 4 December 2018 providing additional information requested by the committee in relation to the steps taken by the University of Limerick to engage with three specific members or former members of staff. There are a number of employees or former employees of UL who have been in correspondence with the committee on this topic and therefore I think it is appropriate to ask the president to confirm that those to whom the correspondence refers have been sent a copy of this correspondence and, if not, to do so. We will note the correspondence and we will not publish the specific item yet. We will deal with the University of Limerick whistleblowers early in the new year and will return to it as part of our work programme.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	54	The whistleblower issue and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are separate.We will come to the work programme in a few minutes. We will hold that over until then but we do want to write back to make sure the people involved have been notified. The next item is No. 1775 B from Dr. Des Fitzgerald, President of the University of Limerick, UL, dated 4 December 2018, providing additional information requested by the committee in relation to the steps taken by the University of Limerick to engage with three specific members or former members of staff. It is a three page letter with one thing I want to confirm. In the second last paragraph of the letter on page 7, it is stated that persons B and C remain employees of UL. It continues by stating that UL continues to engage with persons B and C so as to ensure they can return to the workplace as soon as possible. I raised this the last day and I think we might have written back. If we have not, I want to know where in the workplace is being referred to. Is it a situation where the people involved are being offered some other job in some other section and not the job they were in before this incident? We need clarification. On reading that letter first, it might be thought that those people are back. If we delve deeper, they may not be back in their own job. I want that clarified. The next item of correspondence is No. 1776 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 4 December 2018, providing further information requested by the committee regarding the transfer of the property on Grace Park Road from religious congregations to the HSE under the residential institutions redress schemes. We will note and publish this. We will keep a hold of it. It is still between the solicitors. We will not sign off on that religious congregation handing over the sites yet. This is an update on the letters that are toing and froing but without conclusion. We will continue to monitor that. Correspondence No. 1778 B is from Mr. Seán Ó Foghlú, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 3 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee. I refer to the instruction given to education and training boards, ETBs, in respect of the publication of minutes of ETB meetings, including the date of commencement and a schedule for each of the 16 ETBs for the publication of their minutes. I am pleased today that all ETBs are now publishing minutes of their meetings online. We will note and publish this. Helping to get that carried out is something we have achieved.

The links have been included with this correspondence. If somebody calls up the correspondence in electronic format, he or she will get direct links to each of the ETBs. That is useful and we will publish it so that anybody who wants access to those records can use the website of this committee to follow those links. The item of correspondence is No. 1779 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 5 December 2018, providing a detailed note as requested by the committee on the release of slides related to CervicalCheck. Can we note and publish this?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	61	One of the first things learned in politics is that we read something the first time and then we decode it and read it again. It is welcome that have got this information but I fast forwarded to further slide requests on page 6. I read that. There is going to be a case next week, on 20 December I think it is, with an application to the High Court to have the records of the slides of some of these women released. Why is that happening?
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	62	That is fine.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	63	If I can finish, on reading this it looks like that there is a fairly short timeframe for providing these slides. I have been talking to some of the people involved. Some of the applications, included in these 18, go back to April. A fresh application, however, came in. It is not acknowledged anywhere that the original application for these slides goes back to last April and May, in some situations. It gives the impression that it is a shorter duration by virtue of the fact that there was a second application. The key issue here is the format in which slides or photographs are produced. I refer to them being usable in the event of a court case. There was to have been a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris. That was cancelled at very short notice, something like 12 hours notice, to the great disappointment of the 221 Plus group. This is one of the issues that would have featured at that meeting. Much of information here is accurate but there is one item of information that certainly takes a liberty - and a significant liberty.  The failure to begin with was that people were not given information about their own health. That has now been repeated because some people, albeit a small number, have to go to court to determine whether these records can be released. I do not think we were given any kind of indication that there was a dispute when the HSE was before this committee. For me, that is misleading this committee.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	64	I understand everything that was said. I have also been speaking to some of the ladies directly involved. For public information, I want to touch on a few points in the letter. It is an extensive letter with very detailed information. We welcome the information provided. It is the first time anybody will have seen this level of information on this matter. I do want to make some points for people watching. The letter states that in respect of the cytology slides it is a condition of the laboratory that it holds the document for up to ten years once testing has been completed. The letter from the HSE continues on page 2 with the kernel of the issue Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned. The HSE has put what it calls a protocol in place because it states that these slides are a critical piece of primary physical evidence that will be relied on by patients to advance their claims and by the laboratories and the HSE in defending any such claims. An exact protocol was put in place by the HSE as to how the slides are to be released. I will come back to that because it is relevant. The HSE states that it wants to maintain the chain of custody and to ensure that the slides are issued through laboratory to laboratory transfers. Even though the HSE, and the national screening service, is the legal custodian of these slides, they are normally held in laboratories. It goes on to state that a digital image is taken to record the condition of the slide prior to its dispatch so as to ensure that if a slide is lost or damaged in transit, a secondary record of the contents of that slide will be available. Typically, the taking of such images requires the input of a specialist cytologist or screener. That is some of the reason for the delay. I am just putting that on the record. I am not agreeing or disagreeing. It is being stated by the HSE that some of the issues patients have might result from a single patient slide being in one or two, or more, laboratories and more than one laboratory, therefore, might have to be contacted for some individual patients. The letter goes on to state that early on, before the HSE established its protocol, some people, because it is their medical information, were contacting the laboratories directly. The HSE was losing a chain of custody, as it calls it, of evidence that might be very relevant. It put this protocol in place and that has ensured that the HSE now has a centralised approach. I ask the Deputies to pick up on what I am saying when I am finished. The HSE has stated that the updated position, as of Friday, 28 November, was that slides have been released under the protocol to 30 patients represented by 16 different firms of solicitors. The number of patients who received slides following direct contact with the laboratories, before the protocol was put in place, was 18. On the next page, the HSE gives the release time for 49 slides. That is not 49 people because some people might have slides in more than one laboratory. It is clear that 25% of them were well over the eight week period. I cannot find this in the letter but the HSE has stated that, in its protocol, when arrangements are being put in place to meet a request for slides to be transferred from laboratory to laboratory, it must also be to an identified person with relevant experience taking overall responsibility for maintaining the physical environment in which the slides are stored and examined. I think we have to agree with that.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	65	Yes.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	66	I will move on. The court case concerns the fact that some people want their slides released but not in accordance with the HSE protocol. I think the essence of the case is not that people cannot get their slides. The HSE states that slides should be issued according to this protocol. People are saying they want their slides but not through the protocol. Deputy Catherine Murphy may correct me if I am wrong. I think this is why the HSE, from a centralised base, wants to maintain the chain of custody. It states that if slides are being transferred from laboratory to laboratory and from named physician to named physician, it wants this done in accordance with the protocol and it probably wants to maintain the integrity of that protocol rather than this happening outside of it. I am almost finished now, and Deputy Murphy may pick me up on anything she wants to pick me up on, but this is such an important issue that it is important to put this information out there. Then it states, "[A] firm has indicated that it wishes to have the High Court rule on the arrangements that should be applied to the release of slides where no legal proceedings are in being." They might not be in being now but they might be at a later date. The correspondence continues, "For completeness, it should be noted that...on 8 November last, the HSE had not received the information necessary to release slides relating to the 51 patients in question (i.e. the 18 patients who have issued proceedings and the 33 other patients who have not)." What had happened in these cases is that the HSE had identified the laboratory in Northern Ireland; however, it had not given the name of the responsible person in the laboratory. The HSE stated that it considers it likely that many of the requests that were referred to at our recent meeting are possibly part of that 51 in respect of which slides have not been released because the HSE has not been given the name of the person who was going to take custody for it in the laboratory in Northern Ireland. The correspondence gives the turnaround times relating to the slides in the table on the following page. If it looks as if I am defending the HSE, all I have been doing is summarising its position in its letter. The essence of the matter seems to be that there are a number of cases held up in which the person in the laboratory has not been identified and the HSE states it will not give a slide to a laboratory unless it knows who the responsible person is. Then there are other people who do not want to go through the HSE protocol. This seems to be the essence of the court case. I call Deputy Murphy. That is just my reading of the HSE's letter.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	67	I agree with a lot of the Chairman's summary. Certainly, no one, not least the women involved, would want the original slides to be exposed to any kind of damage. That would not be in anyone's interest. Quite rightly, there is a protocol. My understanding is that the protocol was deemed not sufficient by one solicitor who had experience of contesting a case in the courts and that this same solicitor, who has a number of clients, went back and suggested some amendments to the protocol within a week - this was in September - and has not been engaged with since. It is important to say that. Essentially, the HSE is stating, "It is our protocol. It cannot be amended." My understanding is that the difficulty is that the resolution of the photograph of the slide that the HSE proposes would be not sufficient to show up the abnormalities. What use is that? This is the kernel of the problem. Going back to our relying on information when a public body comes before the committee, we were told there was a 22-day turnaround. It was as if we were inventing a problem. This problem has been acknowledged in this letter and it will be further acknowledged next week. I hope the matter does not have to go to court. There would be absolutely zero point in going to court if there were a satisfactory outcome to the matter. It strikes me that there was zero discussion of there being a problem here when we had representatives of the HSE before the committee. I really take exception to that. We must be able to believe what people tell us when they come before us. The word "candour" has been used here on numerous occasions. We would not have had to keep going back looking for information if it had all been outlined in the first instance. There continues to be a problem, however, and I think the public would be surprised at this, given that the failure, or part of the failure, in the first place was not providing the information that was needed. It must be given in a format that is usable as well.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	68	I think the HSE acknowledges on a couple of occasions the unsatisfactory length of time it is taking. It does put its hands up and does not disguise this. In its own way it is important we release this letter today because many people are looking for it and there is significant information in it. Our discussion teasing out the issues here is probably helpful to the process. I ask the HSE please to listen to what is being said here this morning because we were told these matters should not have to go to court. If there are issues with the details of a protocol, I ask the HSE to try to sort them out without going to the High Court if at all possible. I think we would be unanimous on this if it could be done. I thank Deputy Murphy for raising the matter. Without her pursuing it the last day, we would not have this correspondence today. It is very useful for many people involved, especially the women directly affected. The next item of correspondence is 1780 B from the HSE, providing information on the Deloitte report into governance arrangements in respect of section 38 and section 39 organisations. It is expected that we will be given a copy of this report in January. The next item is 1782 B from Mr. Pat Smyth, interim CEO of Tusla, dated 4 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on procedures to secure service level agreements and the memorandum of understanding on information-sharing with An Garda Síochána. We will note and publish this. The important aspects of this letter are the following. Regarding the memorandum of understanding on the sharing of information with An Garda Síochána, Tusla makes quite an issue of the data-sharing agreement and the legal services involved from both organisations. I think they are getting advice on this. Tusla states:Once approved and signed off, Tusla and [An Garda Síochána] will agree an implementation strategy. The time frame for implementation has been set as Q1 2019.That is useful. The other item Tusla gives is a full list of all the organisations with which it has commissioned a service level agreement. I think every one of these organisations bar one has signed a service level agreement, and that one exception is in the process of being - to use Tusla's words - "decommissioned" from dealing with Tusla. This is again progress on following up on these service level agreements. We started with the HSE, we found a weakness in Tusla, we referred to it in our periodic reports and Tusla seems to be 100% on top of the job. We will note and publish the correspondence. The next item of correspondence is 1784 B from Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, dated 5 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on the review of the pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes. It includes a note on the progress of the Deloitte prospectus review and a note on the nursing homes steering committee. We will note and publish this. People may be interested in it. It is a follow-on from the information we requested. There are copies of minutes of meetings and of records of information. That is useful. The next item is 1785 B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing an information note on testing the constitutionality of excise law in a tax appeal case. This was mentioned at our meeting. He says it is not a matter for the Tax Appeals Commission to make any determination but, rather, it is a matter for the courts to decide constitutionality. He provides information on high-income individuals' restriction and a summary of section 485F, carry forward of excess relief for the years 2007 to 2016. This is as a result of a question I asked and it is good to get this in the public domain. The correspondence concerns one of the reasons some high-wealth individuals pay quite reduced amounts in tax. We understood that if they had losses, and if they had claimed this allowance and carried forward losses in a given year rather than using them all, they could carry them forward again.Some people will be interested in that. We asked for details of the fines imposed by courts in respect of tobacco. We found them farcical. For the millions of euro involved the fines issued were farcical, and the situation has become more farcical now. Three cases went to court. One person was fined €12,000 and two individuals each received a fine of €5,000. One individual received a fine of €5,000. Any defendant who received a sentence had it fully suspended. There is zero deterrent to smuggling in Ireland as far as I can see. We talk about it every year. The revenue or some other body should be given the authority to impose very serious fines. All that happens is that smugglers lose one particular shipment. They carry on the next week with the next lorry-load. That is something we will have to come down on firmly in our periodic report. It is no wonder it is happening on this scale because there is zero enforcement and zero penalties relative to the scale of activity.  The next item is No. 1,786, from Ray Mitchell of the HSE-----

The next item is from Mr. Ray Mitchell at the HSE. We are keeping that man busy this week. The item is a note on the record retention policy in place, in particular procurement documents, and changes that will be made to this. There is also a note providing a list of supports available to those affected by the H1N1 vaccine, that is, the flu vaccine. This arose from matters concerning the procurement of goods and services and retention of records. We found that some of the documentation concerning CervicalCheck was not kept on file. That is where that query arose.  The next item of correspondence is No. 1,787 from Mr. Nick Ashmore, chief executive officer of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, dated 5 December 2018. It provides a response requested by the committee regarding the value for money query. I propose we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual who raised the matter. I find this response completely unsatisfactory. From recollection I think we asked some questions. A major fund is available to the SBCI. It does not lend directly. It provides funding to on-lenders, meaning banks or other institutions. I want to know the breakdown of how much is provided through banks and how much is provided through non-bank on-lenders. I find it extraordinary that on writing to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland we got back a three-page letter on money matters without a euro symbol in it. There is a lot of lovely talk about policies and principles. It could have been taken from the opening statement describing what the SBCI does in its annual report. It gives us none of the information we are really looking for; how much the SBCI has loaned, how much the banks have loaned on, how much the non-banks have loaned on-----

Talk about a generalised response. The SBCI was hoping we would accept it. We do not accept it. We acknowledge it, but we want a proper reply the next time. The next item is No. 1,789 from Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, dated 6 December, providing information requested at our meeting last week. These queries concerned contracts awarded without a competitive process. There are very useful details here. Mr. Griffin says that some of the issues relate to very specialised, unique expertise only available to a very limited number of contractors, or in some areas only available to one. There is good information there. We will note and publish that. 
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	89	I do not accept the responses that have come back, to be honest. They raise more questions about the procurement process. We are talking about contracts which are awarded without a competitive process. There may be times when that is the only possible outcome but it seems to happen an awful lot. To give a couple of examples, the Department states in the document that the contract was awarded for Corrib north and Corrib south-----
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	90	What number is assigned to this item on the document?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	91	No. 10.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	92	The information on Corrib north and Corrib south states that the contractors have the requisite expertise and knowledge to carry out the urgent assessments required, and the contractor has specialist knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this complex project. That does not necessarily mean that there were no other possibilities. It is not an excuse for not having a tendering process. The same applies to the contract to support the development of the national mitigation plan, NMP. The Department says the process was shelved because the supplier is considered unique because of the research it offered. Who considered the contractor unique? Again, I do not accept that as a reason not to have a tendering process. The same occurred with a NMP climate modelling contract worth more than €600,000. Again, there were no competitive bids. The Department's reason is that the contractor has a specialist team. There is a wider implication here. Even if it was the case that these were unique specialist services, why is in-house expertise not being built up at the Department? It was the same with the national broadband plan. We have ended up with only one bidder because it seems that the only contractor left is the one that can do the job. We all know why that happened; because of privatisation. However I do not accept that for these contracts. An awful lot of contracts are being awarded without any competitive tension at all. We are given the excuse that the Department believes that the supplier is the only organisation or private company that can do the job. That does not cut it. I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined the correspondence. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	93	The point the Deputy is raising is exactly the relevant one. We challenge these outcomes when we become aware of them. We ask the Department to demonstrate to us that this is the only supplier who can do this. It is a little clearer when a public body is locked into an ICT system and there is only one supplier of licences or requisites for it. We then check that the procurement testing for that has been carried out, even on a ten-year cycle, and that there is proper full-life recognition of the costs associated with the contract. A public body cannot just pick a supplier and decide that the State is tied to that supplier.

The Department is saying that it considers the supplier for the national mitigation plan to be unique. Who decides that this contractor is unique? Why is it not tested? Mr. McCarthy's point is-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	95	That is tested by putting the contract out to tender and seeing if the supplier in question is the only one that comes forward.

Following up on what Deputy Cullinane was saying, I am struck by No. 4. The upgrade of the Department's financial management system was worth €74,000.It says the vendor is the sole supplier within Ireland of the software used by the Department of Finance. How did the Department pick a financial management system with only one supplier of that service in Ireland? It is nonsense to think there is not a myriad of companies that could provide a financial management system to the Department. We will write to it asking it to give us an information note regarding each of the items mentioned by the Deputy where there was either a sole supplier or these people had unique expertise. We want a note on each of them as to how the Department arrived at that conclusion. 
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	100	I raised this previously. I know we have a very busy work schedule and a lot of work to do but the broader issue concerns procurement. This is another example of where there are problems. This time, it is citing a lack of expertise in the marketplace and saying that in its judgment, only specialised companies can do this work. In other areas, we have seen examples involving leaving it too late before rolling over contracts or putting them out for tender. We know there are ongoing problems in the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills. We have done it but it is bit sketchy. We are coming at it in bits and pieces here and there so I ask that we join it all up and at some point, produce a report on procurement because the problem is that there are no sanctions.

We then give the Accounting Officer a slap on the wrist, there is no punishment or sanction and it continues. I know there have been some improvements in the HSE because of our work. Notwithstanding that, it still comes up over and over again for many different reasons. I know we will get to our work programme. Can we look at the issue?

I have raised the matter with regard to computer expertise. What is happening is that there is less and less competition. That is the problem. There is less and less competition under the guise of more competition and we are struggling piecemeal with it so I would certainly welcome an opportunity to come back and deal with it in a more comprehensive manner. We are just beginning to identify the problems. It is a bit like spin-off companies where we barely touch on the matter.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	106	We will write to the Department asking it to give us a detailed explanation in each case involving a sole contractor and tell us how it arrived at that conclusion. For example, €100,000 was paid for the provision of legal advice regarding the Corrib gas field project. The reasons given for not having a competitive process include the contractor having specialist knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this complex project. We would certainly hope that whoever was getting the contract had specialist knowledge and an understanding of the project or it should not have got th.e contract but to suggest that there was nobody else in the country who could have done it does not stand up from our perspective. We will come back to that We now turn to correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. No. 1774 C from Senator Gerard Craughwell, dated 3 December 2018, is correspondence requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding the expenditure by the Department of Defence defending High Court actions on its failure to implement the working time directive for the Defence Forces. We will request a note from the Department regarding the matters raised. 
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	107	This is an important issue that was raised with me. The Defence Forces are not subject to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. Similar Acts are in place in other countries to which the relevant defence forces are subject so we are unique in this respect. Because there is no possibility for class action in this State, individual cases are being taken by the trade union. It seems the WRC is siding with the workers in each and every case. Rather than, again, dragging more and more workers through the WRC with a cost to the State, it would make more sense to deal with the substantive issue. It seems that from the WRC perspective, the EU has a competency in this area that supersedes national law. This is one of the reasons the WRC is making the judgments it is making. Senator Craughwell mentions the European directive in his correspondence. We need to go back to the Department with that substantial point, which is that if it is losing all these individual cases and is faced with more, why does it not deal with the substantial problem here?

No. 1783 C is correspondence from an individual regarding the response from the University of Limerick regarding mediation processes at the college. The individual does refer to Dr Fitzgerald's item of correspondence, which we discussed earlier. The individual wishes to know if he is referred to in Dr Fitzgerald's correspondence. It does not appear to be the case. I propose we note this item and inform the individual accordingly. We will be discussing our engagement with the University of Limerick and whistle blowers at the university as part of our work programme in a few moments.

We do not know if it is backed by the State to the tune of 1% or 99%. We have no concept. It is good PR to put out that it is a State-backed fund. The extent to which it is backed by the State might be substantial or minuscule; I have no idea. We need to know what the State's investment in that fund is.

It did come from part of that and is now managed through this system. The NTMA publishes a list of investments each year. I think it should be able to give it to us straight up. Again, I will ask. If that information arrives in the near future, I will want to make sure that this reply about the State's share in the Irish Strategic Investment Fund is circulated as soon as that reply arrives.

Let us test some of those minutes and see how we get on with them. We can certainly come back and ask for further information. That is the end of correspondence and we now move on to statements on accountancy since the last meeting. There are four on the screen. There is the carbon fund clear audit opinion, the University College Dublin clear audit opinion and the usual issue about the deferred pensions in the education sector and payments totalling €5.4 million to 75 suppliers for goods and services where procurement procedures did not comply with Government procurement guidelines. We will group them all together. Next is the Limerick and Clare ETB, clear audit opinion with the same issue of a material level of non-compliance with national procurement rules. There is also Laois and Offaly ETB, clear audit opinion and attention is drawn to the disclosure statement on internal control that Laois and Offaly ETB would welcome an increase in internal audit resources. We covered that last week. Here we go again. UCD and Limerick and Clare ETB are not in compliance with public procurement guidelines. Is there any information on the statement of internal control in the accounts?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	151	Yes, there is.

For anyone who wants a breakdown or background on that, it is in the published financial statements laid before the Oireachtas. The next item is work programme and we want to talk about the meetings early next year. We are not proceeding with the meeting with the Irish Prison Service next week. Is that agreed? I think everyone is agreed to that. Time is very tight and we will come back to that. Thursday, 17 January, we are having the first meeting back with the Department of Justice and Equality about the Irish Prison Service and Vote 21. Hopefully that is agreed. The following Tuesday is a separate and private meeting with the whistelblowers and complainants in relation to the University of Limerick. We will pencil that in now, but when we go into private session for another item, we might have a brief discussion on the structure of that meeting. We will do that in private session in a moment, but we will publicly set that date for it now. On Thursday, 24 January, we will deal with the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the Waterford Institute of Technology and his special report on the remuneration of certain staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology, Sligo. Those organisations, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills will attend on 24 January. All of these have to be confirmed. On 31 January, we are back to our housing meeting. We will have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and specifically the Irish Council for Social Housing. We will deal with the Vote for housing and planning. We will try to conclude our meetings about housing at that meeting. On 2 February, we have the Vote from the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on chapter 1 deals with the financial outturn for 2017. Chapter 2 deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer. Chapter 3 deals with the control of funding for voted public services. Chapter 22 relates to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. We will have to make arrangements as to whether it will take a separate slot at the meeting or be a part of the bigger meeting because I think the council is meant to be independent. We will work out the format of that.

We might keep that to a separate 30 minutes. We will not repeat the meeting with the finance committee at which the council presented recently because that happens several times a year. We will not duplicate the finance committee's work. The accounts for the Department of Finance for 2017 will come after that, the national central fund to which I referred earlier.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	165	The issue there is instructions by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the collection of pension contributions where there are charges for services. That Department has been running that. Pensions policy is an issue for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform rather than the Department of Finance.

Are there separate Accounting Officers for those?

We might not get them all done, but we will provisionally put them in at this stage. On 7 March, we are back to the Department of Justice and Equality for everything else outside the Irish Prison Service.  There are other items on the work programme that we will set dates on. We said we would come back to public-private partnerships and the Dormant Accounts Fund. Procurement is another one we will come back to. We said we would come back to the sale of the greyhound racing track in Harold's Cross. We are awaiting further correspondence. We want to deal with the whole issue of protected disclosures, medical negligence and the State Claims Agency. Broadband providers are on the list. Incontinence wear and nursing home charges have been mentioned in correspondence. I recently spoke to the person with whom we were in correspondence to indicate we would meet him in January but if they are to meet members of the committee-----

As I understood it, after our last meeting when Deputy O'Connell was here, we would ask the HSE. The Brothers of Charity Services in Ireland would not have to come, but we would ask their representatives and go through this. The issue was that they seemed to be applying rules and people were being charged, some of whom were reimbursed, others of whom were reimbursed from a certain date but not the whole time period. The person who contacted me took issue with the information that Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE provided to this committee. I have unilaterally written my own rebuttal to Mr. Mitchell, putting a series of questions. I sent it off lately, so I have no response. It would be good to have the HSE and the Brothers of Charity before the committee but Deputy O'Connell said at the meeting, and others agreed, that such a hearing could be broadened to include other indirect charges being applied to long-term residents in nursing homes.

We will discuss it in that context when we have the HSE in but in the meantime, I have given a commitment that I would meet the people who wrote those directly in the new year in any event. We will circulate the time of that meeting. It will not be a Committee of Public Accounts meeting; we will meet in a meeting room and any member who wants to come to that meeting is welcome.

The second HSE issue which is not in the work programme that I am raising for the first time is HSE outsourcing, not under sections 38 and 39, but in respect of adult services for people with disabilities, how that is handled, how it is supervised and the amount that is provided. That is something that at some point in the first half of next year it would be well worth specifically looking at.

Reasonably often I come across issues relating to failures where services are supposed to be provided but they turn out to be inappropriate and the person does not go to the service. It is being paid for but the service is not being used in such circumstances. The level of supervision of that leads to the inadequacy of the services.

I would like to pursue the outstanding issue of the eight or nine people with it again because we posed a number of questions the last time that were not adequately answered. Of the remaining eight or nine thalidomide sufferers who are not being accepted as being part of the scheme, one is a judge and one works here in the Houses. It is not a significant sum of money and we could be more compassionate about how we are dealing with it. I do not know whether other members agree.

The final sentence states:Subsequently the Chief State Solicitor's Office, due to pressure on resources in its office, came off record in the Thalidomide matters and was replaced by Hayes, Solicitors, a firm with an established track-record in the Defence of medicinal product liability litigation. For transparency purposes, payments to Counsel, whether on or off panel, are published biannually on the SCA's website. No payments have been made to any of the State's Counsel in the Thalidomide cases. I will ask the secretariat to go through that correspondence and the earlier correspondence and if there are any outstanding questions from the day we were here we will ask the secretariat to submit them.

We are talking about eight or nine people and it is being defended in the High Court and we have Hayes Solicitors on record, which is a private firm that is incurring a cost to the State and all so on. The State's default position will be to defend every case and I would love to know why it is throwing money at this when there are so few people who are clearly thalidomide sufferers. I would like an explanation because it would be much cheaper to mediate and get it done.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	214	We need to have a look at the structure of the State Claims Agency and we have not done that sufficiently. It became clear when we were looking at the CervicalCheck issue that proceedings had to be issued in court before the agency even knew about it. It did not seem that there was a mechanism to do open disclosure in a way that was non-legalistic. That has to be part of what we do when we examine the agency because we will have to keep going back on individual streams of work that relate to different issues such as CervicalCheck or thalidomide unless we get to that.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	215	I will make a general point related to how long things take. Regarding the summit on the catastrophic infants' cases, the agency in its correspondence states, "The Agency only ever becomes involved when the letter of claim is received." By that time, the solicitor has done all the research and all the work and then submits his or her claim. The agency further states, "This has the inevitable consequence that the Agency has to "play catch-up" as it can only commence its liability and causation investigations when it receives a letter of claim." By definition, then, the system is geared such that there will be a significant time lag. This is another example of it. The agency will be before the committee again as part of our work programme but we will write to it in the meantime if there is a gap in its responses to the issues we raised with it the last day. We will now go into private session.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	216	The committee will examine the Comptroller and Auditor General Special Report 98 on the provision of school transport. We are joined from the Department of Education and Skills by Mr. Seán Ó Foghlú, Secretary General, Mr. Ned Costello and Mr. Richard Dolan. They are accompanied by representatives of Bus Éireann: Mr. Stephen Kent, CEO, Mr. Tom Delaney and Ms Miriam Flynn. I also welcome Ms Deirdre Hanlon, assistant secretary, and Mr. Kevin Doyle from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off or set to aeroplane mode. Phones that are on silent may interfere with the recording system. I wish to advise witnesses of the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members of the committee are reminded of Standing Order 186, which provides that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies. While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by committee members clearly and with candour, they can, and should, expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol. I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make a brief opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	217	Special report 98 looks at the arrangements in place for the provision of school transport. The examination was carried out to ascertain whether the Department of Education and Skills can demonstrate that it is achieving value for money through its arrangements with Bus Éireann to deliver the school transport service and whether there is adequate oversight of the service by the Department. The special report was based on financial and service data relating to 2015. The briefing material provided by the Department includes data for later periods and there have been some significant subsequent developments which the Accounting Officer will explain. However, as the key findings of the report are likely to still apply, I will present them as reported. Primary school children are eligible to avail of school transport services if they live not less than 3.2 km from their nearest suitable school. The eligibility minimum distance for post-primary pupils is 4.8 km. Pupils who do not qualify under the eligibility rules may use the school transport service if there is spare capacity on a bus route. Such users are known as concessionary ticket holders. Eligible children who hold a medical card and special needs pupils are exempt from charges for availing of the service. The cost to the Department of school transport services in 2015 was €173 million, or close to €1 million per school day. The bulk of the cost is accounted for by payments to Bus Éireann, which received €149 million in 2015, or 86% of the amount spent by the Department. Bus Éireann also collected a little less than €14 million in fees from fare-paying pupils. The balance of the expenditure by the Department is accounted for by various grants, including for special needs escorts and transport grants. The average annual cost of transporting eligible pupils was approximately €1,800 per head in 2015. Fees recouped from fare-paying pupils amounted to a little more than 8% of the costs.  Although there has been a steady increase in the total number of enrolments in primary and post-primary schools over the past decade, the number of pupils who are eligible for and avail of the school transport service has fallen significantly.In 2007, the number of eligible pupils who availed of the scheme was 127,000 or 16% of enrolled pupils. By 2015, this had dropped to 89,000 or 10% of enrolled pupils. The school transport bus fleet is made up of a mix of large, medium and small buses. Taxis are also used to transport some pupils with special needs. Much of the service is subcontracted by Bus Éireann to private bus and taxi operators. Payments to subcontractors accounted for 71% of the cost of the service provided by Bus Éireann in 2015. Based on assumed average carrying capacities for vehicle types, we estimated the bus fleet as a whole had a potential carrying capacity of 163,000 pupils in 2015. Relative to the number of eligible pupils, the estimated level of spare carrying capacity in the fleet was 48%. Some of this spare capacity is taken up by concessionary ticket holders but the estimated residual spare capacity in 2015 was still significant, at about 35%. There was also evidence that some ticket holders do not use the transport available on a daily basis resulting in further underutilisation. At the same time, there is local demand in certain areas for concessionary access to school transport services that cannot be accommodated. The examination also looked at the oversight arrangements in place between the Department and Bus Éireann. We found that in 2015 the Department was still relying on arrangements that had been in place for over 40 years contained in a 1975 document entitled, Summary of Accounting Arrangements. I concluded that the accounting arrangements provided for in the 1975 agreement are inadequate given the level of costs involved. Reporting requirements are weak and there is an absence of key performance indicators or other metrics that would allow the Department to assess service performance and the achievement of value for money. I recognise there have been some developments since the report was completed on a service level agreement. The accounting arrangements provide for the Department to pay an annual lump sum transport management charge to cover Bus Éireann's indirect and unspecified other direct costs. The charge is provided for in the agreement at 13% of direct costs. By agreement between Bus Éireann and the Department, the management charge was capped at €16.7 million in 2011, at €15 million a year between 2012 and 2014 and at €11.3 million for 2015. Information provided by Bus Éireann to the Department and the costs to be met from the management charge indicate that, notwithstanding the cap, the amount paid was in excess of costs in each of the four years to 2014, resulting in an accumulated surplus being held by Bus Éireann estimated by the Department at €11.2 million at the end of 2015. The report includes a number of recommendations for improvement in the oversight and accounting arrangements. The Accounting Officer will be able to brief members on implementation progress in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	218	I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear before it. I will not read my full opening statement given the tightness of time. I will focus on our response to the recommendations. The Department’s general agreement with the recommendations is recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. As the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, progress has been made on implementing the recommendations since that time. On forecasting, while the school transport scheme continues to be a demand-led scheme, in planning for projected demand the Department liaises closely with the National Council for Special Education in regard to projected enrolment trends at primary and post-primary. The Department is undertaking a route audit with independent professional advice to ensure that route design is optimised from a value for money point of view, taking into account the location of eligible children. In the process of preparing for that review, the Department worked with Bus Éireann on the digitisation of its route maps. The Department has strengthened the governance framework around school transport and continues to do so. We have worked with Bus Éireann to put in place a number of additional elements of our governance framework, which builds on the 1975 arrangement that underpins our relationship with Bus Éireann on school transport provision. A service level agreement has been put in place between the two organisations. This sets out the reporting arrangements in place between the two organisations, the roles and responsibilities of both organisations, the agreed outputs to be delivered by Bus Éireann and the key performance indicators for the operation of the scheme. The agreement is under review and it is intended that an updated service level agreement will be put in place in 2019, with a view to further strengthening the governance framework around school transport. Also in the context of reporting and performance monitoring, certain overhead costs and other indirect costs attributable by Bus Éireann to the school transport scheme are known collectively as the transport management charge. The Department commissioned an independent expert to carry out a review of the apportionment methodology for it. The report was completed in March 2018. The report provides a detailed analysis and classification of the costs incorporated into the charge. Based on the recommendations of the report, the Department has developed a reporting framework and we are working with Bus Éireann with a view to completing these reports initially on a biannual basis with a view to moving to quarterly reports. In addition, the Department has been taking steps to reduce the accumulated surplus arising from the charge. The surplus of €11.2 million recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General' report will be eliminated by the end of the current year. In regard to the final recommendation, all operational meetings between the Department and Bus Éireann are minuted and agreed by all attendees as a standing agenda item. While it did not generate recommendations, it is noted that a central part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was an examination of Bus Éireann’s procurement processes. The report records that Bus Éireann was compliant with public procurement guidelines. I will mention two other areas of note in the school transport scheme. The first concerns concessionary transport. The purpose of the school transport scheme, having regard to resources, is to support the transport of children who live in remote areas. We have heard about the distance criteria. Families of eligible children living in areas where it is uneconomic to provide a transport service are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements if a service is not available. A number of non-eligible children are also transported in those circumstances, where bus places are available, after all eligible children are catered for. The transport is provided in the interest of maximising the utilisation of the existing fleet and in providing a service to families where the capacity exists to do so. Since the number of spare places is dependent on the number of eligible children requiring transport, there can be no guarantee from year to year of a place for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria. On the special education needs scheme, the purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability. In general, such children are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet their needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs. The Department and Bus Éireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for these children. This is reflected in the standard of service provided by Bus Éireann, factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of these services which generally operate on a door-to-door basis. Eligible children are exempt from school transport charges. At a cost of almost €190 million in 2017, school transport constitutes a significant expenditure of taxpayer money. The scheme is under financial pressure from increasing demographics at primary and post-primary level but, more significantly, from the increase in the numbers of children with special educational needs being transported. While cognisant of the costs associated with the scheme, and having taken on board the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Department is continuing to strengthen the process to ensure value for money in the delivery of the school transport scheme, while also ensuring that all eligible children are accommodated with school transport services.  I am very happy to provide any further information sought and respond to questions from the committee. As the Chairman noted, we are joined by representatives of Bus Éireann.

They have joined me as part of a new senior management team at Bus Éireann. We are very pleased to be here to answer any questions and assist the examination of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. We have been operating the school transport scheme successfully for over 50 years. We do not exercise discretion on the policy and all applications are simply dealt with in accordance with the rules and guidelines. It is important to note at the outset that the delivery of our operation on the ground is highly complex and the scheme is administered by Bus Éireann on a cost recovery basis only. The scheme has expanded dramatically in terms of vehicle numbers as the number of services provided under the scheme has increased from 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to more than 4,500 now.More than 460 new school transport services were approved by the Department and introduced by Bus Éireann in 2017. This year alone, another 300 new services are expected to be introduced by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. The vast majority of these will cater for children with special educational needs. All newly sanctioned services are opened to public tender by Bus Éireann. With regard to the management of the overall network, 95% of Bus Éireann fleet operates two double trips daily, with the bus used for different school runs both morning and evening, comprising two return trips. More than 60% of contractors also operate double trips. It is important to note that 83% of the costs of the scheme comprise payments to contractors. Due to the nature of special educational needs routes, where the individual needs of a child are taken into account, many of these services are operated in single vehicles on a door-to-door basis. On procurement, more than 90% of routes are subcontracted to private operators and 20% of these routes are tendered on an annual basis by Bus Éireann in compliance with EU guidelines on procurement. We welcome the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which demonstrates that Bus Éireann is fully compliant with public procurement standards. This is testament to our stringent and equitable standards, which we apply to all our procedures and practices. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted opportunities for improved governance and I will touch on those. There has been the introduction of a service level agreement, there are monthly operations meetings to review periodic financial and statistical reports and there are quarterly meetings with the chief executive and senior officials from the Department. I can provide some context in the information we cover in this regard. We provide a formal budget and projected costs for the financial year, which are agreed at the start of every year, and these consider both internal and external cost drivers, emerging trends, the anticipated level of demand and policy developments which may have a bearing on each of the cost headings each year. We prepare a schedule of monthly payments based on the number of school days each month, the mode of transport and the eligible children travelling. This is furnished to the Department at the beginning of each year, and it is designed to provide an estimate of the annual projected cost. These figures are reviewed at monthly meetings and amended as required. Sometimes there must be change, such as when there is a status red weather warning and costs have to be reviewed. Individual statutory accounts are not produced for school transport as it is not structured as a separate company within Bus Éireann. However, all finances pertaining to school transport are audited and a separate statement of account for the school transport scheme is prepared as part of the company’s annual independent audit. Bus Éireann is committed to providing the highest levels of transparency to the Department across all cost allocations. We have engaged specifically with the Department on allocations related to the indirect costs of staff, property and information technology, which account for nearly 85% of these indirect charges. Most recently, we are in joint agreement that all these costs are demonstrably related to school transport. A biannual review is in place to ensure that the basis for cost allocation is robust and transparent. Bus Éireann accounts are fully audited by Deloitte. An additional audit of all school transport activity is undertaken to comply with the summary of accounting arrangement in line with the 1975 agreement. This year and taking into account the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Bus Éireann is in discussions with our auditors regarding a separate audit under general accepted accounting principles for the school transport part of our business. Bus Éireann’s 2017 accounts noted that a €6.7 million ring-fenced surplus was held within its reserves on behalf of the Department to be used solely for future expenditure on school transport-related activities. In recent years, this has included spend on the creation of a new online ticketing system, an improved telephony and call management system and new school buses, all of which were authorised by the Department. Currently there is no surplus in reserve and our 2018 financial statements will support this position. On the subject of the special needs scheme, it has evolved in recent years with a significant growth in the provision of transport for special educational needs children. This year, we received in excess of 3,000 new individual special educational needs applications or requests for amendments to services and this contributes to the growing cost of providing services. It is also worth noting that while the volume of work has increased because it is complex to deliver, there has not been a corresponding increase in the costs of administration associated with this. We welcome the expansion of the scheme in recent years and we are conscious that we must also continue to strategically refine our own resources, processes, procedures and technology supports to ensure we meet its growing needs. We will do all that in close liaison with the Department of Education and Skills. We are committed to full transparency and to continuing this close co-operation as the scheme evolves. We fully enforce the rules of the scheme, comply with the performance requirements of the service level agreement and every day we try to deliver high standards of safety, consistency and reliability for all students who avail of the school transport scheme. We do this on behalf of the State. We have been operating the school transport scheme for over 50 years and we look forward to continuing to providing this vital service into the future.

#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	221	I welcome the representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Bus Éireann. The roll-out of the bus system for schools was a good idea and I availed of it when I attended secondary school in 1968, which is a good few years ago now. While it was a great scheme when it was rolled out, there is always a "but". I am a rural Deputy representing County Kilkenny and every year, from July onwards, school transport, in particular concessionary tickets, causes me a major headache. I will focus on that issue today. As I mentioned, the service is good for most but it is not good for those who are left behind. That is the problem. I hear daily about problems and even last week a constituent with four children contacted me here in Leinster House about a problem. Most parents work nowadays and it is not like it was years ago, when one parent stayed at home while the other was the breadwinner. It has changed and both parents must work, so getting children to and from school is the issue. The Fianna Fáil Party did some research for the 2016 general election and we updated the results this year. It found that 350 pupils with concessionary tickets did not access the school transport service this year and that €4 million would be sufficient to cover the costs involved. I accept that is a simplified version and rolling out services to this group would be a different job for Bus Éireann. It is small money in the overall purse of taxpayers' money. The Department and the Minister should address the issue. I repeatedly bring it to his attention. There was a recession and we changed the rules in 2009 or 2010. Now that the recession is over, we should review the scheme and look after the 350 children who have been left behind this year, if my figure is correct. We should try to include them in the school transport scheme. Will the witnesses comment on that first?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	222	The concessionary element is a key part of this, as we organise the scheme on the basis of eligible pupils first and then concessionary pupils. All pupils are supposed to have applied for transport by the end of April and all payments are supposed to be made towards the end of July. The first problem is that people do not necessarily all apply and pay fees on time. That is a challenge when it comes to organising routes. Getting past that, Bus Éireann, on behalf of the Department, must organise the routes, starting on the basis of the people who applied and implementing them on the basis of those who have paid. Once all the eligible people who have paid have filled the seats, the remaining seats are available for concessionary tickets. A large number of children are travelling under the school transport scheme using concessionary tickets. In the 2017-18 school year, they numbered just over 27,000. This year, there were approximately 3,000 applicants who applied for concessionary transport who did not receive it. Of those, just 1,129 applied on time but did not secure a seat, while 1,888 applied late and did not receive a seat.The figure is just around about 3,000. We are speculating on a scheme here. It is a matter for a Government to make policy but I do not mind taking this a little distance. If were to have a scheme where concessionary transport was available to everyone then, we would have a different number of applicants. Those applicants are on the basis of the scheme we have at the moment, not on the basis of a putative scheme that may provide transport for all concessionary users.  We were very conscious of this being an issue. Obviously on the establishment of the current Government, we had a review and published the outcomes. We are continuing further work on the nature of "concessionary" and whether there is a way we can seek to meet some of the need that has been identified, such as for a large group of concessionary users - not individuals - who seek to go a certain distance and who may already be eligible for school transport. We are exploring options in that regard and, yes, they would cost money. They probably would cost more than the figure to which the Deputy has referred because obviously one must organise transport. We are looking at that. One of the tensions we have in the scheme is that we have a scheme where costs are going up, especially on the special education side. We also have a tension, and it is an appropriate tension, to provide a social service to people who want to have it. That is a tension always. We want to make sure that we strike the right balance and that balance is obviously in the rules of the scheme and so on. Yes, we recognise it is a difficult issue. I am not sure it is as small as the Deputy set out and I am not sure it is even as small as I have set out. If we had in place an open choice to be transported to anywhere up to a certain distance limit, that could actually cost a huge amount of money. Obviously there may be room to develop the scheme slightly. We are looking at whether that is a possibility and that would obviously cost money if we were to do that.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	223	I understand there is waste and will give examples affecting my constituents. I have experienced this myself as I must drive through these areas. A 40-seater bus serves a small place called Paulstown and brings children to Kilkenny but seven children have been left off. I believe that it would not cost an awful lot of money to provide a 50-seater bus. I disagree with the changes that have been made to the qualifying criteria for concessionary transport. I know that the Department is not to blame for the changes because we, as politicians, are responsible for the changes. I come from a little place called Ballyhale which is in the southern part of County Kilkenny. In 1967, the three primary schools in the locality were amalgamated into one school. For 40 years there were no problems and everything worked beautifully but all of a sudden these changes were made. My grandchildren attend the school. Unfortunately, after a service being continuously provided for 40 years in the parish, due to the changes that were made here, parents of the children have been told that they should send their children to a different parish because that school is nearer. That is crazy stuff as everyone will agree who knows the loyalty that people have to their parishes, particularly in rural areas. While I am not talking about all rural areas, people tend to be very loyal to their parishes. There is religious loyalty because one receives the holy sacraments of baptism, first communion and confirmation in one's parish church. All of that has gone on for generations and the same applies to hurling, football, soccer of whatever sport one plays. Unfortunately, at the stroke of a pen we, as politicians, changed the criteria in 2010 or whenever. Therefore, after three generations have availed of school transport, parents have been told they must send their children to their nearest schools. I measured the distance that obliged one family in the parish, with three children, to travel. It was 0.25 km and the family was told the children had to attend a school located outside of the parish. We all know that one's loyalty is to one's parish. The family was told this because of the new criteria and, unfortunately, siblings will be separated as a result. The older siblings can attend one school but the next lot must attend school in another parish, which is nearer in terms of kilometres but not in any other way. That is a crazy situation so we must review the matter. I do not blame the Department for this situation. It is us, the politicians, who must review the scheme. I ask the Minister and my own party to review the matter and I hope it will be reviewed shortly. I ask the Secretary General to comment. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	224	I do not want to comment about individual situations but I will comment about the situation in principle. If we were to say to Bus Éireann you can run bigger buses where there are not enough eligible pupils for them, that is a policy change that costs money. It can be done but it is a policy change that costs money, and it would have to be applied across the country and in all areas. We have to have a consistent national policy. Yes, that could be done. Yes, it could cost a lot of money because Bus Éireann run buses of different sizes at different times. Yes, it can be done but, yes, it could cost a lot of money. In relation to the amalgamations, the policy view was taken arising from the value for money, VFM, review. There is a very good example in the VFM of a few Catholic schools that happen to be in the same Catholic parish, where parents were living closer to one school but only could get school transport to the school further away. To be honest, we cannot set a scheme in stone in relation to amalgamations which were made 50 years ago.

The other point is this is about school transport. Parents can choose to send their children to other schools, if they wish. I know there are challenges on parents to get students to different schools in respect of transport and so on. This is not requiring them to attend school. Parents can choose which school to attend, obviously subject to there being places in schools. This is about the availability of school transport to support that. I draw that distinction because I think it is an important distinction.  If we introduced and kept the level of choice to allow people to go to somebody under the former closed or close school rule, as well as the closest school, which was the policy dilemma, we would then have a myriad of choice, and a myriad of choice in transport costs a huge amount of money. It is a reasonable policy to say that the State will support a child to go to his or her nearest primary school. If a parent wishes to choose for a child to go to a different primary school, that is a reasonable choice for a parent to make but it is a choice that parents can make and arrange themselves.

I am not talking about parents who want to pick specialist schools for their children and want the State to pay for it. I am talking about parents sending their children to one primary school in a parish. The parents have no choice because there is only one primary school in the parish. After 40 years, the grandparents, parents and grandchildren, have all of a sudden been told that the option is closed. These people have a right to get the same service that they were promised in 1968 and enjoyed for 40 years. Unfortunately, politicians have changed the situation with the stroke of a pen. If people went to court and outlined that they always had access to the school then I think the Government would be bound by it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	228	Nobody is saying that they cannot attend school. It is the availability of a service.

In Kilkenny, there is another school of another faith that gets that privilege and students are being brought to the school. The situation has caused a lot of anxiety because one faith gets the service yet only students of that faith are transported to the school. That situation is wrong and it has caused a lot of problems in my area.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	234	The scheme at primary level allows for children to attend the nearest school of their choice, whether it is multidenominational, Catholic, Protestant or Irish-medium. It is a reasonable policy that the State would support the provision of children to their nearest school of whichever those types they wish to attend.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	235	I will move on to another matter. The Secretary General has stated that school transport cost €190 million in 2017. Was that value for money? I want to discuss the surplus. The Secretary General has said that there will be no surplus in 2019. There was one in 2015, according to the report compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General. To me, the term "surplus" sounds like a profit was made. It is a crying shame to have a surplus and a profit when a couple of hundred children have been omitted from the scheme. It is a pity that money could not be used to bring the children to school rather than have a surplus and profit. Does a surplus mean there was a profit? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	236	I will answer first, Deputy, and then Mr. Kent can reply, if that is okay.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	238	We have a transport management charge, which is part of the fees that we pay or the costs we pay to Bus Éireann but there is no profit. Everything is assigned. There was a reserve held, which was held by Bus Éireann and referred to in their accounts in latter years, which was assignable, on agreement by us, to certain costs. We made the call this year that we would not let the company retain that any more. That is no longer being retained and will not be retained by the end of 2018. There was no profit in the scheme. It is a scheme on the basis of cost recovery, in terms of expenditure.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	239	Bus Éireann is rolling out the scheme and it has subcontracted a lot of buses from private individuals.Is Bus Éireann making a profit running the scheme? It is being said that its coffers are a lot richer because of the roll-out of the bus scheme. I want to go a step further. It is a monopoly when there is only one service provider. Would we get better value for money if we opened it up to private contractors? Bus Éireann is subcontracting them for the routes. The routes are given out, many of which I know, around Kilkenny and Carlow and everywhere else. Would the Department not get better value if it went directly to the subcontractors, put the routes out to tender and saw who came in with the best price? Would that not save us money at a cost of €190 million? When one has a monopoly and no-one to compete against, it does not sound like good business. The service level agreement that is being talked about was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report up to 2015. I question it as well. If we even got a sample of putting it out to public auction to see who would come in at the best prices, we might get a better and cheaper service. I ask the Secretary General to comment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	240	I will take this first and then perhaps Mr. Kent can come in. The Department engages Bus Éireann to look at the applicants, their routes, and tendering. Bus Éireann has a transport infrastructure management expertise, which is why we work with it to do this. Within that, nearly 83% of what it does is on the basis of procuring out. Some 83% of the money we give it is procured out. Bus Éireann does that efficiently and it follows public procurement in doing that.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	241	How does the Department know this when it does not have anybody else doing this or competing for it? Could better value be got if it went out to a private contractor to provide the service, for example, for Kilkenny alone for 12 months? One could then let Bus Éireann and private contractors bid against it and one could see who came in with the best value.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	242	Bus Éireann is not bidding to provide transport in Kilkenny but is working out the routes and then procuring for the majority of services externally.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	244	It would take a national organiser to do it on that basis. There is no alternative national organiser that we see. The bulk of what Bus Éireann does is to outsource procurement, which is done to Government procurement standards. There is no question about the procurement by Bus Éireann of the services. I think it is very really helpful that the value for money question was confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We get updates and sign-offs on reports from Bus Éireann to confirm that this is the case. We are looking at other ways that we can confirm that this is the case. I am not saying that we just take it on its word forever but we have to look at it. I do not see an alternative national organiser to step in and organise all of those services and to procure and to work it out. We are, however, undertaking the audit of routes and when we look at that, which I referred to in my opening statement, we can then see if that informs any other policy choices. Of course, there are policy choices. At the moment our very strong policy option is to work with Bus Éireann as the route provider providing that it is outsourcing the vast majority of the service, as it does. The private sector is hugely involved in school transport.

Bus Éireann are running the system for the Department. Could the Department of Education and Skills not run the system directly and put it out to tender without Bus Éireann? It is a second layer of bureaucracy that could be avoided with better value for money. I am just a lay person asking these questions. I am a businessman and farmer as well, and when I am trying to get a price, I put it out to two or three people to see which is the best price. That is how I work my business and try to get value for money.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	246	I do not believe the Department should do the route work. There is a transport expertise that is unique to Bus Éireann. There is route design, ticketing, and a whole range of things with which we, as a Department, do not want to be involved. We have set up agencies to provide State examinations and to do the work of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. We set up one on education welfare that is now within Tusla under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I do not believe the Department itself should be undertaking that work. Given the extent to which Bus Éireann outsources in the first place, it is the company's transport management expertise that is vital and very important to us. On value for money, we have to ensure that we understand all of the costs and that we are on top of all of the costs, and its accountants are signing off on these, and we are checking as appropriate. That is part of the service level agreement that we have discussed, along with a number of other matters.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	248	There are two aspects to this. The Deputy asked about value for money and whether we are making a profit. First, 90% of the routes that we operate are put out to tender and procured in complete compliance with EU guidelines. Anybody who gets to operate them will have won them on a competitive basis. Second, 83% of all of the costs associated with the delivery of this scheme at the moment go back to the contractors. They come through the Department, they pass through us and they go out there. This company has been through a radical transformation, as the Deputy may be aware, even in the past couple of years, and it continues to take on board a lot of the findings that we have. We have a transport management charge that tries to recover the indirect costs. It has fallen almost every year. It has fallen from €11.2 million and is part of the transformation that we tried to do again last year. It will be of the order this year of €10.5 million of costs. That goes to cover all of the indirect costs that surround and go into the business. We try to deliver and utilise it to get as many double trips into the business as we can into every single route. That is an important point.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	253	That leads in certain instances to more capacity on the first bus and less on the second. From our experience, it is still better value and cheaper to the State to do that rather than contracting two separate vehicles and different contractors to do it. There is value delivered on that. We continue to try to utilise the capacity. Even though, as the Deputy states, there is concessionary use there, we try to ensure that where we take it in, that there is a contribution coming back into the value of the route. Those students are having to pay in to utilise it and that contributes to the value of it. What we are doing is that we never stop. We have a new management team here with a school transport officer just in place and what we are undertaking is a full structural review within our business as to who is delivering it. We have delivered a lot of the services directly ourselves with our own Bus Éireann fleet and drivers, supported by a lot of clerical administrative staff. We are now looking at the full needs of the scheme in conjunction with the Department. In particular, as we have recognised that as special education needs have grown, some of the assistance we must do in that regard has to grow. One does not see that cost coming up. If anything, one can see that everything we are charging through what is called the school transport management charge, which is almost a misnomer because it is a recovery of all the indirect costs of providing the service, is coming down year on year since 2008. To the Deputy's point, I can categorically state that we operate this on a cost-recovery basis. There is no profit in this for us at present. That is another matter for us, but that is within the scheme. Where there has been a surplus from one year to the next, it is identified, completely ring-fenced and brought to the Department-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	260	Yes, we have to return the surplus to the Department if there is any surplus in any one time. That is the way it operates. The Comptroller and Auditor General report identified a surplus and it has gone back. Sometimes, as I have said here, depending on where we are, that surplus has been used, if the Department agrees, where we have needed to invest in a technology system or in more customer service support systems. We bring that to the Department and it decides whether we are allowed to do it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	264	I can clarify the answer, if that is okay. That surplus has returned to the Department this year. It netted off this year for the first time. Previously it was held by Bus Éireann on an annual basis. It has been netted off and returned to us for the first time this year.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	265	Parents are tearing their hair out as they try to get their children to school. The surplus that is handed back should be utilised to look after parents who are in need of transport. In 2015, the level of spare capacity was 18%. Almost 20% of capacity was available in 2015. What was the situation in 2017? What is the situation in 2018? Given that we have the situation that we have, it is extraordinary that 20% of capacity is not being utilised. The 2015 figure I mentioned came from the Comptroller and Auditor General.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	266	I would like to explain what constitutes spare capacity. Mr. Kent and Mr. Ó Foghlú have touched on this. We try to ensure we get the maximum utilisation out of all vehicles. Approximately 95% of Bus Éireann vehicles operate more than one trip, morning and evening. The same can be said of more than 60% of contractors. Even though there may be spare capacity on one of the trips, the Department is still getting a more cost-effective network and better value for money. I assure the committee that where capacity exists on a particular route, it is fully utilised to meet the demand that exists for concessionary transport on that route. If there is demand for concessionary transport, any spare places are allocated on that basis. This year, we probably have the highest number of concessionary pupils travelling. The total number is approximately 28,400. We aim to try to utilise capacity as best we can. We also have to look at capacity in the context of the value for money it provides and the utilisation we get out of the individual vehicles. I would like to touch on one other point, which is that there will always be an element of spare capacity. If 35 eligible children present for travel, one has to procure a 50-seater vehicle. There will always be cases in which a certain element of spare capacity exists anyway. The key priority for us is to look at this issue in the context of the amount of utilisation we can get out of the vehicle and the cost that the State would incur if a separate vehicle had to be procured. The two issues of utilisation and cost-efficiency are looked at in tandem.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	267	Some parents in Kilkenny have conducted a survey on the matter of seat utilisation. The hoarding of seats is a big issue in rural Ireland, where I come from. I am talking about seats in respect of which tickets have been allocated. I have received answers on this from Bus Éireann on several occasions. Seats are being allocated but are not being used; they are being hoarded. The survey to which I refer was conducted for a month earlier this year on the bus that brings children from Paulstown to Kilkenny. It was found that on every day of the survey, 11 seats were available on the bus - going in and coming home - and seven children were left on the side of the road. The parents did this survey themselves. The 11 seats that were not being used were being hoarded, perhaps by parents who were bringing their children to school on their way to work. Perhaps they keep these seats for rainy days on which they cannot bring their children to school. Something should be done about such terrible practices. Seven children are being passed and left on the side of the road, even though there are 11 empty seats on the bus from Paulstown to Kilkenny. I am just giving an example. I do not mean to mention my own area all the time. It is a crying disgrace to see 11 seats being left empty as the bus goes in and out, while seven children are left on the side of the road. This survey was carried out over the course of a month. It found that on average, ten or 11 seats were empty every single day. Bus Éireann or the Department should wake up and do something about this. If a seat is not used over a period of two or three weeks, it should be taken off the person who is not using it. Some allowances can be made. Parents are keeping these seats to use them on a rainy day when they are not going into Kilkenny for a work day or something like that. I am not saying I know what the situation is. It is a disgrace that 11 seats were continuously available for a month without being used, while seven children were left on the side of the road. Something should be done about it.

The officials from the Department are present to discuss their oversight of the scheme. It is a great scheme.

I realise that things have moved on since then. I suggest we should look at the conclusions in the report. Even though this is ostensibly a cost-based service, the report identifies serious flaws in the recovery of costs, particularly the management charge, which I will come to. Oversight reporting requirements were weak, there was no service level agreement, and forecasting was poor. The report makes three recommendations, within which there are a number of elements. What do the officials from the Department have to say about the serious flaws in the recovery of costs? I understand what Bus Éireann has said. The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding that the management charge was fixed at 13% of the direct costs, regardless. It was capped at that level. There was a surplus arising from that year after year. The figure for "accumulated service" was €11.2 million when the report was compiled, but it had decreased to €6 million last year. I might be wrong, but I think it was recommended that this should be eliminated on the basis that there was no adequate explanation from the Department of how it was fixed and so on. Mr. McCarthy might correct me if I am wrong when I say the recommendation was to get rid of it. I understand it is gone now. Where has it gone to? How did it happen? If it was correctly done on a cost recovery basis, how was this charge allowed? Where has it gone to? I understand it has gone this year as a result of the special report. Is that right? It did not go on foot of any action from the Department.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	297	I will start by responding to the question the Deputy asked about Bus Éireann and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Some members of the committee will recall a session we had about school transport four or five years ago.Arising from that session, we indicated that we would welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General going into Bus Éireann to determine whether that was desirable. That was the genesis of the report. We decided to have a very good look at value for money in school transport in the final part of the past decade. We concluded that we needed some rule changes on efficient routes, which were adopted by Government.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	301	I am going to come to that now. We also focused on the fixed charge. We carried out a detailed report on the fixed charge at that time as well. We concluded that the best way to reduce the fixed charge was to cap it. Previously we had a cheap seat for every child, which meant that we did not have spare capacity. When we moved away from that, the extent of the charge meant that reserves were building up, from which Bus Éireann was occasionally able to purchase buses with our agreement. The company purchased computer equipment, dealt with other matters, improved their mapping of routes and so on.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	302	I am not questioning how it was used. I accept that it was probably used for the good of the service. It is now gone. It has been highlighted that this surplus was not reported in the Department's statements. I refer to the paper record and the justification for it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	303	It arose from the arrangement we had. We looked at the value for money represented by having a seat for every child because the reserve was building up. We agreed an allocation from it, and we worked on the basis of allowing Bus Éireann to keep it from year to year. We had discussions internally and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In parallel with the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, we decided that we did not wish Bus Éireann to retain it from year to year and that we would fund any costs on an agreed basis in a year. That is the basis on which we are proceeding. It was public knowledge. We had talked about it openly at this committee. We recorded it in our accounts in 2017. It is in Bus Éireann's accounts as well.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	305	No. I refer to keeping a surplus on it.

It is a combination of those things that are-----

I read one review from 2016 that refers to 11 reports since 1977. We have more reports. It has been subject to significant analysis. I wish to raise the Department's supervision and the lack of a service level agreement. The opening statement said that there is a service level agreement and it is now under review. When did that agreement come into play?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	309	The service level agreement came into place for the previous school year. It was for 2017-18. We have extended and changed it for 2018-19. We want to improve it further.

An essential service covering so many pupils had no service level agreement. My time is limited, but I note that the Comptroller and Auditor General has itemised the lack of oversight in his report. He specifies what should be there. Why did that not happen sooner?

The concessionary students pay a fee depending on whether it is primary or secondary. The Department has spare capacity. Apparently that has increased significantly, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Perhaps I am wrong and that has changed since his report.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	321	The report says that the proportion of the capacity used by eligible students has declined.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	330	In 2007, the estimated residual capacity was 24%. It has increased to 35%, taking the concessionary pupils into account.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	331	Our latest view suggests that it is riding at approximately 33% at the moment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	333	Of course we try to fill all the buses, but it is demand-led. When we procure services, there are sometimes different vehicle types. Whether it is a 44-seat or a 52-seat bus can sometimes depend on the locality being served. Part and parcel of that is that where there has been demand, particularly for concessionary seats, we will try to make sure that every seat is occupied. We also try to take into account the mixed nature of bus types we use. There is a combination of singles, 14-seaters, mid-size vehicles and bigger buses.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	334	I saw that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	335	We try to deploy them as efficiently as we can every year. The issue that continues to confront us is that the closing date for this is around 27 July. We are also trying to get everything else in place for the beginning of the school year in September, five to six weeks later. Until we know exactly where the demand will emerge every year, we almost have to evaluate it on a year-to-year basis. To cater for that, particularly in the case of any mix or change in demand, we retender the contract. As I said, 20% of all of the service is retendered to make sure we are getting efficiency and value. Second, all of the routes continue to be reviewed. At this point we have made it clear that if there is any audit requirement, or if any way can be found to improve efficiency and utilisation, we will work with anybody who wants to review that with us. We will be completely open and co-operative on that.

I am thinking of climate change and the necessity of buses on roads and the reduction of car usage. I have not seen that mentioned anywhere in any of the documents. Climate change has to be one of the criteria taken into account in any value for money analysis .
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	339	If I may clarify, the point I was making earlier about spare capacity and utilisation is linked. We try to get the maximum utilisation out of a vehicle. We may require a 50-seat vehicle to operate a post-primary trip with 44 children. That bus can do a primary run which may have only 25 children on it. We will try to utilise that vehicle because it is more cost-effective.Unfortunately, it has an adverse effect on spare capacity numbers but it affords a greater level of efficiency and is far more cost-effective from a value-for-money and a departmental perspective. When one looks at the figures in isolation, it is the multiple runs where the level of spare capacity is higher. Where one vehicle is doing a single run, the levels of spare capacity are much lower.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	340	I understand that and the nuances involved. There has to be some new and imaginative way of looking at this and I understand the Department is open to that. On climate change, we want more people to travel by bus. That is essential. On the other hand, there are practicalities involved. I refer to the situation in Galway, about which I want to make a general point. Children go to school, and they have tickets. If they go home at 4 p.m. or thereafter, they miss all of the after-school activities. A letter was written to us in respect of this matter and we were asked if the children could use their tickets on regular buses. In this case, it is Carraroe, ag gabháil siar do dtí Ceantar na nOileán. Those children have a choice of missing after-school activities and going home on the school bus or, with the permission of Bus Éireann, using their tickets on regular buses which are passing back towards Carraroe in any event. However, they cannot do the latter. Am I making my point clearly enough?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	341	Yes. Unfortunately, it would not only be our consent that would be required because one is talking about the scheduled services that are operated under the supervision of the National Transport Authority, which determines the fares and sets the fare strategy in respect of those services. We collect the revenue in the context of how those fares are set. In an ideal world, if we had integrated tickets, we all agree they might work on those services. An integrated ticket would recognise revenue on a particular trip and then revenue on another trip. Perhaps that is something we can aspire to but at the moment it is not possible.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	342	We are beyond aspiring to it. We have major changes to make in the context of climate change. We are talking here about one child but the circumstances involved are reflective of those of quite a number of people. The person who wrote that letter stated that there are over 20 students involved. Are we going to obliged 20 people to drive their children home in cars or jeeps simply because we are waiting for an ideal time when there will be integrated tickets in place?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	343	I referred to the balance between social policy and cost but that is also an example of where we would be creating 20 empty seats a couple of days a week on a bus. Children may choose not to take the school bus; they may take a public bus and pay for it later. The issue is that there is a public service. Whether there is space on it, I do not know. The issue is that whether the State should pay for the two seats. The first seat on the school service and the second seat on the public bus, or is it possible to rotate seats so that, potentially, somebody else could use the school bus seat. That is very difficult to manage on a day-to-day basis.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	349	It is not disingenuous if the Deputy is stating that the alternative is for people to get in cars and drive them when there is a public service available. The way the Deputy has described it, there is a public service on that route. The issue is whether the State pays for them to get on to that bus.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	351	We are looking at three counties. We have done an initial digitalisation with Bus Éireann and we have engaged a company to examine that. The company in question will look at the routes, at the issue we have been discussing and at whether the double tendering for the double route has been effective. All of those issues will be examined. It is an external challenge to Bus Éireann's expertise in the context of its transport management. This will be the first time we have done it. We are going to trial it first in three counties and, depending on the outcome, we are considering taking it further.

We have no choice. I have mentioned 11 reviews since 1977; that is to ignore some of the other reviews. At some point, when we talk about social responsibility in respect of this service, climate change has to be factored into any of these reviews, particularly in the context of capacity. It has to be a feature. I do not hear that from Mr. Ó Foghlú.

It is stated on page 27 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that €11.2 million was the accumulated closing balance surplus for 2015. What is it currently?

The surplus has decreased. Do we know how that occurred? Is it possible to obtain some indication in that regard?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	386	Essentially, the €6.7 million was a balance due back to the Department and held by Bus Éireann.

Every year there is a surplus. In 2011, the surplus was €8.1 million. I presume that was held in a bank account somewhere. Where is the surplus held?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	388	My understanding of it is that it would be part of the cashflow in CIÉ as opposed to being a separate fund.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	389	Our understanding is that it was identified separately and held by CIÉ. That is the assurance we got from CIÉ and Bus Éireann.

If I am holding it somewhere, surely interest is accruing on it. Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can help me with this point. The figure increases every year, but are we being told that it does not include interest that has accrued year on year?

If the organisation holding the funds was using them, an interest element should accrue. However, it is the responsibility of the Department to ensure that, if its funds are held, it gets an interest element.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	399	One would have to find a basis for agreeing what the interest rate would be in that situation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	404	No. There would have been a very low interest rate, if that.

Regarding running costs, page 54 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report contains a copy of the 1975 agreement. I am seeking clarification ahead of some of my questions. The report provides a breakdown of the running costs - maintenance, servicing, accident repairs, periodic overhauls, lubricants, tyres, fuel, etc. - as well as tax paid on the buses. Do these costs just relate to vehicles that are being used full time?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	406	All of the direct costs that are outlined basically relate to the provision of the service directly either through Bus Éireann vehicles or contractors.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	407	In the case of a contractor, I presume that it is not the only use of his or her vehicle.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	408	That is correct.

Is it correct to assume the taxes paid on that vehicle form part of the contract? We pay for the vehicle's tyres and servicing, but the contractor can use it for more than school transport.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	410	No.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	411	The private contractor just provides the vehicle in full. The costs outlined are for the Bus Éireann provision directly.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	413	The Bus Éireann fleet. Exactly.

In its investigation, the European Commission found that this scheme was not compatible with state aid rules. We disagreed. To be honest, I support that disagreement because there is a social element to this service. The Department has been engaging with the Commission since 2014 on future implementation measures. Will Mr. Ó Foghlú update us on those engagements?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	415	There are two different EU cases, but they are linked. From our Department's point of view, we have updated the Commission regarding the organisation of Bus Éireann and indicated that it is our agreed intention to ensure at a stage in the future that the school transport element of Bus Éireann is clearly identifiable within that company. We are moving towards that, but there are further changes to ensure that it takes place. A benchmarking exercise is being undertaken and a methodology is being developed by Bus Éireann as regards the relative costs of its direct provision and its private contractor provision, a matter that the Deputy touched on in his previous question.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	419	We keep the Commission updated on developments and it comes to a conclusion. With these EU cases, I am not aware of a definitive timetable.

Paragraph 3.10 on page 27 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report reads, "Bus Éireann applied a total of €11.3 million in round sums to a category described as 'property charge'." What is that property charge? The report continues:Furthermore, non-recurrent charges applied by Bus Éireann against the unused surplus and accepted by the Department since 2011 were  - €3 million for 'future pensions for school bus drivers' [that is explanatory enough] - €3.4 million as a 'contribution to capital investment'.I presume the €3.4 million relates to the purchasing of new vehicles, or does it-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	421	That relates to operational systems for the planning and scheduling of services.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	423	It was €2.6 million, with some other technological pieces on top.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	425	Absolutely.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	426	That is part of the breakdown that we have committed to already.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	428	Basically, it is all of the properties within which the schools' staff or vehicles are sitting. In using those buildings, there is an opportunity cost of rent forgone. It is calculated at an agreed rate.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	430	There are three businesses in the Bus Éireann structure - PSO services, Expressway services and school services - and a wide range of properties across Ireland. Based on the amount of space used by schools at each property, be it in the yard, maintenance section or office, a split was done and a charge was arrived at with a view to what Bus Éireann or CIÉ would have got were those properties rented on the open market.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	431	I will give an example. If I am wrong, Mr. Delaney should tell me. I am just trying to understand.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	432	Sure.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	433	If there is a bus depot and two buses are using part of it, are we saying that a property charge is applied to the Department on the basis that, if they were not school buses and Bus Éireann was renting that space out on the open market, it could get more?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	434	I will take that example. If there are two school buses and two non-school buses and they occupy equal space in the yard, 50% of that space would be charged to the Department of Education and Skills at a rate.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	435	Okay.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	436	The same would apply in an office. It would be based on the square footage that people, some of whom are with the schools, occupied.We have three different businesses within Bus Éireann. We look at the space occupied by the people who are working on the schools-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	438	It was €1.3 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	440	Yes.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	441	It decreased by 50%, more or less. How is that decrease explained? I presume the fleet has not decreased by 50%.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	442	It has decreased quite a lot. I would have to get the exact figures but I think we had about 650 buses in the past and now we have just over 400. It has certainly decreased by a good chunk.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	443	We have a value for money policy of reducing the Bus Éireann fleet. It has been reduced. The portion outsourced to contractors through procurement has increased significantly. It is a matter for dialogue with Bus Éireann about what the right level will be. As the Deputy noted, on a number of occasions, we have supported the purchase of buses by Bus Éireann.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	445	What drew our attention to the figure was it was a round figure. It is a notional figure. It has some bearing in reality. Buses have to be parked somewhere. There has to be security and so on. When we asked for an explanation about why it was precisely €2.5 million, we did not get a detailed explanation for it. It goes back to the work that has been done over the years looking at how we arrive at these figures and how we know we are recovering the costs incurred. There is an element of guesstimation or apportionment going on there. All of that has to be-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	447	We did not get a breakdown of the €2.5 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	449	It did not appear to be available.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	451	On that point, there was an exchange between us and the Department. One of the notes we provided to the Department is on our estimation that we had allocated approximately 84,000 sq. m to offices and depots when we were asked to do that. It is something that would be picked up as part of an annual review of how much is being utilised depending on how many staff are in different locations. We have clerical staff in place in 16 locations in Ireland. We operate 11 depots throughout Ireland. We try to continually review the number in the fleet and how many people are in different places to determine if it is reasonable. It is probably a reasonable number as opposed to something that is scientifically apportioned. That is how we got to it. It is a reasonable number that was developed in conjunction with the Department.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	457	To be fair, I meant an interrogation of the figures. I was not at all implying the Deputy was interrogating. We have had a further independent report on the management charge. This is an example of part of the issue.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	459	We had an RSM report which was completed in March 2018. It was a follow-up to the FGS report and it has identified this issue.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	461	The FGS report highlighted the level of the management charge and we prioritised reducing the management charge. We have succeeded in doing that with the agreement of Bus Éireann.

I may have missed some stuff so if the Chairman tells me any of my questions have been dealt with I will move on and consult the record. Is any of the transport outsourced or does Bus Éireann do it all?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	464	Of its income, 83% is outsourced to contractors.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	466	Yes. The tendering, safety checks and inspections are all costs on the State as a result of it being provided. If it was provided by Bus Éireann directly, there would still be safety and inspection costs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	472	We want to have as much of the school transport provision tendered for by Bus Éireann with a reserve within Bus Éireann and we feel the best value for money comes from Bus Éireann procuring externally. It would be a different matter if Bus Éireann was to provide all the provision itself. It would be an arrangement of a different nature. It is not the arrangement we seek to have.

A value for money examination has been undertaken of the service on the basis of the way it is currently organised.

#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	487	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	488	What we look at is the requirements of the scheme and Bus Éireann operates primarily large vehicles. There is a requirement as a result of evolving needs in various locations to have a mix available of smaller vehicles either because of suitability of the roads or the level of demand.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	489	There might be nothing to stop us doing that if we chose to do it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	490	What it offers at the moment is the flexibility to procure vehicles of different sizes in the market.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	491	That leads to the next question. It is something we should look at because if one is dealing with one operator, there is only one set of management and vehicles to deal with and one maintenance and health and safety strategy and so on. It is an alternative to tendering each time and going in to see if Marc MacSharry, the bus operator in Sligo, has everything he needs from a safety and organisational perspective. While there would certainly be initial capital cost in making sure the fleet was appropriate to the demand, it would be worthy of examination. Is it safe to say the scheme is designed totally based on demand? We will see what is looked for next year and then we will put a series of tenders together that will deliver for those children.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	492	No. It is based on incremental change. Obviously the scheme is based on demand but the amount of change year to year is still minimal. Bus Éireann has a policy of tendering for routes at least once every five years.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	493	I was thinking about where we have capacity issues in larger cities. We have a housing crisis. It is replicated in urban centres around the country. Mr. Ó Foghlú will know from parliamentary questions and representations we make to him about the smaller schools that are under pressure, where every year there is a child whose brother has a place on the school bus who cannot get one because there is a new way of measuring the route to the school which means it is not the closest school or whatever.Bearing in mind the difficulties we have in many urban centres and in Dublin, and while there are always pressures to build new schools - I am aware of two new schools in Harold's Cross - has there been any cross-departmental analysis of the introduction of a more proactive transport scheme to try to encourage the repopulation of rural schools? Using transport as a tool might be of assistance in terms of housing and pressures in many of the urban centres. For example, school X with its facilities and infrastructure in a rural area could be built up to a viable number of students, which, in turn, would take pressure off the urban difficulties we are having in abundance throughout the country. Has any such analysis been conducted? Is there an aversion to examining something like that? I am guessing there has been no such analysis due to all of the other pressures on the Departments
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	494	We have based the policy on providing eligible children in general with transport to their nearest school subject to distance criteria rather than population moves or in trying to bring people out of their-----

A number of rural schools throughout the State are under pressure and from a political perspective any councillor, Deputy or Senator would be able to verify that this is the case. We have pressures in respect of many other issues, not least school places, housing and so on. Could using school transport in that way be worth looking at? I ask respectfully that in the cross-departmental forum and the Secretary General's-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	496	I will make two comments in response. First, I can recall a case of a second level school in the west where the patron had decided to close the school. The Department did an analysis, having regard to school transport costs. Notwithstanding that the school had 250 pupils, we calculated that it was more cost efficient and of more benefit to the local community to leave a second level school in the town. There was a Catholic patron at second level and it transferred the patronage to the local VEC, as it was at the time. Work like that can be done. At a very high level, we have Project Ireland 2040 and we have economic targets to develop populations in the regions in scale. I am on the project 2040 delivery board and a lot of work is being done to bring together perspectives from the different Departments to enable economic growth, including houses and jobs. Obviously, educational infrastructure will link to that in the regions. At a high level, there is a serious policy to seek to have diversity of economic growth and capital investment from the State to support that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	498	Yes, that is being looked at. I have set out that it is the policy of the Government. We will consider the suggestion the Deputy has made. It can be looked at.

I wonder about the wisdom of these policies where on the other side of the policy house we have serious difficulties - and will have into the future - because of urban pressures. The issue of the closest school criteria has jarred with me, and I raise the particular query due to an education grant aid query I had. With regard to the distance from one's house to the school or the university is Google Earth or Google Maps now the standard that the State or the Department embraces as the benchmark?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	500	I will ask Bus Éireann to explain how it does the measurements for that.

I have come across instances when Google Maps has not been accurate. In the case of one particular grant scheme for a person - the details of which I will not go into - I toed and froed and was told that "Oh no, Google Maps says it so it is true." God, I would hate us to be using Google as a benchmark.

I do not need Google Maps. What is OSI doing if we are not using it as our benchmark? God knows one can Google anything and get any answer one wants. I suggest that it is poor practice to depend on Google Maps as the benchmark of the distance from A to B as a reason to refuse somebody a grant, when the practical reality is different on the ground. I do not believe that a supervisor is getting into a car and driving from Sean Fleming's door to Marc MacSharry's door and saying, "That is the distance"

We deal with that through a range of agencies. The services to the islands are probably more specialised and have a very particular community sense to them. Therefore, it is the Department that leads around those areas that is responsible. The decision has been that its understanding and expertise around community issues and decisions is probably the more significant issue that determines how it has been decided to make that allocation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	567	That is correct

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	569	It is a very different type of organisation from most of the organisations that we audit. There is probably a policy angle to it as well in that there are other service companies, including the ESB, Bord Gáis and so on, that we do not audit. They have a customer charging regime, as is the case with CIÉ. I am not looking for extra work.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	570	I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not looking for extra work. Indeed, he has enough to do already but I ask the question in the context of his office being able to provide this committee with the picture that it needs. In the context of the commercial mandate of Bus Éireann and so forth, is the Comptroller and Auditor General in a position to give us the picture that we want, given that one part of the equation is subject to audit but a very significant part of it is not?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	571	I would obviously try to give the committee the assurance it needs around the expenditure by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. To the extent that it is making payments, my focus would be on ensuring that it has systems in place that allow it to give the assurance. To a certain extent, that is what we are doing with the school transport special report.

I am not fully up to date with international accounting standards but are there any implications of which we should be aware? Do the accounting arrangements need to be updated? Are there systems that have moved on since then? Are we behind the curve with anything?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	575	In terms of a good understanding of the cost base for the provision of the service, the 1975 agreement is out of date. There are certain aspects of it for which we never got an explanation, including, for instance, why a 13% add-on for management costs was ever appropriate. Part of the recommendation there was that there needs to be a better understanding of what makes up that charge, why it should be what it is and so on. Work has been done over the past number of years to try to get a better fix on the costs. We noted that the assurance that was being given on the account that is produced under the 1975 agreement was an assurance that the account was produced in the manner required under that agreement. It was not an assurance that this is an account of the cost of the service, which is what the Department is moving towards.

Equally, we are conducting a review of routes in three counties and we will explore the possibility of updating the accounting relationship too, as part of our work.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	586	Yes, as far as we know.

Garda vetting is required. To return to an earlier point, the Department leaves it until very late in the year to close the scheme to applications. I know that is done to give people as much time to apply as possible but it causes terrible problems in a short six to eight week period. Why does the Department leave it so late? Why does it not move the closing date back by a month, to June?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	592	The closing date is April for applications and July for payments. To be honest, the real difficulty we have is that the closing dates are not really observed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	598	Yes. This is not like the Central Applications Office, CAO, system. We need to move it to be understood to be like that but only in the case of general applications because the needs of children with special education needs are different and can arise at short notice. One of the things we are looking at is how the system can be more harsh in regard to such applications. More generally, we are regulating more around applications for entrance to schools and so on.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	605	Previously there was a cascading of older vehicles but that is not under way any more.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	606	We used to take the buses that were bought traditionally through CIE and more latterly by the NTA.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	608	It is a case of putting back into service vehicles not suitable for general use. In more recent years, as the NTA replenishes fleet on the PSO side, typically it is purchasing double-deck vehicles or a different type of vehicle that may not be suitable for rural roads. For example, the Expressway vehicles are 64 seaters and, again, would be appropriate for this type of work.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	612	We have approximately 420 buses that we service directly with our own drivers.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	614	Yes. There are older vehicles but they are Bus Éireann designated vehicles.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	616	A lot of the PSO buses are fitted out in a particular way. The NTA vehicles are fitted with a particular ticket machine and there are regulations in place in regard to those buses in terms of fit-out, wheelchair access and so on, which would still be useful on that fleet but mostly it is about the ticketing and the vehicle type.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	617	The ticketing issue does not arise in regard to the school bus.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	618	No, not in the school bus. We have utilised some school buses for special events and so on but we cannot deploy them for regular PSO work because the PSO work under the contract specifies that a vehicle must be of particular age and a particular ticket type, ticket machine, etc. For example, it must be able to recognise a Leap card.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	619	As I see it, the State, through the Department, has invested in 400 buses that can only be used for 33 weeks of the year. That makes no business sense to either the Department, Bus Éireann or the taxpayer. Does Mr. Kent understand my point? For example, Bus Éireann could not afford to keep other buses locked up for 20 weeks of the year. It makes no sense. What percentage of buses is provided by the private sector?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	620	It is 90%.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	623	It will be a decision for the Department. Previously, we provided 10% by direct provision.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	625	It would have to consult the Department on the matter.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	627	There are a couple of issues arising. The policy is that no school bus owned by Bus Éireann can be more than 20 years old. If we use them more, we might have to bring the timeframe down.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	628	Would that not be a good idea in safety terms?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	629	We would then have to purchase buses more often because they would be no longer cascading in. We are in policy discussions with Bus Éireann around the issue.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	630	We have already been told the cost per annum in passenger terms of operating the 400 buses. What is the cost to Bus Éireann versus the cost to the contractors? Which is the cheapest? For example, the Comptroller and Auditor General said that the cost in 2015 was on average €1,800 per head. What is the amount for the most recent year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	631	It is probably in the realm of a 15% to 20% differential depending on how one calculates the costs and what one is benchmarking the price to. When making the comparison one should be comparing similar type maintenance, similar kilometres, etc. In terms of the direct provision, as will have been noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it has always been at a slight premium in terms of what we pay relative to the market. To a large extent, it is the cost of using our own staff, our own vehicles and our own facilities.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	633	We did some work on this in the value for money review and we have a contested comparison between private and public.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	639	It was 2010. I referred to work we are doing with the Commission.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	641	The European Commission. I referred to it earlier. Bus Éireann is working on a methodology to undertake a comparison. The comparisons referenced by the chief executive are entirely valid but the issue is how one takes account of all of the other Bus Éireann costs in working out the comparison of costs.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	642	I presume the Department's objective is to maintain the contract with Bus Éireann and allow it to subcontract.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	643	That is the current policy.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	644	It goes without saying that the Department is working to that objective. There is no point beating around the bush on that. It is the policy most people would expect. Nobody would want to see an English or Portuguese company getting the contract for school buses in Connemara.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	645	As stated, transport organisation is a key part of it.

Are there regional cost differences in regard to route servicing in, for example, Meath versus Kerry? I do not want to hear that everywhere is different. I am asking about comparable routes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	647	The key is that routes are put out to public procurement such that it is market conditions that determine costs by county.

I am asking about the outcome of the process. Bus Éireann must know on average the cost of similar routes across the country.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	649	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	651	We see it in particular around taxi provision.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	652	I want to deal with the buses for now. Where are the regional differences? Do the witnesses have that information? As the Committee of Public Accounts, we are trying to find out if we are getting value for money. There are lots of activities in Irish life in respect of which we know the cost, including the cost of surfacing a kilometre of road in one county versus another county, which is subject to tender but there can be crazy variations. Is Bus Éireann experiencing similar variations? Are there parts of the country where there is not a lot of competition and in which it suits operators not to have too much competition?Other operators can enter the market. Where is the most expensive and least efficient area?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	653	It is partly demand led. In the past year, it has sometimes been difficult to procure vehicles and provide contractors in certain parts of the country. That is part of the reason for the discussion on whether direct provision is needed. Even though we might go to tender, post to tender and invite participants, if we do not get the response we need, we must figure out how to meet the needs of the scheme.

How often does that happen on the thousands of routes?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	655	A combination of issues would arise. If it is possible for us to use our own bus, we will do so, but there are situations where if we do not get additional tenders, we may have to put a route out through direct award. That would all be done-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	657	It may go to the existing contractor if, after a route goes out to procurement, there are no other compliant tenders. It would operate under a derogation on that basis. There are such situations, although I do not have the exact details of the number of routes that we tendered for and where there may not have been a compliant tender. We can arrange to submit that information through the Department.

However, when I asked about the size of the gap, they told me that they did not have that information. Do the witnesses follow me?

Historically, Bus Éireann probably knows where there will be strong competition and where it will be lucky to get a contractor. In the latter situation, does the contractor effectively name his or her price?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	663	No.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	667	What we call a BAFO process, which is the best and final offer. Where a price would be perceived to be high, we would always revert to the contractor to discuss the details of the offer and seek a further pricing schedule from him or her. This is all part of our compliance with procurement guidelines and is what happens every year on the 20% of routes that are tendered.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	671	It is EU procurement law and it should be fair and equitable.

I am not asking our witnesses to name the regions, but does that happen? It must happen where there is strong competition.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	675	It is very much determined by the local market conditions.

We know what the price is based on, but I have moved beyond that point. Having got its price via the proper procedure, are there regions that consistently have higher prices than other regions with similar routes? I will not ask the witnesses to name them, as they will claim that they might be giving a competitive advantage or disadvantage to either side, but what are the variations in the cost per mile per student? I presume Bus Éireann has that figure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	679	We have the average cost by vehicle type by county. It varies, but I will not mention-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	681	What we have said is that it varies and is subject to the prevailing market conditions.

I just want to know the outcome, that being, the figure. Can Bus Éireann send us information on the variations without identifying the regions? After asking my questions, I still have no sense of the variations in the average price that market conditions dictate in different regions. Some places must be below the average price while others must be above it. If the witnesses do not know that information, they should not be here. They do know it. I am just trying to extract it from them without breaching commercial sensitivities so that we can have an indication of whether there is value for money. That is all.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	683	This relates to issues like capacity utilisation, the design of routes, the mix of the fleet and so on.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	685	That is fair enough. One would expect variability in any market. We are hesitant because we do not want to prejudice this.

Just give us the range in variations. It could all be in the same county for all I know. I am not asking the witnesses to breach any commercial sensitivity, but we cannot have a notion of whether there is value for money if we cannot even get comparative percentages.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	687	It should be said that it is not all purely about cost, even though that is a significant part of it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	689	It is also about quality, compliance, safety and standards. Those are all of the elements that we take into consideration.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	697	There were two questions back to back. How early does the child have to be at the bus stop?
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	698	We are all showing our age. Deputy Aylward mentioned his time on school buses. When I was on a school bus, I had to be dropped off at school at 8.15 a.m. because the same bus had to do another run.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	699	We have guidelines in that regard. There is a travelling and waiting time maximum of an hour and a half.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	701	Yes.

It has guidelines. In the interests of safety, a child cannot be on a bus for an hour and a quarter in the morning and the same in the evening. Maybe it does happen.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	703	If the child is travelling a long distance.

The average cost per pupil was approximately €1,800. What is the average cost for children with special educational needs? It must be a multiple of the other figure, given that there must be escorts, drivers, specific routes from door to school and so on. What is that average?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	705	Between €7,000 and €9,000 depending on the escort.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	706	I see that. Page 12 of the briefing note supplied to us mentions "STG". What does that mean?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	707	Special transport grant.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	708	In 2017, that amounted to €2.754 million, escorts cost €25.371 million and the special educational needs contractors cost €63.668 million. That comes to more than €90 million for the 12,000 students, which is well over €7,000. All of those children with special needs must get to school, but where does the Department draw the line between offering the grant to the parents to provide their own transport and providing transport itself? If it costs €8,000 per year on average to operate this system, where does the Department decide the cut-off point is? What grant does it award? It is based on distance. What are the minimum and maximum grants?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	709	I am not sure what the minimum and maximum are, but I can get the Chairman that information. We have a process for allocating transport for children with special needs on a case-by-case basis.The application will come to us, signed off by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. We will then contact Bus Éireann to see if a route is currently available. There could be a special needs school transport vehicle going by the house, in which case we will just put the child on it, possibly at no additional cost or a small additional cost. If we calculate that the grant would be cheaper than amending a route then we will offer the parents a grant, but often they cannot take it because both are working, so it is not all about economics and it is addressed on each child case by case.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	711	It is in or around €3,000 but I do not know the exact figure.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	712	When I looked at the figure of €8,000 I was surprised to hear the individual grant is less than half of that. It has led to the situation where even when long distances are involved some parents feel the grant is not sufficient. If it is in the region of €3,000 but the Department is paying €8,000 for somebody to go with a contractor on a bus, I can understand the reason some parents would be reluctant to take it up if it is in the region of €3,000. I have met parents who said it would not keep a car on the road not to mind paying the petrol.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	713	The current rate of grant is 39 cent per kilometre for the first 6,437 km.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	715	Yes, I will send you a figure, Chairman. You are right that the grant does work out cheaper, certainly when one considers providing a single vehicle. The grant would be a lot lower than the cost of providing a vehicle.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	716	Do many parents get offered a grant but do not take it up?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	717	More and more, we are seeing parents not taking the grant because both parents are working.

One has to drop a child to school, come home and then go back a few hours later. Four journeys are involved.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	719	There is such a variance. A lot of parents like dropping their child to school.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	728	It is 10%.

It is a fantastic service. I am aware of it from a person in my family. The Department is rolling out a great service. We must have been hardier in my day because I used to be on a bus for an hour and a half to two and a half hours. We were hardier in the 1970s than nowadays. I did not know there were restrictions on time. At the same time, we were damn glad to get the bus. In a case where the bus is full and there are no tickets available if anyone is even an hour late in paying, he or she is finished for the year. I was involved in several cases where families forgot to pay over a weekend, or in one case it was only an hour late, and they were excluded for the year because they did not pay on time. There was no appeal system. Those who were late were just ruled out for the whole year until the following year. Most of them learned from that and they paid the following year. Parents are frustrated by the notification system. They might be told on a Friday evening that even though the school is open on Monday no bus would be available. That is frustrating for parents and people in general. Working parents must make alternative arrangements. An early warning system should be in place to warn parents, for example, a month in advance, that children on concessionary tickets will not get a place on the bus. Something must be done about that. In effect, there is no appeals system. I have been through it on several occasions. An inspector comes out and makes a decision and that is the end of the story. He might come out a second time if one contacts him. The inspector covering my area is based in Waterford. However, there is never a change. Whatever decision is made is upheld and there is no come-back on it. In one case there was a third of a kilometre involved between two schools in adjacent parishes. I did the journey myself in the car based on where the children were let off the bus in the evening and the distances were equal. Even though I went to the inspector there was no give whatsoever. Three generations of a family had been to the school concerned. The family was told to go into a new parish for the sake of a third of a kilometre even though where the children were being dropped off meant it was the same distance between both schools but no one would listen. That was the end of the story. The provision of a place on a school bus was ruled out. Another case concerning health and safety has been going on for years. The Garda was contacted by parents as the bus was turning at a dangerous junction. We appealed it on several occasions. The inspector came out two or three times and said the bus would continue to turn at that point. I thought it was very cruel that they did not take the safety aspect of where they were turning into consideration. People were trying to drop children off on a bad bend in the road, and they were waiting for them with no place to park but they got no hop on that one. I do not think the appeals system is working. A better system should be in place for parents and politicians. I have called on the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to amend the rules governing the school transport scheme which state that, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis, to ensure who apply for a concessionary ticket can be accommodated. I put the same question to the Department and Bus Éireann. From an operational point of view, would Bus Éireann be open to amending the rule and would there be a significant additional cost associated with amending the rule?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	736	The answer to that is that of course the rules can be changed but there are costs associated with it. In that instance someone would already have tendered and received a tender to provide a smaller bus.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	738	I would prefer not to because it is a policy decision.

It is up to us here in Dáil Eireann to change the rules. I am asking the witnesses because I have asked the Minister. I have even asked my party to make it part of the confidence and supply arrangement. I am looking for a solution for the small number of students who are excluded. I know it is unfair to ask the witnesses as they are only implementing the laws we make. I understand that. I have been told that every year. However, when I have the opportunity I ask the witnesses as well for their point of view.

If there is a compensation claim against a Bus Éireann driver or bus, is the cost covered by the Department?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	744	We have provisions for claims in our accounts, which are charged in the direct costs.

If there was a total of €10 million in claims this year, for example, is that all recoverable by the Department or is there a cap in place that allows for only a percentage of the costs to be recouped?How does it work?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	746	It is managed on our behalf by CIÉ. If the Deputy wants specifics, we will have to revert with those details. There are thresholds within the management of claims.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	748	There were claims totalling €153,000 in 2016 and €370,000 in 2017. The amount of claims in 2018 is expected to be €402,000.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	751	The transport management charge covers the management of the claims rather than the total cost.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	753	There is an insurance and claims direct cost in the direct cost scheme. That came to €789,000 in 2017 and has varied between €700,000 and €900,000 annually from 2013 to date.

It is managed by CIÉ. Does CIÉ fight the case and hire its own solicitors and barristers or does the State Claims Agency have any role in that regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	755	CIÉ manages claims across all of our transport facilities. Obviously, strategy depends on the individual case. Some go to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. It depends on the nature of the claim.

It is my understanding the Department has no role in the claims even though it foots the bill.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	760	That is a valid point. We will revert with further details. It is fair to say that there is a significant amount of stewardship of claims within CIÉ. There are monthly meetings to go through the various aspects of claims. It is a very rigorous process and has been so for 20 years or more.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	761	Does Mr. McCarthy examine whether we are getting value for money in that regard? Is that within his remit?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	762	That would be too great a level of detail. In any event, I do not examine the accounts of CIÉ or Bus Éireann.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	763	Mr. McCarthy examines the accounts of the Department and would be aware of the headline figure. Is that what is presented by the Department?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	764	The cost of the service is reported. The Deputy makes the valid point that the Department should interrogate those figures to determine what makes up the direct costs.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	765	I ask that we be provided with a breakdown of the types of claims, if possible. How many relate to accidents on buses or involving third parties? The Department should give consideration to that because it does not know how vigorously claims for which it is picking up the tab are being contested. That information might be of interest to the Department.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	766	It is one of the areas on which we want to get further information. Obviously, Bus Éireann is part of CIÉ and CIÉ has a duty to follow up. We do not think there is anything inappropriate going on but it is entirely appropriate that we consider this in more detail.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	767	For the record, Bus Éireann is not passive in terms of managing claims. We have monthly meetings at which the risk register is considered. We meet representatives of CIÉ and the claims are presented to us and we interrogate them. A management committee reviews every case to decide whether it is appropriate to fight the case or consider a settlement. There is a significant amount of rigour by the CIÉ investigations team and secondary investigation teams to ensure that nothing untoward is being done.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	768	I acknowledge that. I do not suggest that Bus Éireann would take a passive approach to contesting claims but if it is not picking up the tab, these things could happen subconsciously. It would be a good exercise to compare these cases against others that are taken against the company in circumstances where it is footing the bill. That might be an interesting analysis. It was mentioned that the number of vehicles has fallen from approximately 600 to approximately 400. I presume those are CIÉ vehicles.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	769	They are Bus Éireann vehicles.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	771	Yes.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	772	Is there a reason for that? Does Bus Éireann not have sufficient vehicles or does it relate to the size or type of vehicles needed? Is it due to the required increase in the taxi service?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	773	It is partly due to decisions made by the Department on the replacement of services which we provided directly. For several years there has been a policy of contracting out services where demand had diminished. Typically, we directly employed part-time school bus drivers. As each retired, a decision was made on whether to replace the driver or contract out the service. In recent years, more services have been contracted out than new drivers hired.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	774	Bus Éireann school bus drivers are not being replaced on retirement. Rather, the services are subcontracted to the private sector.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	775	Discussions are ongoing in that regard. The issue relates to the vehicles as well as the drivers. As was explained, there has been a long-term issue as the traditional practice of cascading from road passenger vehicles into schools is probably no longer feasible. We need to decide whether to replace vehicles and direct provision at current levels or at a level which will satisfy the market going forward. That is a funding dialogue which we are entering with the Department.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	776	Is there a figure for the annual cost of those drivers' pensions? Some €3 million for future pensions for school bus drivers was set aside against the surplus. What does that €3 million cover? Does it cover the next five years or ten years? How many drivers does it cover?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	777	We have a certain amount of money set aside on our balance sheet for future ex gratia payments to drivers on their retirement.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	779	Absolutely.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-13 00:00:00	Business of Committee	780	At this stage, I can safely say we have concluded our discussion. I thank the witnesses from the Departments of Education and Skills and Transport, Tourism and Sport and Bus Éireann. I thank them for the material that has been provided to the committee. We made some requests for information which Bus Éireann or one of the Departments will send directly to the committee secretariat in writing. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff. I hope the witnesses and members have a happy Christmas and wish them all the best for the new year.
