#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	We begin with the resumed Second Stage debate on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  Deputy Durkan is in possession.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1	On a point of order, this morning I circulated a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach.  I wish to explain why I circulated that motion.  Yesterday saw the publication of two independent expert reports into the causes and the failures of the banking situation in Ireland.  This Government has relied on independent and expert advice on a series of occasions in recent years——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I must advise the Deputy that we are bound by——
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I do not propose to speak to the motion.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Deputy must be very brief.  We are bound by the order of last Thursday to proceed with the business as agreed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I appreciate that we are bound by order, and I know the order can only be varied by a proposal from the Government.  That is what I wish to address.  These two independent reports point the finger of blame directly at the Government and directly, as a consequence, at the person who was driving fiscal and economic policy in this country for a number of years, namely, the Taoiseach as then Minister for Finance.  The situation is that if similar reports were produced for any major company in the land, the chief executive officer would be dismissed forthwith and have to resign.  We have been told——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	6	With all due respect, we cannot have a debate on this matter at this stage.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	7	We have come in here for a second day when this House is expected not to speak about what everybody else in the country is talking about.  The consequences of the actions, or inaction, of the Taoiseach as Minister for Finance have been that hundreds of thousands of people are now paying the price, with €20,000 of debt for every family, increasing unemployment——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I was quite willing to allow the Deputy to make a few brief remarks.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	They will be very brief.  This morning on Pat Kenny's radio programme the Minister for Transport said that people can make their own judgment.  He said we can blame the Taoiseach for leading us into this — these are the words of the Minister for Transport.The position is that the precedent by long convention in this House is that when a motion of no confidence is set down it is countered by a motion of confidence by the Government.  I want to know from the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, or the Tánaiste — whomever is representing the Government this morning — when it is intended to move a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach.  I challenge the Government to move that motion today so that we can deal with it.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	11	This is a situation where the people of our country have been misled time and again by deception, which continues to this day.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Some co-operation from Deputy Kenny would be much appreciated.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for letting me say my few words, and I will make a final point.  I listened this morning to the Minister for Finance who clearly said that the Government has to bear primary responsibility.  He went on to speak about the sociopolitical context in which this happened.  That sociopolitical context was generated by the Government within the spires of the Galway tent.  The sociopolitical context was this — that if one said anything about the way the country was moving, such as when Deputy Bruton pointed out time and again that the alarm bells were ringing, one was either guilty of national sabotage or told to go and commit suicide.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	We agreed the Deputy's comments would be brief.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	17	It is impossible to have belief and trust in the Government or to know whether it is speaking the truth.  These reports are a damning indictment of the guilt of the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	18	We must move on to today's business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	19	For that reason, I challenge the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, the Tánaiste or the other Ministers to tell me when it is proposed to take a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach so that we can deal with these reports of guilt in this House where we should be allowed to debate such issues.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Government does not have confidence in the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	21	While the Minister for Finance points out that he was not in office at the time, he says the Government should accept primary responsibility while at the same time excluding the Government from the terms of reference of the commission of inquiry.  I think the Minister was saying this morning that the country would make a profit out of this.  He forgot to speak about the €22 billion that has gone into Anglo Irish Bank.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	22	We need to move on.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I challenge the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to tell me when it is proposed to move a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach.  I challenge the Government to take that motion in this House today.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I have called Deputy Gilmore.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	28	There is a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach before the House.  The normal practice when a motion of no confidence, in the Taoiseach or the Government, is tabled is that there is a counter motion of confidence from the Government.  Motions of confidence or no confidence have always taken precedence over all other business being transacted in the House.  I want to establish from the Tánaiste, first, when we are going to see the Government's counter motion, which we can expect.  Second, I want to know if, in line with precedent, the taking of a motion of confidence will take precedence over the conduct of all other business.We are in the unusual situation that the Government decided last week to order business for the House this week so that the House would not be in a position, as the Government thought, to discuss the damning reports on the banking crisis which it had in its possession at the time it moved its motion last week.  The reports on the banking crisis were delivered to the Government on 31 May.  The Government came in here last Thursday and put a motion before the House to sanitise the business for this week so that the representatives of the people could not discuss here in the Dáil the contents of the reports——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	29	We agreed that the Deputy's comments would be brief.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I will be brief.  We were not to discuss the contents of the banking reports which so damningly criticise the performance of the Government and, in particular, of the Taoiseach over a period of time.  The Government hatched those reports for ten days and is not allowing any discussion here in the Dáil.  It then tried to news manage the release of the reports yesterday, which backfired spectacularly on the Government, to the credit of the press in this country which was not going to be treated to the kind of spin and news management that was clearly intended.  We are now in the unusual situation that the two reports, one of which is from the Governor of the Central Bank, which criticises in very damning terms the performance of the Government and of the Taoiseach, can be discussed everywhere in the country except in the House of Parliament.I have asked two questions on a point of order.  One is to the Tánaiste.  When are we going to see the Government counter-motion on the motion of confidence?  The second question is to the Ceann Comhairle.  Will he follow the precedent that has existed in this House from the foundation of the State, which is that a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach or a motion of confidence in the Government, takes precedence over all other business being conducted in the House?  That motion of confidence, in my view, must be taken and debated today.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I will deal with the latter point before I call on Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  A motion of no confidence does not automatically take precedence over the business ordered for this week, unless the Government otherwise orders it to be taken.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Could we have some silence for the Deputy in possession.  I ask Deputy Burton if we could have silence for Deputy Ó Snodaigh, please.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	34	There is not a single Green Party Deputy in the House.

Yesterday, we had a protracted debate on this and as yet, we still do not know what facility exists for a change in the order of the House to take the question of a motion of confidence.  I raised this last week at the Whips' meeting when a proposal was made to have the sham sitting of the House.  I proposed, at that stage, that emergency legislation or emergency debates might be required and yesterday's report indicates there is an emergency debate required.  Everybody else, bar this House, is having the debate on the report which seems to indicate there is no confidence in the Government.  That debate should be taking place in this House.I ask the Ceann Comhairle, under Standing Order 27, to which I referred yesterday, to facilitate us in changing the order of the House so that we can have a debate on this matter and quite a number of other matters which have arisen since the House decided last Thursday, against our better wishes on this side of the House, to have the sitting yesterday and today.  I asked the Ceann Comhairle how we can order the business to take account of this.  The Ceann Comhairle said there would be an opportunity to do so and I ask him to present that opportunity.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	37	We proceed on the basis that the Government proposes and the House disposes.  I suggest the consultation process by means of the Whips is the way for any variation.  I call the Tánaiste.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I ask the Ceann Comhairle to please hear my point of order.  There is a motion of confidence which challenges that the Government has a majority in the House.  We do not know if Government backbenchers, who have been distancing themselves from the Taoiseach for some time, are willing to come in and vote support in him.  We do not know if the Green Party will vote support in him.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	59	All those points can be made next week.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	60	We do not know if the Independent Deputies will vote support in him.  The Constitution is very clear that votes in the House are on the basis of those present and voting.  There is a challenge today, not next Tuesday. The motion of confidence is tabled today.  The challenge is that the Government does not enjoy the support of a majority of Deputies in the House today.  I submit to the Ceann Comhairle that under the Constitution, he is obliged to take that motion today.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I have stated the position.  A motion of no confidence does not automatically take precedence over the business ordered last week.  The order of last Thursday sets down the business for this week and as it stands, no other business can be taken.  We will move on to other business.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	62	As I said last evening, I disagree with the concept set out in the proposal for the selling off and transferring of the assets of St. Luke's Hospital to the HSE.  I set out the grounds on which my disagreement rests.  I should add that my confidence in the HSE to deliver the health services as set out in its original mission statement has sadly waned, as has the confidence of everyone else in this House.  I have a theory which has been proven in other jurisdictions.  There is a notion developing with regard to delivery of health services in this country that big is beautiful and that everything should be concentrated in a number of major centres.  That concept has failed in other jurisdictions.  It has been shown that where smaller, more compact units were upgraded and modernised, they delivered a higher degree and quality and a more readily available service to the public.  They delivered it more conveniently to the needs of the general public which should be paramount in such cases.  The health board's replacement, the HSE, has done little in improving the delivery of services.  The current system is unworkable and unacceptable, representing a daily waste of money.This will continue until such time some health Minister decides to dissolve the HSE and return to a more workable structure that is accountable to the House.  A Minister must be made accountable to questions in the House on the expenditure and day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year delivery of health services across the country.  No attempt must be made to centralise services in such a way as to make it more cosy for those providing them while at the expense of those for whom they were intended.From the evidence we have seen so far, no attempt has been made to take account of patients' needs.  Neither has there been an attempt to utilise modern medical technology to ensure higher quality services can be delivered to the remotest areas in the country.  It actually appears that we have slipped down the technological ladder when compared to other jurisdictions.  I am saddened that so many dedicated people who work in the health services and have made it a vocational commitment are frustrated by this.This frustration also manifests itself in the replies to parliamentary questions we raise in the House.  We ask the Minister for Health and Children simple questions that cannot and will not be answered.  A Cheann Comhairle, I have noticed references creeping into all replies to parliamentary questions of a website where the information is available.  They often run along the lines of, "The Deputy can avail of the information on the Department's website".  A website is simply an advertisement in the media.  I have never known before of a Member being referred to a newspaper advertisement in a reply to a parliamentary question.  An attempt is being made to foist on Members the acceptance of an answer on a website for which the Minister is not accountable.Anything one wants could be on a website.  One could go to Senator Dan Boyle's Twitter page and get all the information one likes off it.  Shortly, we will be getting answers to parliamentary questions which will state, "We refer the Deputy to Dan's Twitter".  The Ceann Comhairle will have to go to Dan's Twitter himself to get information too the way this has gone.It saddens me to see the way the whole process is breaking down.  It is an absolute disgrace to Members on all sides of the House.  What about the unfortunate Government backbenchers?  What function they do have anymore?

If it is not dealt with in the first instance, it will be dealt with later when it becomes a scandal and there is an inquiry into it.  Will Ministers recognise, to protect themselves and the country, that ministerial responsibility, particularly in the health services, must be taken?I suspect I have not much time left as the Ceann Comhairle is looking at me with a kind of jaundiced look.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	65	He wants to give me more speaking time.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I am saddened by what is proposed in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I do not believe anyone could have confidence in the HSE's ability to use and value the facilities and staff of St. Luke's Hospital or be able to continue the work done by the staff and its voluntary support group in the past.  They certainly will not be able to do it to the same benefit of the wider community.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I welcome to the opportunity to speak on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which provides for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's Hospital and the transfer of its staff to the HSE.  As other Members have done, I wish to praise St. Luke's Hospital for what it has achieved for patients through the years.  People diagnosed with cancer went to St. Luke's for treatment with a heavy heart.  That was until they entered into the hospital which was a kind environment, if one can call a cancer treatment centre such.  The staff were interested in patients' well-being and recovery.  An air of welcome, courtesy and hospitality was evident in St. Luke's.  Anyone who went there as a patient or visitor would know they were entering a house of well-being.Now the hospital will enter into the centres of excellence treatment programme as laid out by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and Professors Tom Keane and Brendan Drumm.  I hope these intangible qualities of welcome, courtesy and hospitality and the well-being evident to all who entered the portals of St. Luke's will be enabled in a real way after this transfer to the HSE.  I hope the board and the staff will bring with them this aura which is necessary to a patient's well-being during cancer treatment.Even in this day and age with all the advances in cancer treatment, when a person is diagnosed with it, it still causes immense dread.  All these advances are set at nought for the patient, his or her immediate and wider family and circle of friends.  It is amazing this primitive feeling of dread is still strong.I also want to commend the work done by the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital.  For many years I had dealings with the group, participating in some of its fundraising events.  I know the energy and dedication of those who worked on behalf of the organisation.  I salute them for raising up to €26 million over the years, which was put into hospital facilities, research and ongoing treatment including radiation and oncology.  They are a great bunch of people and I understand from the Minister's speech and from speaking to some other Members that they intend to continue this fine activity which they have undertaken and to which they wish to continue.  They are imbued too.  Earlier, I referred to the staff and the aura within St. Luke's but each of the Friends of St. Luke's are imbued with those same qualities.  "The quality of mercy is not strain'd, it droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven upon the place beneath".  This sentiment is the way they treated their job or vocation.We are discussing the transference of all of this to the HSE but I hope those fine qualities are not smothered by the HSE and that during this transference those qualities are not lost, smothered or sent off on another route, which can happen in large organisations.  Deputy Durkan was right when he maintains that small is beautiful.  I am a firm advocate of the centres of excellence for cancer care.  When she embarked on the road of setting up centres of excellence, the Minister embarked on a very tortuous Via Dolorosa along which many people attempted to throw stones at the idea and objective.There is no doubt that if one wishes to have excellence in cancer care the experience gained by many prognoses and treatments stands to the test when a person presents for treatment.  If the doctor, clinician and all such people in charge do not have a vast array of experiences within their grasp, which they can use for the curative good of the patient who presents himself or herself, then the care will not be as thorough or far-seeing as it would be within a centre of excellence of cancer care.I refer to what should take place now.  The idea of centres of excellence should be extended to other areas of ill-health in our population.  I speak particularly of the Alzheimer agenda.  The work of the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, touches upon this as well.  There is a case to be made now for the road of the Alzheimer agenda to be travelled and to have centres where the finest research can be undertaken.  It is evident that where centres of excellence exist, research can be channelled and, if it is not already undertaken in these centres, it can be channelled to work for the good of the body of patients who go there.There is no doubt that in the modern world Alzheimer's is a complaint widespread and terrifying in its implications.  In a way it is as terrifying, not so much for the patients, but for those who mind them, as cancer was in its horrific impact on people.  I commend Deputy Michael Noonan who, on "The Frontline" programme, spoke so feelingly and from the heart of the journey he travelled with his dear wife towards Alzheimer's and towards the oblivion towards which people who suffer from Alzheimer's travel.  He spoke so feelingly that he unlocked a well of feeling and support towards that complaint and towards anything that could be done to address it.I am keen to see progress made with cancer care such as that spearheaded by Professor Tom Keane and the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney and well done to them.  It was a very difficult task.  Naturally, the places where cancer care had been well given and received would wish to hold on to that, a natural wish and feeling.  However, from the outset I was in favour of the centres of excellence because I took the view that if I were ill I would rather go where I could be assured of top quality exploration and curative care and I could be there for the receipt of ongoing research.In that vein, we should take the same path for the Alzheimer's agenda.  It is pervasive and I do not know what we used to call it long ago.  I am aware of the man who gave his name to the condition, which is well documented but the prevalence of it now is amazing.  There is strong ongoing research into the Alzheimer debate and it has yielded some very positive results.  One cannot lift up a newspaper at the weekend but to find a snippet about new research into Alzheimer's and how it could, hopefully, have an effect in time on the work of those who work for and with people with the complaint and as they travel onwards in life.I commend Deputy Michael Noonan who opened his heart to us all in that television interview.  He gave a personal and acute insight into what it has meant to him and to many other people throughout the country who have faced that terrible dilemma.  I trust the Minister of State will take from my remarks that the time has come for an agenda for Alzheimer's.  If that could be married to the work of the Minister of State, so much the better because much of his work is relevant in this regard.  I commend the Minister of State on his work as well.It would be wrong of me to finish my contribution by not restating my admiration for the years of work carried out by the staff in St. Luke's, including the work of the medical and nursing staff, the ancillary staff and the Friends of St. Luke's, who have set up so many benefits for those who went to that hospital.  One such benefit was the facility whereby one could go and stay in a nice guest house on the grounds.  Relatives could be near their loved ones who were entering on an unknown journey and who would surely benefit from the warmth and love of their dear ones as they embarked on it.  There can be no higher accolade than that the Friends of St. Luke's have stated that they will continue their good work for patients on the road ahead, no matter what else happens.The Minister, Deputy Harney, referred to other aspects of the debate, including matters relating to the Department of Social Protection and the culmination of the infectious disease special payments.  I refer to one other matter.  I understand from what the Minister has stated in the debate that there is to be a specialised centre for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in St. Vincent's Hospital.  I was very pleased to read of that development.  Such a centre is much needed.  I commend the Department of Health and Children, Professor Keane, the Minister and all who work within the Department and the HSE on the dedication that has given rise to the setting up of all of these centres of excellence.  Make no mistake about it, that project — the centres of excellence — would not have succeeded if somebody very determined and with a strong political will and engagement had not been at the helm, but succeed it did.  I wish all those who work in St. Luke's well but my abiding wish is that the fine work carried out there is not smothered by the entrails of the vast bureaucracy which is the HSE.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I wish to share time with Deputy Shatter.The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's Hospital and the transfer of its staff, properties, functions and liabilities to the Health Service Executive.  I listened with interest to numerous speakers who are more familiar with the operation of St. Luke's Hospital than I am and who highly praised the staff and the service they deliver.My contribution primarily concerns the miscellaneous amendments in the legislation but I would like to comment on St. Luke's Hospital and perhaps go from the particular to the general.  There is an increasing trend of the HSE taking small State-funded hospitals under its remit and I am not altogether sure that is welcome.  I have no doubt that in years to come we will reverse this process and recognise that small does not necessarily mean inefficient.  I accept the need for centres of excellence and I am not opposed in principle to the reconfiguration of the health service, but the HSE is a monolith and is unaccountable and this just adds more fuel to that fire which I am not sure best serves the public.The primary purpose of my contribution concerns the miscellaneous amendments in the legislation, nursing homes and the new fair deal scheme which, broadly speaking, has been widely welcomed by all parties in the House.  There was much uncertainty for families with ageing relatives in need of full-time care, how affordable it would be for them and what would happen when their financial resources ran out.  This scheme has brought some certainty in regard to their entitlement to support from the State, which I welcome.As I was coming into the House, I saw the retiring chief executive of the Health Service Executive, Professor Drumm, presumably heading into the dungeons of Leinster House to a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I wish him well in his retirement and I welcome the new chief executive designate, Mr. McGee, who I understand has a history in the health service in the north west where he was involved in the provision of community facilities which, I believe, will be the next battle ground.Reconfiguration has happened in respect of centres of excellence for cancer services.  It has happened in the mid-west in Ennis and Nenagh and in the north east.  It is now happening in the south and there are question marks over the future of Bantry and Mallow General Hospitals.  What is relevant to this Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the nursing homes legislation is that the reconfiguration process is moving into the delivery of community-based nursing home facilities.  I wish to put down a marker here for the HSE that it should make haste slowly.Community-based medical services can thwart the onward march to acute hospital facilities if properly structured and delivered.  A key component of that is community nursing facilities — the district hospitals.  In my constituency, there is Kanturk, Millstreet and Macroom District Hospitals and on the fringes of my constituency, there is Dunmanway District Hospital.  I see a threat hanging over those district hospitals.  When concluding the debate, I would like the Minister to reassure me about their future.It is important we have a public-private mix.  The fair deal scheme does not differentiate and people now have a choice.  It is not right that we phase out these community hospitals by stealth and I would like an assurance that will not happen.  What is happening is that the Health Information and Quality Authority is carrying out inspections in these district hospitals and there is a real danger that a combination of HIQA and patient choice about whether to choose a private nursing home or a HSE run facility could mean district hospitals will be starved of funding to meet the HIQA standards and that, ultimately, the HSE will say it does not have the capital budget to spend to meet the HIQA standards and that patients have a choice and can go to the private nursing home facility.  Maintaining a public-private mix in terms of provision for elderly people is critical.The new fair deal scheme is very much in its infancy.  I support the idea of patients having choice but there is some evidence that patients initially opted for private facilities in large numbers but are now opting for community-based nursing facilities.  It is vitally important that the Minister assures us that the combination of HIQA inspections and the fair deal scheme is not the pretext under which the HSE will say it does not need community facilities.  I acknowledge the tremendous service those community hospitals have delivered on a shoestring for large numbers of patients over many years.There is another matter about which I am concerned in regard to the HSE's tactics on this issue.  Almost all the patients in those community nursing facilities are high dependency and, therefore, the rate per patient could prove higher than the rate in a private nursing home.  Will the private nursing homes cherry-pick and say the high dependency patients can go to the district hospital and that they will take the low dependency patients where the care requirements are not as complex and where they can meet their profit demands which the community-based facility does not have?  I would like an assurance that agenda is not afoot in the HSE and that the community hospitals will continue to play a role.Deputy O'Rourke mentioned Alzheimer's care.  There is a great and growing need for facilities to care for patients with Alzheimer's.  There is also a great need for respite care places.  The reconfiguration process has been undertaken in acute hospital services in HSE south and is beginning to happen in respect of these community hospitals.  That process must be open and transparent and I would like communities to be involved in it.  I do not want closure by stealth, which I fear.The Minister cannot hide behind the HSE in this regard.  She must clearly state that she supports the principle of retaining a public-private mix in terms of choice for patients in terms of long-term care.  I would like to be reassured that the great and growing need in regard to respite care places and care for patients with Alzheimer's is met whether through the community hospitals or otherwise.  That can be dealt with in the context of reconfiguration.  However, due to a combination of factors, including the fair deal provision, patient choice, HIQA inspections and the cost of care having regard to the high-dependency nature of the patient in community hospitals, I do not want the HSE to arrive at a juncture and decide that such provision could be done better in the private sector.  The straws are in the wind in that regard.The HSE has recently built a new community nursing facility, paid for by public funds, in Ballincollig in my constituency.  It is very welcome but no sooner was the building completed than the HSE decided to put it out to public tender.  It will now be given to the private sector to operate.  I am not opposed to that — there is a role for the public sector and the private sector in such provision.  If that is a signal of where the HSE is going in respect of its own facilities, it raises the most serious questions in respect of the future of the aforementioned community hospitals in Kanturk, Millstreet, Macroom and Dunmanway.  There are 21 public long-stay HSE operated facilities in the south west in which local communities have significantly invested.  I want to be reassured by the Minister of State, when she replies to this debate, that the HSE, at her direction, will not be allowed to wind down its involvement in community nursing facilities for the elderly.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I am greatly obliged to the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to contribute and I thank my colleague, Deputy Creed, for sharing his time with me.I was anxious to briefly speak on this legislation because of the many people in my constituency of Dublin South, across south Dublin and from outside Dublin who have used the facilities in St. Luke's, who admire the medical care available there, who regard it as a centre of excellence in the area of radiotherapy, who greatly fear for the future in the context of the Government's intention to transfer the facilities and services provided by it to St. James's Hospital and who have fears, in the context of the future management of that hospital, not only about how matters will develop but also about its accessibility and the nature of relationships with patients.  St. Luke's has truly been a centre of excellence in providing for many thousands of people going through the trauma of cancer care and oncological treatment.  It has an ethos, to which many other speakers have made reference, whereby the patient is absolutely put first.  Unlike the HSE dealing with people as if they are anonymous nuisances whose situations have to be addressed and who frequently seem to lose to sight of the humanity of the individuals and their health concerns, St. Luke's deals with people on a one to one basis.  There is an ethos about the hospital and a support system within it not only for cancer patients but for their families.  Accommodation arrangements are made of a nature that certainly are not currently available in St. James's Hospital and there is no indication that they will be available when the services are moved from St. Luke's.  It is only right that we in this House reflect the concerns that are inherent in the Government's proposal.  I am saying this from the position of someone who supports the concept of centres of excellence and believes that we must provide the best possible medical care of a specialist nature to patients not simply with regard to the area of cancer but also in other areas.  However, in this context, we are talking about cancer patients.In the context of St. Luke's in Rathgar, a major criticism is that surgery is not provided for there and that it cannot deliver the multidisciplinary care that many believe is necessary to ensure the best possible care for cancer patients.  This is seen very much to be the Achilles' heel of St. Luke's.  While the centralisation of technology and expertise is important when it comes to diagnosis and surgery, radiotherapy can be delivered in a community setting.  In many countries that is the arrangement.  St.  Luke's is a centre of excellence in that regard.  I have grave doubts about the wisdom of Government policy.  I see no reason there cannot be a linkage between the preservation of St. Luke's and the expansion of services in St. James's to incorporate both of them into the one centre of excellence.  This is something to which serious consideration should be given.I have grave doubts about the Government's timeframe for its proposal.  When it was first proposed that St. Luke's essentially be closed down and its services transferred to St. James's,  I recall the date of 2011 was given for the move.  The target date of 2011 then became 2012, and that target date has now become 2015.  I am not clear at this stage what is the credible timeframe for the move and the financing of it.  This is creating a level of uncertainty that is undesirable.  However, what I am particularly concerned about, and I want to emphasise this point, is that St. Luke's — which currently has an independent board — a well-managed hospital albeit one that on occasion has a waiting list, is to be replaced by management provided by the HSE.  I regularly talk in this House about the complete incapacity of the HSE to manage our child care services.  Professor Drumm in the Irish Examiner  this morning almost bewailed the fact, that, as chief executive of the HSE, he has had to deal with child care services.  If I could say this within this Chamber, he has managed the child care services with unprecedented incompetence as a chief executive during his term of office and we are seeing the consequence of that in all of the revelations of the past 18 months.  However, equally, despite all of the good work done by Professor Keane, and I acknowledge he has done good work, we have seen the extent to which there are endemic problems within the medical service managed by the HSE, namely, the failure to ensure proper patient care, to treat individuals, to acknowledge the stress individuals suffering serious ill health are under and to provide a response to them of a humane and rapid nature when required.  I have huge reservations about the HSE taking over the management of St. Luke’s, be it St. Luke’s as it is currently positioned within Rathgar or the new St. Luke’s to be in St. James’s.In terms of the level of patient care at a human level — I am not being critical of nurses or doctors in St. Luke's — in the context of the administration of the hospital in Rathgar, the manner in which the hospital interacts with patients and their families, the types of services it provides for them that go outside the medical area in providing the supports necessary to ensure that people avail of the medical care and that their family members understand the nature of the illness being suffered and the impact of treatment, I am concerned that when the HSE replaces the current board, there will be a deterioration in that area.  The facilities in St. Luke's which has beautiful grounds — a tranquil setting where there is an opportunity for those undergoing treatment and their visiting families, particularly when the weather is good, to go for walks in the grounds — will not be available in the grounds of St. James's, which may be a hospital of excellence but is essentially turning into a huge hospital factory covering a broad range of areas.  The types of facilities available to patients undergoing treatment in St. Luke's will not be available to such patients in St. James's.  I do not understand why we cannot ensure that St. Luke's remains open as part of a centre of excellence interlinking with St. James's Hospital.  That is something I would like to see happen and to be reconsidered.  In the context of current economic catastrophe confronting this State and the financial dilemmas of where we will find money to spend on projects, previously deemed desirable, I suspect that, as a matter of practical economics, what is now being proposed may have to be reviewed.    However, as a matter of ensuring medical excellence, there is no reason there cannot be the type of linkage between the two to which I have made reference.It is important that if one is a cancer patient and requires radiological treatment that is available as rapidly as recommended by the consultant whose care one is under but there remains a problem in so far as there are those on radiation oncologists waiting lists in circumstances which are not acceptable.  Such waiting lists are simply not acceptable in any civilised state not only because of the worry and anxiety it causes to patients, but because of the life and death implications of radiation treatment that is required being unnecessarily delayed.  At the moment when that occurs and there are waiting lists, there are arrangements in place and, in recent times, a number of patients on waiting lists in St. Luke's Hospital have been referred on and been provided with the treatment they require.My concern is that when this administration is taken over by the HSE these individuals whose care is catered for will simply become more HSE statistics on a list that someone in HSE central views as one among hundreds of people on waiting lists for a variety of reasons across the country.  We must ensure that does not happen and that the best treatment possible in the quickest time it can be provided be made available to cancer patients who require the type of treatment that to date has been so excellently provided in St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar.

Thar na blianta, d'aithnigh éinne a d'fhreastal ar othar a bhí san ospidéal le haghaidh obráide, nó aon ghnáthamh eile bainteach leis an ailse, gur áit speisialta a bhí ann.  Tá na céadta míle othair imithe tríd St. Luke's ón lá ar oscalaíodh é, breis is 56 bliain ó shin.  Tháinig a lán dóibh amach ar an taobh eile ina lán-bheatha, ach níor éirigh le go leor dóibh teacht tríd an chóir leighis a cuireadh orthu san ospidéal.Tá na haltraí, na dochtúirí agus an fhoireann iomlán i St. Luke's speisialta freisin.  Déanann siad i bhfad níos mó ná gur chóir dóibh, i mbealach amháin, agus iad ag déileáil leis na hothair.  Tá siad sásta gach rud gur féidir leo a dhéanamh chun cuidiú leis na hothair atá faoina gcúram.  Is áit speisialta í St. Luke's freisin mar gheall ar an suíomh deas ciúin atá aici.  Nuair atá daoine buartha faoin ailse atá tar éis iad a bhualadh, tá sé tábhachtach go mbíonn an ciúnas sin acu i suíomh atá leagtha amach chun a thuairimí a tharraingt chucu féin.  Bíonn buairt ar dhaoine a bhíonn an "C mór" acu agus ar a muintir.Is trua go bhfaigheann i bhfad Éireann an iomarca daoine bás de thairbhe ailse sa tír seo.  Dá bhrí sin, aontaím leis an Rialtas go bhfuil gá ann radiation oncology a chur ar fáil lasmuigh de Bhaile Átha Cliath.  Ní dhéanfaidh mé aon troid i leith an chinnidh sin.  Dar ndóigh, tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuig na fadhbanna móra leis an bplean.  Sa deireadh thiar thall, ní chóir go mbeadh gach rud lonnaithe i St. Luke's nó in aon ospidéal eile.  Is fíor sin ó thaobh radiation oncology, paediatrics agus gach gné eile de chóras leighis na tíre seo.Labhair mé faoi St. Luke's agus an suíomh atá ann.  I gcomparáid le hospidéil eile, tá an ciúnas sin ann.  Níl sé chomh ghnóthach sin go bhfuil gach rud ag tarlú ar luas ró-thapaidh.  Measaim go bhfuil cinneadh mícheart déanta ag an Rialtas sa chás seo.  Ní chóir dúinn glacadh leis an Bhille seo, os rud é gur céim siar atá i gceist.I have a problem with parts of the national plan for radiation oncology not because of the four centres and two satellite centres that have been identified, but because none of them is north of a line between Dublin and Galway and that still has not been properly addressed.  There are ways to address it and they should have been announced before we dealt with this legislation.  An all-Ireland approach to health services would also have helped to address this with greater co-operation between the HSE and the health services in the Six Counties.  That would help to address some of the problems in counties Mayo, Sligo and Donegal and north Leitrim, which will not be properly served by the plan as it stands.I cannot understand the logic of decisions the Government and the HSE have taken in recent years to close hospitals which are known the length and breadth of the island for the services and treatment they have provided and in which the State has invested significant sums in the recent past to upgrade facilities.  For example, there was quite a financial investment in St. Luke's Hospital in recent years to upgrade it and make it, as was announced by Ministers at the time, a world class treatment centre that would stand out above others.  That was true in 1996 when major investments were allocated to upgrade the hospital and in 1997 when St. Anne's Hospital was closed and its services were transferred to the St. Luke's site.  It was also true as recently as 2008 when two new and two replacement linear accelerators were installed, increasing the hospital's radiotherapy treatment capacity.  The investments have been made and while I am not critical of them, I am critical of the fact that they will be undone at a time we can ill afford it.St. Luke's Hospital is located in Rathgar, Dublin.  It is renowned among patients and their families for the beauty of its grounds and I do not see the logic of concentrating all its services in centres of excellence.  Why not make this hospital a centre of excellence, as was proposed in the past?  In 1996 when the Government invested in it St. Luke's was to be made a centre of excellence.  Obviously there is a requirement for additional moneys to be invested in St. Luke's.  There is a requirement for additional moneys to be invested in the satellite centres and in order for treatment to be made available in the community, and I have no complaint about that.However, there is no logic in abandoning a hospital in which so much public money has been invested to date, and leaving it without a proper future.  I am not aware of what the future plans are for St. Luke's.This type of half thought out planning has also been the approach taken by the HSE to paediatric care in Ireland.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin is in my constituency.  There is another paediatric hospital in Tallaght, formerly Harcourt Street Hospital, and in Temple Street there is another.  There is an enormous need for investment in paediatrics in Ireland and I am not disputing the logic that there should be one centre of excellence.  Nor am I disputing the fact that there should be a centre of excellence for oncology services.  I am, however, disputing the need for new build in all cases so that everything is moved into a centralised location, especially in  paediatrics, without any plan as to what is to happen to the existing hospitals.In my view, the only logical thing that can happen, given the current approach of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government as a whole to health services, is that those centres will be sold to private concerns.  That question has not been answered here in terms of the site of Crumlin children's hospital.  What is the future of that site?  Only last month the hospital applied for planning permission to upgrade its ICU unit, despite the fact that it is going to be closed in four years time.  There is absolutely no logic in continuously investing public money in upgrading facilities that will be closed within a few years.  The same goes for St. Luke's.  There is no logic in upgrading the facilities there if it is intended to close the hospital in a year or two.I believe these hospitals should be upgraded and should not be closed.  That is a question for the Minister of State to answer as regards the future plans for the site of St. Luke's once the national plan has been fully rolled out and the hospital transferred to St. James's or Beaumont by 2014.We have a major problem in Ireland with cancer.  The figures I was provided with show that there are some 23,000 patients annually, and this is expected to increase.  As legislators we have to ensure that appropriate education is made available so that people can detect cancers early and avail of treatment locally.  Of the 23,000 detected some 12,000 or 13,000 will require treatment annually.  For all concerned, there is a logic to the fact that the treatment required should be made available at the nearest possible point to a centre of excellence.  From a patient's viewpoint whatever services can be provided should be available as locally as possible.  Everyone accepts that not all treatment can be provided on one's doorstep, and that there is a need for centres of excellence.  However, the health services in Ireland have become more and more centralised over the years.  Every small hospital around the country seems to be targeted for closure by the HSE, supposedly on efficiency grounds.  However, I can guarantee that when a cost analysis is done in a year or two, it will show that the efficiencies which were meant to be achieved will be found wanting because people will be presenting at centres of excellence with problems that could have been addressed at an earlier stage, if the services were more locally available — or if they did not have to travel up and down to Dublin by taxi from as far afield as Donegal, for example.I am opposed to this Bill, and I am asking that, even at this late stage, the Government thinks again about this and takes into account the financial constraints the country is under.  I believe part of its policy objectives can be achieved by investing in St. Luke's.  It would be cheaper to upgrade St. Luke's than to roll out all of the current plans.I have visited a number of friends in the recent past who, sadly, have died, and who had undergone various radiation treatments.  They were very proud of the work done in St. Luke's and praised its staff and the treatment they received.  One of those treated at St. Luke's had previously been treated in St. James's for another ailment.  He said that the difference in terms of his whole attitude to the problems he was facing, from being in a major general hospital to being treated in a dedicated small hospital, was immense, and it gave him some relief.  Regrettably, he is not with us today.Another friend who died recently, too, also was full of praise for the staff at St. Luke's.  Now that staff is to be transferred by the HSE to wherever it decides.  Hopefully, most of that staff will be able to stay together, because they have built up a good working relationship, regardless of whether they are transferred to St. James's, Beaumont or one of the four satellite centres so that the care and treatment they mete out to patients over and above their normal responsibilities will continue.  I know this will be difficult, because I am aware of the problems experienced by staff from smaller hospitals when Tallaght General Hospital was set up.  To this day there is a tendency among staff to identify colleagues as belonging to the Adelaide, Harcourt Street or the Meath.  Sometimes it is difficulty for people to gel.  That difficulty would be removed, however, if St. Luke's in its present form was maintained and expanded, while increasing and enhancing the services, as required.I will not continue for much longer, apart from saying that every decision taken by the HSE of late seems to have been ill-conceived, and I cannot see how this one is any different.  The HSE is running on a political platform to the effect that privatisation is good and should be facilitated.   The Government has fully endorsed that platform and I believe it will be further endorsed in this case, because the plans probably will be carried out under a PPP.  While I may be incorrect in this regard, I cannot envisage the Government changing its mind on its current approach to building an investment in the public health services, which is that it must have private investment.  Public moneys should be spent on public hospitals and private moneys should be spent on private hospitals, if the latter are allowed at all.  I am one of those who believe that Ireland should have a single tiered health service provided from the public purse and paid for by the public.  It would be paid for by those who can properly afford it.  This is the argument in respect of the need to change the taxation system.  The taxes that are raised should be targeted specifically at public services such as hospitals and so on and public moneys should not be diverted from public services, as is the case at present under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.I recently learned that €5 million, which would have kept open the St. Joseph's ward in Crumlin hospital, was diverted from public paediatric services to pay for private paediatric services.  It is a living disgrace that a hospital cannot keep open its wards and operating theatre because the money is being diverted to private hospitals.  Moreover, I believe the same is happening in respect of radiation oncology and that this is the plan for the grounds and buildings of St. Luke's Hospital once they have been transferred, if this Bill is passed, to St. James's and Beaumont hospitals.I urge the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to reject this Bill and to go back to the drawing board.  It is not a big drawing board and I believe this can be achieved on-site at St. Luke's Hospital.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Great sadness is attached to the legislation before Members today, which effectively sounds the death knell of St Luke's Hospital.  It also is a Bill that gives more power to the HSE, which by any standards is a mixed blessing.  I fully agree with the remarks made yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, that not even the greatest fan of the HSE would fail to recognise that defects exist which must be addressed with regard to the management of and a uniform delivery of services within the HSE.  All Members are aware of this on foot of their representation of people from their constituencies nationwide.  I am particularly aware of this point from the perspective of my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, in which services have been destroyed by the present Government over the years.  The most extraordinary thing is that this could be recognised by a Minister, as the lack of uniformity comes from the ill-conceived policies of the HSE, which is unfit for purpose.The old saying, "Do not fix it unless it is broken" really applies in respect of the closure of St. Luke's Hospital.  The destruction of a rare good within the health system, which definitely could not be described as being broken, begs the question as to the reason.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, might explain this fully later.  I acknowledge that Ministers of State who serve in various areas under the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, have different views on this issue.  The Minister of State who is present in the Chamber might outline her concerns regarding the closure of this fine facility.  Of course, the moment the word is out of one's mouth, the answer shoots up to hit one between the eyes.  The patients of St. Luke's Hospital, who have received excellent care for the past 66 years, are being asked to pay for Government mismanagement.  Unfortunately, the price is their ill health.St. Luke's Hospital is situated on a prime site in Rathgar and therefore is a highly saleable asset and it is obvious that the Minister intends to sell it.  The proceeds will be lost, as were the proceeds of the sale of St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar, in the general chaos of the HSE.  However, the like of St. Luke's will never be seen again and for what?  No one can convince me that, excellent though St. James's Hospital is, it can replicate the personal and homely environment perfected in the smaller and more intimate settings of St. Luke's.  I echo the welcome of my colleague, Deputy Reilly, for the Minister's decision to not move the radiotherapy services at St. Luke's until 2014 at the earliest.  However, no matter how one considers this or what argument the Government puts forward, the closure of St. Luke's constitutes a failure on the part of the Government.  It is a failure to provide for the people it represents and a failure to look after the health of the nation.Country-wide, the first blow to cancer care was the withdrawal of local cancer services and the centralising of such, in so-called centres of excellence in Dublin.  One was told that this would lead to an improvement in services and care.  The reality has not been quite as promised and the closure of what probably is the most highly regarded cancer hospital in the country can in no way be considered a positive move.  A major review of the eight designated centres of excellence for breast cancer care in February last demonstrated that the centres still do not have all proper measures in place to avoid missed or delayed diagnosis.  The report found that despite scandals associated with breast cancer, there was as yet no national definition of delayed diagnosis or a consistency of approach across the centres for auditing such clinical incidents.  The report also highlighted the fact that there still is no sharing of treatment outcome data between the eight centres to maximise patient safety.From my own perspective, the closure of local services has caused untold hardship for the people of my constituency of Longford-Westmeath and the midlands as a whole.  Previously, poor quality rural transport and a lack of designated transport services made the accessing of services in Tullamore hospital difficult but travelling to Dublin is a nightmare for the ill and terminally-ill patients who need ease of access to services.  The main difficulty for those travelling from rural areas to Dublin is that city traffic makes the final leg of their journey almost as long as the time it takes to reach Dublin.  It is frustrating and extremely upsetting for seriously-ill people to be obliged to sit for long periods in cars that essentially are going nowhere.  Travel is one of the worst aspects of centralisation.  Local services in local areas should be a right for everyone.I met relatives of an elderly patient from south County Longford who left her home at 6 a.m. to travel to Longford to be picked up by an ambulance, which then made several stops throughout the midlands before continuing on to Dublin.  The ambulance was obliged to visit several hospitals in the Dublin area that were caring for patients from the midlands.  Eventually, she was brought in to the relevant hospital for treatment at 4 p.m.  Having been obliged to spend some time in the waiting room, she received her treatment and started out for home at 7 p.m.  She again encountered the hassle of visiting other hospitals to pick up patients and did not arrive back in her home until 11:45 p.m. that night.  It is shameful and disgraceful that in this day and age, an elderly terminally-ill person would be obliged to endure such hardship.  That is not good enough.  It is necessary to examine how we treat people.  Such situations should not be allowed to happen under the Minister's watch.  What is happening in this country would not happen in the Third World.My local area in Longford-Westmeath has been stripped of medical services, which has affected every man, woman and child in the constituency.  Some health and health-related services have already been cut in Longford-Westmeath.  I refer, for example, to the closure of Longford County Hospital in 1986.  I refer also to the ongoing failure to complete phase 2B of the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar despite the fact that €57 million was ring-fenced for the project when I served on the Midland Health Board prior to 2002.  Senators Camillus Glynn and Donie Cassidy both gave such a guarantee.  We were told the funding to put the services in place by the end of 2005 would remain untouched but nothing has happened in that regard.I understand that when the Taoiseach was Minister for Health and Children he intervened and had a cost-benefit analysis carried out.  He put several obstacles in the way of the completion of phase 2B at Mullingar hospital.  As I have said time and again, it is dangerous to have a Taoiseach in a neighbouring constituency because the constituencies bordering a Taoiseach's constituency will lose out on services.  The current Taoiseach has been most political in the manner in which he directed the relocation of many services that were better placed in the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar to Tullamore hospital, to the detriment of the people of Longford-Westmeath.  Political interference was also evident in the national spatial strategy when the Taoiseach designated three large towns in the midlands with city status when common sense would have dictated that Athlone would have received gateway status while the other towns were designated as hubs.The ENT clinic in Longford was closed.  In July 2006 there was a reduction in the number of agency nurses at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  In January 2007 the bus service to Mullingar and Tullamore came to an end although the service had been guaranteed when Longford hospital was closed.  In November 2007 the breast cancer unit at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar was closed.  Also in November 2007 the geriatric ward in St. Joseph's Hospital, Longford was closed.  Last year the consultant dermatologist in Mullingar retired and people were hoodwinked by bogus appointments for a number of months until I highlighted the issue in Dáil Éireann.  I understand that the permanent position has not yet been filled.  I urge the Minister to make a statement on the matter.Dental services were cut back in Longford-Westmeath.  The year 2009 also saw a threat of closure hanging over St. Loman's Hospital in Mullingar.  Loughloe House was closed in 2010, which has resulted in the death of three patients.  There has been a 50% reduction in beds at St. Joseph's care centre in Longford.  The HSE is introducing the closures in a mean, sneaky way.  According as patients move on or become deceased, beds are removed from wards.  Wards are being reduced in size from eight beds to four beds and six bed wards are being reduced to three bed wards.  That is a mean, sneaky way of closing down and reducing services in Longford.That brings me to current developments in the health sector in Longford-Westmeath.  On the principle that there is no smoke without fire, people are extremely concerned about talk of downgrading the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  We protested in 2005 at the closure of the breast cancer unit and we are protesting again on Saturday against the perceived threat to the hospital.  I assure the Minister that up to 10,000 people will be on the streets of Mullingar this Saturday to protest.  We want a 24-hour accident and emergency service in the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  We will accept nothing less because the people of Longford-Westmeath deserve nothing less.  We also seek the completion of phase 2B of the hospital and no downgrading of services, which are essential to the well-being of local people and people in the midlands.The Minister is blaming the current reduction in accident and emergency hours throughout the country on the organisation of working time directive but I am deeply concerned that this is a precursor of the closure of accident and emergency services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  I have been assured by the Minister when I raised the issue on the Adjournment that this is not the case but I am not reassured given past experience of what the Minister said and what she did.  She will never convince me or reassure me on the issue.  I do not like the cloak and dagger manner in which the HSE operates under the watch of the Minister.  Any reduction in accident and emergency hours or any attempt to move the service to Tullamore will leave the people of Longford-Westmeath without life saving medical options.  However, the Minister is fooling no one and is failing to cloak the closure of accident and emergency services in the guise of a reduction in hours.The spectre of the closure or downgrading of services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar has hung over the midlands for some time.  In an effort to avert that and secure the future of the hospital, it is necessary to designate it as a centre of excellence, with one speciality as its hallmark.  I demand the Minister to make a statement to that effect immediately as the uncertainty is demoralising to medical staff and other staff who are conscious of services being removed from the hospital.As a hospital that has consistently featured among the top three medical facilities in the country, the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar must be kept open.  Despite the removal of the breast cancer unit and despite the Government's failure to complete phase 2B of the hospital, the hospital in Mullingar is a dynamic centre, which provides medical excellence to the people of Longford-Westmeath.  The closure of St Luke's Hospital, which has been described as a haven in Rathgar for people from all over the country, and the potential downgrading of the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, are proof of the HSE's wilful destruction of all that is good in our health system.  It seems that the best performing hospitals are being axed by the Government.When Longford lost its hospital in 1986, promises were made that all services would be available in Mullingar.  That has not proved to be the case, as one by one, departments are being closed and specialist services removed.  We have seen the scandal of patients being refused scans and X-rays at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, despite referrals by GPs.  These doctors are then forced to send their patients to Dublin for private treatment.This very serious matter was dismissed when I raised it in this House and there were sniggering comments from the Government benches, which is the common response by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party when caught with regard to another health-threatening cutback.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach, who cannot take control of the country, took control over his party.If patient safety is being compromised in this manner in Longford-Westmeath, it is more than likely that the practice is common to all parts of the country.  It is disgraceful that doctors are being forced to refer their patients to private Dublin hospitals to have life-saving scans or X-rays.  This is putting a gun to the heads of vulnerable people, who are once again being forced to put their hands in their pockets to access necessary procedures.That the Government should apparently put in place measures to ensure that patients must either go without investigative actions or pay privately for scans or X-rays in Dublin hospitals is a disgrace.  If this is a deliberately orchestrated response to GP referrals, then the Minister for Health is responsible for serious misconduct and should consider her position.Over the past few months, we have seen patients at the Midlands Regional Hospital being given phantom appointments for a consultant that was no longer in employment.  Now we see patients being refused scans and X-rays to which they are entitled.  Cancer and mortuary services have been removed from the hospital.  Longford-Westmeath relies on this hospital.  It must be run in an open and fully transparent way.I am pleased to see the Minister has finally agreed to introduce legislation on sunbeds, particularly on their use by individuals under 18.  I have raised the publication of the public health (sunbeds) Bill many times on the Order of Business in the Dáil.  I am disgusted that it has been on the legislative programme since autumn 2008, perhaps earlier.  It is heartening to see that the Minister is at last taking seriously the matter of the danger to those under 18 years of age.  The seeking of recommendations from a range of bodies, including the WHO, will lead to greater protection, particularly of the young.However, the provision of health services under the tenure of the Minister has involved a litany of mistakes and missed opportunities.  The key prefix has been "mis-" in that there have been mismanagement, miscalculation, misdiagnoses, misdirection of finances, misconstruction, misspending, misbegotten policies, miscarriage, misconception, misjudgment and a miscast Minister.  The ill and vulnerable of this country have missed out to the detriment of their lives and their health.We have a small population.  We had a healthy economy and we can with conviction, and two reports for back-up, lay the blame for its demise firmly at the Government's door.  The legacy of Fianna Fáil will be Government for a few at the expense of many.  The quicker we get rid of it, the better for our country.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am from an area even farther west than Longford, Deputy Bannon's county.  Over the years, people had to use St. Luke's Hospital for services.  I thank the management, staff and board of St. Luke's for the excellent job they did over the years.  I spent many a sad night in the hospital.  Every Wednesday night I used to go there until we got our own service in Mayo.  The service was then lost to Galway and now there is a centre of excellence.  I do not want to comment on the centre of excellence but on what happened in Mayo General Hospital.I hope what is being proposed will be best for cancer services in Dublin and the rest of the country.  St. Luke's hospital was run very well.  It is the cleanest and kindest hospital I was ever in.  The inpatients used to be dealt with during the day and the country patients and others who had to travel long journeys, and who were in the facilities on the grounds, used to be treated at night.  My colleague, Deputy McGinley and I spent many nights at the hospital.  I used to visit the patients from Mayo.Some years later, the services in St. Luke's were moved to a location nearer the people in the west, which I welcomed.  There was an excellent cancer service and team in Castlebar but the HSE, in its wisdom, then opened the centre of excellence in Galway.  It was easier for people from the west to get to St. Luke's with their loved ones than it is to get to Galway.  St. Luke's was farther but it was easier to find parking there and to get in.Although I am sorry to see the services go from Mayo General Hospital, I hope the centre of excellence in Galway works.  I hope the property in St. Luke's cannot be sold by the HSE without the permission of the Minister.  I have no confidence in the HSE based on what has occurred over recent years.  The increase in size of the organisation is not working.  It is getting bigger and bigger and is having an increasing number of problems.  This week, we heard about misdiagnoses of miscarriages.  Every week there is a problem with the HSE.  It is like the Government, the banks and everything else in the country in that nobody takes responsibility.A group was set up that is very dissatisfied with what is happening in regard to St. Luke's.  It was proposed that the hospital be closed and that its services be delivered from a hospital in the centre of the city.  It was another idea proposed and forced through by the former Taoiseach that was not right for the health service.  As Deputy Bannon said, the health service should not be about what constituency a Minister is in; it should be about what people need and where they need it.  It should be a matter of what is best for the community, not what is best for the current Minister based on the location of his constituency.  Basing decisions on the latter does not represent the way in which any service should be run.Why is there such a high incidence of cancer, particularly in the west and particularly among women?  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, will state whether there are any investigations into this and any statistics being compiled on cancer types and where they are prevalent.  Is there any reason the incidence is higher in certain areas?Some years ago I tabled a number of questions to the Department of Agriculture on the amount of radiation from Chernobyl and the consequent high incidence of cancer, particularly in sheep.  If it was affecting animals, it was of course going to affect humans.  Are the Departments of Health and Children, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and others monitoring to determine whether there is radiation coming from various quarters, including England?  Is radiation still emanating from the Ukraine?What is the link between cancer and food?  When I was in the bread business, bread used to go stale in a day.  It now lasts for six weeks and develops blue mould before it goes stale.  The same is the case with milk.  I recently left a pint of milk in the garage at home and when I returned to it, about three weeks later, it had not gone sour but had just vapoured away.  One must ask oneself whether it is good for consumption.  Are we checking what is being put into food?Why are so many dying from cancer and why are we not further down the line regarding its treatment?  Although millions upon millions of euro have been invested in research and hospitals, do we investigate the cause of the high incidence of cancer in this country?  This is of concern to my constituents and to me because there areas in Mayo where there are high rates of cancer.  People worry about this, asking why the Government is not surveying to find out the nature and cause of the problem in certain areas in the west.St. Luke's Hospital gave an excellent service, with a great staff.  I hate that something that works is being broken and that is what will happen if St. Luke's is closed and the lands sold or developed by the HSE.Front line staff are not being appointed but I recently saw an advertisement for four regional managers in the HSE.  More managers, on huge salaries.  What do these managers do?  Manchester United, the most successful team in Britain, has had one manager for the past 25 years and he has got results.  We have more managers in the west than there are in the entire Premier League but they cannot get the job done and no one takes responsibility when there is a problem.I have written to the Minister of State many times about home help.  This scheme has worked so why does the HSE insist on tampering with it?  A constituent who gets one hour's home help per day contacted me this morning.  She depends on it but the HSE is cutting it down to half an hour.  A woman in Erris with no family in the area wrote to me, and I passed this letter to the Minister of State, saying she had a half an hour per day.  Weekend services have been withdrawn and home help has been reduced to three days a week.  She cannot feed or wash herself, she depends on the home help.  How could someone withdraw that essential service?  Everyone who was assessed has seen their home help hours reduced.  The Minister of State should bring in the managers of the HSE to see what is happening.  They will say that they must save money but they should not do it by cutting back on front line services like the home help.  All they are doing is creating problems further down the line, which is exactly what will happen with St. Luke's.  People who cannot look after themselves and who depend on their home help will finish up in nursing homes.What good is that?  We are far better off giving people the little bit of help to keep them in their homes.  All reports on home help have shown people want to stay at home if possible.  The Government is being short-sighted.  This is wrong, because the service is working well.  It might be costly but it is working and the Minister of State should bring in the HSE to deal with it.There is a problem in Belmullet hospital — a hospital our emigrants paid for over the years.  They raised money in Chicago, New York and Manchester for it and sent it home.  They did not forget about their loved ones; they wanted them to be in a hospital that would look after them.  Now the HSE is doing all it can to close that hospital.  Yesterday, it closed an eight bed male ward and I doubt it will ever open again.  That is wrong.  It is all because of staff cutbacks and to save money.  All that will happen is that those who need beds in Belmullet will have to go to Castlebar, Galway or Dublin.  It does not make sense.  The system was working and people were happy to be in their own area and I compliment the staff on the excellent job they have done there.This week, we have seen the misdiagnoses of miscarriages due to the failure of equipment.  If I had a car and it did not work, I would not keep it going for six months but the HSE blames the machinery for the mistakes.  Will anyone take responsibility for what has happened?  There is no point having an inquiry if no one pays the price for what happened.  It is the same with the banks.  There is no point telling us what the problems were; we must deal with the people who created the problems that we are paying for.  Managers are well paid so why are they are not taking responsibility?What has happened in the last week and to hear mothers on the radio telling their stories has been shocking.  It does not reflect well on the health service, although I do not want to criticise it.  I want it to work for everyone in the State.  We all use it at some time so we want to see a good one.  It does not work, however, when no one takes responsibility.  The Minister for Health and Children has been in the job too long and has lost all control.  She handed power over to the HSE and it has no responsibility to this House.  That is the problem in the health service.A bungalow in Áras Attracta in Swinford has been closed.  It worked well but people are being upset and frightened because of the amalgamation.  People must be shown the respect they deserve.  I say to those running the health service that they must be sensitive as well as saving money.  They cannot just close these units or double the numbers in them.  These people are human and deserve some respect.  I hope the decision in Áras Attracta will be reversed.Westport has no hospital — the nearest hospital in Castlebar.  There is now talk of weekend closure of the accident and emergency department in Mayo General Hospital and further cutbacks in services.  When I was elected to the Dáil, the big issue on Mayo was the orthopaedic unit.  That unit was agreed by the Government because it wanted to save its seat in the by-election and had to carry through.  I take some credit myself, because I was so strong at the time that the Government thought it might not win the seat so it conceded the orthopaedic unit.  Only last week, consultant Derek Bennett carried out surgery that was televised globally.  That is now a centre of excellence.The old Western Health Board did everything in its power to oppose opening the orthopaedic unit in Castlebar.  People with broken bones had to travel from Belmullet to Galway for treatment but now there is a centre of excellence in Castlebar.  The consultants there are to be complimented because no longer are people waiting for years for orthopaedic surgery.  Over Christmas an unprecedented number of people broke bones because of the frost and Mayo General Hospital dealt with that professionally.  People were treated and looked after.  I am disappointed that the HSE is trying to reduce services in Mayo General Hospital instead of granting the staff there the resources they need to serve the people of County Mayo so well.We lost the cancer services and the women were angry.  They will adjudicate on that at the next general election because those women have not forgotten what was done with cancer services.  This is short-sighted because in ten years time there will be more inquiries into the health services.  More people will not get the services they are entitled to and they will sue the State, something that will cost a lot more money than these cutbacks save.These cutbacks are hurting people.  They are hurting the sick, the weak, the poor and the most vulnerable in society.  It is wrong to attack frontline services.  We should be supporting them and giving them the help and backup they need.  We should be trying to keep people out of hospital rather than putting them into hospital.  The latter is the policy of the Government and the HSE by closing down home help and essential services for people being cared for in their homes.  These people will end up in institutions paid for by the taxpayer and the State.  All we are doing is saving money now but we will pay later, which is crazy.Cancer has affected every family in this country.  I would like to see more research and resources to see what is creating the problem with cancer.  I compliment the Department of Health and Children for upping its game in respect of some cancers.  It has improved people's chances of surviving if cancer is caught in time.  A good job has been done in respect of some cancers.  Men have been left behind for the past few years with regard to prostate cancer.  I am glad we are having an awareness campaign and are taking this seriously.  Men do not take their health seriously but they should.What is happening in the HSE is wrong.  The Minister and the Government should examine the HSE again.  It has not worked, it has failed the people of this country.  The HSE wants to cut and this is not working because it puts people's lives at risk.  Whatever cuts must be made should begin at the top rather than the bottom, as has been done.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I wish to echo the sentiments of many of my colleagues in paying tribute to the many years of outstanding work carried out in the field of cancer care at St. Luke's Hospital.  Many of my constituents have been treated at St. Luke's, which was a recognised centre of excellence for Ireland.  The sense of care, concern and support was outstanding.  However, its inception into the HSE fraternity exposes the deep flaw in the current national cancer care strategy.  Dublin has four cancer centres of excellence while there are none situated north of the line from Galway to Dublin.  Sligo has a regional hospital, with a staff of 1,400 providing a range of highly specialised services extending to 250,000 people in Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, north Roscommon, west Cavan, and east Mayo.  Sligo General Hospital bore the brunt of HSE cutbacks in terms of cancer service cuts as well as budgetary cuts over the past 12-24 months, affecting all services across the hospital, from oncology to orthopaedic care.  The hospital has already been dealt a severe blow with the removal of breast cancer mammography and surgical services under the national cancer control programme.  This move came despite the clear scientific and medical evidence that Sligo General Hospital was providing cancer care outcomes that compared favourably with, and indeed in some cases exceeded, those obtained in top cancer care clinics in the United States.Upwards of 4,000 mammograms were carried out at the hospital each year, which was well in excess of the critical mass required for the establishment of a centre of excellence.  This is relevant also to the outreach service if there is not to be a dedicated centre.  When Fine Gael is back in Government, I hope it will re-establish the outreach service working with Galway.  The multi-disciplinary team headed by a consultant, Mr. Tim O'Hanrahan, was responsible for the highly favourable and top level outcomes for breast cancer care at Sligo General Hospital.The decision also ignored the demography of the region.  The reality is that most cancers are age-related.  The north west region, served by Sligo General Hospital has the highest percentage of elderly people in the country.  The patients of Sligo General Hospital and the people of the north west have been categorised as second class citizens by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney and the HSE.I quote from the mission statement of Sligo General Hospital: "Sligo General Hospital is committed to the delivery of a high quality patient centred service in a safe, equitable and efficient manner".  With the best of intentions from hospital staff and management, the hospital is severely curtailed in delivering upon this mission statement because of the policies of the Government, and the HSE.  Clearly there is nothing equitable in the draconian budgetary and service cuts being applied across the hospital.  The Government and the HSE have a clear and deliberate policy to downgrade the hospital from one which provides essential acute services to over 250,000 people in the entire north west region, to one that will only provide for non-essential and elective services on a local basis.  This is the agenda being pursued.Notwithstanding the current €12 million budgetary cutbacks being implemented in the hospital, a further €12 million budgetary cut is now being proposed by the HSE in Sligo General Hospital, meaning the overall cutbacks will total €24 million.  This is a massive cut.  It will have a devastating impact on the cardio and angiography services in the hospital.  Up to now, Sligo General Hospital offered a three week turnaround time for patients, which is excellent.  Under the cutback proposals, coronary angiography patients will have to be referred to St. James's Hospital in Dublin, meaning what was once a three week turnaround time for patients in the north west will become a six month waiting time.  Lives will be lost.This is a critical service.  I appeal to the Minister to examine it, which is provided by an outstanding team led by a top consultant.  The team is recognised in the region.  The hospital serves 250,000.  I emphasise the three week turnaround, which will have an extraordinary impact.  Patients will have to be referred to St. James's Hospital to be placed on the waiting list.  Lives will be lost.This is just another example of the contempt in which patients in this region are treated by this Government and the HSE.  I appeal to Deputy Scanlon and the former Minister of State, Deputy Devins, who knows the importance of this service to Sligo.  Next week, Deputies will have a unique opportunity to vote on the motion of confidence in the Government to be taken next Tuesday.  The two Deputies are not members of the parliamentary party and say they adjudicate on every decision as it arises.  Between now and Tuesday they should talk to the Taoiseach.  The most critical infrastructural development of patient care in Sligo provides them with an opportunity to put a clear marker down to the Taoiseach.  It is bad enough to lose cancer services but now the coronary care, cardio care and angiography services are threatened.  We want a clear statement from Deputies Devins and Scanlon prior to the vote on Tuesday that the Taoiseach has given assurances these services will be ring-fenced and funding secured at Sligo General Hospital.  This matter is critical.Not alone will coronary care be affected by the current proposals but every essential acute service across the facility will suffer as a result.  This is where politics counts. It is where we exercise the mandate we were given when we were elected to this House.  Deputies Scanlon and Devins have a unique opportunity because they have a clear assessment of the local position but I have not seen much of it on the ground.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I have given you latitude, Deputy.  I ask you to address your remarks to the Bill, please.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	76	This is very much part of the Bill.  We are talking about the provision of cancer services and this concerns the extended services at Sligo General Hospital.  There was no curtailment of previous speakers who mentioned their local facilities.  This concerns the mandate I was given.  We are discussing St. Luke's cancer services and the regulation regarding their removal but cancer services were removed from Sligo.  This is phase 2.  Given the demographic profile of the north-west region, with its high population of elderly people, it is critical that oncology services are adequately resourced to cope with an increased demand.  Oncology was very much part of St. Luke's but the service is now being transferred to other centres in Dublin.  I am worried about the removal of services from the north west.  North of a certain line there are no services and I wish to put that clearly on the record today.The geographic location of the hospital also means it is ideally situated to perform as a centre for many regional services, especially now, in light of the roll-out of the national colorectal cancer screening programme.  However, under the watch of the Government, Sligo General Hospital will not have the resources to provide these critical services.  Oncology and palliative care services at the hospital, under Mr. Merton and his team, provide an outstanding facility.  Decisions will have to be made on this in light of the colorectal cancer screening programme.  It is very important that the matter be addressed in a clear manner.To date, budgetary constraints imposed on the hospital have resulted in a reduction of the orthopaedic bed capacity to 24 beds.  In the past 12 months a reduction of 72 beds has taken place in medical, paediatric, orthopaedic and surgical wards.  This reduction does not take into account the proposed further €12 million cutback.  The hospital simply cannot operate under such conditions.  The critical services it provides to so many people across the wide geographical region it serves will be severely restricted.Next week there will be an opportunity for Deputies Scanlon and Devins, the latter a doctor and former Minister of State, to vote against the Government unless they receive assurances that further attempts to curtail Sligo Hospital services, especially in the areas I mentioned, will not take place.  One may consider the entire cancer strategy and the issue of the four centres of excellence in Dublin.  However, to the dismay of many people, there are cutbacks in the north west region especially with the removal of essential services such as surgical and mammographic facilities.  There will be the impact of further curtailment imposed by budgetary cutbacks.  I have met the hospital management and seen the commitment of the 1,400 staff in carrying out an outstanding service.  Even the emergency facility at the hospital has been curtailed, as has facilitation of services for many people who are referred there.  Cutbacks have been immense.The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 provides for the dissolution of St. Luke's and the transfer of its employees and their abilities to the Health Services Executive.  This arises from the national plan for radiation oncology under which there will be four radiation oncology centres, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, with two satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick.  The Bill also provides for the amendment of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, the Health Act 2000, the Medical Practitioners Act 2000 and the Nursing Home Support Scheme.  It also repeals section 44 of the Health Act 1947 and section 36(2) of the Health Act 1953.This debate draws together a wide range of information from the Department of Health and Children, National Cancer Registry Ireland and St. Luke's Hospital.  It is comprehensive legislation.  The most important aspect is the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland, on which there is a critical mission statement.  When one considers the statistics on the incidence of cancer in Ireland, it is frightening to think that the disease will increase dramatically over the next number of years.  With that level of development and the roll-out of services in the country it is extraordinary there is little or no facilitation of services in the north west.  The roll-out of services in a fair and equitable manner is not served by the loss of those in the north west and west regions.For cancer patients, radiation therapy is critical.  It is not so long since there was a major campaign in the region for the facilitation of radiotherapy in the north west but now there is removal of the current services.  Although this is comprehensive legislation it is regrettable there is to be such a massive cutback, given the demographics of the region and the services provided by Sligo General Hospital for a population of 250,000.For every action there is a reaction.  The removal of the cancer surgical facility at the hospital more than a year ago has had a severe impact on other facilities at the hospital.  The threatened removal of coronary angiographic services at the hospital is frightening.  Lives will be lost if people are left with a three-week turnaround.  If they are referred by a general practitioner to a consultant at Sligo General Hospital they can have an angiogram or other services, as identified, but if they are to be referred to Dublin, with a consequent waiting time, that is frightening for coronary patients with threatened heart attacks.I am delighted to speak on this very important Bill.  Enough is enough when it comes to critical and outreach services, the ambulance service and the size of the vast region covered by Sligo General Hospital, the main hospital in the region, serving 250,000 people.  It does not compete with any other hospital and provides an opportunity for cross-Border care with Northern Ireland.  That has been discussed but is very much a long-term plan of investment in connection with Fermanagh Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.  The big disappointment would be curtailment at the hospital which is the backbone of the north-west region.  This is why people pay their taxes.  They expect to have a service and be able to support the 1,400 staff who work at Sligo General Hospital.  One must recognise the outstanding commitment of the doctors, nurses and all supporting staff of the hospital who are totally committed, as I know from visiting the hospital.Given the statistics on incidence of cancer in Ireland and projections for the future the situation is frightening.  As Deputy Ring stated, cancer affects every family.  This is frightening but it is reassuring to know that if the disease is diagnosed at the initial stages and correctly treated people can make a very good recovery.  It is very important that all the concerns of people be heard.  They do not want to have to go to the hospital in Galway to be diagnosed.  That is where the mammographic service is but there is difficulty getting into University Hospital Galway because it is over-pressurised and its budgets are being curtailed.  There is only one surgical bed for the north-west region at that hospital although the Minister, Deputy Harney, stated there would be two.I hope my two Oireachtas colleagues are listening to this debate which is very important.  I appreciate the tolerance of the Acting Chairman.  This has been one of the most important issues in the region for some time and is a cause of concern for everybody.  While I recognise the importance of ensuring value for money and increasing efficiency in the delivery of services, a curtailment of €12 million, followed by a second budgetary cutback of an additional €12 million, is difficult to bear.  Although the overall budget for Sligo General Hospital is €100 million, without taking account of the additional reduction of €12 million, that includes staffing costs for 1,400 personnel as well as the cost of maintaining critical services.The threatened curtailment of services at Sligo General Hospital has not been adequately debated in the public domain, particularly in the case of cardiological and angiographic services.  Up to now the hospital has managed a three-week patient turnaround.  Under the cutback proposals, however, cardiological and angiographic patients will have to be referred to St. James's Hospital in Dublin, with associated waiting times of up to six months instead of three weeks.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter serious consideration as what is proposed is a frightening prospect.  The wonderful team being led by Dr. Donal Murray has been doing excellent work and the coronary care facilities are the best in the country.It is bad enough to see the removal of cancer services; it is time now to say that enough is enough.  People in the region will not tolerate any more curtailment of critical services.  Everybody understands the importance of careful management of financial resources.  The hospital is adamant about giving value for money but there is only so much curtailment it can endure.  I appeal to my Oireachtas colleagues who are outside the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and have power to influence this issue.  All they have to do is to inform the Taoiseach that their support is conditional on this situation being rectified.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	77	This Bill provides for the dissolution of the board of St. Luke's Hospital and the transfer of its employees, assets and liabilities to the Health Service Executive.  The dissolution arises from the national plan for radiation oncology under which there are to be four radiation oncology centres, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, and two satellite centres in Waterford and Limerick.  The Bill affords us an opportunity to discuss not only the dissolution of St. Luke's Hospital board but also to examine services throughout the State, including in Members' own areas.I join with previous speakers in recognising the work that was carried out in St. Luke's Hospital over the years.  We have all had occasion to visit patients there — in some cases, family members — and we all found it an example of how hospitals should be run.  Patients suffering from cancer experience various stages of trauma during their treatment and these are trying times for them and their families.  St. Luke's Hospital catered for such patients in a sensitive way.  The dietetics department in the hospital has built up expertise in the area of diet and its relation to cancer treatment.  I acknowledge in particular the work of Eimear Finn, head of the dietetics department, as well as the senior dietician, Catherine O'Connor, who is from north Kerry and over whom I had some influence in directing her towards dietetics through Listowel food fair.  They have built up an excellent department and I hope their expertise will be utilised in Beaumont and St. James's hospitals.  As I understand it, services will remain at St. Luke's Hospital until 2011, while phase two will be confined to Beaumont and St. James's hospitals.In the debate pack supplied by the Oireachtas Library & Research Service, reference is made to a report on the development of radiation oncology services.  In referring to the existing and short-term plan, it is noted that the increase in treatment capacity within the State is "significantly below" the equivalent guidelines recommended by international agencies and authorities in other western countries.  It goes on to say that during the late 1990s and early 2000s, major investment in new and replacement clinical treatment services took place in Dublin and Galway while, during the same period, a more limited investment programme in replacement equipment took place in Cork.  The service may have improved since that report was published.  It is also noted in the information pack that the current utilisation of radiation therapy for various common adult cancers, as indicated by comparable data, appears "considerably less" than in several European Union countries and in North America.  As regards patient case load analysis and projections to 2015, we are told that the total number of new cancer cases is increasing annually, with some of that increase a consequence of growth in the population and a significant element of it attributable to our aging population.  I will come back to that later.We have seen, therefore, that while our services have improved considerably, they are not comparable to those of our neighbours in Northern Ireland, the rest of Europe and elsewhere in the developed world, including North America and Canada.  Nevertheless, according to data from the national cancer control programme, published this year, survival rates for almost all types of cancer improved for people diagnosed between 2000 and 2004 compared with those diagnosed between 1994 and 1999.  We all know of people who have survived cancer following treatment.  It is critical that once people are diagnosed, they receive treatment without delay.  Unfortunately, however, that is not the case even for patients with private health insurance.  Lives have been lost because people have not been diagnosed and treated in time.  The value of screening and early detection is that they help to save lives.  As other Deputies said, it is vital that people are encouraged to monitor their health on an ongoing basis and to have check-ups on an annual or six-monthly basis.  Sometimes people do not recognise or act upon symptoms of cancer, diabetes or other diseases.  Early detection is vital in all such cases.Ireland is on a par with Europe and the United States in terms of survival rates for children diagnosed with cancer.  We have made remarkable progress in this area and young children's lives have been saved as a consequence of early intervention and treatment.  Approximately 22,500 new cases of invasive cancer are diagnosed every year.  The current trend indicates that the number of cancers diagnosed each year is likely to double in the next 20 years.  This will impose a significant burden on our health budget which currently is 12% of GNP and is primarily funded by the taxpayer.  The financing of services will be a major challenge in the future, as we will have an ageing population and there will be more detection of cancers.I commend the excellent cancer screening programme in Kerry General Hospital.  However, people bought into the centre of excellence in Cork on the promise that services would be provided locally.  These are being put in place, albeit rather behind schedule.  Politicians should support these services.  I hope that women in Kerry will not be disadvantaged because of the change in services which means they will have to travel to Cork for major surgery with follow-up chemotherapy treatment in Tralee.  The jury is still out and some people are rather concerned, including doctors, that this system may not work.  However, we must ensure it will work.Cancer screening for women in Kerry commenced in April 2009, in the grounds of Kerry community services headquarters in Rathass.  Women living in the greater south Kerry area, including Tralee, Ventry, Dingle and Listowel, were invited for screening in Tralee.  The initial take-up was low because, for whatever reason, women were not encouraged or were discouraged to avail of the service.  However, the numbers have increased considerably.The statistics on cancer screening should be readily available, such as the numbers of women availing of the service, but, apparently, this is not the case.  In preparation for this debate, I looked for statistics on the number of women who availed of the BreastCheck service in Tralee.  This information was not available.  The free mammogram service for women aged between 50 and 64 years, will be carried out every two years on an area basis.  I suggest this service should be expanded.  Cancers can be detected by screening in GP surgeries and in hospitals such as the Bon Secours Hospital in Kerry.  However, it is crucial that all women carry out a personal breast check on a regular basis to ensure they have not developed cancer.  Lumps in the breast are common and they may not always be cancerous but it is very important to have these diagnostic services available and women should be encouraged to use them.  Approximately 13,000 women between 50 and 64 years live in County Kerry and these will be invited to avail of BreastCheck which will remain in County Kerry until all eligible women have been offered an appointment.The most recent statistics available for 2008 and early 2009 show that 92,061 people were screened by BreastCheck and 672 cancers were detected.  This means a large number of people were saved.  Screening for cervical cancer seems to be working very well.  This is available for women between the ages of 25 and 44.I have an interest in screening for colorectal cancer.  Anyone whose parents died from colorectal cancer or stomach or bowel cancer, should be screened regularly.  It is obvious that this cancer is genetically transmitted from one generation to another.The Minister announced last December the NCSS would proceed with preparations for the national colorectal cancer screening programme for men and women aged 55 to 74 years and that preparatory work is well under way.  However, this will not happen until 2012.  Deputy James Reilly referred to this programme in his contribution.  It is hoped this programme will not be postponed beyond 2012 but there is no reason it could not have been put in place in 2011.  The earlier, the better as more lives will be saved.Colonoscopy can be carried out as an outpatient service and people should be encouraged to avail of this service.  Early detection can save lives.  We all know of people who went in for a routine check-up and discovered they were in the early stages of cancer of the bowel.  Procedures and treatment can commence immediately and this means a colostomy bag is not required afterwards.  Early intervention means that people can live for years.I refer to the National Cancer Registry of Ireland which last 23 December published an atlas of cancer incidence.  This was not a very auspicious publication date for receiving publicity.  It outlined the geographical status of cancer sufferers across the country.  It showed that poorer areas are more likely to record higher incidences of the disease than other areas.  For example, poorer rural and urban areas have higher incidences than other areas.  This is a very important fact.      A Combat Poverty report showed the two counties with the least income per capita were Donegal and Kerry.  A National Cancer Registry report mapped where the sufferers of specific cancers were located across the country and those diagnosed with the disease between 1994 to 2003.  It found that socio-economic factors such as high deprivation levels as well as population density often correlated with higher levels of particular cancer diagnoses.The report also claimed:Some geographical variation in cancer incidence may be due to differences in health awareness, in participation in screening, or in access to cancer services.  However, it is generally accepted that it is predominantly the result of differences in well-known risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, obesity, diet and sexual behaviour.The report provided a breakdown of where particular forms of the disease are found across the country.  Breast cancer, for example, showed little variation in the location of sufferers across Ireland but the highest density cases were found in west Cork, north Kerry and the east midlands.  This is why north Kerry should be singled out for special treatment with more awareness campaigns for breast cancer screening.When general cancer treatment services were moved from Kerry General Hospital, Tralee, a commitment was made for a digital mammography unit to be established there.  While it took some time for the unit to be provided, it will be opened on 14 June and will allow follow-up treatment for treatment done in Cork.Every year 200 people die from cancer caused by radon gas.  This is an area that must be examined more seriously.The country faces major challenges in the delivery of health services, particularly cancer treatment.  The annual health care budget is €19 billion of which the Government contributes €14 billion and the outstanding €5 billion has to be borrowed.  Prevention of ill health will become an important element of health strategy.  Between now and 2033, the overall number of invasive cancers is projected to increase annually by 6% for females and 8% for males.  Early intervention, improved diagnostics and immediate treatment will reduce the cancer casualty rate.  However, we must be far more aware of ways of preventing the disease too.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I regret provision is being made to dissolve the board of St. Luke's Hospital.  While we are told this will lead to improved access and outcomes for cancer patients in the new cancer treatment strategy, it has always been acknowledged St. Luke's staff, both clinical and non-clinical, provided excellent care to their patients.  All patients who attended the hospital from around the country were always afforded the greatest care possible.  My regret is the HSE will now include the hospital in a network of cancer care centres with the two Dublin centres of excellence located in Beaumont and St. James's hospitals.While many of these centres of excellence have only started to operate recently, the experience so far has not been satisfactory.  For example, in Galway's centre of excellence based at University College Hospital, Galway any claim we have better access and outcomes resulting in better cancer care would have to be examined thoroughly.  One would get fantastic treatment if one got access to the services.  However, the provision of extra staff and beds has not happened in Galway.  Members from Sligo and Mayo have raised the problems their constituents have in gaining access to services at Galway as a result of this lack of provision.  It is claimed the Irish scheme follows international best practice.  If the Government believes it has established centres of excellence by putting a brand on a hospital, it should think again.I know of a person who was diagnosed with cancer three years ago.  He has had to repeatedly enter University College Hospital, Galway for treatment.  Each time he must go through the accident and emergency department and give all his personal and medical details on each occasion.  There is something wrong in a centre of excellence maintaining such a cumbersome delaying tactic.  Neither is it acceptable that this person, suffering from cancer and who has been treated in the same hospital, must wait six hours in the accident and emergency department for attention.  One must query any claim this is a centre of excellence.  While the treatment and personnel are first class, the problem is getting access to the services.  This is not isolated to Galway but is happening in the other centres of excellence across the country.  That is what is taking place there and it is not an isolated incident.  It takes place on a constant basis.  The management must be restructured or the centre of excellence for cancer care must be streamlined in some way and focused directly on access rather than having to go through the accident and emergency department, which is unnecessary and creates repetition.  If one queries why this procedure is necessary, one is informed in no uncertain terms that the routine in place applies and that is it.  It is an obvious waste of time, manpower and effort and it is costly and painful for the patients who must wait and go through that torture.The report indicated that on average some 23,000 people in Ireland suffer from cancer annually.  They must be treated.  We are informed that figure will double between now and 2020.  We have identified only four centres of excellence and we are dismantling the other centres that were in place.  It is unfair that established treatment centres in other parts of the country should be dismantled on a regional basis.  Dismantling those centres and directing people to the major centres is unfortunate and represents short-term thinking.  Let us consider the far end of Donegal or, as Deputy Deenihan remarked, County Kerry.  Such geographical situations must be considered.  We have broken up a network that could have been developed.  Much of the trauma with regard to access at present would not exist had we continued on the existing basis.  For this reason, I regret that St. Luke's is being brought into the network.  It has been recognised by the Minister and the Department that the personnel relocated under the reconfiguration play a pivotal role in the continuation of services, which is important.  The personnel in St. Luke's have a pivotal role in the new structures.I refer to the centres of excellence to be established and how they should be defined.  The term should not refer to a physical building, but should represent the people and personnel involved.  In her identification of the centres of excellence, the Minister should have given consideration to the fact that the label should be earned, not simply applied.  If people were in competition to earn that label, there would be a far better delivery of service to many patients throughout the country.Any discussion of cancer and cancer centres must include a mention of Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  I refer to the centre in Crumlin under the direction of Mr. Finn Breathnach.  The Minister and the Government have repeatedly starved that centre of excellence.  The term or classification "excellence" was earned by the centre because of its commitment to the treatment of children.  Although Mr. Finn Breathnach and many of his colleagues have indicated the importance and potential of Crumlin as a children's hospital, all their experience and requests were ignored by the Minister when she reconfigured children's hospitals and under what she is proposing to do now.  That was regrettable.  I am aware of the service that has been provided from first-hand experience and from being involved in Crumlin hospital for six years.  Thankfully, the outcome was 100%.  I refer to the dedication of the staff there led by Mr. Finn Breathnach.  It is a pity and regrettable for the many people who will have to attend there on an ongoing basis that he has retired.  However, he continues his commitment to the treatment of children's cancer at the Robertstown centre.  As he had done at all times in Crumlin, he continues to deliver the absolute dedication and care needed for the treatment of children with cancer.Parents fundraised on a national basis to make good the deficit and to provide reasonable conditions in Crumlin hospital.  This was ignored by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers with responsibility for health during the past ten or 20 years.  The hospital received only a paltry subvention from Government, far short of what was necessary because the Government and the Ministers were aware that the parents had a commitment to that hospital and that they would raise funds.  Many individuals including sporting individuals and others in society have given commitments to raise funds for that hospital.  It is regrettable that we are demolishing what was and is a first class service and would continue to be were it allowed and supported by the Minister and the Government of the day.Regarding the HSE moving in and taking over an institution or a hospital, the hospital nearest to me is the Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe which has lost its cancer treatment facility.  It was taken over some six or eight years ago.  In the meantime, it has been stifled of funding and personnel because of Government policy.  We are waiting for the appointment of two consultants at present.  Senior medical people have referred to the dangers in the accident and emergency department in some hospitals such as Portiuncula hospital because of the lack of consultants.  This is ironic given the controversy of recent days involving a mother who went to the centre of excellence in Galway and was misdiagnosed there.  Eventually, following advice from a friend she was referred to the maternity services in Portiuncula.  There, thankfully, her condition was confirmed and we are all aware of the outcome in this regard from the media reports of recent days.When discussing centres of excellence we should consider the record of the very large centres.  They have lost contact with patients.  Patients are no longer individual people; they become numbers and statistics, which is regrettable.  Report after report from the HSE refers to statistics.  They do not refer to people as such or as patients or to their outcomes.  Until a change comes about in the statistical delivery of health services and until we return to the idea that people and patients are important, the HSE is on a wrong course.  Unfortunately and tragically, many cases will be affected by this approach.Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe has been starved of support by the Government and the HSE.  I refer to one simple example of what is taking place.  We are informed that, as of last month, the hospital must save €1 million each month.  Even at this, the hospital will have a deficit at the end of the year.I refer to a previous provision of the Minister.  If one goes to a general practitioner, one pays him or her €50 while the statutory fee in a hospital is €100.  The general practitioner might do nothing other than refer the patient to the hospital but the hospital will lose the €100 even though it does the work, which might be expensive.It is important that anomaly is rectified.  Hospitals, such as Portiuncula  Hospital, are losing scarce resources because of this anomaly.  We hear much about the out-of-hours service, including West Doc and all the other doc services.  The same is happening there.  A patient goes to the out-of-hours service but nothing is done there and the patient is referred to the hospital.  Once the patient produces a receipt showing he or she paid the general practitioner, the hospital will lose out on the €100 statutory fee.  Perhaps the Minister will look into that anomaly.  If €50 is paid to the general practitioner, the other €50 should be paid to the hospital for the work it carries out.Each year 23,000 patients seek cancer treatment and that figure will probably double.  The strategy in place must be revised.  We must reconsider the decision to close centres against the people's wishes.  It is regrettable that we have taken a short term view which will have to be reassessed in the near future in order to cater for the numbers.  The downgrading of the oncology section in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, St. Luke's Hospital and the hospitals in Sligo and Mayo and elsewhere is short-sighted.  If we are following this international model, which has been referred to, in regard to this reconfiguration, we are overlooking so many factors which are important for the delivery of a proper cancer service.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am glad to speak on this Bill and wish to preface my remarks by saying that 15 years ago, I had first-hand experience of St. Luke's Hospital as an outpatient.  While I was not being treated for cancer, I got a good insight into the role of, and the atmosphere in, the hospital.  The first time I was scheduled to go to the hospital I went with a certain amount of trepidation about what St. Luke's Hospital was but as I became more familiar with it, I realised what a wonderful facility it was and how lucky the people were to have a hospital run by a board of directors and with such an ethos and governance structure.The hospital was established by the Cancer Association of Ireland with a view to taking care of people with cancer and engaging in cancer research and awareness.   It has developed from that to being recognised as the prime centre for cancer care for the country.  As recently as 2008, there has been significant investment in new and replacement linear radiotherapy units.  The suspicion was that when St. Anne's and St. Luke's hospitals were merged, there was an exit plan which would result in St. Luke's Hospital being amalgamated into St. Vincent's University Hospital in Elm Park.  That has probably changed now with the plan that it will be amalgamated into St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.It is difficult to understand why we are trying to transfer the assets, staff and governance of an area of the health service which is working excellently — I have never heard anyone criticise St. Luke's Hospital — to the HSE, an organisation which has all sorts of problems.  That is ironic on the day when a headline reads that the HSE would be better without an arm of responsibility.  Child care and child welfare may not be directly associated with health care in the same way as cancer care but it is ironic that we are looking to transfer a significant piece of cancer care into the arms of the HSE.  It reminds me of the plans for the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  Given that Dundrum and Rathgar are two leafy suburbs and that the real estate of the Central Mental Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital is very valuable, one would have to be suspicious that there is an attempt to relocate both institutions and capitalise on the assets.That in 2008 St. Luke's Hospital was upgraded and given the most modern facilities in the country when money was probably not as plentiful as it had been is a recognition of its role.  It is nice to know that St. Luke's Hospital will remain there until 2014 but one must ask what its future is after that.  What is the plan?  Will it continue until then with its current ethos?  Will it be governed centrally by the HSE cancer care service?  I wish the new director of cancer care and the incoming chief executive officer of the HSE the very best.I was chairman of the former East Coast Area Health Board at the time of the dissolution of the old health boards and I always opposed the manner in which it was done.  I agreed that the health boards needed to be reformed but believed that the model whereby the former Eastern Health Board became the Eastern Regional Health Authority with three area boards probably should have been replicated throughout the country.  At least primary care could be governed locally while many aspects of the roll out of health care and the management of the health service could have been governed centrally, although not all of them.  The chickens are coming home to roost in that regard.  Inevitably when the review of the HSE comes to a conclusion, it will revert to four or six regional boards of administration with a central authority for payroll, quality, etc.Like other speakers, I will mention my constituency of Wicklow which does not have a hospital.  St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, which is very close to the Wicklow border, serves Wicklow but it has not been upgraded in the manner in which Naas and Blanchardstown hospitals have been.  Mental health services are delivered from Newcastle hospital but it has been starved of funding and resources.  There was a comprehensive plan for both hospitals but it was never progressed.  That would possibly have meant the provision of a new facility on the grounds of Newcastle hospital which would have incorporated mental health services, some general hospital facilities and perhaps a dedicated Alzheimer's unit which was identified for it.  None of that has happened.  The affordability of all this now comes into question but for many years the plan was in abeyance and nobody considered it.I will not speak for much longer other than to say that I understand the miscellaneous provisions of the Bill and I have no problem with them.  Deputy Ulick Burke mentioned Crumlin hospital.  When a service is working, why should it be changed?  The approach being taken is to ensure all the boxes are ticked in regard to service provision, which should be consolidated into a centralised service provided by the HSE.  Can the Minister of State honestly say that the service being delivered in St. Luke's will be improved when it is moved?  I do not believe the service being delivered in St. Luke's can be delivered better anywhere else under any authority or structure.  The model of service delivery in St. Luke's is as good a model as one could find.  Rather than taking St. Luke's out of the system, we should consider replicating that model throughout the country.  The service delivered in St. Luke's has stood the test of time.  That hospital was established 56 years ago and it has developed as needs required over that time.  Money has been invested in it.  It has an excellent team of surgeons, consultants and medical care staff and other staff.I ask that this Bill be reviewed and rejected, and that people examine and concentrate on the services within the HSE that need to be improved.  Under the cancer review that took place and the rollout of cancer services in the eight centres of excellence throughout the country, four of which are in Dublin and four are outside it, the working group recommended that there should be no fewer than eight and possibly ten such centres.  A centre of excellence should have been provided in the north west to allow people from that region to have logistical access to cancer treatment services relatively nearby and even at that many people would have to travel quite a distance.  It makes no sense to have no centre of excellence north of the line from Dublin to Galway.  The cost of establishing one further centre would not have been exorbitant and would probably have involved very little additional cost.I urge the Government to consider this Bill.  I am aware the Minister of State, at a personal level, knows the workings of St. Luke's quite well.  I ask that he consider the matters that have been raised by the Opposition.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I thank Deputies for their participation in the debate.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give further effect to the Government's cancer control strategy and, in particular, the development of radiation oncology services under the national plan for radiation oncology.  It also provides for the discontinuance of the infectious diseases maintenance allowance, which was originally introduced in 1947.  The Bill makes technical amendments to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 and the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 to assist in the interpretation of these Acts.  It also makes a technical amendment to the Health Act 2007, which relates to decisions taken under section 55 of the Act.  It also makes textual amendments to the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to correct typographical errors.It is clear that if appropriate radiation oncology facilities are not available to meet the need for these services, then outcomes for cancer patients, including survival rates and quality of life, may be seriously compromised.  By the beginning of 2011 with the establishment of St. Luke's network with radiation oncology services at St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital, the number of linear accelerators will increase from the current number, which is eight in St. Luke's, to 12 in the network.  High quality radiotherapy services will be delivered in an integrated fashion across the three sites in Dublin by the network, which will report to the director of the national cancer control programme.The Hollywood report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland noted that optimal treatment outcomes are achieved through the close co-ordination of radiation oncology, surgical oncology, medical oncology and palliative care services.  Effective treatment for patients will often require the different treatment modalities to be combined at the same time or at different stages during the management of illness.  Single modality radiation therapy is curative in certain situations, however, combined modality treatment uses radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy surgery and other treatments.  In advanced cancers and in conjunction with palliative care, palliative radiation therapy often offers quick and effective relief from pain and other difficult symptoms.  It is therefore essential that radiation oncology services and expertise operate side by side with surgical and medical oncology and palliative services.  The integration of these services provided at designated centres under the programme should result in best outcomes for patients.As the Minister has stated, St. Luke's will continue to provide radiotherapy services until at least 2014.  She looks forward to receiving proposals from the friends of St. Luke's and board on possible future uses for the hospital.  She has previously stated that she believes St. Luke's has a future within the public health service and has indicated that she will consult the friends, the HSE and other interested parties on how the site could best be used for the benefit of patients in the future.During the debate on this Bill Deputy Reilly requested a briefing on the national plan for radiotherapy.  The current Bill relates to a significant element of phase one of the plan whereby adequate radiotherapy capacity will be available up to 2015 with the development of the radiation oncology centres at St. James Hospital and Beaumont Hospital.  Phase two involves further expansion at these hospitals and also at Cork University Hospital and Galway University Hospital and the development of satellite facilities at Limerick and Waterford hospitals.  The Minister will shortly brief Government on the public sector benchmark for this phase, which will be delivered by public-private partnership.In regard to comments made by Deputy Ó Caoláin regarding patients in the north west, the Minister is awaiting approval of the business case for new radiation oncology facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital by Minister McGimpsey in Northern Ireland.  She has agreed to make a capital contribution to the project, which will address the needs of patients in the north west and significantly improve access and travel time for patients.  Approximately 30% of patients will be from the Donegal area.St. Luke's network model will provide a single clinical governance and management structure across the eastern region and will allow for the most efficient use of resources to deliver a service to patients in line with best international standards.  Because staff at St. Luke's will become HSE staff on the enactment of this Bill, they will be able to work across the other hospitals in the network under this single governance structure.  This enables the new facilities at St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital to tap into and emulate the successful patient centred model that St. Luke's represents.  At many Deputies have stressed throughout this debate, a key aim is to ensure that the ethos and spirit of St. Luke's pervade into the broader St. Luke's network.While St. Luke's site will be transferred to the HSE, under the legislation the HSE will not be able to sell or dispose of the land without the permission of the Minister for Health and Children.  That was a concern raised by one of the Deputies.I thank Deputies again for their contribution.  The Minister looks forward to the further Stages of this Bill at which time the views put forward will be considered in detail.  I therefore commend this Bill to the House.

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	86	During my previous contribution when the debate on the Bill was adjourned some two or three weeks ago I made the point that we cannot discuss the issue of begging and putting in place controls to tackle this problem without mentioning why people find themselves in the position that they have to beg.  I acknowledge there can be many cases of organised begging, which is unacceptable.  I hope this legalisation will give the gardaí powers to act in those circumstances.  The Garda welcome this Bill because up to now there was a vacuum in terms of legislative provision which had made it difficult for them to tackle the problem of organised begging.  We cannot ignore the fact that many people who are homeless find that they are forced to beg for many reasons.  The obvious comment about such begging is that people are entitled to contributions from the State, be it jobseeker's allowance, disability benefit or rent allowance, but many people do not have an address whereby they can claim allowances.    We are all aware of homeless accommodation units in our constituencies where organisations, in particular, the Simon Community and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, provide valuable support to those who are homeless.  They are active in my constituency and they do excellent work in providing emergency shelter to people who find themselves for whatever reason without an address or a roof over their heads.The Simon Community provides a particular range of services for those who are experiencing drink or drug-related issues.  Its administrators recognise that strict criteria cannot be observed at all times.  For safety reasons, most hostels do not allow people to access their services if they have been drinking and they are not allowed to bring alcohol onto the premises.  The Simon Community, however, goes a step further.  The organisation had a long struggle a number of years ago to establish a wet shelter, which males and females can access if they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs.  That must be commended in the context of tackling homelessness because some people on the streets cannot access the services they need to support them, particularly if they have health issues.  The services provided by the Simon Community and other organisations are invaluable and they must be supported in order that the homeless can access health professionals or have an opportunity to have a shower and tend to other health needs aside from the drink or drug-related issues they may have.  These services are important.A balance needs to be struck and the message must go out, as previous speakers said, that the legislation will not clamp down on begging completely, regardless of the circumstances or the issues affecting those engaged in it.  Section 1 recognises that begging is legal if it is not accompanied by aggravating factors and this is an important statement.  If a beggar is found guilty of harassment, obstruction or intimidation, he or she can be fined €400 or imprisoned for up to a month.The Bill also allows the Garda to intervene in the interest of public order and the safety or other people and property and move a beggar on.  This is particularly relevant around ATMs or outside the entrance to business premises.  The Garda will have powers to move people on if they are within 10 m of an entrance and they will not have to demonstrate harassment or aggravating factors under those circumstances.  I was walking along a high street the other day and there was a shop entrance every 10 m.  If gardaí become over zealous, they could clear a street completely of beggars but we are not overrun by beggars.  It has always been part of our culture, as beggars looked for support and for alms.  People give generously and I hope the Garda's powers in this regard are not used too extensively and the provisions will be implemented in such a way that people can offer a contribution or a service in return for alms.  A balance needs to be struck and we should not go over the top.Tourism and business interests have welcomed the Bill because they are concerned about the intimidation of their customers and the impact begging may have on them where it is a problem.  The Dublin tourist authority states tourists are often intimidated by the volume of beggars.  I am not aware that there is a huge number of beggars in the greater Dublin area.  I have read tourism reports and I have attended many Fáilte Ireland briefings and receptions but I have never heard that begging was an issue and that the number of beggars turns tourists off.  Begging and people looking for contributions are part and parcel of city life.  This is how society deals with those who are homeless and who are forced to beg.  That is how I would judge any society.Given the current downturn, more people will be forced to beg.  I welcome the provision that allows gardaí to deal with organised begging and beggars who harass the public and I hope the Bill will be implemented in a balanced manner in order that busking and other services provided on the street, which are part and parcel of what we are, will not be affected.  The legislation has highlighted that some people are forced to beg, as previous speakers said, because of the difficulty they have accessing services and this is positive.  I look forward to the Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I wish to share time with Deputy Johnny Brady.I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I congratulate the Minister on the timely introduction of this legislation.  Many of us have received representations from constituents who felt intimidated by beggars.  The legislation replaces the old regime, which criminalised all forms of begging.  I am happy it only seeks to make it unlawful for those who engage in any form of intimidation or harassment because, unfortunately, this happens.  A High Court judgment led to the introduction of the Bill after it found section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act 1847 to be unconstitutional.The legislation recognises the current position.  Unfortunately, people in our society have to resort to begging.  The Minister is trying to ensure begging accompanied by aggression and intimidation will be outlawed.  I have met people who have felt intimidated by beggars approaching them as they exit banks or shops or as they use ATMs.  Gardaí should have the right to move people on and the legislation will provide that they will have the right to ask anyone begging within 10 m of a business premises or a home to move on and if they do not, they can prosecute them.People are exploited every day.  As drivers pull up at traffic lights, they are approached by people who knock on their windows.  Female constituents of mine find that intimidating.  I suspect some of those involved are part of an organised begging ring.  In my opinion the people doing the collecting are probably not the beneficiaries of any money they might receive and it is going to these begging ring lords.I drive through Westland Row every day, and every morning, at 7.30 a.m., as I drive by I see a young man in bare feet.  I ask myself each time I see him whether he is a victim of one of these begging rings or if he is so unfortunate that he has to resort to that.  He is consistently in bare feet, probably underdressed as well in all types of weather.  I hate to believe that this poor unfortunate fellow is being forced by some begging ring to be out there in winter, spring or summer, at 7.30 in the morning when I see him.I certainly believe this Bill will protect those unfortunates who, for one reason or another, seem to have to resort to begging.  I was in town doing a radio interview one Saturday morning some weeks ago when I came across a young girl in her late teens.  I stopped and talked to her, to inquire what her circumstances were and find out why she saw fit to beg.  I offered her breakfast, but she did not want that.  She wanted money because she was effectively collecting €40 every day so that she could stay in a guest house, as distinct from the State-sponsored bread and breakfast facilities, because she felt unsafe in them.  Once she had achieved her target of €40 she moved on and was quite happy.That girl is quite articulate and intelligent.  She left home because she says her step-father was abusing her.  I asked her whether she would not go to the Garda and she said she would not on the basis that her mother loved this man, and she did not want to cause her any trouble.  I do not believe this proposed legislation in any way affects those types of situations and I sincerely hope that it will not.  This young girl told me that she had quite a good relationship with the gardaí, who all knew her circumstances and were quite happy to let her stay in position on Molesworth Street.It is important, too, that charity collectors are allowed to continue with the great work they do.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in launching the Bill emphasised that all charity collections would continue and noted that they were already covered under the various Charities Acts, such as the one introduced last year.  That is very important, because the Irish people have a great record in terms of supporting different charities that organise collections from time to time.I am happy to support this Bill, which I believe reflects the attitude that people now take to most begging.  They are quite happy to support it, but have grave difficulties with organised groups or individuals who resort to intimidatory and often threatening behaviour.  I do not believe any citizen going about his or her daily business should have to encounter that, and the Garda should have the powers to ask such people to move on.In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to all the voluntary groups.  When I was talking to that young girl, Mary, in Molesworth Street a couple of weeks ago, she mentioned that quite a number of agencies actually supported her, such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society and  the Simon Community.  A group from the North actually comes down and is supplying material goods to these unfortunate people.  The soup runs at night, too, effectively give great support to the groups.I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute and I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I welcome this Bill and indeed would like to be associated with other speakers in complimenting the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern on bringing it forward.We all know that the incidence of begging has increased enormously across the country.  People say the reason is the downturn in the economy, but it has been evident in this city in both good and bad times.  There were as many people begging in the capital and in the towns and villages in the good times, just as they are today, for whatever reasons.People can be very critical and formerly it was said that it was always the Irish who were begging, homeless and so forth.  However, the number of foreign nationals begging on our streets has increased fourfold in recent times.  As my colleague talked about a girl he had come across here in Dublin, I recalled doing five or six runs around Merrion Park just before Christmas, in order to lose some weight.  I did not succeed too well, but in any event I did my best.  I saw four foreign nationals, three of whom had young babies in their arms, and they were begging to buy something for the children for Christmas.  As I went around they were still there.  When I had completed my rounds of the park I noticed that they were all in a group, having a chat, apparently dividing up the money.  To me they were not begging individually.  They seemed to be part of an organised group to beg on the streets.As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Michael Kennedy has said, one would love to buy a person a loaf of bread, breakfast, a carton of milk, bar of chocolate or whatever, but they do not want these.  I would be very concerned that they might be begging for drugs, given the problems we have here and in other countries in that regard.  That is something I would be very worried about.As the Acting Chairman and Deputy Clune have so rightly said, there are many organisations doing tremendous work for the homeless, such as St. Vincent de Paul which has a presence in so many parishes around the country.  There is also the Simon Community, although this perhaps does not have such a large presence in rural parts.  We met a group from the Minister's area, Dundalk, recently which had some concerns.  I know the Simon Community is in Navan, Dundalk and the larger towns, but the St. Vincent de Paul Society is doing tremendous work in the smaller towns and the rural areas for those types of people.I have had complaints from many elderly people about intimidation.  Often they are so keen to help people who are begging, as they emerge from the post office, the credit union or the bank, or are doing their shopping in the supermarket or local shop.  On some occasions when an elderly person takes out his or her wallet or purse to give something to a beggar, unfortunately somebody will grab it and run off with all the money.   This happens regularly, regardless of whether this is organised.  Although it may not be organised by those who are begging, people are watching out for such things and as soon as the elderly person takes out his or her purse, it is pinched and those responsible are gone.  This is something about which I am greatly concerned.While going through the Bill's provisions, I note that section 3 proposes a new power that would permit a member of the Garda Síochána to direct persons who are begging to desist and move on from some key locations, namely, from any point within 10 m of an ATM or a vending machine, an entrance to a dwelling or an entrance to a business premises that is open for trade or transaction with members of the public when the member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that due to the person's behaviour and the number of persons begging at or near those premises, members of the public are being or are likely to be deterred from entering the premises.I also ask the Minister to consider precluding begging from events such as people attending religious services.  This happens every Sunday and not only on Sunday.  I often go to a church that is not too far from Leinster House during the day, at which it is possible to light a candle or perhaps attend mass and so forth, and the number of people who are begging outside it is enormous.  At some churches, people can be seen begging both outside the gate and at the door.  This is highly unfair and I appeal to the Minister to examine this area.  I acknowledge that it is a public place within the grounds when people are attending a service.  I also appeal to the Minister to consider sporting events such as Gaelic, rugby and soccer matches, as well as concerts.  Perhaps on Committee Stage, when amendment are being made, he might include such events.  In addition, an enormous amount of begging takes place at train stations and bus stops and it is unfair to those who are waiting at such locations or who are attending their local church for Sunday or daily service or whatever.  The Minister should examine this issue.I again compliment all the voluntary people who do so much work for the vulnerable.  There is no need for much of the begging that takes place.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Kennedy, referred to being able to make €40 per day and that is a lot of money on top of one's social welfare benefits.  Many people in receipt of social welfare benefits today do not receive any hard cash into their pockets and I am sure all those involved in the activity under discussion also are in receipt of some form of social welfare.  I recently encountered a woman begging just down the street from Leinster House, who told me she was expecting a baby and had no money to visit the doctor.  While I am sure that women had a medical card, she still was begging and this certainly is highly unfair.As for fines, the Bill proposes that where begging is accompanied by threats, intimidation, violence or obstruction, an offence will carry a penalty of one month's imprisonment or a fine of €400.  I am unsure whether it ever would be possible to get €400 from some of those involved, the foreign nationals in particular, even were they brought before a judge.  On a few occasions, I have challenged people who were begging as to what they wanted the money for.  All they could say in response was that they could not speak English.  However, they had enough English to beg.  Consequently, it will be very difficult for the Garda Síochána to bring charges against many of those concerned.However, this Bill certainly constitutes a move in the right direction and I again compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on its introduction.  I again appeal to him to consider the inclusion on Committee Stage of those areas I suggested, such as church services, sports events, train stations, bus stops and so on.  I include taxi ranks as another area at which begging takes place.  I again thank the Minister.  I am sure this Bill will be enacted and hope it will improve matters.

Nílim ag cur ina choinne, ach tá fadhbanna agam maidir leis an treo a ghlacadh go dtí seo.  Tá súil agam, má fhaighim an deis freastal ar an gcoiste a bheidh ag déileáil leis, go mbeidh mé in ann roinnt leasuithe a chur a dhéileáilfidh leis na buarthaí atá orm agus ar dhaoine eile maidir leis an méid atá sa Bhille san iomlán.Tá, dar ndóigh, níos mó daoine ag lorg déirce sa chathair.  Glacaim ón méid a bhí le rá ag na Teachtaí a labhair romham go bhfuil seo fíor lasmuigh den chathair seo chomh maith.  Tá fáthanna leis sin.  Ceann de na fáthanna ná go bhfuilimid ar fad níos boichte ná mar a bhíomar cúpla bliain ó shin.  Fiú nuair a bhíomar ag barr ár réime le linn aimsir an Tíogair Cheiltigh, bhí líon mór daoine gafa ag lorg déirce ar na sráideanna toisc go bhfuil ár sochaí míchothrom.  Bhí daoine ann le neart sealúchais agus flúirse airgid ach ag an am céanna bhí daoine ar leith gan pingin rua acu agus iad go minic gan dídean.  Tharla seo in ainneoin an fhlúirse airgid a bhí sa tír.Tá fadhb ann maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo a thabhairt isteach ag an am seo, mar go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó daoine thíos de bharr polasaithe an Rialtais le tamall de bhlianta anuas, an dhá bhliain deireanach ach go háirithe.  Tá na daoine seo anois ar an ghannchuid agus iad an-bhocht de thoradh na bpolasaithe a ghlacadh le tamall anuas agus de bharr go bhfuil an oiread sin d'airgead an phobail dírithe ar na banic agus NAMA in ionad a bheith dírithe ar dhéileáil le bun fadhbanna ár sochaí nó leis an gceist i dtaobh an fáth go bhfuil na daoine seo bocht sa chéad áit.  Feicimid agus feicfimid níos mó daoine bochta ag brath ar déirce de bharr na cinntí atá glactha ag an Rialtas agus de bharr an treo atá á thógaint aige.  Is cuma sa tsioc le haon duine atá thíos chomh mór sin an bhfuil sé nó sí ag briseadh an dlí nó nach bhfuil, mar chaithfear maireachtáil.  Tá cuid mhaith de na daoine a fheictear ag lorg déirce go mór in ísle brí mar go bhfuil siad ag brath ar an méid a bhfuil mise, aon Teachta nó éinne eile sásta a thabhairt dóibh.Is fearr liomsa i gcónaí airgead a thabhairt do charthanais seachas é a thabhairt dóibh siúd a bhíonn ag lorg déirce.  Ach le tamall de bhlianta anuas, is daoine gairmiúla iad na daoine a bhailíonn airgead do charthanais agus ní théann an t-airgead ar fad chuig an charthanas ach isteach i bpócaí gnónna atá eagraithe chun ach 10% nó 15% den airgead a bhailíonn siad a sheoladh ar aghaidh go dtí an carthanas.  Níor díríodh ar an gceist sin sa Bhille seo.  The Bill is a missed opportunity.  A regulatory impact assessment of the Bill asserts that it is "the only practicable solution to address the levels of anti-social begging activity".  In reality, it is not a solution at all.  The Bill addresses one part of the problem but it does not address a single one of the many complex causes which give rise to begging.My party's assessment is shared by many in the human rights, homelessness and poverty sector.  The Human Rights Commission held that the legislation will not provide "an effective or humane response to begging and will not be effective in addressing the root causes of begging".  The children's charity Barnardos argued that "the legislation alone will not address the problem of begging which stems from the societal failure to care and protect vulnerable people including children".  Focus Ireland, which works with the homeless, acknowledges the Bill does not re-criminalise begging per se but rather focuses on “aggressive begging”.  That reflects arguments made by many others in the sector who deal with those who end up in poverty, begging or are totally dependent on the State for care.  Similar arguments have been made by those who work with those who end up in prison, some of whom started off begging in the first place.  Focus Ireland also concluded that the Bill will not make any real difference or do any real good.  It is a poor message for any government to send out that it will provide for the imprisonment of those involved in begging while on the other hand it will not prosecute those who have screwed the nation of billions.The Bill provides for imprisonment of up to one month on summary conviction for the relevant offences.  Of all the potential responses available, the Government — surprise, surprise — chose to opt for prison.  Prison is the most expensive and least cost-effective response available.  The Government's regulatory impact assessment asserted that "the implementation of the legislative proposals is expected to give rise to only minimal, if any, additional costs".  However, it was also admitted in the assessment that the cost could rise to €1.5 million annually.  The average number of convictions in the past for begging amounted to 170 or 180 per annum.  The average cost to the public purse of a one month prison stay is more than €8,000.  On the basis of past average begging conviction rates, that approach will cost the taxpayer €1.4 million annually.An important question when considering legislation that could result in imprisonment is whether the money could and should be better spent.  I believe it could be better spent.  If we are genuinely committed to tackling begging, there are many better avenues through which this money could be spent.  The excellent Leanbh service is one such example.  Leanbh was established by the ISPCC in 1997 to address child begging in Dublin.  It offers an around the clock service to children, young people and parents who are begging or at risk of begging.  The ISPCC, like many other charities which provide vital services, has been hit by a fall in donations in the context of the recession.  In 2008, total State funding for the ISPCC amounted to €675,000.  That puts into context the money that could be required for the Prison Service following the enactment of the Bill.I encourage the Minister to discuss the Bill with the Minister for Finance and in the context of the imprisonment option to seek funding to assist the Leanbh service to expand to ensure an alternative option is available to imprisonment.  One could ask what sort of signal the Bill sends to all those who are down on their luck at the moment.  Once again, the Government is all about the big stick.  It is more interested in passing the legislation than sorting out the economic crisis which has led to many people ending up on the street.  The Government is forcing people into a situation where some will consider begging as the only option.Dole payments have been cut to unemployed young people, some of whom have large debts, including mortgages.  The sum of €100 a week will not go very far, which will force people to consider other options.  It is not as if they have the option of finding a job, as no jobs are available for the 500,000 people who are unemployed, especially those who are young and have limited literacy and no skills.  I urge the Minister to talk to the Minister for Social Protection to reconsider the ill-advised cut to the dole payments of young people under 22 years of age.  Many graduates who qualified in the past month are facing the dole although, when they started their courses of choice, jobs were available for engineers, electricians, teachers and many other professions but those jobs have now dried up.  Those graduates are languishing at home or considering the bád bán, the emigration boat.  Government policy is forcing people into a situation where they are living in poverty.Another area over which the Government has a degree of control is the habitual residency condition.  Destitution gives rise to begging and through its application of the habitual residency condition the Government has chosen to make people destitute.  An increasing number of constituents, including returned Irish citizens, have come to me detailing desperate scenarios of poverty and of being forced to sleep on floors in friends' houses or on the street.  All of them had applied for one form or another of social protection but were refused on the basis that they did not qualify under the habitual residency condition which is a requirement for even the most basic emergency welfare payments.  This condition, which in practice requires the applicant to be habitually resident in the State for two years in order to be eligible for State support, is making Irish citizens and others who are in this country destitute.The condition is being used in a blanket manner to exclude many from welfare support.  I have brought a number of cases to the attention of the Minister with little success to date.  I regret that the Minister has not been able to consider the cases personally and has used the cover of industrial action to avoid giving a reply.  By way of parliamentary question, I have asked the Minister to make changes to the habitual residency requirement because it is acting as a barrier for many returned Irish citizens to access the protections they need.  To justify the refusal, the Minister for Social Protection stated he is satisfied Irish nationals returning to live in Ireland on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the habitual residency condition.The Minister is totally out of touch.  We might give him some leeway as he is new to the job but the same attitude was demonstrated by the previous Minister and the officials making the determination.  There is no reason welfare should be refused to a constituent of mine on the grounds that he does not satisfy the habitual residency requirement because he was born and lived in Derry.  That Irishman has not left the island of Ireland for any length of time, yet he is deemed not to be habitually resident and is, therefore, denied social protection.  If it were not for the generosity of friends, he would be forced to beg.  Unless the condition is examined, a person such as him will end up on the street in the near future.Another case I am dealing with concerns a woman who is seriously at risk of becoming destitute.  She was refused the jobseeker's allowance on the basis that she has not been habitually resident here.  She fled England because her 16-year-old son was raped at knife-point.  She cut all ties with England and is an Irish citizen born in Ireland.  Her only connection with her former home in England is her father.  All her other nearest relatives live in Ireland.  The family is experiencing severe trauma, trying to set up home once again in Ireland, yet the lady was refused the allowance.Under the legislation, when determining whether an applicant satisfies the habitual residency requirement social welfare officers are supposed to consider all of the circumstances of each case, including five considerations in particular. These are the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country; the length and purpose of any absence from the State; the nature and pattern of the person's employment; the person's main centre of interest; and the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.  There is either a blanket ban on accepting applicants who meet the habitual residency requirement or the officials are not doing their work in the cases I have highlighted.I presume many other Deputies have encountered similar cases of people who have been refused some type of social protection, be it because of the habitual residency condition or some other condition.  I am concerned the affected people will end up begging on the street and will consequently be threatened by this legislation if the Ministers do not take into account all the reasons people end up begging or destitute in the first instance.There is concern over organised begging by organised gangs, the parents in which drop off their children in the streets to beg.  They should be prosecuted under child abuse legislation or organised crime legislation.  The offence should also be prosecutable under truancy laws and addressing it should involve the welfare services.  We know that the welfare services in the HSE cannot cope even with part of their workload.  It is State failures in this area that have resulted in organised begging on the streets.  The problem needs to be addressed but not in the sledge-hammer fashion that this legislation envisages.It is a pity we have not addressed harassment by companies collecting for charities.  Even under this legislation, they will probably still harass us as we walk up and down the street.  I refer to organised, big business whereby the companies concerned give a proportion of the money obtained on the streets to a charity.  I praise any charity that has volunteers and supporters out trying to obtain money.  The form of collection to which I refer is not charity but business and we should put to an end the accosting, sometimes in a harassing fashion, of people who are walking up and down the street.Other Deputies mentioned the illogical aspect of this Bill, namely, that its intention is to fine people who are begging despite the fact that if one is begging, one does not have the money to pay fines.  I guarantee that 90% of people on the streets begging cannot afford any fine, let alone a fine of €400.  I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to re-examine the legislation.  There is a loophole because there is no definition of goods and services.  It means that anybody with any wit at all will be able to offer in exchange for a charitable donation a piece of paper or an old biro, for example.  This is a way around the Bill and it will make it illogical and unworkable.I am concerned that the Bill does not address begging on the streets in the way it should.  The way of doing so is by investing in social protection, literacy and education and by not cutting community services and other services delivering for those who end up destitute.  The services should be enhanced in an era during which there will be an increasingly greater call thereon.  I urge the Minister to find in the big pot from which he seems to be paying billions to the banks a small portion to be distributed to charitable services, which are addressing and destitution in our city.

Over 20 have spoken on Second Stage.Deputy Ó Snodaigh is accusing us of not prosecuting wealthy people and refers to a big stick in respect of this Bill.  I can safely say he does not believe what he is saying because he knows right well that the Government does not prosecute.  It initiates legislation in this House, which then passes it.  It has initiated legislation not just in this area but also in the area of white collar crime, etc.  It is up to the State agencies, the Garda and the Director of Corporate Enforcement to prosecute under the legislation for which they are responsible.  If we pass this Bill, it will not be the Government that will be prosecuting anyone but the Garda.  The Deputy should not try to suggest otherwise.Comments made by Deputies on this Bill have been measured in the sense that, while the Government is amenable to making amendments thereto, it must obviously do so in the context of the parameters laid down under the Dillon case.  As I stated previously, there are some who feel this legislation is not going far enough.  Equally, there are those who feel it is going too far and that we should not be legislating in this area at all.Deputy Clune referred to the fact that some of the tourism bodies have not raised this issue with her.  When I was in Paris on St. Patrick's Day duty, I was lobbied at a function promoting Ireland as a tourism destination by some Irish organisations that were plying for business on the basis that this legislation was not going far enough.  We must strike a balance and I believe we have done so.Deputy Ó Snodaigh suggested there are ways around this legislation, such as providing something as a quid pro quo for the money received.  Equally, there is ample opportunity for people to beg and stay within the law because we made it clear that, under the Dillon judgment, we cannot ban begging entirely.  Under the judgment we cannot ban begging entirely and under the freedom of expression provision in the Constitution, we must allow that people are entitled to beg, provided they do it within the law and in a reasonable way.There are others who feel that no one should be entitled to beg and that there is no need for anyone to beg because we have excellent State services and supports and NGO supports.  It is, however, a social reality and we must deal with it legislatively and in terms of assistance.  I acknowledge the contributions made by voluntary organisations, many of which are supported by public funding in the work they do, to provide assistance to those who feel the need to beg.  Equally, I have a duty as Minister to discharge my responsibility to preserve public order.  That is what this Bill is termed, it is specific public order legislation to deal with a public order problem, namely, aggressive begging.Some Deputies asked about public places.  The definition of a public place is contained in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  A public place includes a highway and any outdoor area where there is access and that is used for public recreational purposes.  Deputy Johnny Brady asked about begging around a church.  In the 1994 Act there is a reference to a public place including any cemetery or churchyard.  It also includes any train, vessel or vehicle where the carriage of persons is for reward and any premises or other place where the general public has a right to go to or would go there for a payment.  That would include concerts and places where people congregate, such as football matches.  If there is any further scope when we go into the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage, I will agree to some amendments if we can tailor them.A number of Deputies raised the issue of begging interfering with normal social and commercial activity.  The Department has received a considerable number of representations from groups including IBEC, the Business Association of Ireland, the Cork Business Association, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Dublin City Centre Business Association on the need for this legislation.  We have also received correspondence from Oireachtas Members exhorting us to deal with this problem and, equally, have received representations from members of the public.  I was at a football match recently where a man asked me to deal with the situation in Dundalk, where there was a suggestion that a non-national was begging to such an extent that €2,000 a week was mentioned.  That is ultimately an issue for the Garda but it shows the public is exercised by this.Deputy Rabbitte asked about the additional statistics on begging.  Recorded incidents in 2003 numbered 961, in 2004 there were 575, in 2005 there were 891, in 2006 there were 605, in 2007 there were 461, in 2008 there were 30 and since then virtually none.  That is a result of the Dillon decision, which meant the Garda no longer proceeded on the basis of the Vagrancy Act.I was asked about the use of children to beg by Deputy Joe Carey.  Section 247 of the Children Act 2001 is not concerned with children begging but with those who procure and control children for the purpose of begging.  The numbers show a similar pattern in the opposite direction of the recorded begging incidence.  In 2003 there were six such incidents, in 2004 there were four, in 2005 there were two, in 2006 there was one and then in 2007 there were 75 and in 2008 there were 124.  This section was used more often than before because of the Dillon judgment.Deputy Rabbitte mentioned that the penalty under section 247 was low compared to the levels proposed in this Bill.  The maximum fine for a first offence is €250, with a fine of €500 for subsequent offences in this Bill.  The fines under the other Act will be upgraded by the Fines Act under the indexation provisions.  There would not, there, be much difference ultimately.The involvement of foreign nationals was raised and there is concern in this regard.  My wife and I recently witnessed a situation in Dundalk that brought to mind the purpose of this legislation.  A non-national lady was begging, not in an aggressive way but it could have turned aggressive quickly because of the nature of the conversation with the people she was begging from.  The people involved were quite upset afterwards.  If this legislation is passed, it would be difficult to ground a prosecution because it could not be said the lady, and I witnessed this, was being aggressive but it could have turned aggressive and could have been very nasty within seconds.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we could look at this again within the parameters of the Dillon judgment.Deputy Rabbitte asked about the Human Rights Commission and we were pleased to be able to accommodate a number of points it made, some of which I mentioned in my speech.  He also referred to the submission from Barnardo's, which echoed the statement from the Human Rights Commission and which we took on board.  It stated that begging in itself should not be criminalised but the Bill recognises that begging cannot be banned because of the court decision.Deputy Joe Carey asked about the report of the Law Reform Commission on vagrancy.  In the Dillon case, the High Court referred favourably to that report and many of the proposals referred to have been enacted in subsequent legislation: the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.While people make the political point that we should not be addressing this Bill, that we should look after "bigger" criminals, I do not accept that we are not passing the required legislation to allow the State authorities to prosecute those people.  We have made it clear that if other legislation is required in that area, the Government is more than amenable to bringing such legislation forward.  The fact we are dealing with one area does not mean to say we completely ignore other areas.  It is safe to say that given so many people have spoken in the House about begging on Second Stage, and that so many Members have raised these issues with me, it was right to introduce this Bill.  I look forward to the more forensic examination of these issues as the Bill passes through Committee Stage and Report Stage in this House.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am very pleased to introduce the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 and I look forward to hearing Members' contributions.  The Bill received broad support from all sides on its way through the Seanad and I look forward to a continuation of that broad support in this House.  The Long Title of the Bill captures precisely the Government's objective in bringing forward this legislation.  It is described as "An Act to amend the law relating to the ownership and management of the common areas of multi-unit developments and to facilitate the fair, efficient and effective management of bodies responsible for the management of such common areas, and to provide for related matters".The Bill forms the centrepiece of the Government's strategy to deal with the interlinked issues of completion of the common areas of multi-unit developments and the smooth and efficient operation of the owners' management companies.  The Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, which has also completed its passage through the Seanad, makes detailed provision for a licensing system for property management agents, those who carry out various management functions for owners' management companies.  It will complement the provisions of this Bill.This is a short but complex Bill that establishes a new statutory framework for multi-unit developments and owners' management companies.  While the provisions have been designed to apply to future developments, the majority of the Bill's provisions will also apply to existing developments.  They include the new transparency standards on service charges and sinking fund contributions; the holding of proper annual meetings to manage the affairs of the company; the adoption of house rules to improve the quality of life for residents and new mechanisms for the resolution of disputes between parties.Section 1 is a standard provision that contains essential definitions.  "Multi-unit development" means a building or buildings comprising residential units where it is intended that such units will share amenities, facilities and services.  A "mixed use multi-unit development" means a multi-unit development of which a commercial unit forms part.  This definition is necessary to ensure that residential units contained in mixed use developments are included within the scope of the Bill.  One important exception is made — if the development comprises residential units and a child care facility, it will be treated as a multi-unit development rather than as a mixed use multi-unit development.  "Common areas" are defined as all parts of a multi-unit development that are, or are intended to be, designated as common areas and include external walls, foundations, roofs, landings, lifts, staircases, access roads, footpaths, cisterns, drains and pipes, etc.  An "owners' management company" means a company established for the purposes of becoming the owner of the common areas of a multi-unit development and responsible for the management, maintenance and repair of such areas.  I am aware that some existing management bodies are not companies registered under the Companies Acts and I am providing in section 1(3) that a reference to an owners' management company shall be construed as including bodies such as industrial and provident societies, partnerships, and unincorporated bodies.Section 2 defines the scope of the Bill.  It provides that its provisions will apply to multi-unit developments containing only residential units provided there are at least five such units; mixed use multi-unit developments containing residential units; small developments comprising two, three or four residential units, the provisions for which are specified in Schedule 1; and "traditional" housing developments that have an owners' management company, the provisions applicable to these developments are specified in Schedule 2.Sections 2(3) and 2(4) apply to mixed use developments.  Section 2(4) provides that in such a development, the annual service charges and sinking fund contributions must be apportioned in a fair and equitable manner between different classes of unit, for example, between residential and commercial units.  It also provides that the voting rights of members in such developments should be apportioned in a manner that is fair and equitable.  Subject to limited exceptions, the provisions of the Bill will apply to all existing multi-unit developments and not just those built following commencement of this legislation.  Section 2(5) makes this clear.Section 3 is a key provision and deals specifically with future developments.  It will ensure that the ownership of the common areas of a new multi-unit development is transferred to the owners' management company before any apartments are sold.  It provides that an apartment in a new multi-unit development cannot be sold unless an owners' management company has been established by the developer; ownership of relevant parts of the common areas have been transferred to it; and a contract has been concluded between the developer and the owners' management company setting out the rights and obligations of both parties.  I envisage this contract will contain the developer's commitments to completing the common areas of the development.Transfer of the legal ownership of common areas will be subject to retention of the beneficial interest by the developer.  This is intended to ensure that the developer completes the development in accordance with the permission obtained from the relevant planning authority under the Planning and Development Acts as well as the requirements of the Building Control Acts.  The transfer of the retained beneficial interest to the owners' management company upon completion of the development and its merging with the legal interest transferred before the sale of the first unit is provided for in section 11.Apart from future developments, the Bill deals with developments that are already partially completed, where some units have been sold, as well as those which have been substantially completed but the common areas have not, for whatever reason, been transferred to the owners' management company.  Section 4 provides that in those cases where some apartments have already been sold prior to the coming into operation of this legislation, the developer must transfer ownership of the relevant parts of the common areas to the owners' management company within six months.  Here also, the transfer is subject to the retention by the developer of the beneficial interest pending completion of the development.  In section 5, I have provided that in the case of completed developments the developer must transfer ownership of the common areas to the relevant owners' management company within six months of the coming into operation of the legislation.Section 6 places an obligation on the owners' management company to join in any transfers or conveyances of units and to take any other reasonable steps to enable a purchaser to obtain a good marketable title to the property.  This provision will help to ensure that intending purchasers of apartments do not become caught up in any disagreement or dispute between a developer and an owners' management company.  For example, an owners' management company might decide to bring pressure to bear on a developer by refusing to join in a transfer due to an ongoing dispute over common areas.  In such cases, the people who would suffer most would be the intending purchasers and this provision is intended to prevent such situations from arising.In framing the Bill, I was determined to ensure the transfer of the common areas did not absolve a developer from obligations to complete a development.  Section 7 makes it clear that transfer of ownership of common areas does not relieve a developer of his or her responsibility for completing the development in accordance with the Planning and Development Acts and the Building Control Acts.In section 8, I have provided that on the sale or assignment of an apartment, the vendor's membership of the owners' management company will transfer automatically to the purchaser.  The company will be obliged to give the purchaser the share or membership certificate as soon as practicable following notification of the change of ownership.  The company must also ensure that the register of members is updated and complies with other relevant requirements under the Companies Acts.  I also provide, in subsection (3), that unit owners must provide contact details to the owner management company.Following transfer of the common areas prior to sale of the first unit, section 9 provides that the developer retains rights to pass and re-pass over these areas in order to complete the development.  However, a developer must indemnify the owners' management company against any claims made in respect of acts or omissions by the developer in the course of completion works.  Generally, there will be an obligation on a developer to minimise inconvenience to residents, and to ensure that access is available to them at all reasonable times, and a reciprocal obligation on the owners' management company not to obstruct the developer in exercising any rights in regard to the development or adjoining land.In certain multi-unit developments, especially early developments, it appears the ownership of certain parts of the common areas may have been allocated to individual unit owners.  For example, owners of apartments on the top floor may also own the roof and be responsible for any repairs that might prove necessary.  Section 10 provides that in such cases, the unit owners concerned and the company may agree to transfer the ownership of that interest, and responsibility for it, to the company.  Where either party considers that consent to the transfer is being unreasonably withheld, they may make an application to the court under the dispute resolution mechanism in section 21.As I mentioned, the transfer of ownership of the common areas to the owner management company is subject to retention of the beneficial interest in the property by the developer.  Section 11 provides the mechanism through which the beneficial ownership of the common areas is merged with legal title in the owners' management company.  When a development has been completed, the owner of the beneficial interest in the common areas must, as soon as practicable, make a declaration that such interest stands transferred to the owner management company.  The effect of the declaration will be that the beneficial interest and the legal interest are merged.  The declaration must be made with the consent of any mortgagee or owner of a charge on the property but that consent may not be unreasonably withheld.Section 12 makes provision for early transfer of the beneficial interest where a development has not been completed.  It provides that where 60% of the unit owners request it, the beneficial owner must make the required declaration transferring the beneficial interest to the owner management company unless good and sufficient cause is shown.  In the event of a disagreement, an application to court under section 21 may be made.Section 13 makes it clear that an owner management company shall have a right to carry out repairs or maintenance on a part of a multi-unit development which is not within its control where the repairs are reasonably necessary to ensure the safe and effective occupation or the peaceful enjoyment of occupation of any apartment.  Subsection (2) provides, however, that the. management company shall not undertake any such repairs or maintenance unless the person responsible for the maintenance has been afforded the opportunity to undertake the repairs.  The section also provides that the company may recover the costs of carrying out such repairs or maintenance from any person, including the developer, who had responsibility for so doing.Section 14 applies to new multi-unit developments commenced after the coming into operation of the legislation.  It provides one vote shall attach to each unit in a development, and that each vote shall be of equal value.  To ease identification, the words "owners' management company" — which may be abbreviated to "OMC" — must be included in the name of any owners' management company.  As I mentioned, the general rule regarding one vote per unit cannot apply in mixed use developments.  Section 2(4) of the Bill provides that voting rights in such developments must be apportioned in a fair and equitable manner.Arrangements for the governance of owners' management companies constitute an important part of this Bill and they are set out in sections 15 to 20.  In framing these provisions, I have been determined to promote openness, transparency and accountability.Section I5 deals with the holding of annual meetings and the content of annual reports of owners' management companies.  The annual reports must include details of income and expenditure, as well as assets and liabilities; the annual service charges and sinking fund account; planned expenditure on maintenance and repair; and insurance cover and contracts entered into by the company.  Notice of the forthcoming annual general meeting must be given to each member 21 days before the meeting and a copy of the annual report must be provided at least ten days beforehand.  The annual general meeting must take place within reasonable proximity to the multi-unit development unless otherwise agreed by 75% of the members of the company.  These specific obligations are in addition to any other obligation or duty on the company under any Act, statutory instrument or rule of law.One of the major difficulties faced by apartment owners is the lack of transparency surrounding the annual service charge.  In many cases, owners are unsure what services are covered by the charge or are dissatisfied with the service provided.  In order to address this issue, Section 16 specifies that the owners' management company must establish a scheme for annual service charges to fund expenditure on the maintenance, insurance and repair of common areas within its control and for the provision of common services such as security, legal or accountancy work.  The annual charge must be approved by a general meeting of the members of the company.  In any case in which over 75% of the members do not approve the proposed charge, the existing charge shall remain in place until the adoption of a new charge.  Where no service charge already applies, the directors of the company may determine a scheme to operate for a period of four months.  This section also places an obligation on apartment owners to pay the annual service charge.The annual service charge must be calculated and apportioned on a transparent and fair basis.  Moreover, proper records of expenditure must be retained by the owners' management company.  I will be tabling an amendment to this section on Committee Stage to deal with the setting of initial service charges for a multi-unit developments.  In most cases, it will be necessary for an initial service charge to be set by the owners' management company prior to a meeting of the owners.  The amendment will provide for this while protecting the general right of the owners to agree to the charge.Payment for "snagging" of the common areas has arisen as a problem for many developments.  Section 16 provides that the service charge must not be used to cover costs which are the responsibility of a developer or builder unless over 90% of the members vote in favour of such use.  In such cases, the owners' management company may recover the cost from the developer.A further issue of widespread concern at present is whether to establish a sinking fund.  It appears that many developments do not have a sinking fund or, if it exists, it may not be adequate to meet the costs of any major repairs or renovations.  This can become a very serious problem if a lift has to be replaced or the roof has to be repaired.  Section 17 provides that an owners' management company must establish a sinking fund to cover spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of the multi-unit development.  Unit owners will be obliged to make contributions to it.  A minimum contribution of €200 per unit per annum is specified in subsection (5) but another amount may be agreed by the members themselves.A sinking fund must be established within three years of the first transfer of ownership of an apartment in the development or, in the case of existing developments which do not have such a fund, within 18 months of commencement of section 17.  Contributions to the sinking fund must be held in a separate identified account.  Any disputes in regard to the fund may be the subject of an application to court under the dispute resolution mechanism in section 21.Section 18 provides that the owners' management company may issue a combined request for payment of the service charge and the sinking fund contribution.  Such a request must outline the basis for the calculation of each charge.  In cases of arrears, section 19 provides that they may be recovered as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction, normally the District Court.With a view to enhancing the quiet and peaceable occupation of units within multi-unit developments, section 20 permits an owners' management company to make and amend "house rules".  Such rules must be consistent with the covenants contained in title deeds and must be agreed at a meeting of members of the company.  Where an apartment is let, it shall be a term of the letting that it is subject to the observance of the rules by the tenants.  The rules may make provision for the recovery by the owners' management company from any person of the reasonable cost of remedying a breach of the rules.  Again, I intend to bring an amendment to this section on Committee Stage to allow the owners' management company to make initial house rules prior to a meeting of the unit owners on the matter.Another problem to be addressed is the lack of an appropriate dispute resolution mechanism through which aggrieved unit owners may seek redress when disputes arise.  Section 21 establishes a new court jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes in multi-unit developments where attempts at mediation have failed.  An application shall state the circumstance giving rise to it must also state whether attempts at mediation have been made.On the hearing of the application, if it is satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, the court may make such order or orders as it deems appropriate.  Such orders may relate to the legal documentation concerning the development; transfer of control issues; issues regarding sinking funds and completion of the developments.  In making an order, the court must be satisfied that all parties likely to be affected by the making of an order have received sufficient notice of the application.  The court is also given the power to make such ancillary orders as it considers necessary to give effect to any order or orders made by it under the section.Any person referred to in section 22 may apply to the court for an order to enforce any rights conferred or obligation imposed under the Act.  Section 23 provides that the Circuit Court will have jurisdiction to hear and determine an application under section 21.  Mediation offers an alternative to potentially lengthy and costly legal proceedings and should be used wherever possible to resolve disputes.  For that reason, I have included sections 24 and 25 in the Bill.Section 24 provides that at the request of any party to an application under section 21, the court may, at any stage during the course of the proceedings, direct all parties concerned in the application to meet in a mediation conference.  It further provides that where a mediation conference is directed by the court, all parties must comply with the direction.  Other relevant provisions in the section relate to issues such as the time and place for the holding of a mediation conference, the appointment of a chairperson of the mediation conference, confidentiality, and the costs of the conference.  Section 25 provides that the chairperson of a mediation conference must submit a report to the court on the outcome of the conference.  A copy of the report must be also given to the parties to the application.  Where the court is satisfied that a party to the application did not comply with a direction to engage in the mediation process, it may make an order as to costs.Section 26 is a saver provision which provides that nothing in the Act shall derogate from any power vested in any person or court, by statute or otherwise, and the powers conferred in the Act shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any such powers.  Another problem that has arisen in regard to multi-unit developments has been the striking off of owners' management companies from the companies register.  This can have serious consequences, including, for example, that an owner wishing to sell his or her apartment cannot do so until the company is restored to the register.  At present, when a company is struck off there is a one-year period during which it can apply to the Companies Registration Office for restoration to the register.  After one year, the company must apply to the courts to be restored to it.  This is costly and cumbersome.  Section 27 addresses this problem by extending to six years the period within which a management company may be restored to the register without recourse to the courts.Section 28 provides that the benefit of any guarantees or warranties relating to any materials used in the construction, repair or improvement of a multi-unit development shall stand transferred to the owners' management company on the transfer of the land.  In addition, subsection (2) provides that on the transfer of the beneficial interest in the common areas, the developer must provide the documentation set out in Schedule 3 to the owners' management company.  Section 29 places restrictions on owners' management companies entering into long-term contracts with providers of goods and services, for example, insurance contracts or broadband services.  Such companies will not be permitted to enter into contracts for a period in excess of three years.  In addition, any contract entered into by the company cannot include a clause imposing a penalty on the company if the contract is terminated after a three-year period.  Section 30 provides that the regulation-making powers conferred on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in sections 16,17 and 20 shall be exercised in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.As I mentioned earlier, Schedule 1 specifies provisions of the Bill which apply to multi-unit developments comprising more than two, but less than five, units.  Schedule 2 specifies those provisions that will apply to "traditional" housing developments with a management company.  Schedule 3 lists the documentation which must be passed by the developer to the owners' management company on the transfer of common areas.  It is quite a comprehensive list involving issues such as drawings, manuals, counterpart leases, financial accounts and so on.The provisions set out in this Bill will, when enacted, provide much improved consumer protection for the owners of apartments in multi-unit developments and will serve to reassure the public that high standards will be applied and maintained in this growing segment of the housing market.  I commend the Bill to the House.  As I said, we dealt with several of the difficulties that arose in the course of the debate in the Seanad.  There is an advantage to having legislation examined in both Houses because sometimes there may a good debate in one House and not in the other, and on other occasions there may be a useful debate in both Houses.  Following the discussion in the Seanad, I am bringing an improved Bill to this House and I hope it will be further improved on leaving it.

As public representatives we have had many queries from concerned apartment owners anxious to see a speedy passage of this legislation.  The sooner it becomes law the better for all concerned.  The delay in bringing it forward is unacceptable.  Like the banks, reform is coming years too late to help many apartment owners.  The housing bubble has well and truly burst, yet apartment owners who are in negative equity and who have lower incomes than before must still pay management service fees far in excess of what they should be to developers.  Apartment owners have been left in the lurch without any protection despite all they are paying.  The Bill should have been introduced at least ten years ago, before the property boom, and not now when the property market has crashed.  We now have a situation where some management companies are insolvent and in disarray as a result of being poorly managed and run into the ground by developers.  Others were too large from the beginning and fees and arrears were not collected.Many apartment owners are highly stressed and angry with the Government because of its procrastination in introducing legislation in this area.  A proper explanation has not yet been given as to why it has taken so long.  Moreover, all the Government has to show after all this time is a half-baked 28-page Bill which was changed, as the Minister said, as it went through the Seanad.  It should have been introduced when apartment building became the norm in the Irish property market.  A situation should never have been allowed, never mind allowed to persist for a decade, where an industry was entirely unregulated.  The perception is out there — and the Minister must nip it in the bud if it is incorrect — that he was lobbied heavily by his party's buddies in the property industry who did not want this legislation to be introduced.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Minister must admit that it has taken a considerable time to get to this stage.  That is unacceptable to all of those who are suffering as a result of the failure to regulate the industry.Up to 500,000 apartment owners must endure on a daily basis the problems created by management companies that are not functioning correctly.  Many have been ripped off, year in and year out, by the management fees they are being charged, without any means of redress.  Good work has been done in this area by the Law Reform Commission and the National Consumer Agency which produced succinct reports setting out the problems encountered by apartment owners.  This Bill does not go far enough to protect those home owners.  Looking around this city and other towns and villages throughout the State, one cannot fail to notice the poor condition of some apartment complexes.  This is a consequence of the lack of direction from Government and the absence of regulation to ensure standards are maintained.  There is concern that some of these complexes may become slums in the future as a result of this neglect.Apartment owners have been left at the mercy of unscrupulous developers for too long, to the detriment of their property and the environment.  Recent issues involving apartment complexes run by management companies have come to light, including anti-social behaviour in certain complexes and where children have lit fires and caused serious damage to apartment complexes.  Only for management companies having proper insurance in place, there would have been more expense and problems encountered.  Some apartment complexes are open to trespassers and have neither proper fire escapes nor fire equipment.  The protection and safety of apartment complex owners is not being taken seriously in this legislation.  I was particularly concerned at Dublin City Council's report entitled, Successful Apartment Living, which revealed shocking statistics that 75% of private apartment schemes in Dublin have inadequate fire safety provisions.Fine Gael has been proactive in this area for many years.  Two Private Members' Bills were introduced.  In May 2008, we published our policy document, A fairer Deal for Modern Living, which set out clearly our policies regarding the management of multi-unit developments.  Members of Fine Gael have campaigned and called repeatedly in the Dáil and the Seanad for the property management sector to be regulated.The problems facing apartment owners are numerous.  In many instances, the management company is still controlled by the developer, leaving owners powerless.  The companies are insolvent and owners are powerless.  Services are poor, fees are not paid, there is no sinking fund, the management company is in considerable debt or has even been struck off the Companies Register, thus leaving the residential units unprotected, uninsured and unsaleable.The Fine Gael policy document on owner-management companies highlighted the main difficulties facing apartment owners.  I will outline the points which are not being dealt with adequately in the Bill.  There is a significant information deficit surrounding the property management sector.  Many property owners do not understand the basic definitions of a management company and a management agent.  Many people signed up to management companies without realising what they were doing.  They believe they were not properly advised by their solicitor.  There is a need for solicitors in future to provide basic information in a booklet and in simple English so that owners understand they are signing up to pay an annual service charge when purchasing an apartment.  Apartment owners need to know their rights and responsibilities.  Basic education and training supports should be made available to people who will have the responsibility of being directors of management companies.  The property services regulator's office should provide this advice.  Some apartment owners are hesitant about becoming directors of a management company as they believe it is an onerous task and they will only get grief from fellow owners about decisions made.  Owners need to be informed and properly educated in this regard but this area is not being tackled adequately in this Bill.Dublin City Council is to be commended on the establishment of the apartment owners forum and the good work it has done.  As a public representative I have referred apartment owners who have encountered difficulties with their management company to Dublin City Council which has been in a position to provide expertise and help and to point people in the right direction.  These forums should be available in all local authority areas.With regard to the taking in charge of a development  by the local authority, it is often unclear what the maintenance responsibilities of the developer are as against the responsibility of the management company.  Grey areas exist in this regard and this point is not addressed in the legislation.  The extent of the area to be taken in charge by the council should be clearly marked on a site layout drawing so there is no confusion among parties.  If a road within a development is due to be taken in charge by the council, repairs and maintenance is the responsibility of the developer until the road is taken in charge.  If the road is not to be taken in charge, it is the responsibility of the management company and the cost of the maintenance must be raised through management fees.  There is confusion and it is the case that some developers have not accepted responsibility in certain areas.A significant problem facing apartment dwellers is the allocation of service charges and this Bill fails to deal adequately with this issue.  The Bill states that service charges should be set in a transparent manner but this is vague and non-prescriptive.  Clearer detail is needed in the legislation to ensure that management companies have insurance, that regular fire checks are taking place and that the fire-fighting equipment is up to the correct standard.  People's lives should be the priority.An amendment to the Bill is needed to allow for the calculation of the service charges.  A professional quantity surveyor should be responsible for setting the charge.  The legislation should require owner companies to plan ahead five years when calculating their service charges.  This would be of assistance to apartment owners who can budget correctly for their annual service charges.  I note the Minister is including an amendment regarding the initial service charge and this is to be welcomed.  The breaking down of the service charge estimate by service type and the option to veto a service charge with 75% of the vote, is to be welcomed.The Bill needs to provide a solution regarding arrears of service fees owing to management companies.  This makes it difficult for management companies to carry out their work within complexes.  As a first step the issue should be referred to the property regulator for adjudication rather than clogging up the courts.

In addition, services imports from that country for 2008, the last year for which data is available, were valued at €75 million.I understand that a preferential customs status applies for certain goods traded between the EU and Israel but that goods exported from illegal Israeli settlements cannot benefit from these preferential rates.

Payments made by the Health Service Executive to a ‘home help' are taxable in full subject, of course, to liability to tax being reduced by virtue of the home help's personal tax credits.

Alzheimer's disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia.  People are living longer and as a consequence are more likely to develop some form of dementia. While dementia is not solely related to age, the prevalence is higher in older people and increases with age. It is estimated that about 5% of people over 65 years of age have some form of dementia with this figure rising to 20% for people over 80 years of age.  The demographic make–up of Irish Society is changing.  The population is growing older and the number of people aged over 65 is estimated to almost triple over the next 30 years.As I have indicated previously, my Department has started the process of developing a policy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services having regard to future demographic trends and the consequential increase in demand for long-term care.    This policy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources. Officials in my Department have engaged with relevant stakeholder groups on the first stage of the process.I would also like to advise the Deputy that the Health Services Executive (HSE) is currently exploring the potential for changes in care pathways for people with dementia, and will make recommendations for the future provision of dementia care across all health and social services. An audit is underway within the HSE of the current specialist dementia care services available both in residential/hospital and community services. This audit will inform future planning and development of services for people with dementia.  The educational needs of staff will also be identified to inform any future staff requirements for working in the area of dementia care. This work will also feed into the overall Dementia Policy formulation.Finally, the Department is committed to publishing a new Statement of Strategy by the end of 2010, to cover the period 2010-2013, which will contain the goals to be achieved in the coming years.

However, owing to industrial action, the matter cannot be referred and accordingly, I have set out the position for the Deputy in so far as information is available to my Department.In approving its National Service Plan for 2010, I have instructed the HSE to ensure that urgent colonoscopies are provided within four weeks. In the case of non-urgent colonoscopies, the HSE has instructed hospitals to refer patients waiting for longer than three months to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.The latest information (May 2009) available to my Department shows that in the 19 hospitals which reported data on colonoscopy waiting times, no patient is waiting longer than 28 days for an urgent colonoscopy.  In the case of non-urgent colonoscopies, the latest figures (May 2009) available to my Department from the NTPF show 1,081 people waiting longer than three months.  Colonoscopies are carried out for a range of possible conditions and this figure would include cases where cancer is not suspected.

To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework (ECF) for the health sector.  The ECF for 2010-2012 gives effect to the Government decision on employment policy in the public sector. It provides that there will be a net reduction in employment to 2012. This includes a target reduction in numbers in 2010 to achieve the overall reduction of 6,000 from March 2009 to the end 2012 and consequential pay roll savings. Based on numbers reductions already achieved in 2009, the net target reduction (for the Health Sector) to end 2012 is 4,560 WTE (or 1,520 per annum). The 2010 ECF also provides for the creation of 265 posts for the implementation of the Ryan Report.   The grades exempted from the moratorium/special provisions under the 2009 ECF were as follows:Hospital Consultants — any new post of hospital consultant was generally to be created by the suppression of two non-consultant hospital doctor (NCHD) posts;Speech and Language Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist — up to 450 therapists;Clinical Psychologist, Behavioural Therapist, Counsellor — up to 250 new posts;Social Worker – up to 270 Social Worker posts; andEmergency Medical Technicians — up to 30 further posts may have been created and filled.In addition, special provisions applied in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.Under the ECF 2010-2012 grades exempted from the moratorium/special provisions are as follows:Medical Consultants — any new post of hospital consultant will generally be created by the suppression of two NCHD posts;Speech and Language Therapist, Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist – replacement posts should be filled and up to 380 posts in addition to the Dec 09 outturn;Clinical Psychologist, Behavioural Therapist, Counsellor — replacement posts should be filled and up to 230 in addition to the Dec 09 outturn;Social Worker – replacement posts should be filled and up to 300 in addition to the Dec 09 outturn;Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) — where it is necessary to support the reconfiguration of emergency services between hospitals and there is no scope to meet the needs arising from the redeployment of existing EMTs;Psychiatric Nurses — up to 100 posts where they are required to support the implementation of A Vision for Change;Public Health Nurses — up to 70 posts to facilitate the recruitment of student public health nurses;Nurse Sponsorship Scheme — up to 30 posts to facilitate the appointment successful students from this sponsorship scheme; andNational Cancer Control Programme posts — up to 79 new posts for service developments andClinical engineering technicianDosimetristPhysicistRadiation Therapist.

This Operation is still ongoing.To date, nine (9) persons have been arrested, five of whom were attempting to evade removal from the State. The remaining four (4) were arrested on suspicion of committing criminal offences, including the offence of Bigamy and offences contrary to the Criminal Justice (Theft & Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 in relation to the possession of false documentation. An Investigation File is being prepared for the Law Officers in respect of the alleged bigamy offences; one person has been convicted of two (2) counts of possession of false instruments, with one other person currently before the Courts for similar offences. All five (5) persons attempting to evade removal from the State have since been removed, pursuant to the Dublin Convention.I am conscious of my responsibility to ensure that the provisions of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States are implemented appropriately to guard against possible abuses and I would strongly support the actions  taken  by An Garda Síochána in this regard.

It contains a special unit for those under the age of 18. On 8th June 2010 there were 212 prisoners in custody in St. Patrick's Institution.In the Work and Training area, a number of vocational workshops are currently in operation — covering Woodwork and Joinery, Metal Work,  Computer Training, Industrial Cleaning and Catering.  Some inmates also work in the laundry, with others engaged in painting, general cleaning and horticultural work around the Institution.Education in St Patrick's Institution is provided in partnership with the City of Dublin VEC and there is currently an allocation of 20 wholetime equivalent teachers.  A wide range of subjects is taught in the school, including Art, Literacy, PE, Woodwork, Craftwork, Computer Skills, English, Maths, CSP, History and Drama.A wide range of recreational facilities are available to prisoners in St Patrick's Institution, including a number of gymnasia staffed by trained gym instructors. Other recreational facilities and activities include a library, football, table tennis, chess, pool and television. All prisoners have regular access to outdoor exercise.St Patrick's Institution is a closed prison and operates to the standard prison regime therefore inmates have 7 hours and 15 minutes out of cell time.  Under eighteens get 8 hours out of cell time because they dine communally.The Training Unit is a semi-open, low security prison for males aged 18 years and over, serving sentences up to life.  On 8 June 2010 there were 114 prisoners in custody in the Training Unit.There are a number of vocational workshops in the Training Unit which provide accredited training in a range of disciplines, including Welding, Computer Skills, and Catering. In addition, a number of prisoners participate in external placements on day release.In partnership with the City of Dublin VEC the Training Unit has a teaching staff of 7.5 wholetime equivalents.

This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 366.  This represents an approximate 9.4 % increase in the number in custody.The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997 in excess of 1,720 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.Current projects will see a further 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of a new block in Wheatfield. In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.In the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This will provide 30 rooms with sufficient area to double up if required and is due to be completed later this year.The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin. The new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 cells with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works required for the development including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services. Tenders for the construction of the access road were published in March of this year and tenders for the construction of the perimeter wall will be published in September.Phase 2 will include the development of the main prison campus. The detailed appraisal is underway in accordance with Department of Finance Capital Expenditure Guidelines and is at an advanced stage of preparation.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Ireland fully supports the suggestion of the UN Special Rapporteur on Burma, Tomas Ojea Quintana, that United Nations institutions consider the possibility of establishing a commission of inquiry with a specific fact-finding mandate to address the question of international crimes in that State.  In addition to the evident systematic repression of political dissent and expression throughout the country, we are deeply concerned about the allegations that have been made by a number of ethnic groups that they have been subjected to grave breaches of international humanitarian law by the Burmese regime and we feel that such allegations should be formally investigated.Given our very deep concerns about the situation faced by Burma's ethnic groups, my Department commissioned the Human Rights Centre at the National University of Ireland Galway to undertake independent research into the treatment of Burma's Rohingya ethnic group, one of the most ill-treated of all the ethnic groups, who are a minority within a minority.  That study, which I will be launching next week, provides accounts of systematic persecution of, and discrimination against the Rohingyas. As a result of the actions against them by the regime, which include a denial of their right to citizenship, the Rohingyas are being forced over the border into Bangladesh or to flee out to sea, where they end up in appalling conditions in refugee camps or detention centres in neighbouring countries, if they do not perish at sea.I shall, of course, be providing copies of the Report also to all members of the Oireachtas, to Irish NGOs and to the Irish media on its publication, and copies will also be made available to all UN Members, relevant UN bodies themselves and to international human rights NGOs.  Besides the Rohingya, a range of other ethnic groups have presented allegations and evidence of serious and systematic humanitarian abuses in the course of military offensives and other actions against them by the Burmese military regime.  Despite widespread calls for decisive action for such allegations to be formally investigated, I very much regret that there seems little chance that an official UN Commission of Inquiry will be set up any time in the near future.  Sadly, I do not believe that there is currently sufficient international consensus to facilitate the instigation of a formal international legal process against the Burmese regime.  This was very much in evidence in the wake of the appalling events of September 2007 — when the regime launched a ruthless crack-down on monks and other peaceful protestors, killing large numbers of them, and wounding and/or detaining many others — when efforts at that time to gain Security Council action and the initiation of a formal Inquiry failed due to insufficient international support, particularly among some of Burma's neighbours and friends.On my own part, and that of the Government more broadly, we will continue, as we have long done, to work pro-actively — bilaterally, through the EU and at the international level — in support of the cause of democracy and justice for the people of Burma, for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, for elections later this year that are free, fair and inclusive, for the horrific crimes against the ethnic peoples of Burma to end, and for the perpetrators of the many crimes against the Burmese people to be brought to justice.

Applications submitted through ordinary post are taking up to eight weeks to process.  In recent days, additional staff have commenced work in the Passport Service and will be working to clear this backlog.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	131	As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes.  These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.It is important to note that, despite what is stated by some community development projects (CDPs) and by others, integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area.  As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under the CDP can continue to be delivered under the new LCDP and by the same staff who currently do this work.My Department has set out a model involving full integration of CDPs with local development companies (LDCs), but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis.  In recent weeks, however, my Department has been able to respond positively to a number of other alternative models put forward by both LDCs and CDPs.  While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am satisfied that the real possibility for agreement exists.  Additional proposals from other CDPs or LDCs are also being considered positively but are less developed at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives.My overall aim is to ensure that, notwithstanding the difficult budgetary position, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme and better integrated actions.  As previously indicated, my primary concern in this most difficult economic climate is to make every effort to ensure the front-line services provided by or supported through my Department, especially those focused on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities, are protected and to minimise overheads and ancillary costs.

These figures include those in receipt of farm assist, those working a reduced week and other categories not included on the Live Register.There are 4,266 jobseeker's allowance customers under age 20 who are entitled to the full personal rate of €196.  This is the current maximum personal rate as the rate was reduced from €204.30 in Budget 2009.  A further 7,288 customers are entitled to the reduced personal rate of €100.There are 243 supplementary welfare allowance customers under 20 years of age who are entitled to the full personal rate of €196.  A further 755 customers are entitled to the reduced personal rate of €100.Detailed statistics of the number of people under 20 years of age who have qualified for the full personal rate since May 2009 are not readily available.  In the intervening period, some customers would have moved to the higher rate of payment for a variety of reasons, including being married or co-habiting where an increase for a qualified child is payable.  Others will have signed off having found work or commenced a course of training.

The methods of assessment of the liable relative's ability to pay are specified in detail in Regulations (S.I. 571 of 2006 and S.I. 142 of 2007).  The financial and new dependency situation of each liable relative is assessed in detail.  The assessment is based on the net weekly income (i.e. income from all sources less income tax and PRSI) with deductions for a personal allowance in respect of personal needs, a child dependant allowance in respect of each child living with the liable relative, and an allowance may also be granted in respect of the liable relative's accommodation costs.  Any maintenance currently being paid to the one parent family recipient is also taken into account.It has been found that, following the assessment based on net income and when the appropriate deductions are made, liable relatives earning less than €18,000 p.a. are not usually liable to make a contribution under the existing Regulations.  €18,000 p.a. has therefore been adopted as a guideline for operational purposes. It is not stated in Regulation.  It is kept under review by the Department.

A means-tested widow's or widower's non-contributory pension may be payable to those who do not satisfy the social insurance conditions.  If the person has qualified children, they may instead qualify for the means-tested one-parent family payment.A key condition for receipt of the widow's or widower's pension is that the person is the surviving partner of a married couple.The Civil Partnership Bill provides for registration of civil partnerships by same-sex couples. It is proposed that on enactment of the Civil Partnership Bill civil partners will receive treatment under the social welfare code equivalent to that of spouses. The required changes to social welfare legislation will be brought forward when the Civil Partnership Bill is enacted.

This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 April 2010 was 9,856 comprising 8,036 Army, 797 Air Corps and 1,023 Naval Service personnel.Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits for the Naval Service. In addition, the military authorities will shortly advertise for some limited recruitment to the Army.I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.

Since then, I have published the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure to be undertaken in County Galway.  The total value of contracts under way and those proposed for commencement during the period of the Programme in County Galway is some €130 million.  The Loughrea Water Treatment Plant Scheme is included in the Programme amongst the list of schemes in the county to advance through planning in this period.With the changed economic climate and the finalisation of the first cycle of River Basin Management Plans, the new Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues.  It also fully supports economic and employment growth as envisaged in the Government's policy document Building Ireland's Smart Economy — A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal .  The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed better to reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.In developing the Programme, a review was undertaken of all contracts and schemes listed in the previous Programme on which there had been little progress over the past 2 years, to ensure that those proceeding were aligned with current priorities.  In this context, while the proposals for upgrading Loughrea Water Treatment Plant were considered to reflect programme priorities, the planning of this infrastructure under previous programme cycles had not sufficiently advanced to allow for its inclusion as a contract to start construction in the Programme period.  Upgrading the treatment plant is a prerequisite to providing a water supply to Kilreekill village.In February 2010, my Department received Galway County Council's revised Preliminary Report setting out the latest design proposals for this Scheme.  The Council has subsequently written to the Department with further information regarding proposals to connect Kilreekill to the Loughrea Water Supply Scheme.  My Department is examining this report and correspondence and will convey a decision on it to the Council as soon as possible.I have included an annual review process as one of a number of new measures in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, under which the Programme will be reviewed and updated annually to allow for any re-prioritisation required.  The format and timing of the annual review process has still to be decided by my Department.  However, when finalised, it will be a matter for Galway County Council to decide whether to submit the trunk main to Kilreekill element of the Loughrea Regional Water Supply Scheme to my Department for consideration for inclusion in the new Programme.My Department will continue to work closely with Galway County Council to ensure that the Loughrea Scheme and the other water services contracts and schemes included in the Council's Water Services Investment Programme are advanced as far as practicable over the course of the next 3 years.

In addition, the WHS programme manager, Mr. Michael Martin of SEAI is available to deal with queries on 042 939 1548.  The availability of both points of contact ensures that there is no delay in dealing with specific queries related to the delivery of the Warmer Homes Scheme.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	148	My Department does not hold data regarding the number of properties that are currently without landline broadband or that are unable to access wireless broadband due to local topography and accordingly I am unable to provide the estimated numbers sought by the Deputy.In implementing the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), my Department undertook an assessment of broadband coverage in the State in mid-2008 and prepared a coverage map based on electoral divisions.  This enabled the Department to determine which electoral divisions should be included in the NBS.EU State aid and competition rules govern how States can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Broadband platforms do not respect exact geographic boundaries and are difficult to define due to radio propagation or DSL reach issues.  The nature of broadband networks is such that they provide a coverage footprint over a certain area rather than an individual link to isolated premises.It was necessary to guard against the NBS coverage footprint spilling over to an extent which would be unacceptable from a state aids perspective, onto surrounding areas already served by existing service providers.  Accordingly, an unacceptable level of market distortion would have resulted from including premises that are located in areas considered to be already substantially served by existing service providers.  These areas had to be excluded from the scope of the scheme and will not be addressed by the NBS.  The uncovered buildings in the electoral divisions excluded from the NBS (c. 12,500 buildings) represent c.0.7% of all buildings in the State.In addition to those premises identified as being outside of the coverage of service providers, there are also premises outside of the NBS areas that appear to have persistent difficulty in obtaining a broadband service.  This is primarily due to technical and locational reasons (suitability of telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  There is no substantiated estimate of the number of consumers who find themselves in this situation.Funding for rural broadband has become available from the European Economic Recovery Plan through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  My Department is in the process of developing a new measure under the Rural Development Plan to use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to remaining unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.A key element of putting any scheme in place will be to identify those remaining premises where no broadband service is available.  In a fully liberalised market it is essential to intervene only where the market is unable to provide a service and the Department will be consulting fully with the existing service providers in this respect.  It is intended to commence the scheme later this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is expected that the roll-out phase of the scheme will be carried out during 2011 and 2012.

This category catered for farmers who inherited, leased or otherwise received land free of charge, or for a nominal amount, from a farmer who had retired or died before 16 May, 2005, a holding that was leased out to a third party during the reference period 2000 — 2002.Under the 2005 National Reserve the person named was deemed successful and he received 17.68 National Reserve entitlements at a total value of €6,519.85.  The processing of the 2009 National Reserve application was delayed as the person named did not submit his 2007 or 2008 Single Payment forms until March 2009 and this created issues regarding the usage of his National Reserve entitlements.  The issue regarding usage has recently been rectified and an official from my Department is currently in contact with the person named with a view to obtaining outstanding legal documentation required to finalise his 2009 National Reserve application.

In this Scheme applications were invited under 2 categories; Category A was for brand new entrants — those who had not previously held quota and, Category B — was for existing quota holders — those who had previously purchased quota as a New Entrant under a Milk Quota Trading Scheme.  A total of 58 applications to Category A and 53 applications to Category B were received by the closing date of 9 April 2010, giving an overall total of 111 applications to the Scheme.Of the 111 applications, 73 were successful, with 41 applicants in Category A being awarded 200,000 litres each and 32 applicants in Category B being awarded 181,250 each.  The selection process for the Scheme involves the assessment of a business plan by an independent panel of experts.  In the case of the named person, the panel did not consider that the application merited selection under this process.

Under the Terms and Conditions of the scheme, for herds of more than 10 cows, the animals must be weaned in at least two separate groups with at least five days between the weaning of each group. Payment will not issue until all of the animals have been weaned to ensure compliance with this condition. Also there are a number of queries regarding some of the animals and when these have been resolved payment can issue. I have arranged for an official of my Department to make direct contact with the applicant to deal with the issues involved.

Lamb which has been produced in the Island of Ireland can be called Irish.  If the lamb has been slaughtered in Northern Ireland, then it would have to have the number of the approved premises on the label which would include "UK" in the oval mark. However the label could indicate that the lamb was Irish providing it is from the Island of Ireland.

These companies (called Sponsors) are formed by community groups 'incorporating' to comply with FÁS contractual guidelines for operating CE schemes, i.e. there has to be a legal entity.  The remainder are generally made up of public bodies such as County Councils etc.FÁS as a matter of course does not typically fund privately owned companies to run Community Employment Schemes. However, Commercial State or Private Companies are eligible for consideration as Sponsors of projects in exceptional circumstances as a vehicle for enabling such companies to make a contribution to local development.Any Project carried out must be external to and separate from the main business of the Sponsor (i.e. a separate legal entity/public company, as above) and it must not in any way impact on the existing or future workforce of the business e.g., no displacement of staff as a result of a Community Employment project or the work carried out there under.Such a project must not impact on the financial gains of a company's business, i.e. profits and/or benefits of the project should not directly or indirectly accrue to the Sponsor's business as a result of their sponsorship of the project or the work carried out there under.The company's sponsorship of a project would be divorced from the businesses of the company for the life of the project. This would be incorporated into a legal agreement between the Sponsor and FÁS.

I understand that the initiative referred to by the Deputy provides a range of programmes and products for schools, community groups and corporate events, which involve interactive workshops on food choices, the preparation and cooking of food and the various skills involved.  They also provide modules and lesson plans for implementation by schools, recipe books, posters, and offer advice to schools on school menus and approaches to promote positive nutrition. The programmes and advice offered appear to be in line with a variety of UK national initiatives that promote healthy nutritional choices.It is a matter for individual schools if they wish to engage with this company as part of their strategies to promote health and wellbeing. It should be noted that the subjects Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) and Physical Education (PE) at primary level, and these subjects together with Home Economics at second level cover the areas of healthy eating and the food pyramid, healthy lifestyle, physical health, body care, exercise, relaxation and diet. They are evaluated in schools by the inspectorate using indicators specific to primary and to second-level schools as appropriate.Addressing the obesity issue requires a multifaceted approach that involves the development of knowledge, skills and attitudes that influence behaviour on food selection and consumption and also engagement in appropriate levels of physical activity. Many schools are making conscious efforts to support students in the development of these behaviours to promote health and wellbeing. Schools in Ireland also have a strong and proud tradition of developing sport outside of the school time-table. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland, and the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.Schools have worked on devising healthy lunch policies as part of Social, Personal and Health Education and Physical Education  The curriculum support services at primary and post primary level have a number of activities in place to promote healthy living in schools, and Healthy Eating policies. Planning templates to assist in school planning for the implementation of the PE Curriculum and the wider aspects of physical activity and school sport are also available. In addition extensive opportunities for professional development for teachers are provided in this area, including in SPHE, PE and Home Economics.The majority of schools currently participating in the School Completion Programme operate breakfast clubs or other meal provision, in accordance with the Nutritional Guidelines issued by the Department of Social Protection. In addition, the Food Dudes programme is being rolled out on a national basis to all primary schools over a 5 year period. My Department also promotes Sport for All Day, the Active School Awards and National Healthy Eating Week.The 2008 State of the Nation's Children Report shows that children in Ireland are doing well on physical activity, ranking first among the 40 countries surveyed in being physically active for at least four hours per week.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Under existing arrangements schools are allowed an allocation of 15 exam aide days for the administration of the certificate examinations. Examination aides are paid a standard daily rate and the arrangements for using this resource are made at school level, i.e., they may recruit someone or pay an allowance to an existing staff member for the work. These arrangements for the administration of the certificate examinations were not affected by the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility.When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal appointments in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has applied unevenly in schools depending on the level of retirements. My Department has not issued any financial assistance to schools impacted by the moratorium. However, discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to some limited alleviation for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium. Schools will be advised of the outcome of the discussions at the earliest possible stage so that they can plan ahead for the coming school year.It is a matter for school authorities to re-organise and prioritise, as best as possible, the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.

This amendment is in line with provisions already outlined in the Student Support Bill. In fact, the change in the residency requirement to three out of the last five years instead of the year immediately before entering college will in many instances provide greater flexibility for students who may be returning from abroad. The new residency requirement will also ensure that persons applying for grants will have more established links with and integration in the State.The residency requirement must be met by the student him/herself in all cases and is no longer linked to the residency of the parent/legal guardian for certain categories of students. However, a candidate may qualify for a grant, having met the residency requirement during the course of their studies.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	166	As the Deputy is aware, the downturn in the construction sector has resulted in a significant fall off in the numbers of apprentices being recruited nationally.  The number of FÁS registered apprentices requiring education and training has dropped from 8,300 in 2006 to 1,535 in 2009, a reduction of more than 80%. Construction related trades have been particularly affected.The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has consulted widely with individual institutions on the impact of the reduction in these numbers on the level of apprenticeship provision in the education sector.  Having regard to the inputs received, and to enable the necessary reductions in education provision for the construction and related trades to be implemented on an objective basis across the country, an independent evaluation panel was established to advise the HEA in relation to the appropriate levels of provision which should be maintained within the education sector having regard to likely future demand to 2014.  The college referred to by the Deputy was informed earlier this year of the independent panel's allocation of the available apprenticeship provision to that institution for the 2014/15 academic year.The education requirement for apprentices is expected to drop further before picking up to the levels of provision required for the 2014/15 academic year and I understand that all colleges have been briefed on the potential difficulties and constraints in attempting to distribute the reduced number of blocks between now and 2014/15.The college referred to by the Deputy is an approved PLC centre which is managed and funded by Dun Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee (VEC) from grants provided by my Department.  PLC providers, mainly VECs, submit applications annually for an allocation of approved PLC places.  In respect of VECs further distribution of these places to their schools or colleges is a matter for each VEC.  Staff are allocated to deliver PLC courses on the basis of a pupil teacher ratio (PTR) of 17:1 (compared to the 19:1 PTR that applies to second level teaching).  For the 2009/2010 academic year, Dun Laoghaire VEC was allocated over 100 extra PLC places (including 75 from the 1,500 additional places announced as part of the 2009 Supplementary Budget), bringing its total allocation of approved PLC places to 2,151.  That allocation is being maintained for the 2010/2011 academic year.Each VEC is an independent statutory body established under the Vocational Education Act 1930.  My Department has no direct involvement in the deployment of teachers within individual VECs.  Teacher allocations to all VECs are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment and, in accordance with these rules, each VEC is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are a matter for the individual VECs.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	168	A project to provide permanent accommodation for the school to which the Deputy refers involves the acquisition of a site.  Contracts for the provision of a site for the school are now being exchanged and my Department has recently issued instructions to the CSSO to complete the transaction.The progression of a building project for the school from initial design stage through to construction phase will then be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project for the school at this time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	169	On 12th March 2010, I launched a call for proposals to be funded under the new €20 million Labour Market Activation Fund.  The closing date for receipt of tenders was 5.30pm on 8th April 2010.  370 tenders, from orgnaisations across the private, not for profit and public sectors, were received by the deadline.Twenty six programmes, providing 6,500 additional training and education places for priorty groups of the unemployed, have now been approved for funding.  These programmes will be coming on stream from this month onwards, subject to completion of satisfactory contractual arrangements.  The organisations promoting the proposed programmes are located across a wide regional spread, enabling the priority groups at whom the Fund is targetted to access programmes in many locations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-10 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The Teaching Council has registered teachers under the provisions of sections 31(2) and (3) and section 31(5) of the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Any person that did not apply under the provisions of section 31(2) and (3) can only apply for registration under section 31(5) which involves the full registration process, provision of transcripts and evidence of character (to include Garda Vetting).The Registration Council was the designated authority for the recognition of qualifications for the purpose of teaching in secondary schools prior to the establishment of the Teaching Council.  In 2008, the qualifications requirements of the Teaching Council were exactly those as inherited from the Registration Council.  The current Teaching Council [Registration] Regulations were signed by my predecessor on November 18, 2009 and came into effect on that date.Any teacher that was registered by the Registration Council is deemed to have met qualifications requirements for registration with the Teaching Council on the basis that they were previously recognised as a teacher.  This provision is also included in each of the new Teaching Council Registration Regulations.  If a teacher was registered on the basis of qualifications in a particular curricular subject by the Registration Council (and can provide documentary proof thereof), this is honoured by the Teaching Council and reflected on the register and in the documentation confirming registration.In summary, all those registered by the Registration Council will continue meet the qualifications requirements for registration with the Teaching Council. However, only in cases where a curricular subject was specifically recorded on the register of the Registration Council will this subject be recorded on the register of the Teaching Council.In relation to securing a position in a school, a range of Circulars dealing with appointments, staffing arrangements, requirements for teacher recruitment, registration are available on my Department's website.

This application is under consideration and a decision will issue to the school authority in due course.
