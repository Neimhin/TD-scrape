          <p eId="para_7">We have allowed good time for debates on the Committee Stages of these Bills. Therefore, I am hopeful of good debates but also that there will be no need for guillotines. Nonetheless, I must provide for them in respect of the Bills.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_8">It is important that all the amendments tabled on the Committee Stages of these Bills are discussed. A complaint was made in the Lower House last week in regard to the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 about the fact that 25 Government amendments were not even reached. This House needs to discuss all the amendments and I thank the Leader for making time available for the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">There is still a deal of speculation concerning the State Airports Bill 2004. The Leader has put together a very good schedule of legislation this week. In that context, will she confirm that the Government does not intend to bring the Bill before the House at any time this week, as outlined by the Leader last Friday, given that it is still before the other House?</p>
          <p eId="para_10">As the Leader is aware, the march in Drumcree last Sunday thankfully came to a peaceful conclusion. I congratulate the PSNI, the protesters and the Portadown residents for doing everything in their power to ensure that tensions were not heightened on the day. It bodes well that the tension regarding the marching season, which was a regular feature in the past, will be kept to a minimum this year. It is a great sign of the new confidence of the PSNI that it has managed to broker deals locally to ensure that tension is kept under wraps. There is a responsibility on Sinn Féin to support the new policing arrangements. It is over two years since the SDLP signed up to the PSNI. It is now time for Sinn Féin to cross the Rubicon, support the new arrangements and make it a totally new beginning for policing for everyone in Northern Ireland. The success of the PSNI in Drumcree last Sunday is the type of success we want replicated every week in Northern Ireland. I congratulate the PSNI in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Since we are in the throes of the tourism season, a recent report showed that, according to the Central Bank, the price of goods here exceeds the EU average by 12% and that tourists who come here want value for money. We are known historically as the Ireland of the welcomes, but of late we have been known as the Ireland of the rip offs. We have not provided good value for money for tourists. As we move through the tourism season hoteliers, restaurateurs and all of us have a responsibility to ensure value for money. Not only are tourists coming here to enjoy a holiday, but ultimately they will be ambassadors for the country when they leave and tell their friends back at home about their trip. It is important for a major industry that we keep a focus on the price of goods and services to ensure Ireland is as competitive as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">It is important the House recognises that the auctioneering review group has been established and is up and running, arising from an initiative in this House which was pushed and supported very much by the Leader. This is worth recognising and I refer particularly to those people who are constant critics of the House. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has advertised for people to deal with the motor insurance area ahead of schedule. It was intended to begin that process on 1 January 2005. When the Bill was going through the House, that question was asked by almost every speaker.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I raise also the question of the State Airports Bill, which I raised last week. The Leader gave a clear reply on what she knew about it at that time. We have a large volume of business to deal with this week. The manner in which that Bill has been pushed through the other House, with guillotines and brow beating committees, as happened in the Select Committee on Transport, last week is unacceptable. While that is the business of the other House and it is not for us to comment on it, I would be appalled if somebody were to pull strings to interfere with the Order of Business in this House this week to push through that legislation. It would be an appalling reflection at a time when the Bill needs consideration. Members on both sides will have much to say on that Bill which is not critical or under much pressure. I believe its current shape will change when we come to discuss it. I would be opposed to any heavy handed approach or intervention. This House is seen by too many as a creature of Ministers or a rubber-stamping operation where we do not have any involvement or decisions to make which are of real value. We should express a clear view that we will discuss the Bill at some length.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Recently I raised with the Leader the question of a peace time discussion on the values, advantages or disadvantages that have accrued to the nation from privatisation. We are now looking at making Willie Walsh a millionaire so that he can join Denis O'Brien out in Portugal, or whatever it is that we are trying to do with Aer Lingus. It is time we looked at what we gain from privatisation. We have started on the same route again by having a go at the national transport service. We are being told how bad the service is, how much needs to be invested in it and how bleak is the future. We are told that North Korea and Cuba are the only countries which own their airlines, but we are not told what it has cost the US Government to own its airline and what it costs Italy to maintain Alitalia.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">We could consider all sorts of views in the context of public and private ownership. As John O'Connor said this morning, the issue is not privatisation, it is value for the taxpayer and the travelling customer and it involves the broader national strategy.

          <p eId="para_16">I commend the Leader and her staff on the manner in which business has been ordered this week to ensure that every Bill is given the time it deserves, particularly on Committee Stage. Bills are ordered which have returned from the Dáil and have already been the subject of useful discussion here. We need time to discuss Report and Final Stages. I say this as I am concerned at a reference by a commentator over the weekend to the Seanad rubber-stamping legislation such as the State Airports Bill. This has never been the practice of the Leader and I am absolutely certain that it never will be. In that context, it will not be possible to take the State Airports Bill this week. I look forward to an in-depth and full discussion on the legislation when we return in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Will the Leader schedule a debate on economic policy when we return? I note that a debate on this subject has begun in the Government parties among the real PDs, the pseudo PDs and the left wing of Fianna Fáil which has rediscovered its soul following the local elections. It would be a very useful debate. Perhaps we will get some insight into Government thinking over the summer months as its members get a chance to observe real life outside Government Buildings during their holidays.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I note in the media that the report by the all-party committee chaired by a former Member of this House, Deputy O'Donovan, on house prices and the price of building land appears to be almost complete. It would be a very useful exercise to consider the report at the earliest opportunity.</p>

A letter appeared in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> from the National Graves Association regarding the growing disrespect for the tricolour.

The flag has been besmirched by violence over the past three decades. It is time we as a nation took back the national flag for all the citizens of this country, not only for one exclusive sector.</p>

I have just returned to Ireland having taken several flights with Aer Lingus. Despite the fact that it has been pushed into a situation where the service is pared down in terms of the provision of meals and so on, in my experience the attitude of the staff is quite outstanding. That is what marks the difference between Aer Lingus and so many other airlines. We should recognise the marvellous work done by the cabin crew and other staff of what is a great national airline.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I congratulate my colleagues, Senators Ross and O'Toole, on their work in drawing the situation in the auctioneering business to public attention and their success in regard to a commission. In addition to the point made effectively and ably by Senator Ross on the wireless this morning, he did the Seanad proud because he took up an issue the impact of which hits many young people in terms of house prices and he dealt with it in quite a magisterial way.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In addition to examining the nonsense of dozens of surveyors' reports being produced whereby young people may not have an opportunity to buy a house because the price increases beyond their means as they have to pay these exorbitant fees, the question of the involvement of solicitors should also be examined. It is idiotic that purchasers have to carry out so-called searches for titles and so on. Such searches are carried out dozens of times when they should be done only once and given an official stamp. In that way we would know that a title has been validated by some central legal authority and people would not need to pay for the same work to be done over and over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I do not suppose there will be much time for a review, even a short one, of the situation in the Middle East in which this House has taken a consistent interest. If it not possible before the end of the session could we have an urgent debate to review developments early in the new session, particularly in the light of the very troubling broadcast made by King Abdullah of Jordan, which was quite apocalyptic? He envisages a situation where there really could be a meltdown in the Middle East, which would bring us very close to a third world war. It is a very worrying situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The Israeli Supreme Court found that the wall was wrong. Congratulations must be extended to it. Its decision suggests there are elements of democracy active in Israel. However, I am very disturbed that a senior Israeli Cabinet Minister said the country will not accept the ruling of the International Court of Justice in this matter. Where did that come from? It is the example of the Americans who, as they exited Iraq, passed legislation indemnifying themselves against charges of major human rights abuses. They then put Saddam Hussein on trial for human rights abuses. It is an absolute idiotic nonsense.</p>

Members of the same families attend the two schools. However, the boys school was classified as disadvantaged and it is getting a special needs assistant for every 80 pupils, while the girls school is getting one for every 200 because it is not deemed to be disadvantaged. This is crazy and the issue should be reconsidered.</p>

I know the budget is being formulated as we speak but I hope we can debate it in early October with the Minister for Finance.

Senators need all the secretarial services provided to them to exercise their duties and functions, as we are all well aware.

Will the Leader draw the Minister's attention to this anxiety? Will he outline, before we conclude this session, the prospects for the mid-west area?

One of the rules states that the national flag should be raised on election day and on other appropriate days but in a respectful manner. We do not raise the flag in a prostituted way as is done in certain count centres and in discotheques in the early hours of the morning. The idea of introducing the national flag as a subject in civics classes is an excellent one. The Minister of Education and Science should consider it. There is a perception that the flag belongs to a particular party and is not a national flag.</p>

Shannon Airport serves all of the west of Ireland as an international airport and it is important that we discuss it. It is also important that Senator Daly mentioned Shannon Development. Aer Lingus has turned its fortunes around and credit is due to the management of the company for that. However, talk of a management buy-out is a step too far. This proposal has caused major concern among the travelling public and particularly among those who work for the company. The reports I have seen of a possible loss of more than 1,000 jobs are worrying.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">My attention has been drawn to the national flag by Senators Mooney and McHugh. Where we display the flag we should always do so with respect and honour. In my own business I have always regarded it as something we should not be afraid to use. The point was made to me recently that the lowering of the flag at sunset is a British tradition and is only adhered to in former British colonies. I mention this because I have always made a point of bringing down the flag in our stores at sunset. I am told it is only former British colonies such as the Americas, India and Australia which lower the flag and that in France and Germany it is regarded as disrespectful to lower the flag at sunset. It would be interesting to have a debate on this topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I ask the Leader, during the summer, to draw the attention of the various Departments to the lethargy and enthusiasm which seems to exists for using modern technology. We have the opportunity to use it and I have submitted amendments to various Bills drawing attention to its benefits. It is interesting to see that different Departments have different attitudes.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Two pieces of modern technology would be of immense benefit to us and I would like some studies to be carried out into them. The first is electronic tagging, which removes the need to install every convicted person in jail by giving them the option of accepting a tag as an alternative. This would ensure that they adhere to the conditions imposed on them by the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The other is a much more interesting and is called the intelligent speed adaptation. There is an interesting article on it in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>. I mention it because I have experience of a bleeper in a car that lets the driver know when he breaks the speed limit. In Sweden, 10,000 people have volunteered to be guinea pigs in an experiment with this scheme. A Big Brother satellite surveys a person’s speed and informs him that he is speeding and adjusts the speed of the car to conform with the speed limit on that road. It is already in place in Victoria, Australia, in Sweden and in a number of other countries. It could not be introduced here immediately but we should study the results if we are to do something about speeding and death on the roads.</p>

Teagasc agreed with the scientific recommendations that higher levels of up to 250 gallons of nitrates per hectare could be used but it was muzzled by the Minister for Agriculture and Food. It is important that he comes into the House to debate this. Many farmers now question the authority of Teagasc and its relationship with the Minister because it now appears that the agency is taking political considerations into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">The Minister must also be questioned on the confusing letters his Department sent out to many farmers last week on extensification. The Minister has admitted an error in this but if the unfortunate farmer errs, his livelihood is threatened and, in some cases, removed. I know many farmers in the midlands who have lost their extensification and other head payments because of a simple error. It is time for the Minister to apologise to the farmers for erring in this case.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">My colleague, Senator McCarthy, mentioned the use of Oireachtas envelopes. There has been much muddying of the waters about these envelopes. There is nothing wrong with a Member of the Oireachtas using Oireachtas envelopes when writing to his or her constituents. The impression has been given by many commentators, including political commentators, that there is something wrong with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">It would not be possible to give due consideration to any Bill at that time. We have much work to do this week and I am conscious not alone of the calls upon spokesmen in the House but also of the pressures on the staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The Senator raised an important point about the march in Drumcree and I also congratulate the PSNI. We all heaved a sigh of relief when we saw 500 marchers and protesters instead of the 30,000 that was the norm in the very bad times. I agree that Sinn Féin should sign up to the policing arrangements. The election is over and it would send a powerful signal.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Senator Brian Hayes also raised competitiveness in the tourism industry and pointed out that some goods are 12% more expensive than the EU norm. Tourists will stop coming if that continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">In response to Senator O'Toole, I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, because he said in a debate here in reply to points made by Senators O'Toole, Ross and Scanlon that he would arrange a root and branch review of the auctioneering business. I made many requests to the Minister. I told him it was one of those issues about which I could not face the Seanad unless he told us when he was going to do it and, true to form, the Minister did it. Senator Ross was also true to form this morning. It is a significant issue which is exercising the minds of almost everyone in the land. It arose in this House and was presented to the Minister. He thought it was a good idea and he took action. I thank all those who contributed. It was good to hear Senator Ross say that it emanated from this House during the passage of a Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Senator O'Toole referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and noted that it is ahead of schedule. On the question of the State Airports Bill, the House has a packed agenda this week. I do not intend to stir from the House this week as there is so much that could go wrong. Like the shoemaker, we must stick to our last and complete our programme of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">A debate on privatisation, particularly with respect to Aer Lingus, was requested. I hope all Members will contribute to the debates on the important legislation in the House this week. I heard about the commentator on the politics programme to which Senator O'Meara referred. The House is not a rubber-stamping Chamber; it is a thoughtful and reflective Chamber. This House does not just consider a Bill and send it on its way. I have come to the conclusion that this Chamber should not merely railroad through Bills. I know that commentator and I intend to tackle him.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">I am informed by the Deputy Leader that the report on economic policy has been published but it has not been debated in the House. It is important to debate the matter in the House. It could be called the O'Donovan report.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Senator Leyden raised Aer Lingus. There will be time on another day to discuss that issue. Aer Lingus needs finance and the Government cannot give it. Following 11 September 2001, Loyola de Palacio, the EU Transport Commissioner, would not allow a single euro to be given to state airlines. That was part of the difficulty. We all beseeched her and other countries gave funding under some other guise, but Ireland did not do so. True to form, the workers and management of Aer Lingus were powerful. By the end of 2001, they had agreed to a huge number of redundancies and to sharpen their approach and work practices. Its turnaround was a great success story. The company now requires new aircraft and investment. The matter must be dealt with one way or another. The Government cannot provide funding but I believe there will be a fair consideration of the matter during the summer. It is an urgent issue for the company over the next few months. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Senator Ulick Burke asked about the weighted model. I have received representations on this matter. There must be some way of judging the number of special needs teachers required in particular schools. While the waiting period may seem unfair, it is judged on age and background; the Senator will be aware of the procedure involved. There must be some way found to do it. Committee Stage of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003 will be taken in the House today. I hope many Members will contribute to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Senator Mooney spoke about the growing disrespect for the tricolour, the national flag, and I fully agree with him. The first time I was aware of its use was in the main Dublin counting centre during the European elections. The tricolour belongs to all of us. Everybody in this Chamber and every citizen has a right to it and it should not be wrapped around members of a particular party in a triumphalist manner. To use the Senator's words, it is being besmirched through its wanton use by one party. The Senator's suggestion that a module be introduced in civics lessons to promote respect for the flag is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Senator Norris referred to the service provided by Aer Lingus. As a very charming person, the Senator would receive good service. We are all charming and appreciate the good service we receive. He congratulated other Members of the Independent group on their work on the issue of auctioneering. Alan McCarthy, who heads the working group on the issue, is a fine person. I know him from the days of An Bord Trachtála and he will do a very good job. As regards the Senator's call for a debate on developments in the Middle East, I understand a section of the wall must be re-routed. As Senators will be aware, we will not have time to debate the matter this week, although I wish we could.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Senator Browne referred to the difference in treatment of a boys' school and a girls' school. This begs the question as to why the schools do not amalgamate. It is odd that girls receive a different weighting from boys to allow for special needs, particularly as there would be siblings in each of the schools. I hope the Senator will contribute to the Committee Stage debates on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill this evening and the Equality Bill tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Senator McCarthy called for a review of the use of Oireachtas envelopes. I expect that is a matter for the Committee on Procedures and Privileges of both Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">Senator Daly raised impending changes at Shannon Airport and developments with regard to Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Shannon Development and bilateral arrangements with the United States. All these issues are important. While we, in the Houses, are legislating, all the likely changes, which will affect many people, particularly in Shannon Airport, seem to be coming together. Coming from that region, the Senator is correct to raise the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Senator McHugh agreed with Senator Mooney on the issue of the national flag and pointed up its prostitution and use by one party in a triumphalist manner. The €18 million in VAT paid by groups with charitable status is a very large sum. The matter can be raised when we debate the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill later in the week. As the Senator pointed out, special needs should receive an injection of funding from the dormant accounts fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Senator Quinn referred to honouring the national flag. I do not believe that lowering the flag at sunset is a colonial tradition with people going off afterwards to have their gin and tonics or whatever. I have noticed that the flag is also lowered in barracks and similar places. The Senator said the idea originated in former British colonies.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Senator Quinn also raised the issue of modern technology and the potential for electronically tagging people who should be in jail. He also mentioned intelligent speed adaptation. While I have not yet read the article in question, the scheme to which he referred appears to be a sensible course of action if we had a cohort of people willing to take part in it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Senator Bannon referred to Teagasc and confusing letters issued by the Department of Agriculture and Food concerning extensification. I raised the matter with the Deputy Leader who explained the extensification system to me. I was aware that it allows one to make better use of one's land and one gets more bang for one's buck.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Senator Tuffy raised the use of Oireachtas envelopes. Members may use their envelopes when writing to constituents, as we all know. Articles have appeared in the newspapers which seem to imply that somehow we should not use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">It is the misuse of Oireachtas envelopes that has given rise to this debate but Oireachtas Members can use them for correspondence with their constituents.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">The purpose of this amendment is to encourage the immediate enactment of the Bill. The reference to a charge on public funds is made to prevent the amendment being ruled out of order. I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, will consider the issue of efficiency of time scales and consider the amendment in the spirit in which it is intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">One must be cognisant of the time constraints under which the House is labouring this week and the Order of Business reflects the structured manner in which this business will be conducted.

I encourage the Minister of State to accept this amendment which will ensure a speedy commencement of the Bill once it has passed through the House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_118">I cannot accept the amendment. Section 2 represents a standard commencement procedure which allows for the practical reality that certain matters must be dealt with before the Bill becomes operational. There must be a strategic approach to the development of the Private Residential Tenancies Board's functions. The initial objective is to establish the board and formally appoint its members after which it will commence its work. Its first task, which will take some weeks, is to secure the registration of landlords on which basis a database will be developed. There is no intention to delay but the reality is that it will take a couple of months before the board can carry out its functions. Landlords must be registered before any dispute resolution can be undertaken, for example. There will be no unreasonable delay and the system will be wholly operational in four or five months but the landlord registration task must be the first focus of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">The wording of section 2 is standard and can be found in many other pieces of legislation. I acknowledge that the provisions of some Bills can take months to come into effect but that will not be the case in this instance. The Bill will come into effect quite quickly but not all its provisions can be implemented on day one.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_125">I appreciate the Senator's comments but the reverse is the case nowadays. It was a requirement under many previous Bills that documents had to be served through registered post. However, life has changed and the use of registered post to serve notices has been deliberately omitted from this legislation and other legislation in recent times. For example, serving summonses is no longer done through registered post because it is not as satisfactory as it used to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Society has changed significantly. Once upon a time, houses were always occupied but that is no longer the case. If a postman calls to a house to deliver a notice and the person is not in, he will leave a note for him or her to call to the district sorting office to pick up the letter. If he or she knows it is a summons or something else he or she does not want, he or she will not pick it up. Even if a person is in the house and sees the postman coming, he or she will hide behind the curtains.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The use of registered post has been deliberately excluded and this provision is being standardised in legislation because registered post is not working. People are not at home most of the time and, even if they are, they can abuse the system to ensure they do not receive a letter they do not want. The omission of registered post is not an oversight and takes account of practical realities.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I have researched penalties in various Acts. A fine of €250 for continuous breaches of the legislation is lenient. For example, the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003 set a fine of €500 for continuous breaches. That Act set the penalty for continuing offences at €500, and I propose that the amount of the penalty should act as a real deterrent. I could have gone higher, because nowadays €500 is not that much of a deterrent for some people, but I left it at that level to ensure consistency with the Licensing of Indoor Events Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_71" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_131">I do not consider that the proposed amendment to increase the fine per day is warranted. The legal advice is that there is no particular standard for daily fines. The amount prescribed in the Bill which, as the Senator says, is up to €250 per day, is in line with other legislation. I accept there may be higher amounts in other Acts but that is the daily fine outlined in the legislation. We think the specific fine on summary conviction is more significant at up to €3,000 or up to six months in prison or both. That should provide a significant deterrent against offences under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">In reality one will probably find that the daily fine is not imposed that often. It is not automatic — one has to go back to court a second time to get the specific daily fine imposed. What we are putting in here may not be the highest amount one would find in legislation but we think it is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The Licensing of Indoor Events Bill may deal with a different scale of major projects, while here we are dealing with the tenancy of a house or apartment. What we have included in the Bill is proportionate to the issue and what will be used in the vast majority of cases is the once-off €3,000 fine. We hope the fine per day is not the one normally used. It is in line with other legislative measures, although it may not be the highest fine.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">Strong regulations are in place and this amendment is designed to ensure that a landlord can no longer rent out sub-standard accommodation or hovels to people. When people are paying rent they are entitled to a good standard of accommodation and those of us who came up through the local authority system know of far too many situations in our areas where people rent sub-standard accommodation. It is a minority but there is still a small percentage of people who will let out any kind of accommodation if they can get away with it. We must have standards and respect for people and that is why I have tabled this important amendment. It clarifies the situation and should be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The amendment provides that rented accommodation can be inspected by the authorised officers of local authorities and health boards. We are often starved of the cash to put sufficient officers in place to carry out inspections and it is important to include this amendment.

          <p eId="para_143">I sympathise with the concerns expressed by the Senator but including a specific requirement and imposing a duty on landlords to ensure fitness for habitation is not really necessary. It is not the practice to insert into one legislative measure an obligation to comply with another legislative measure. Statutory requirements are imposed once only and once they are imposed they should and must be complied with. The Senator is talking about the law but restating it elsewhere does not make it any more mandatory. The law is the law and separate legislation addresses the Senator's concerns. Including a provision dealing with the matter in another Bill is not necessary and is not the normal legal practice. A "to be sure, to be sure" approach does not give the provision any more teeth.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The requirements in question are already provided for in separate legislation and, apart from being unnecessary, it is neither normal nor appropriate to attempt to enact what would be in effect a duplicate statutory provision regarding matters like this. It is the law and I fully agree with the Senator that all landlords should comply with the law and provide good accommodation. However, restating it or putting it into another Act does not give it any extra legal effect.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_145">It gives greater clarity to the Bill when it comes to complying with the building and environmental regulations. I know 98% of landlords are honourable, decent people, but there are cowboys and we must have clarity in the legislation to deal with those. This is an important amendment which should be taken on board.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_146">I am sympathetic to the Senator. In recent years, with the huge demand for housing and higher population levels, there has been pressure on the housing market. There is no doubt that some landlords have let out accommodation which is not very suitable. The best way to improve standards is to improve supply, which is what we have tried to do. Last year 68,000 new housing units were completed and it is a fact that in the past two years there has been more supply in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Rent levels have come down and, as such, a prospective tenant can afford to be more choosy and demanding. I agree that two to five years ago landlords with substandard accommodation could let that out because people did not have better options. However, if we can continue with this level of supply for the next couple of years it will mean that prospective tenants will not have to queue up outside houses waiting for a landlord to arrive. People will be able to have time to think and they can look at what is on offer. Those offering good accommodation will get good quality tenants and those offering bad accommodation will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">We have had the regulations but enforcement has not been great due to lack of supply. My officials and the commission have been very much involved in dealing with this for a couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">It is intended that when the Bill is enacted the standards regulations will be re-examined and improved. Passing regulations is one thing but the best solution to protect tenants is a better supply of accommodation that will allow people to choose. We all want good quality accommodation but the provisions in Senator Bannon's amendment are already contained in regulations and in other legislation. Inserting such provisions in the Bill will not give it any extra effect because it is already the law. Reinforcing it in any other legislation will not make it clearer or more meaningful. The law is quite clear in this respect. Some landlords have been offering sub-standard accommodation and they should not be doing so, but it is not necessary to reinforce the provisions in this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_150">I am glad the Minister of State has admitted that the existing legislation has not been enforced to any great extent. Is this not a damning indictment of a party that has been in Government continuously for over seven years? Each September and October, young students from rural areas desperately seek accommodation in Dublin. I have seen accommodation that such students have been offered and one would not house animals in some of it. It is wrong to have such poor quality, sub-standard accommodation in some parts of our cities. It is not happening in Dublin alone, but also in other urban areas. That is why I am pressing the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_77" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_151">These regulations are enforced through local authorities, not directly by the Department. Having been a member of a local authority for some years, however, I do not wish to be overly critical of them. The issue fundamentally is one of supply and we have gone through a few years during which there was a shortage of accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The issue of students seeking proper accommodation was raised in the Dáil last week. There is a lot of hype every year, come September, about student accommodation, although it has settled down in recent years. There is a lot of student accommodation now, both on and off campus. Legislation has been enacted to give tax incentives for student accommodation and several thousand units of such accommodation have been provided under that measure, which has helped to relieve pressure. Equally, however, I recall hearing a radio programme last September about this issue. On the one hand, parents were panicking, racing around and paying any rent a landlord sought. On the other hand, college accommodation officers were saying they had plenty of space and were asking people to relax because most of the students would be accommodated. Most colleges have accommodation organised so people should calm down rather than rushing around paying whatever price landlords are asking.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">There is no need for all the hype and publicity stunts that are usually organised by the students' unions every year. There can be some pressure, but if people take their time these matters can be worked out. The tax incentive schemes have helped to provide much accommodation both on and off campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Accommodation standards are regulated by law, although we know they have not been properly enforced. There was a time when people were taking anything that was on offer and some landlords certainly cashed in on that. With a better supply and better standards, prospective tenants now have a wider choice. The best enforcement one can have is the client who must be aware of what is available. Sometimes, clients may be forced by various pressures to make a decision because the money is coming from the rent allowance. If the money was coming from their own pockets they might be more worried. In an era when there was a lack of supply, certain accommodation was let of which none of us could be proud, but matters are improving. The proposed amendment would not help the situation.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_155">I support Senator Bannon's amendment. I have seen some of the pig sties in which some landlords expect tenants to live. Some accommodation is simply not up to standard. Those houses do not comply with any form of building regulations, let alone any standards of comfort, and pose a real risk to people's health and safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The amendment spells out clearly how it is proposed to address the problem which does not arise with the vast majority of landlords, particularly those who let out newer properties that are built to sufficiently high standards. However, I have seen old houses which have problems with plumbing, dampness and electrical wiring, for which it is unfair to charge high rents. It is also unfair to expect students to adapt to such an environment that is neither conducive to good health nor to studying. As well as being faced with staying in such accommodation for the academic year, students must often work graveyard shifts at weekends in restaurants, bars and hotels in order to pay the rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The amendment is fair in what it attempts to do. The Minister of State is a reasonable person and I appeal to him to consider the amendment favourably.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_158">I spoke about student accommodation on Second Stage because I am extremely concerned about it. The question goes beyond the involvement of local authorities in this issue because there is a big responsibility on third level colleges to provide more campus accommodation. NUI Galway has a land bank of 100 acres, for example — a fact that was mentioned when we met with the college authorities. In fairness to the university, a year ago it obtained permission from Galway City Council to provide more campus accommodation but there was an appeal to An Bord Pleanála and planning permission was turned down. That is an example of the practical problems that can arise in the provision of student accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The Minister of State is right to refer to the tax incentives, which have provided a good number of new accommodation units. Those I have seen in Galway are very good, and I am sure the same is true of those in Dublin, Maynooth and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">I would question the charging of deposits for such accommodation, given that the rent can be quite high. We should maintain contact with the universities and other third level institutions in an effort to provide more campus accommodation. This would provide greater security for students who, in addition, will be living near their college. I hope the authorities at NUI Galway will revert to the planning authority to try to get last year's proposal through and, thus, provide more accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The Bill places obligations on landlords but, bearing in mind that some universities are also landlords, we should include them. This is a serious issue and parents of students know the difficulties involved in securing accommodation each September or October. There should be a better way of doing this than obliging people to grab the local newspaper and then tear around Galway to answer all the advertisements for student accommodation. If the universities were to take a greater role and accept more responsibility for this issue, we would have a better system. I urge the Minister of State to keep in contact with the third level institutions and secure more campus accommodation in order that people do not have to make a mad scramble around the relevant cities looking for accommodation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_162">The Minister of State passed the buck when he stated that this issue would be the responsibility of local authorities and health boards. I agree with him and compliment the local authorities on the job they are doing. However, there has been a serious problem in recent years because of the embargo on recruitment of officers. Inspectors were not in place in many local authority areas, particularly the smaller ones. They had major financial problems and were short of funding for other important projects, such as roads, housing and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Will the Minister of State guarantee that a new position of accommodation inspector will be created in every local authority? One can state that someone on a local authority will do this job, but it is not being done. A member of Longford County Council who resigned from Fianna Fáil has for three years called for people to be appointed as inspectors of rented accommodation. No one took on board his requests, queries or demands. Will the Minister of State indicate what personnel will be put in place to carry out such inspections given that the health boards are being wound up and I presume there will be a greater onus on local authorities to carry out such functions?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_81" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_164">Some 14,000 or 15,000 bed spaces are provided under the campus and off campus schemes, some of which are located in north Dublin. Until now, local authorities have been responsible for many issues such as standards, registration and so on. This legislation proposes to establish the new tenancies board, which will take over responsibility for registration from local authorities, although it will do so for everything. Nonetheless, there will be greater co-operation. Local authorities have had so many irons in the fire that perhaps they were not undertaking all their duties due to the need to prioritise their activities. However, under the new set up, the private residential tenancies board will work with the local authorities and will give them some of the registration money raised. It is hoped this will encourage local authorities to perform the service for which they are supposedly being paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">While the onus will always be on the tenant who takes accommodation, the board will be in place to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. If a tenant is not taking care of his or her accommodation or the landlord is not keeping it repaired and up to the standard at which it was let, people can take their dispute to the board. All of these provisions will mean that standards will improve. Tenants are responsible for being aware of what they are renting, although I accept that when supply was short, it was often a case of taking whatever was going and quickly. However, that situation has already changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">We want to get away from the days of bad accommodation and the real enforcement officer is the availability of supply and choice, whether there is one enforcement officer or ten in each local authority area. The best people to enforce standards are those taking the accommodation. If such people say "no" and walk away, the landlord will get the message quickly if it happens often enough. We seek to provide more accommodation, more choice and we want prospective tenants to be a bit choosy at times; if the accommodation is not good value for money, they should walk away. Tenants have been doing so for the past two years as they have had a choice.</p>

Such persons include elderly people moving into towns. It is an important amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert the words "and do not limit the landlord's statutory obligations under this Act". I propose this amendment in the interests of tenants to ensure that the conditions of a lease cannot be manipulated by a landlord to relieve himself from his duties under the Act. A safeguard of this kind is necessary. We must be more explicit about a matter as central as this even though the Minister of State may reply to the effect that he has covered it already.

As the Minister of State has pointed out, adequate legislative provisions cover these issues and adequate investment and resources are being put into this area. As Senator Bannon said, the number of rogue landlords is extremely small. We must take on board what the Minister of State has already said about the matter being governed by other legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">While I acknowledge that Senator Brady is a good worker in his constituency as he was when he was a member of the local authority, it is time we addressed this situation. In the constituency from which we both come, there is a very large number of asylum seekers and refugees living in sub-standard accommodation which is never inspected for fire hazards, health and safety. If the amendment were made, it would ensure that the agreements in question could not be entered into. While the issue may be peripheral to the legislation, I appeal to the Minister of State, who knows the area very well, to take a look at Parnell Street and have its buildings inspected for fire, health and safety. For God's sake, let the Government be on the side of the vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">My attention has been drawn by Senator McCarthy to a section of the Bill to which we may not come. As I hope we will, I will not speak for long on it. Following in the wake of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who removed rights of transport from gay couples, it is proposed to remove any right in defiance of European laws from same-sex couples to inherit tenancies. The Bill demonstrates a very uncaring attitude on the part of the Government to vulnerable citizens, which is a disgraceful position for any government to take.</p>

It is important for the Government to lead the way in protecting the marginalised and vulnerable in society. We have recently seen in the Equality Act 2004 and the decision of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the spousal travel pass a pattern whereby the Government explicitly excludes same-sex couples. This is a retrograde and discriminatory step and I hope we reach section 35 to allow us to deal with the particular issue in greater detail. I hope Senator Bannon and others will be cognisant of the importance of the section which reflects on whether the Government is caring and willing to legislate for everybody. Equality is for everyone.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">It would not be beneficial to insert examples of a few matters that might be deemed to involve penalisation. There is a danger that the insertion of such examples might detract from the effectiveness of the provision. Section 14, as it stands, provides the most comprehensive definition of penalisation possible in terms of any action that adversely affects the tenant enjoying peaceful occupation of the dwelling by specifying that such action may constitute penalisation, even if it involves action by the landlord that would otherwise be legal.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">This section was extended on Committee Stage in the Dáil to cover complaints to public authorities generally or to the gardaí. This will ensure that matters such as complaints about accommodation standards or fire safety as well as applications to the Revenue Commissioners for tenant's tax relief are covered under the anti-penalisation provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">If legislation includes the words "any action", that covers everything. The alternative is to list matters and the board or mediator involved may decide that such action applies to only those matters listed and that another matter that may arise is specifically excluded. The legislation provides for any action and we consider that term to be all-embracive. While I understand what the Senator is trying to achieve, there is a danger that what he proposes, even if it well meaning, might be interpreted later as a watering down of the provision.</p>

I appreciate the intent behind the section, but to impose an absolute requirement of notice is a measure too far. My amendment will require a tenant to notify a landlord where a person is staying with the tenant for longer than one month. We all have a right to privacy and that right should be respected.

          <p eId="para_251">I do not intend to accept them. The absolute right to withhold consent to subletting was recommended by the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. It is appropriate in the context of the four years' security of tenure provided under this Bill and because it is accompanied by a provision in section 186 whereby tenants bound by a fixed term agreement are given the absolute right to terminate the tenancy where consent to subletting is refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">We are talking about a case where a house or an apartment is let to a tenant and he or she wants to move away and sublet it to someone else. In such circumstances, the landlord has an absolute right to say no to such a subletting. The landlord would never have met the person whom it is proposed would move in. It is different if the person concerned was living in the property. For example, if I and one of the Senators were living in a property and I, as the licensee decided to move away, that would be a different situation because the landlord would know the Senator and he would have partaken in an apprenticeship. The same would apply if I was living in an apartment and then shared it with one of the Senators. If the landlord had a problem with the Senator, the landlord has a means of redress by approaching me because the original tenant is still on site. However, what is proposed relates to a case where, say, a tenant moves to live in London and sublets the property to someone else who is unknown to the landlord. In such a case it is only right and proper that a landlord can refuse consent to such a subletting and if he does so, the tenant has a right to end the tenancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">With regard to amendment No. 8, it is clear that the provision is intended to cover only those for whom their rented dwelling is their principal place of residence. We are not being ridiculous here. Nobody wants to know about who stays overnight, over a week or anything like that, or if a person is visiting for a few nights and is not changing his or her place of residence. It is up to the person concerned to decide if he or she is visiting for two or three nights or changing his or her place of residence. If a person is changing his or her place of residence, it is appropriate that the person should let the landlord know.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">Amendment No. 11 seeks to delete "6 months" and substitute "three months". Six months is a relatively long time and is such that a bad or ill-willed landlord could allow a tenant to remain for five months in a premises and then terminate the tenancy before that tenant is afforded any rights. This legislation is all about the rights of tenants. Over the years it has been evident that tenants have been neglected. We already mentioned students who come to the capital to look for accommodation and we have neglected them over the years. In the interest of all parties involved, I propose that the six month qualification period be reduced to three months. Everyone would benefit from this.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The purpose of amendments Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, is to afford tenants greater security of tenure. They are designed to ensure that tenants asked to leave a premises before they are afforded rights under this legislation are given a reason therefor in writing. If one sacks an employee or terminates his employment, one must give notice in writing. It is important that a tenant knows why he or she is being asked to leave and it benefits everyone when there is clarity in this regard. These amendments are important and the Minister of State should find a way to take them on board. They are self-explanatory and will improve the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">The amendments pertain to one of the most fundamental parts of the Bill and I am not in a position to accept them. The Bill lays down clearly that a probationary period of six months applies before one can qualify for a further three and a half years of security of tenure. The six month qualifying period was recommended by the commission and it represented a reasonable compromise between the two arguments. The landlords wanted a much longer probationary period and advocate groups such as Threshold wanted a shorter one. This issue was discussed at length by the commission and it agreed on six months. To change this would undermine one of the core principles that helped to achieve the consensus that exists. We have been trying to proceed in such a way that landlord and tenant groups regard this as a balanced Bill to which both could sign up and such that the advantages to both sets of groups are evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Over the years, tenants' rights have been lacking, to put it mildly. This Bill is not as good as the legislation in many European countries, but it is a major step forward from previous legislation. I hope that in the coming years people will move forward another step from what is proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Amendment No. 13 seeks that landlords should provide a written explanation for ending a tenancy within the six-month period. However, it is fundamental to the legislation that landlords be given six months in which they have the right to terminate a tenancy without providing a written explanation. This is part of a very fine balance which, if changed, would undermine one of the core principles of the Bill and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I appreciate and understand the point of the amendment but it is not necessary as its purpose is achieved more effectively by other provisions in the Bill, including some amendments tabled in the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Deputy is proposing a prohibition, worded in very broad terms, of any action for the purpose of avoiding the application of Part 4. The amendment is too general. It is also in conflict with other sections, such as section 25. It is a case of including either a general sentiment or a specific measure to block people with specific avoidance measures. I understand what Deputy McCarthy is trying to do, but we have tried to determine the loopholes that exist and we have included specific measures to close them off.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_288">This issue arose from correspondence I received. I wish to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister of State because I know he accepted an amendment to this section in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The conditions under which a person may inherit tenancy rights are clear. There is a clear indication that same sex couples are excluded. This continues a pattern of exclusion which was sponsored by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs when the free travel pass scheme was not extended to partners in same sex unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">A judgment in this regard was made by the European Court of Human Rights in the Karner case. This section is clearly in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. The issue dealt with in the judgment related to a gentleman called Mr. Karner, who brought the issue to various courts in Austria until the Austrian Government appealed the case to the Supreme Court and it then went to the European Court of Human Rights. The European court held, by six votes to one, that there had been a violation of article 14 of the convention, which prohibits discrimination, taken with article 8, which deals with respect for one's home.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">This is a significant issue. It is incumbent on the Minister to take cognisance of the disposition of people in these circumstances and of the European Convention on Human Rights. Are we to breach two important aspects of the convention? We are dealing with fundamental aspects of people's rights. I ask the Minister of State to look favourably at this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I know there has been some communication arising from the fact that the issue was dealt with in the Dáil. However, there is an obligation on the Minister of State to conform to the European Convention on Human Rights and to show that the Government legislates for everybody and that equality is not one-sided but is for everybody. This issue relates to the Government's duty to citizens of this republic.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_293">I am grateful to Senator McCarthy for highlighting this issue. It is a fundamentally important one. The Minister of State has not had an opportunity to address the issue fully. Nevertheless, I am glad he had an opportunity to put his first few paragraphs on the record because they worry me. The Minister of State said it is up to the people involved to enter into a joint tenancy agreement. That itself is a discriminatory attitude. Would he say to a widow, for example, that proper provision was not made? Widows automatically inherit by virtue of their status. We are talking about people with no status who are not recognised at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">There is case law on this matter in this country. A very courageous man had lived with his partner for 30 years or so and after the death of his partner, the landlord sought possession of the house, although this man had been contributing financially to the tenancy. The case went to court and judgment was found against him. However, the court, in its judgment, suggested that this was a form of unfairness because the law was anomalous. A situation is known to exist and known to be unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">As Senator McCarthy said, we already have a European judgment in the matter. The case of Mr. Karner was directly parallel to the one which occurred in Sandymount a few years ago and which went to trial here. Curiously, in Austria, which is a very conservative country, the lower court found in favour of the surviving partner, as did the next court. It was the conservative Supreme Court which overturned the judgments of the two lower courts. The case then went to the European court which decided in favour of the surviving partner on 24 July 2003, despite the fact that the plaintiff in the case had died. The European Court of Human Rights stated that the issue was one of such a fundamental nature with regard to human rights that it would hand down a judgment, despite the death of the plaintiff and the refusal of his mother, who was the nearest person in law, to continue the case. Application was made by interested parties of a philanthropic nature from outside the family circle and from outside the country and the European court took the matter so seriously that it heard this application and found in favour of the estate of Mr. Karner. The reason given was the question of proportionality. This is an interesting judgment, which the Minister of State should consider. The court determined that there was no requirement on the part of the state — nothing needed to be protected in the interest of the state — to make this exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I remind the Minister of State of the words of a former colleague of his, spoken in this House. The former Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, said that she would need to have very clear, cogent, rational and factual arguments placed before her if she was to discriminate in any sense against an Irish citizen. Is the Minister of State withdrawing from that position of principle in the name of Fianna Fáil and saying he is prepared to introduce discrimination?</p>
          <p eId="para_297">There is currently a discussion about the nature of the family and the Minister of State invoked the word "family" in his partial reply. It is necessary, as many elements in society are doing, that we look at the definition of the family and accept that people who maintain households together, forgetting about the sexual activities that may take place between them, create a relationship that has rights that should be enjoyed by a bereaved partner without this lingering echo of ideological or religious prejudice. Prejudice is all that could sustain opposition to what is being said on this side of the House and there are many decent people on the other side of the House who feel the same.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_49">Question again proposed: "That section 39 stand part of the Bill."</summary>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_304">I tried to explain earlier how this came about. Originally, the section provided that on the death of all the tenants of a Part 4 tenancy, the Part 4 tenancy would no longer exist. When this was discussed on Committee Stage in the Dáil, considerable concern was expressed by Deputies about the position of dependent family members when a tenant dies. The advice I would offer to all people in tenancies, which will be strongly recommended by the private residential tenancies board, is that all prospective tenants should enter joint tenancies at the outset or when a person moves in with another. The situation should be regularised and placed on a legal footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I was asked in the other House, after a long and heated discussion, to amend the provision to protect other family occupants where the sole family member who is a tenant might die. It was stressed by Deputies on all sides that the amendment was only being sought in the case of a genuine family relationship, married or unmarried. At the end of the debate I gave an undertaking that I would try to do that and we took the matter up with the Attorney General. On Report Stage we came back with an amendment that was drafted by the Attorney General and made the precise change I was asked to make. His office considered that the change would not pose constitutional difficulties for landlords' property rights as the Constitution also protects the position of the family. Here we had a case of competing constitutional rights but the Attorney General recommended this as being in order and that it complied with the request.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The amendment that was introduced enabled spouses, unmarried partners, adult children and parents who were residing with the tenant to elect to become tenants and to continue the Part 4 tenancy where the death of a tenant occurs. It was specifically targeted at the groups I was asked to target, married and unmarried couples. It does not cover everyone but it is wrong for any Member to feel that any group is specifically excluded. It does not cover several other categories of multiple occupant dwellings — friends, cousins, siblings, people in same sex relationships, work colleagues or anyone else — it was specifically targeted at dependent spouses in family relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">That is where the debate arose and where I tried to strengthen the provision on the request of Members on Committee Stage in the Dáil. It is wrong, however, to think that any specific group was excluded. Even when I came back with the amendment, one of the Members who was very vocal on Committee Stage wanted to know why siblings were not included but I had not been asked to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I am not an expert in constitutional law but the Attorney General considered that, because the Constitution recognises the family, in this case it would be in order. Everyone can overcome this concern on the first day of the tenancy and the residential tenancies board will strongly recommend in future that in cases of joint tenancies, people register themselves as joint tenants so they will have complete protection if one of them dies.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The broader extension of the provision, to include partners other than those living together as husband and wife, is not possible. The expression is too vague and capable of a number of interpretations. It would not be appropriate to formulate a statutory provision using such a vague expression. It would be likely to include any person who had been living in the accommodation. Any extension of the provision to include same sex partners in sexual relationships would require specific reference to that category of occupant.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I brought forward a measure, having consulted the Attorney General at the request of Members across all parties, and no group is specifically excluded. More than one group is included but there are other groups that are not included. The amended section was composed entirely by the Attorney General and was framed so it did not impact on the position of leases under the Succession Acts. There was a constitutional concern but I brought forward a measure, as requested, and no one has been specifically excluded and I refute the suggestion they have. It was brought forward to cover certain groups as requested and some groups are included and some are not.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_311">I have no desire to antagonise the Minister of State, whom I know is a decent and caring, if somewhat conservative, gentleman. There is, however, an area here that we should examine. The Minister of State says that he has not been asked to look at this area. I am now formally requesting that he does so because it is such a glaring omission.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I have no qualification in law but that has never prevented me from giving my opinion on the subject. I have some slight acquaintance with Constitution. Yes, it pledges to protect the family but it does not give a definition of "family". It might be taken that "family" corresponds to what was meant in 1937 but that would fly in the face of the consistent practice since 1937 of the organs of the State, especially the courts and the Supreme Court in particular, in interpreting the Constitution in ways which would most certainly have surprised the original framers of that document. The belief is that it is an organic document which did not stop in 1937 but continued to develop and that the Constitution contained certain un-enumerated rights specified subsequently. I believe I am correct in assuming that in this situation where we do not have the narrow definition of the family to which the Minister of State seems to wish to cling, it is quite consistent with the Constitution to protect vulnerable citizens even in terms where the rights of landlords come in. That is governed by the superior clause relating and referring to the "common good", the public good.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I again refer to the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. What public good is served by discriminating in this manner against people simply on the basis of their sexual orientation, a matter which is generally outlawed in the European Community and will be specifically outlawed by the equality directive which this Government will be required to pass into operation in 2006?</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Minister of State in his reply raised the question of arrangements for siblings and other arrangements. I remind him that very case was made from the Front Bench of his own party in this House by none other than Dr. Mansergh, who followed it up with a very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>. I thought the article was a little too narrowly focused but he made the point about the position in a caring society of two old dears of either sex who may or may not be related and who may have contributed to the household over many years. What is so bizarre about that arrangement? I am not opposed to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The Minister uses phrases such as "genuine family relationship". I do not wish to tie down the Minister of State. I am quite incautious in my own language and I will not make a meal of it. I was in a relationship for 27 years which is longer than quite a lot of marriages I know of. Did I have no rights at all? Did the person I loved have no rights whatever? Should I just contribute to a tenancy or a pension and leave that person absolutely stranded? As a decent Christian man, what would the Minister of State say to somebody in that situation when he or she is grieving? If I translate his reply into the immediate human circumstances — I am sure he would never do this — it would be to say to the person: "I told you so. You should have looked after that in the beginning. You should have gone to a solicitor." His reply would recommend that in the first flush of romance when two people have moved in together they should go to a solicitor and sign the documents. The Minister of State knows well that human life is not like that. This reply is not an appropriate answer to give to somebody who has lost a spouse and is then thrown out on the side of the road. We cannot say to people that we debated the matter in the Seanad and decided they should go to a solicitor. This is not an adequate response to a problem we know exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">A similar situation was addressed in this House by the former Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. She laid down the principle that discrimination should not be contemplated in legislation unless there were clear, cogent reasons therefor. The Minister of State has not put forward any that I can see. I ask him to examine this question seriously and to examine the question of supporting a reasonable and measured item of legislation. If he is not prepared to do that in this Bill, I suggest a <i>portmanteau</i> arrangement. I have been working on a Private Members’ Bill. A difficulty exists because of the capacity of the Seanad to infringe on the rights of the Exchequer to spend money, for instance. It is up to the Minister of State. There are tragic human situations which are made unnecessarily worse by the operation of this Bill. I ask the Minister of State to consider the situation so eloquently raised by Senator McCarthy.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">A report on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_318">The Court reiterates its findings stated in various previous judgments that "differences based on sexual orientation require particularly serious reasons by way of justification".</p>
          <p eId="para_319">In the Karner case, the justification for the provision made by the Austrian Government was that the aim was to protect the traditional family unit. The government could not convince the court that excluding same-sex partners from the right to succeed in a tenancy would help to achieve this objective. The judgment states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_320">Accordingly, the Court finds that the Government have not offered convincing and weighty reasons justifying the narrow interpretation of Section 14(3) of the Rent Act that prevent a surviving partner of a couple of the same sex from relying on that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The judgment completely demolishes the argument put forward by conservative forces on this issue down through the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I do not believe the Minister of State's present position will change, despite the debate and arguments put forward in favour of our case. How does his position on section 39 reconcile with the EU anti-discrimination directive to be introduced in 2006? This is an important question if we are serious about the implementation of that directive and it has been given a rebuff in this House today. The decision in the early 1990s to decriminalise homosexuality was taken by a Fianna Fáil Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn. It was a progressive and brave step for any politician to take at that stage, requiring amazing courage and fortitude on her part. Ten years later, it is a pity that section 39 of this Bill is so glaringly stark in respect of its exclusion of same-sex couples to succession of tenancy rights. The two do not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I appeal to the Minister of State's better nature to consider the implications of this section in respect of the implementation of the EU anti-discrimination directive. I ask him to reconcile what is happening today with what his colleagues in Government bravely agreed to ten years ago, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the extension of the debate to include equality and human rights.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_325">I have outlined the history of this legislation and the debate in the other House. It is wrong for anyone to interpret it in the manner outlined. It was not designed to exclude any particular group. This is a good Bill which is moving forward the situation of tenants' rights. I am not suggesting it will last forever. I am sure different sections of the Bill will be improved as time passes. There may well be further development of this section. I am aware of a recent Law Reform Commission report which could well affect and influence the direction and wording of the Bill in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The provision in this section is confined to persons who have been residing in the dwelling with the deceased tenant. These are the only people whose accommodation is directly affected by the death of the tenant. The primary concern in this section is the accommodation of those people. There could well be situations in which other people who are not residing in the dwelling might have rights under the succession Acts. It is a very fine point of argument. The premise of the Bill is to afford rights to both sides and, for the first time, afford rights to tenants. If rights are given to one side, they are taken from the other side. This provision does not remove a right from same-sex couples to inherit a tenancy. The section, as amended, gives the specified people the right to become a tenant of a Part 4 tenancy in circumstances where there is no living tenant.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">This is the only instance in the Bill where a landlord of a house or apartment has no say in granting a tenancy to a particular person in circumstances in which there is no surviving tenant.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Discussing an earlier amendment on a similar matter, we noted the importance of achieving balance from a landlord's point of view and discussed whether a landlord should have a say with regard to new sub-tenants in the event that a tenant goes away for a period, for example, to London. The landlord has this right in all cases, with the exception of this specific exclusion. It was possible to insert this denial, as it were, of a landlord's right to choose or give consent regarding a person who would become a tenant because of the constitutional protection afforded to the family. For good or bad, this specific provision denies the landlord the usual right to decide who can assume a Part 4 tenancy. We are doing this because of the constitutional protection of the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I have listened to Senators' arguments and it is possible that it will be necessary to change the provision as a result of future developments, other legislation or the report of the Law Reform Commission. It is not true that it has been included to allow for what the Senators may regard as my personal baggage. While we all have personal views, this measure was not influenced by mine but resulted from strong demands by Members of the other House for protection in a specific case. We have tried to offer such protection and its inclusion was only possible because of other constitutional protections. The Attorney General concluded that it could be included because of the constitutional protection of the family and, while we did not specifically seek to add other groups, his message was that difficulties would arise if we were to do so because it might create an imbalance.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_333">I welcome the tone of the Minister of State's final contribution and his statement that it may be possible to examine this matter in other legislation. Apart from anything else, we may be forced to do so but I would prefer if it was done with goodwill. We must examine the notion of the family and confront the human aspect of the issue. As legislators, we have been put on notice by the courts in this regard that injustice is being done in human terms to people who have lived together and contributed.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I agree with the Minister of State that the inclusion of others may give rise to difficulties with next of kin, which is abominable. I have seen circumstances in which couples lived together happily for 20, 25 or 30 years during which they were neglected, despised and shunned by their families, who then appear at the deathbed of a spouse to claim the booty and evict the grieving spouse. In the part of the country where my Irish roots are, "eviction" is a dirty word. In this case, eviction takes place at the moment when somebody is most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Minister of State stated he is not removing a tenancy. I accept that and I am glad he has shown a degree of movement and understanding of our position. While not removing a tenancy, however, he is neglecting an opportunity to do something decent in circumstances of great hardship and suffering, one which has been before the courts and for which the Legislature was rebuked for its inaction. He should note that he has been asked and solicited by the House to examine this matter in a humane manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I do not want to contemplate the sexual lives of the people involved in tenancies. It would be too horrendous to imagine that every time one looked at a lease, one would wonder what the tenants get up to at half past ten on a Saturday night and who does what to whom. Such matters are not relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I will conclude on a slightly lighter note. The legislation refers to a person cohabiting with the tenant "as husband and wife". If one tenant puts on a lumber jacket and pair of jeans and the other a crinoline, would they qualify?</p>

In the past ten or 12 years, successive Governments have made considerable improvements in equality legislation. It would be a pity if, in the third millennium, our record in this area began to abate. While I can understand that this matter would give rise to difficulties in terms of passing this legislation, Senators' arguments must be taken into consideration. I encourage the Minister of State to examine the approach of other Departments to this issue. I appreciate his disposition and reply.</p>

The Law Reform Commission is currently undertaking a review of landlord and tenant law which will have a bearing on this area in the future. Unless any of the exclusions in section 3 apply, any letting which has the characteristics of a tenancy is covered by the provisions of the Bill irrespective of what the landlord may seek to call it. That is the important issue and this protection is provided by the Bill without any need for amendment. Neither the landlord nor the tenant can make the decision as to what constitutes a tenancy. It is an objective fact which is determined by the conditions under which the dwelling is occupied and the relationship between the owner and the occupant. If the occupant has reason to believe the letting is a tenancy, he or she should proceed on that assumption. Each party can take its case to the board for adjudication if a dispute arises.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">The Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector recommended that appeals of the board's decisions should be to the High Court on point of law only and that the court's decision should be final. Nevertheless, the Bill contains provision for applications to the Circuit Court for enforcement orders where the determination order of the board is not complied with. This allows aspects of the dispute such as an absence of procedural fairness to be considered by that court. This provision makes appeals on points of law beyond the High Court even more unnecessary and there are many examples in similar legislation where such decisions of the High Court are final. It is a standard provision and is particularly so in the case of Labour Court and Employment Appeals Tribunal decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">The provisions of subsection (4) reverse the entire law of security for costs. The latter is not a mechanism which can be used to oppress a defendant but rather a mechanism whereby a plaintiff must prove that he or she is able to pay costs before being permitted to present a claim. It must never be a mechanism whereby a defendant can be prevented from defending a claim. This is almost unprecedented in legal terms.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I believe the argument being made by Senator McCarthy, as represented in his amendment, has already been clarified for his party in the Dáil. I do not accept the amendment and I presume the Senator has received the clarification he required following the Dáil debate. As I explained on Committee Stage in that House, this subsection deals with a party who has not complied with a determination order and who has claimed, at a Circuit Court hearing of an application by the board or by the other party for an enforcement order, that there was an absence of procedural fairness, that material considerations were not taken into account by the board, that manifestly erroneous decisions on legal issues were made or that the determination was manifestly wrong. The amendment would require the board or other applicant for the enforcement order to offer security for the costs of the non-compliant party should he or she fail to establish legal grounds for the non-compliance. It is not normal to award costs to the party who fails to establish his or her case or to require security from the other party for the costs of the person who may not be in a position to establish a case. I do not know whether that assists the Senator. However, the issue was discussed in the other House and I thought we had come to an understanding that the Labour Party had interpreted the provision incorrectly.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_407">In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following paragraph:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_408">"(<i>b</i>) in the definition of ‘national monument’, after the words ‘remains of a monument’ by inserting ‘as designated by the Minister and appearing in the National Monuments Register’,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The term "national monument" is the highest designation which can be granted to a site of historic interest by the State. Designation of a site as an historic monument is of less importance and significance. There is a register of historic monuments and, through my own local historical society in Longford, I was involved in updating it four or five years ago. Similar contributions have been made to the register from various areas around the country. However, there is no such means of designating national monuments, so the amendment proposes to rectify that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Currently, it can be argued as to whether something constitutes a national monument. It is a matter of interpretation. The old adage states "doctors differ and patients die", but arbitrariness in this respect has given rise to problems around the country. I have seen monuments classified as designated sites in particular counties, yet within months they disappear because nobody has taken appropriate action to preserve them. An historic mill of national importance in County Longford, known as the Manor Mill, disappeared approximately four years ago. That stone mill, dating back several centuries, was listed in the county development plan as a protected building of note. The County Longford historical society was particularly disappointed when the building disappeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The amendment proposes that the Minister should decide whether a site is designated as a national monument. If a monument is so designated, it would be listed in a national monuments register, the establishment of which I am also proposing.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The definition of works relates to "works of national, regional or local importance" and is potentially very broad. Amendment No. 2 seeks to limit the definition to works "initiated or directed by the Minister or local authority on behalf of the State". The flexibility being introduced by the Bill should not be extended to private developments in the general manner suggested by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">In recent times, county development plans have been well put together. I have in my possession the Longford county development plan, which was complied by the local planning officer, Mr. Dónall Mac an Bheatha. I compliment the manner in which he put the plan together.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">All county development plans contain several pages designated to the conservation and protection of our heritage. All local authorities aspire to integrated and sustainable development, which is something that should be adhered to throughout the country. We should all bear in mind the basic requirements of the population but we cannot compromise our culture and heritage, including national monuments, in doing so. Guiding principles have been set out in our county development plans, which must be adhered to because we have a unique heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Many tourists visit the country every year and, despite the "rip-off Ireland" scenario, we have much to offer them by way of national monuments. Fox Hall in my own parish is not alone unique in Ireland but is also unique in Europe, yet it has been allowed to go to rack and ruin. It lies in the centre of a cemetery and no great interest has been shown in its preservation. Buildings of that nature should be fully protected by this legislation. Wherever possible, we should attempt to mitigate harm to our cultural heritage, including important monuments.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The protection and conservation of our heritage sites, monuments and artefacts is important for future generations. However, this Bill goes no way towards providing for this. Therefore, I await the Minister of State's response to my amendments and hope he takes them on board in the interests of the State as it would bring about a great sense of pride in our great heritage.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_423">It is generally accepted that we need to improve our method of designating national monuments. While in principle I am not opposed to this proposal, it is best covered by the consolidation of the National Monuments Acts which is already under way in my Department. I am confident we will deal with the issue by this means and Senator Bannon might await the publication of the consolidation Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Amendment No. 2 is not as straightforward and, if accepted by the Government, would immediately preclude works carried out by the private sector. This would be inappropriate given that many national monuments in private ownership are subject to preservation orders and, therefore, subject to consent for works. In the final sentence of his contribution, Senator Bannon stated that we should accept this amendment in the national interest. However, if we were to do so it would not be in the national interest, which I do not believe is the Senator's intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">A high level of consideration and weighing up of all issues will apply before consenting to such works and, if the amendment were accepted, it would be unduly restrictive. If we were to define works to be of national importance, the corollary would be that we would be eliminating works of local or regional importance, which I am sure is not the Senator's intention. If works only applied to developments directed by the Minister, private development would not fall within the definition of the works.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Senator Bannon should re-examine this issue because it is not in the national interest to have a definition which is unduly restrictive and totally ignores works of local or regional importance. In the circumstances, while I will not accept amendment No. 1 today, I will try to ensure it is provided for in the consolidation Bill. I have stated clearly the reasons in the national interest for not accepting amendment No. 2.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">The Minister of State referred to the promised national monuments consolidation Bill. However, if the Government's record is anything to go by, it will take a number of years before it becomes law. I propose that, in the interim, the Minister of State accept this amendment in order that the register could at the very least be established and any changes to be made could be made by means of the consolidation Bill. I have confidence and trust in local authorities and to that end have examined a number of county development plans, most of which go to great lengths by devoting ten pages to archaeological and cultural sites and places of interest. They list the townlands, the nature and grade of the monuments and provide a map of their location. Protected structures in townlands and parishes are also listed. County councils have done a good job in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I already mentioned one of a number of buildings which was destroyed in County Longford. I raised the issue at county council level but no legislation existed on foot of which action could be taken because they were on private property. Mills and other buildings of industrial and archaeological interest are also listed in development plans in order of local, regional and national importance and there is commentary thereon. County council development plans are a great source of information on and document well the artefacts and sites in their respective counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Unfortunately, many such buildings and sites are derelict, semi-derelict or in poor condition. Therefore, it we do not act soon they will be lost. However, we need to find funds. The Heritage Council has given support but its budget is extremely limited. We must examine means to prevent the dereliction of sites and keep them stable. The issue must be tackled now for once and for all. If one generation takes this on board, it will leave many of our monuments in a safe condition for at least a century. We will pass on our heritage intact if we tackle the condition of our monuments nationwide. Grants should be made available for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I was a member of the national rural development forum when Deputy Davern was Minister of State with responsibility for the area. At the time, I proposed that the REP scheme be extended to cover the maintenance of particular or historic sites on farms. Some assistance should even be provided to retain traditional stone built farmyards, one of which I own myself. They have many features which should be maintained such as traditional pig and fowl houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">It should be examined under one scheme or another because it costs money to maintain such buildings and farmers have to rear their families and may not be able to afford to do so. Some of these sites are of national, regional and local importance and should be protected. This is all about protecting what we have and passing it on in a reasonable state of repair to the next generation.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">There is no question of procrastination as far as the consolidation of the National Monuments Acts is concerned. The Government will strive for the publication of the Bill in the autumn with a view to having it debated in the House next year, not a number of years down the road. I appreciate the work and input of the executive on the local authorities which have responsibility for heritage. We cannot say that and then accept an amendment which would be unduly restrictive and eliminate the local and regional importance which, having listened to Senator Bannon's contribution and his familiarity with his local area, I can see is not the intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The House will be aware there are grants for protected structures under the planning Acts. The Heritage Council also provides grants in this area but I cannot be specific. That information is available from the Heritage Council which is autonomous. I will not stray into the area of REPS and the necessity to have farmyards included. That is a matter for another day.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_438">5A.—(1) The Minister shall cause to be established and maintained a register, to be known as the "National Monuments Register", of Monuments designated by him or her as being a National Monument (in this section referred to as the "Register").</p>

          <p eId="para_453">This amendment seeks to insert a new section. I had expected that it would have been discussed with amendments Nos. 1 and 2. It is all about the designation of national monuments. As I said earlier, we should have a register of national monuments. We already have a register of historical monuments and people are aware of it. A large number of monuments are included in the historical register. Given that there are not as many national monuments, it would not be as difficult a job to get a register of national monuments up and running. The amendment, which is detailed, seeks that such a register be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">In addition, there should be grading of the monuments in regard to their importance. Ireland has a rich cultural heritage given to us by our forefathers. Some of the monuments are exceptional. From the Shannon, through Limerick, and right up to Leitrim there are many ruins of old monasteries, castles, towers, forts and so on. Unfortunately, over the years many of those monuments have disappeared. Nevertheless, many fine monuments are still in place, many of which are in private ownership. Where possible, our policy should be to acquire and protect what remains of those structures. It would have been easier to acquire those structures a few years ago when the cost of land was not as expensive as today. While economic constraints have to be taken into consideration, it is necessary to protect those monuments.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Most members of local authorities are of the opinion that their local authority must encourage, promote and enhance the management and protection of those structures but it is difficult to do much in the absence of funding. While there are monument committees in many local authorities they are not active. Such committees can discuss them but no real action has taken place for many years. Resources are needed to move on the agenda for the protection and preservation of those monuments. At this stage the establishment of a national monuments register is vitally important.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_456">It is obvious Senator Bannon has a deep interest in and an extensive knowledge of the subject. There is much to be said for compiling an inventory of all the national monuments. I presume that is being done or has been done and, as such, I am not sure it is necessary to include the register in legislation. It is something that should be done because I recall when the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, brought in the legislation dealing with historical heritage, a particular onus was placed on local authorities to draw up the list. It created much interest and focused people's minds because often there were national treasures in a community that were overlooked and in many cases they were destroyed. I mentioned some of these on Second Stage, such as the P.J. McCall house in Wexford and the Eamon de Valera cottage in the Nore Valley and there were several others. I have no doubt it would be much more difficult for that to happen now.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">In recent years we have heard of national monuments being interfered with and destroyed. Sometimes there is a suggestion that landowners were not necessarily aware of the importance or status of those monuments. I am not taking their side and I am not saying that is a good excuse, but it is necessary to highlight them. One way of doing this is to ask the local authorities to do an inventory. It is not all about buildings. There are many other aspects of heritage that do not stand out and yet require attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I understand the point being made by Senator Bannon and the issue should be taken on board. In the final analysis we are all responsible. It is not just a matter of enshrining it in legislation. It is not only a matter for Government or the appropriate Department; it is one for all of us. The more we can bring different agencies and individuals on board and empower them to do this work, the better.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_459">When I contributed to the Bill on Second Stage I referred to the fact that many local authorities had national monument advisory committees. I was a member of one such committee. As Senator Ó Murchú said, the committees did more than just list national monuments. They wrote short histories of the monument and put a plaque on it and provided walkways to monuments that were difficult to access. Perhaps the Minister of State will inform the House if local authorities still do this work, given that SPCs are taking over monuments work and tourism work, because they have a role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I remember the late Fr. Egan from Portumna who wrote many histories of the monuments of east Galway and of the O'Kelly family in particular. I hope local authorities will continue to do this work or failing that, that some other authority will provide that information and maintain a list and the history of national monuments. This should be done in conjunction with Bord Fáilte to promote national monuments so that people can visit them. In the past the Government provided a booklet on various monuments. One can get a heritage card to visit any of the monuments throughout the country. I would like to see that working and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is doing great work in that area. I hope the Minister of State can assure the House this work will continue.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_176" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_461">That there is wide general support on both sides of the House for the establishment of a register of national monuments as proposed in the amendment is obvious from the contributions of Senators Bannon, Ó Murchú and Kitt. The proposal has much merit in that it suggests a clear mechanism for establishing what constitutes a national monument. Only monuments entered on the register would enjoy a greater level of protection. Appropriately, the decision would be assigned clearly to the Minister of the day as the person charged with the protection of our archaeological heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The proposal to establish a register is more complex than the procedures suggested in the amendment. Issues to be considered involve emergency registration, interim protection, public consultation, criteria for entry onto the register, deletion from the register as may be appropriate and the status of existing national monuments. The debate is very wide and involves issues requiring further detailed examination. As I said earlier, I will give serious consideration to the idea of a register in the context of the forthcoming consolidation of the National Monuments Acts. I do not have to remind the House of the reason for this Bill which deals largely with Carrickmines and seeks to overcome the difficulty resulting from the court's decision. As I spelt out earlier and on Second Stage, the officials in my Department are working on a Bill to consolidate the National Monuments Acts. Hopefully, it will be published in the autumn or early next year to come before the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The idea of a register has a great deal of merit. A pilot study is being carried out in Kilkenny to determine what monuments should or could be entered on a register. Given that the greater area of a mediaeval abbey, the church of which is in the ownership of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, may be in private hands and contain archaeological structures and features, a great deal of thought must be given to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Reference was made to the grading of monuments for which no formal system exists. Current legislation provides protection for all known and newly discovered monuments under a two-tier system. The first tier involves monuments in the ownership or guardianship of the State or under a preservation order while the second involves all other monuments on the record of monuments and places. The grading of monuments has not been found to be easy in other countries. The Department has established a working group to produce a viable grading system for the 120,000 recorded monuments. That is, of course, the register of monuments and places.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Reference was made to the important role of local authorities, the members of which have a function in relation to listed buildings. I cannot foresee progress being made in the absence of the involvement of local authorities and the private sector which plays an important role in ensuring that artefacts are found during development. I compliment them for their responsible attitude to the preservation of our architectural and archaeological heritage. Today, we are considering a short Bill to strike a balance between the protection of our heritage and the importance of providing an improved structure and the question of heritage is one for another day. I will give serious consideration to the complex issues involved in a register in the context of the forthcoming consolidation Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_466">To be a little parochial, 12 years ago the local authority of which I was a member set about compiling a record of protected structures in our county. We invited submissions from bodies interested in folklore and history and most councillors made a submission on their respective areas having consulted with elderly people and others about monuments of note. It is all part of our heritage and culture. We are losing the names of fields and features of our countryside from bygone days and it is a great pity. With the information received we were able to control developments which took place in close proximity to monuments of importance. We were credited with that. With the register in place, we were able to monitor from time to time the monuments listed and consider how to protect them. We were always able to identify areas of neglect and prevent vandalism. A significant number of monuments have been vandalised over the years particularly a decade ago when it was not uncommon for them to be attacked, abused and broken. We saw evidence of that in several parts of the midlands ten to 20 years ago. We had to do something and took advantage of an opportunity afforded to us to compile a register.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Is there a policy within the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to issue declarations as to the type of works deemed to affect the character of a protected structure? Is planning permission required to carry out alterations to a pre-1700 structure? Buildings are being interfered with. We have seen slatted units and silage pits located against the sides of castles. One need only drive from Portlaoise to Cork to see evidence of fine castles in fields with undesirable structures incorporating their walls into silage pits etc. I am a farmer myself and I am aware that people have destroyed some of our monuments by permitting over-development in close proximity to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">If the Minister of State is not prepared to accept this amendment, will he co-operate with me in establishing a pilot scheme in County Longford where we have already done a certain amount of work in this area? I can speak for the local authority which would co-operate fully with the Minister of State in drawing up a register of monuments. It would not cost a great deal of money as it is a small county with an enthusiastic population of approximately 31,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">We have a rich heritage and monuments of which we are proud. I feel passionate about ensuring something is done to protect these monuments for our own and future generations. Major emphasis has been placed over the past ten years on our tourism potential. Irrespective of where we go in the world, we hear people talk about our rich cultural heritage and the fine reservoir of monuments we have from the past which should be protected. The Minister of State is at one with me on this and perhaps he would consider initiating a pilot scheme in a small midland county.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_470">In my initial response I referred to a pilot study in Kilkenny on monuments that could and should be listed in a register. I have no intention of doing anything other than that at present. The intention and the commitment is to compile such a register and to introduce a consolidated Bill by next year or, hopefully, late this year. If not, it will be introduced early next year and we can move on from there. As part of that commitment, I said I would give serious consideration to the idea of a register when that Bill is being drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">One cannot carry out improvement or other works to any protected structure without consulting the local authority concerned. The local authority will declare if such works are exempted and, if they are exempted after consultation, that is fine, but if they are not, planning permission is required. The local authority must take into consideration the provisions of the existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">In regard to the Minister, this Bill does not reduce in any way our responsibilities in regard to the protection of structures. No powers in this regard are conferred on the Minister in this Bill. Under section 14(3) of the 1930 Act, it is open to the Minister to grant consent to a wide variety of activities affecting a national monument. That is in the interests of archaeology and other areas. This Bill does not provide any additional powers in that regard to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">There is a pilot study in place in Kilkenny and, hopefully, when the proposed legislation is enacted, it will ensure that a register of monuments will be complied. The local authorities will play an important role in compiling it.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">What the Senator said about seeking a declaration from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not surprise me. This is a matter for the local authorities. The Senator will appreciate that if we impose our views and the regulations are too centralised, we can be criticised. In framing and drafting the new legislation, I will consider the possibility of providing guidelines, but the Senator's point does not surprise me because we do not have an input in that regard. However, perhaps that could be considered in the context of the consolidated Bill.</p>

Is planning permission required to alter any structure or a national monument?</p>

          <p eId="para_479">Planning permission may be required, but if the view is that the work proposed is exempted, then it will not be required. My answer clearly indicated that this was a matter for the local authority, but we can discuss it with the local authorities and get their views on it. I am sure the Senator in his local authority may have firm views in this regard. We are always prepared to listen. The Senator is expressing this view at an important time while we are drafting the legislation. We may find that local authorities require guidelines and we provide guidelines from time to time. We all welcomed the rural planning guidelines issued some time ago. We do not stand still. We are pragmatic. If we find this is necessary, it something to which I will give serious consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">I appreciate that. We could not move on if section 5 was not accepted. Section 6 is opposed, but it amends the provision under section 23 of the principal Act relating to the discovery or archaeological objects by removing the requirement to report such objects found by a person in pursuance of a consent granted or of directions issued by the Minister under section 14 or in connection with an approved road development. In other words, there will already be in place procedures for dealing with finds of archaeological objects in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The intent of section 6 is to prevent overlap in reporting requirements by removing the necessity to report each discovery of an archaeological object where there is already a system of mitigation in place. It was not possible to accept amendment No. 5 as it would have undone the effort to make the procedure as uncomplicated as possible. To put it simply, with reference to section 23 of the principal Act, one who finds an artefact by chance in the course of a development must report it to the director of the National Museum within three days. However, there is an exemption to the requirement under section 26 for those who apply for a licence to excavate. This extends to those applicants following the ministerial direction or conditions of consent. If section 6 were deleted it would result in overlapping in respect of finds. If an application for excavation is submitted and approved, all the finds can be reported when the excavation is complete. Otherwise, if one were to report finds every three days it would add greatly to the volume of work. It might deter one from reporting fines although there is a statutory obligation on one to do so. Therefore, there is no necessity for the removal of this section.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_510">In page 6, subsection (1), line 32, to delete "Government" and substitute "Houses of the Oireachtas".</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This grouping of amendments encompasses one issue on which, I suspect, we will need to spend some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">My party has welcomed the publication of this Bill and we see the operation of the new commission as an important new investigative tool at the State's disposal in putting in place cost efficient inquiries and ensuring a rapid conclusion to issues of public interest brought to the attention of the commission and fair play for all parties represented there. It is important that we take our time on this matter and get it right. We welcome the Bill in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The purpose of this group of amendments is clear. Since the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the heads of the Bill, my party has concentrated on the question of who will own the commission when it is established. As the Minister of State knows, the previous tribunals of inquiry have been animals of the Oireachtas established by joint resolution of both Houses. A tribunal, in effect, becomes the perennial responsibility of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">In the newly proposed commission, as put forward in the Bill, the Government is attempting a new departure. The establishment of the commission should be a matter for the Oireachtas and not for a Minister or for the Government. This is my party's major reservation regarding the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Let us suppose a politically sensitive issue arises, a charge is made against a Minister on a television programme and there is a view in the Government that a commission of inquiry should be established to look into the matter and report thereon. When such a charge is made against a leading politician, is it proper that a Minister should be directly responsible for establishing the commission, setting out its terms of reference, appointing its members, receiving its report directly and revising the terms of reference from time to time? We are giving a substantial power to a Minister or to the Government itself. Considering the principle of the separation of powers, is it wise that a commission should be answerable to a Minister in his or her respective area of responsibility? We say it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">When we look at the role of all-party committees of the Houses — and we have seen substantial progress in this area in recent years — it makes more sense that the establishment, ownership and appointment of members of the commission should be under the direct control of a joint committee of the Houses, or of each House, which would be responsible for the work of the commission and for its reporting back. As currently constituted, the Bill is an infringement of the separation of powers and gives far too much control to one Minister as against the Government itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">With that in mind Fine Gael makes these proposals. All of the Fine Gael amendments attempt to remove the word "Government" and substitute the words "Houses of the Oireachtas" as a means of showing that the ownership of this very important new model of investigation should be vested in these Houses and not in a Minister.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_518">The Labour Party amendments raise a similar point to that raised by Senator Brian Hayes. Amendment No. 2 proposes that the commission's terms of reference be approved by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Amendment No. 3 proposes that the terms of reference may be amended by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Our amendments have the same objective as that outlined by Senator Hayes.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">According to the Bill, the Government need only make a draft order establishing a commission and this cannot be amended. The order is then approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This leaves the fixing of the terms of reference entirely up to the Government. Our amendment would require the Dáil and Seanad to pass a motion specifying the terms of reference. This would leave the matter open to amendment by and suggestions from the Opposition rather than have the Government simply put down the proposal on a take it or leave it basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The commission will be an independent body. If we want the commission to work it must have the backing and authority of both Houses of the Oireachtas, not just of the Government.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_521">I thank the Senators. Senator Brian Hayes referred to all-party committees, which have been effective and efficient. I agree with him. My view has always been that the committees of both Houses have been much more effective, efficient and capable of getting to the bottom of matters than some of the tribunals, which seem to drag on forever. The Senator also referred to the tribunals as animals of the Oireachtas. He might have more benignly referred to them as children of the Oireachtas, although, given the desultory performance of one or two of them, it is amazing that anyone will claim parentage.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The points made by Senators Brian Hayes and Tuffy were key to the debate in the Dáil. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that we are trying to create something which is essentially different from tribunals of inquiry and which will not be deployed as a simple substitute for them. They will still exist because this is not simply a question of implementing plan B.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">These amendments would change the roles proposed by the Government and the specified Minister — Senator Brian Hayes said that was the essence of the issue. The issue was debated at length on Second Stage and in the other House and I recognise that the amendments reflect strongly held views. In addressing them, however, we must understand the point the Minister was making when he said this is a completely different type of animal.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Bill arose from a need to provide a different mechanism for investigations that is quick, cost effective, flexible, and reassuring to the public about how matters of major concern are to be investigated. The Bill attempts to create an antidote to the present arrangements which are not quick, cost effective, flexible or reassuring in the way we hoped when they were established. It creates an alternative system of investigation. The Bill does not replicate arrangements that contributed to the present difficulties. That is the key issue — the manner in which the terms of reference were previously created left them loose and that has been the source of our current difficulties. The arrangements in the Bill must be read as a new mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Government is anxious that the Oireachtas should continue to play an important role in the establishment of commissions. The Bill provides, therefore, that a commission must be established by government order but only after the order has been approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is untrue to say this is being established by diktat, the Houses have a meaningful role. The draft order must be accompanied by a reasoned statement on the need for the commission and both Houses would have a clear idea of the likely terms of reference at the conclusion of the debate on the establishing order. The establishment of commissioners and the setting of their terms of reference will not take place in a vacuum that excludes Members of the Oireachtas. The opposite is the case, the Oireachtas and its Members will have a meaningful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Section 4 provides that the terms of reference will be set by the specified Minister or by the Government and amendments to the terms of reference will be carried out in conjunction with and the consent of the commission. It is not simply a ministerial diktat.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The provisions of the Bill for the establishment of the commissions and the setting of the terms of reference are different from the current arrangements, but that is positive. The current arrangements for tribunals of inquiry have not been models of speed, efficiency or effectiveness. There is a fundamental need for tight and focused terms of reference and one of the problems in the existing arrangements is that these have not been provided. The Oireachtas gave terms of reference to tribunals in the past that contributed to the extraordinary delays and mind blowing costs. No one at the outset of the current set of tribunals could conceivably have imagined the telephone number sums that are being paid in costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The proposals in the Bill take account of views expressed in the report prepared after the DIRT inquiry by the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance and quoted in the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper. We should remind ourselves that the DIRT inquiry, which was initiated in a committee of the Houses, was efficient and got on with the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The proposals in the Bill result in tighter terms of reference than might arise if the terms were set under current arrangements. These proposals are to be preferred and I am not in a position to accept the Opposition amendments. Having been briefed on this by the Department, I am convinced that the arguments being put forward by the Department and the Minister are cogent and bear scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The arrangements for the establishment of tribunals are not being altered in any way. The tribunal process exists, the fact that the different arrangements are being applied in the case of commissions underlines the fact that they are different mechanisms. We are not creating, as the Minister said in the Dáil, "tribunals-lite", we are creating a different form of body to carry out investigations. They are designed to achieve different ends and they apply different procedures. It is appropriate, therefore, that the terms of reference should be set in a way that allows for a tighter focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Senator Brian Hayes mentioned that the Minister would establish the commissions and would draft their terms of reference. Under section 38(i)(<i>a</i>), the Minister is under a statutory duty to publish a report as soon as possible after receiving it, subject to the need to avoid any intrusion into ongoing or proposed criminal proceedings. We all accept that. It will be available to the Oireachtas and may be the subject of questions or Adjournment debates or be taken up by a committee. The hearings on the Barron report by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women’s Rights are an example of such practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The Minister has given thought to the points made and the issue was discussed at length. He has come down in favour of the existing proposals because the arguments in favour outweigh the points made by the Senators. We are not simply modifying the tribunals, we are establishing a mechanism that is more efficient and will produce timely reports and be better focused. Even if one does not subscribe to the view that barristers and lawyers will write their own terms of reference when they get into these mechanisms, we are creating a focused system that will give a timely response on issues under discussion. This does not create something to displace the existing tribunal mechanism. There may be a case for those being used but this is a different system working in different circumstances to produce something that is more focused and produces its work in a more rapid and cost effective manner. I thank Senators for their amendments but I cannot accept them.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_533">The Minister of State is right that this matter was discussed at length on Committee Stage in the other House. The views we have outlined are genuinely thought out and it is appropriate that the establishment of these new commissions should be within the remit of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">We are establishing a new set of inquiries which hopefully will have more political effect in resolving many of the difficulties that have been left unresolved by the tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Oireachtas established the terms of reference for the existing tribunals. If any fault is to be laid, Members of both Houses must take their fair share of the responsibility. The terms of reference have been so broad and flexible as to allow the tribunals to investigate every matter that comes to their attention. The fourth interim report of Judge Mahon and his colleagues in the planning tribunal is clearly a cry for help in respect of the outstanding matters yet to be investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">If the Oireachtas pools its responsibility for the establishment of these commissions and particularly for the terms of reference, there will be a much greater sense of ownership of that process when it gets under way. The private nature of the investigations can be discussed later.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The natural tick-tacking that goes on between Government and Opposition before a terms of reference is proposed in respect of any of the existing tribunals will be lost once these new commissions fall within the responsibility of a Minister. The following situation may arise where the all-party approach is not beneficial. Where a political charge is made against a Minister, Minister of State or politician, it is only right and proper that the people who investigate that charge are from outside these Houses. Once a charge is made, all kinds of party political implications must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">What happens if a Minister, who is responsible for a Department and who must establish these commissions, is the subject of a charge or allegation in respect of any third party from outside the Houses of the Oireachtas who could make such a charge? In that circumstance, the Minister and the Government are leaving themselves open to the charge of establishing an investigation with their own terms of reference and reportage. This may well happen in the future. The committee system in the Houses of the Oireachtas cannot make such an investigation because of its party political nature, unlike the situation in the United States Congress where people serve independently on a committee. That culture does not exist in this country, particularly when it comes to politically motivated charges. There is a distinct difference between that and the policy implications resulting from the Abbeylara case. I and my party contend that it would have been a more useful exercise had the Government chosen to work with all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas to bring about the establishment of these commissions, their terms of reference and their functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Minister of State has stated that once a report comes back from a commission, the Minister must publish it as soon as possible. I make the point that where a report comes back, particularly about a politically sensitive issue, it should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and placed in the Oireachtas Library. The notion that it comes to a Minister who is a member of a political party, a serving member of Government and a member of the Executive flies in the face of the notion of independence, which, in the final analysis, is what the new commissions will be about.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I ask the Minister of State to consider this proposal, even at this late stage. The House has only one opportunity to get this right. We all support the establishment of these new commissions and the means they will give to find out the truth on many matters of public concern. Some additional thought needs to be given to the exact means by which the commissions are to be established, members to be appointed and the kind of independence which we all wish to give them.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">The Minister of State appears to suggest that if one allows the Oireachtas to set the terms of reference there would be less focus in drawing them up. I do not understand that reasoning. Ultimately, the Government will determine whether or not a proposal is passed in these Houses. If the Government allows the Opposition to have an input, it will mean there is a better chance of considering all the angles and producing the best terms of reference. Less blame could be laid at the Government's door if the wrong terms of reference are decided. For example, many Members on the Government side have complained about the outcome of the boundary commission dealing with Dáil constituencies. The commission had to work within its terms of reference. If it had been given a different terms of reference by the Government, it would have produced a different outcome. There is no point in Government Senators complaining about the outcome when the terms of reference were set by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">As Senator Brian Hayes stated, everybody will have ownership of the terms of reference if both sides have an input and everybody has a responsibility if any problems arise. It is in the Government's interest to allow this. I do not see how it could be less focused. The Government often accepts amendments from the Opposition and these are often technical in nature. It means that more people are considering the different aspects of the proposals and suggesting better ways of dealing with a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I read an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> about the wisdom of crowds. The thesis argued by the author of a book on the issue was that the more people involved in a decision, the better the outcome will be.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">In fact, bigger crowds make for even more spoiled broth. Senator Brian Hayes is correct. The fault with tribunals and the fact that tribunals have appeared, in the opinion of many, to go off the rails, is due to the imprecision and catch-all nature of terms of reference. The Senator made a cogent argument in favour of the case I was making because he then referred to the tick-tacking that goes on in the background. I agree there has been a degree of tick-tacking in the past. We have produced the lowest common denominator as regards terms of reference rather than terms of reference which are effective and efficient. I accept that point and I acknowledge the Senator is correct. He is also correct in saying that Oireachtas committees are not good places in which to carry out political investigations although I would argue that Oireachtas committees should be used far more frequently. I was one of the advocates of the PAC carrying out the DIRT inquiry. That inquiry demonstrated what Members of both Houses can achieve if we have the self-confidence to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Senator Tuffy referred to the work of the boundary commission on Dáil constituencies. The Senator is arguing against her own argument because she argues that the terms of reference which had been obnoxious to Members on all sides of the House from time to time have been produced. It was not a gerrymander effort but an effort by successive Governments, and not just from one side, to produce terms of reference which are fair and equitable. Some of the decisions made by the commission stand logic on its head but it is one person's view against another person's view.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Senator Brian Hayes may have strayed a little in discussing membership of commissions, which is dealt with in section 7(2). The provision that the Government will appoint the commission in the event that the Minister does not make appointments or it is not appropriate for him to do so creates a certain distance between the Minister and the investigation. The provision will apply if the Minister is the subject of an allegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I return to the point made by the Minister in the Dáil when he addressed this fundamental issue at length. He stated he was trying to create a different animal, not a tribunal light or a tribunal with slight modifications but a different form of investigation. We will have different approaches, namely, the form of investigation provided for in the Bill and investigation by parliamentary committee. The Houses of the Oireachtas have been too willing to use the tribunal system or create tribunals with ill-defined terms of reference and then complain when they do what we have prescribed.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Senators Tuffy and Brian Hayes made cogent arguments in favour of the steps the Minister is taking. Notwithstanding that I am always charmed by Members of this House, I regret I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I agree with the Minister of State on the need for all-party committees. People need to read the Abbeylara judgment. The Houses still have the potential to do much greater committee and investigative work. While we may not make findings of fact against individuals, we may make clear recommendations on a range of other issues related to policy, outcomes and performance. Too often, the Abbeylara judgment is used as an excuse by committees not to fully investigate matters of public concern which do not necessarily involve making findings of fact against an individual. This is a central argument in terms of the direction in which we will advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I am still unhappy with the notion that a serving Minister will appoint members of a commission. Will appointments to a commission be automatic or must they be ratified by the Government as a whole? It would be most dangerous and strange if a Minister were to have the sole power to appoint people to a commission without reference to his Government colleagues. I strayed because we are discussing a large number of amendments together, one of which is related to the section on appointments.</p>

Whatever about a Minister establishing terms of reference or receiving a report from a commission, the notion that he or she would hand pick people to serve as members of a commission without reference to the Government is a step too far. I am sure the Minister of State and his officials will be able to indicate if my interpretation is correct on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_557">The Senator made a cogent point as regards the nature of the investigations to be carried out by the commissions. Commissions of inquiry will not reject contested evidence and come to a view that one person is definitely telling the truth on an issue and another definitely lying. It is specifically provided in the statute that people identified in a report of a commission of inquiry must be notified of the proposed report and so forth. The commission of inquiry, therefore, falls halfway between the two current forms of inquiry, the tribunal and the parliamentary inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The Senator is correct that amendment No. 10, which proposes to strike out words in section 7(2)(<i>a</i>), touches on the issue of appointments. Section 7(2) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_559">Each member of a commission is to be appointed as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_560">(<i>a</i>) by the specified Minister, if authorised to do so by the order establishing the commission;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_561">(<i>b</i>) by the Government, in any other case.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">It, therefore, provides for a dual approach. The point I was making as regards section 7(2) is that the Minister will not make an appointment if it is not appropriate for him or her to do so. In circumstances where the Minister is the subject of the allegation to be investigated, it would hardly be appropriate for him or her to select and appoint. The Government would make the appointment in such circumstances and, as such, a degree of separation is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I reiterate that we are trying to create a forum for investigation which has powers in excess of the limited powers available to the Houses for investigation but which is significantly different from the tribunals of inquiry. Notwithstanding the good faith in which Senators made their points on this issue, the legislation creates something different. The terms of reference and appointment procedures are also different for the simple reason that we want to ensure there is less political compromise and greater focus on terms of reference. Equally, in the appointment of the commission, the danger Senators outlined is adequately addressed in section 7(2)(<i>b</i>) and by my explanation.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">Section 3(3) states that the "order establishing a commission shall specify" the matter to be investigated and, in paragraph (<i>b</i>), “the Minister responsible for overseeing administrative matters relating to the establishment of the commission, for receiving its reports and for performing any other functions given to him or her under this Act.” I presume that if a commission is established under the auspices of, for instance, the Minister for Health and Children, its cost will appear in the annual Estimate of the Department of Health and Children. Will the costs be covered by the relevant Department in the same way as the cost of the Mahon tribunal, for instance, is included in the Estimate of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Subsection (4) states: "A commission may be established under this section even if the matter considered by the Government to be of significant public concern arose before the passing of this Act." I presume the message the Government is sending to the House is that some of the existing workload of the tribunals could be transferred to various commissions for investigation to get a cost efficient and speedy resolution. I also presume this does not in any way preclude some matters not yet publicly aired at the tribunals from forming part of a new commission. Will the Minister of State comment? The fourth interim report by Judge Mahon makes clear that it could take 11 years to bring all matters to public attention. Whether this is a cry for help or for more precise terms of reference, I presume the Government may want to address the matter in the autumn. Is it correct that this subsection (4) gives the Oireachtas and the Government the right to establish new commissions which could assume some of the workload of the tribunals?</p>

          <p eId="para_566">As regards the question on funding, the Minister for Finance would be required to sanction funds in the normal manner. The second question referred to section 3(4), which provides that a commission may be established even if the matter considered by the Government to be of significant public concern arose before the passing of this Act. This could not be clearer.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">One of the commendable aspects of this Bill is that it is written in clear English. Section 3(4) does exactly what it says on the tin in clearly conferring the right to establish a commission regarding matters of public concern that arose before the enactment of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Senator Hayes has suggested that the latest Mahon report contains some element of a <i>cri de coeur</i> for freedom from the burden of that tribunal, which may have to continue for another decade at least. God forbid that it should be so. The question of transferring modules from the Mahon tribunal is a decision that would have to be made at the appropriate time and I am not in a position to speculate on that matter. Nevertheless, I assume that because the Bill provides for matters of public importance which took place prior to its enactment, there is no reason such a process could not take place if it were deemed appropriate and if such a request were made. I cannot be definitive on this matter because it is a purely hypothetical issue that has not arisen and any decision would have to be taken by the Government on the basis of the facts at the appropriate time.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Senator Hayes's fundamental concern is whether a degree of retrospection in possible under the provisions of this Bill and I confirm this to be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I take issue with Senator Hayes on that point. The reality is that we may encounter issues in the future which require more speedy treatment in the public interest than is likely to occur under existing arrangements. One can speculate as Senator Hayes did very well when he observed that there may be matters in some of the Mahon tribunal's modules that could be more appropriately examined through a commission as provided for in this Bill. The issue has not arisen but it is an entirely plausible hypothesis and a judgment call would have to be made as to the method which would best serve the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I contend that speed is of the essence in examining any allegations. Where damaging allegations have been made which traduce a person's character, it is unfair, unreasonable and democratically unacceptable that such a person might have to wait for 15 years before those allegations are confirmed as groundless. Every public representative who takes his or her job seriously is aware of the danger in steadfastly opposing a view which a miscreant constituent wishes to be proposed. Such a person can make any sort of allegation against a public representative which remains on the record for years or decades. This is unacceptable in a democratic society. We are in the area of hypothesis and Senator Hayes, although not objecting to the provision, recognises its novelty and is correct to question it. Section 3(4) clearly represents a degree of flexibility by providing that commissions may be established on matters of public concern which took place before the enactment of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">The amendments both deal with the constraints regarding amendment of a commission's terms of reference as stipulated in section 6(2). It is necessary to include the words "so as to incorporate a particular matter" after "reference" in this subsection. One must consider the case of a person who comes before a commission and co-operates fully in his or her written statement and oral evidence, all of which will probably take place in private, but who it later transpires has some questions to answer regarding some other allegations or matters related to the original investigation. Section 6(2) rightly provides considerable protection to those who co-operate with a commission but the effective amnesty this represents could absolve such people from blame in other investigations. This provision could grant some people immunity forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The proposed amendment would modify section 6(2) to read as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_578">A commission may not consent to or request an amendment to its terms of reference so as to incorporate a particular matter if satisfied that the proposed amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the commission in the investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">This makes it absolutely clear that protection should only be afforded on the issue that is under investigation and not on every other matter that may come to the attention of that commission in the future. The current provision offers far too wide an immunity and is too loose. It could be the case that people who initially co-operate fully with a commission may have other questions to answer at a later date.</p>

One of the benefits of this Bill is that it written in the clearest English possible and it is easy to understand what it is all about. The term "a particular matter" which it is proposed to incorporate into section 6(2) is vague, imprecise and unfocused. In certain circumstances, the inclusion of such a phrase could have the effect of limiting the discretion of a commission or of the Minister. The amendment would not be helpful in general and could cause unnecessary difficulty and delay in the implementation of a commission's work. The proposed amendment does not achieve Senator Hayes's purpose. Conversely, it introduces a certain vagueness and ambiguity, which is something that brings glittering lights to the eyes of legal eagles. The current provision of section 6(2) is clear and succinct and the addition of the words "a particular matter" add little to it. I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

It is absolutely legitimate and correct that protection should be afforded to people who co-operate, particularly if that information is given in private, and it is the best way to prevent a cross-examination process that serves to increase the costs of barristers and so on. However, it should not follow automatically that where such an individual provided information, he or she should be given immunity in future. Section 6 provides for that. If the Minister of State examines this issue with his officials between now and tomorrow, that will be fine. I fully accept the amendment may not achieve the end we seek but we are flagging this as a problem that could well emerge in the future if we do not get the legislation right. I am not sure whether this issue was raised in the other House but it has been brought to our attention and it needs to be re-examined. We must ensure the immunity given to people is fair and transparent. They should not be granted immunity going forward, as this would allow people who are guilty of wrongdoing to get away with it because they co-operated in the first instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">The question of somebody being cute enough to apparently co-operate with a view to gaining immunity is dealt with elsewhere. The legislation is sufficient to prevent somebody from being a grudging supporter early on with a view to gaining greater immunity later.

          <p eId="para_584">The section deals with amending the terms of reference to provide for the consideration of other matters. According to the advice we received, the section states the terms of reference cannot be amended where to do so would prejudice the rights of any person who has co-operated or provided information to a commission. This grants immunity from further and deeper investigation to those who assist the commission, irrespective of what negative detail of their roles later becomes available. Is this a wise procedure? I do not know whether the matter was raised in the other House but it has been brought to our attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">I intended to raise this issue on Second Stage but the debate clashed with a number of committee meetings and I did not have the opportunity to do so. The section, which relates to the terms of reference, resonates very much with Judge Mahon's recent report and his proposal to seek an amendment to the terms of reference of his tribunal. A commencement date is not provided for in the legislation and I cannot ascertain whether the issue of retrospection will create a difficulty. I do not ask the Minister of State to pre-empt the Government's response but, if Judge Mahon's request were to receive a positive response from the Government, would the amendment to the tribunal's terms of reference take place under this section or could it be addressed differently? In other words, what are the Government's options to deal with Judge Mahon's request to amend the tribunal's terms of reference?</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The section is important, as the Oireachtas should be able to amend the terms of reference. We should not be tied to the current arrangement. Originally, Mr. Justice Flood was requested in good faith to investigate each and every allegation in public and so on and there was no disagreement in the Oireachtas about that. However, while that might have been a great idea, it has transpired that it would take 20 years, which is utterly unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Judge Mahon has outlined the reason the terms of reference should be amended, with which I agree. I refer to the method of doing so. The Government could reject his proposal but, if it were to respond positively, could it make the amendment under this legislation, which will be passed this week, or would it have to do something outside the legislation? Is a facility provided under previous legislation to allow the Government to make the necessary amendment?</p>

          <p eId="para_603">Yes. It refers to a tribunal being appointed to examine some matter which is under investigation by the commission. To really confuse the issue, it is actually the reverse of the case Senator O'Toole mentioned. He was talking about whether we would use the powers in section 6 to deal with a situation which may or may not arise at the request of one or other of the tribunals. The answer to that is "No". In future, however, if the commission is under way and some issue arises in relation to a finding of fact which suggests that a tribunal should be established at that time, a tribunal mechanism still exists and can still be used. I hope it will be used with more precision than in the recent past or at present. That would necessitate a change in the focus of the commission's terms of reference.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">The objective of these commissions is to require a whole range of other professional people, such as accountants. One does not need solicitors and barristers for much of this stuff anyway. When I read this last night at 11.30 p.m. with my Horlicks in one hand and the legislation in the other, I had to ask why there was a special reference to them at all. It is clear that if one appoints persons with the relevant qualifications and experience they may well be barristers. They may be household decorators for all I care. However, the notion must be challenged that the only people who can give expert advice and have qualifications are barristers and solicitors. That is nonsense. There are people in the Civil Service with vast qualifications who are more qualified than many at the Bar. They could do a much better job in terms of investigation, assistance and advice. This allows me to make the prejudicial comments I have just made and I apologise to the Minister of State in that regard. The reference to barristers and solicitors in this provision is completely out of context.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">This amendment attempts to include a new subsection. It is a slight variation on the theme of the grouped amendments at the start and relates to queries and requests which may come from the commission regarding composition, terms of reference, staffing and roles. It is suggested that where a query or request is made by the commission, that query or request, as set out in amendment No. 12, would go to the Clerks of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is a slight variation on the previous amendment and its sole purpose is to keep Members of the Oireachtas informed as to the progress of the commission and its requirements. It is a serious point. There have been cases in the past where some of the tribunals have inadvertently criticised the speed at which resources were given to them by the Minister of the day. It would be useful that where a request is made, that information would be given to all Members via the Clerks of the Houses at the same time as the Minister receives the information.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">I make the point again about keeping this simple and straightforward. As it stands, section 9 is unequivocal, stating that the commission shall be independent in the performance of its functions. It will be up to the commission to make absolutely certain that there is no interference with it and any commission worth its salt would actively pursue the independence conferred on it by section 9. This amendment would not add anything in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The Senator's point is more about keeping the Oireachtas informed than underpinning the independence of the commission. It would be much better to leave it at the simple statement of independence as outlined.

That in no way violates the objectives of the commissions, namely to get to the truth speedily. We all need to be on the one side in terms of what is required. Some commissions may require substantial resources while others may not. Some may be over in ten days because only two people are giving evidence, while others may take ten months or ten years to complete their deliberations. While I am not straying back to the first group of amendments, there is a need to involve the Oireachtas. My party's suggestion is that queries and requests regarding this matter should come to the Clerks of the Houses and consequently to all Members.</p>

I can see the Senator's point that, for example, a withholding of resources would stymie the independence of the commission. That matter could be dealt with more appropriately by the commission making a report to say it did not have the necessary resources. I do not think, however, that the device the Senator is suggesting would work because it would be neither practical nor beneficial. The best guarantee of a commission's independence is that provided for in the clear language of section 9, as it stands.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_635">In page 11, subsection (2), line 8, to delete "shall" and substitute "may".</p>
          <p eId="para_636">This amendment seeks to delete the word "shall" and substitute "may" in reference to the conduct of investigations. As drafted, the section appears to make the facilitation of co-operation mandatory. This could require the commissions to travel to any destination at the request of a witness. At one stage, the Flood tribunal sat in Guernsey for a few days. The Minister of State will recall that when the tribunal returned, it had to read into the record all the information it had gleaned in Guernsey for the best part of a week or two, which seemed to be a ridiculous situation at the time. While relocating an investigation may be justified in some circumstances, I fail to understand why the commission should be compelled to facilitate co-operation without limitations. As it is currently constituted, there are virtually no limitations in respect of the notion of co-operation. The amendment seeks to give greater freedom to the commission to distinguish and determine what witnesses it wants to take evidence from. As currently drafted, it appears automatically mandatory that commissions will have to go to the four corners of the earth to interview witnesses in respect of modules that come before them. That absolute obligation should not be in the Bill. The Minister should re-examine this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">As the Minister of State rightly said, the objective of the Bill is to give flexibility and make the new commissions realise they have an obligation to get to the truth as soon as possible. We do not want to tie their hands in such a way that they will have to follow up every single witness. As this section is currently drafted in respect of the conduct of investigations, it may well be that every witness will have to be followed up, irrespective of the weight and importance of the information he or she provides. In that context, I am moving this amendment as a means of facilitating the commission by giving it the maximum flexibility necessary to do its work. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's reply.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_638">As the Senator has said, this is a central part of the foundation upon which the Bill has been constructed. The section is important in so far as it sets out the approach which will be taken by the commission. The commission will be expected — and that is why the word "shall" is used — to seek the voluntary co-operation of all parties and is also expected to do all that is reasonable to bring that voluntary co-operation about. That may involve travel and if that is the case, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The proposed amendment would have the effect of diluting that requirement to facilitate the co-operation of witnesses. The result could be a major change in the whole basis of the Bill. I am not suggesting that this is the intention but, in fact, the outcome of the amendment may be just that. The legislation gives certain powers to the commission and requires the commission to seek voluntary co-operation. It expects that the commission will do all that is reasonable to bring that about. If that means travelling to Guernsey or Jersey — as in that case where a person was unwilling to deal with it, although I think the person has since passed away — and if that is the cost of getting to the truth quickly, that is the price that may have to be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">My advice, however, is that "shall" is a qualifying principle, and to substitute "may" would undermine the whole structure. For that reason the amendment is not being accepted. I accept that this is not the usual argument about using the word "shall" or "may".</p>

          <p eId="para_642">It is a different argument. Notwithstanding that, however, the use of the word "shall" in section 10 would establish it as a qualifying principle. We would damage the Bill if we were to substitute the word "may".</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I understand what the Minister of State is saying but I feel that the commission needs to be given the flexibility to do its job. Inserting the word "shall" would put the onus of responsibility on the commission to follow up every single lead, particularly in respect of voluntary co-operation. I respect what the Minister of State has said, however, and in that context I will withdraw the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">I thank the Senator for withdrawing the amendment but he should take note of section 10(1), which states: "A commission may, subject to this Act and the commission's rules and procedures, conduct its investigation in the manner that it considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case." I made the point earlier that it is expected to do all that is reasonable to bring about the required set of circumstances and this gives the relevant level of flexibility to the commission. It deals with the Senator's concern that somebody could put forward something which is totally unreasonable and impractical, but it would not necessarily bind the commission in those circumstances because the let-out is in section 10(1). I hope that deals with the serious point that has been made by the Senator.</p>

          <p eId="para_648">Section 12(1) imposes an obligation on the commission to disclose the substance of evidence to certain persons. Section 12(2) suggests that the obligation to disclose evidence does not require the disclosure of the source of that evidence. That is the distinction. The amendment seeks to bring some clarity to this matter. I want to ensure that a cautious or narrow reading would not result in a commission coming to the conclusion that it feels it must disclose the source. It should not feel so compelled. The use of the word "require" is too loose and open to misinterpretation. I suggest the word "compel" as a means of giving the commission the clarity it needs in terms of disclosing the source of the evidence. It is in that context that we propose the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">I thank the Senator. We are now in the old area of disputing the differences between "will" and "may" and "may" and "shall". However, this is a new one as we are referring to the difference between the words "compel" and "require". I would have thought that the word "require" might encompass or embrace the word "compel". Section 12(1) provides that the witness is to be informed about any evidence received by a commission and that may be relevant to the witness or the evidence he or she is about to give, which we all accept is a fair and reasonable approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Subsection (2) provides that the commission is not required to reveal the source of information to any witness but may do so where it is in the interests of fair procedure and the investigation generally. The use of the word "compel" in these circumstances would not change the meaning of the provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">I am not sure it is all that subtle but I will take the Senator's word for it. He did, after all, read this Bill at midnight last night when the rest of us were curled up in bed with our Horlicks or something else more attractive. If the Senator reads the section again, the word "require" is more appropriate. As it does not require disclosure, it provides that the commission may do so if it feels fair procedures or a better investigation would be served by providing the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I examined this issue because I was fascinated by the use of the words "require" and "compel" and, on balance, "require" is the better word. It is a striking feature of this Bill that it is drafted in very clear English, which is a model other Departments might emulate for once. The word "require" is the appropriate one. Subsection (1) does not require the disclosure which means it does not prevent it either.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure the legislation will be constitutional and that fair procedures are followed such as, for example, in the re Haughey case, regarding the right to cross-examine and present contrary evidence, which is not present in the legislation as it stands.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">Section 12(3) provides that a person who is informed under subsection (1) about evidence already available to a commission shall have the right to comment and so forth on the evidence. This is the primary focus of the Senator's amendment which is well intentioned. However, the Government is satisfied that section 12 strikes the correct balance between ensuring confidentiality about sources and the need to allow named persons to protect their names and reputations. One must remember that evidence will have to be received in private and, therefore, the possibility of damaging anyone's good name is reduced. This section will enable persons against whom matters have been claimed to have an opportunity to answer those claims, which is the concern that underlies Senator Hayes's earlier point.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">In regard to the disclosure of material in reports, there are already clear requirements that all affected persons will be given prior notice if they are to be identified or identifiable from material in a report. This is adequately covered in sections 34 and 35, which we will discuss later. The two safeguards, which the Senators correctly wish to put in place, are already in the Bill. The protection of an individual's good name is ensured by the fact that much of the evidence is taken in private in any case. Therefore, it will not be like the existing system, whereby allegations, some of which are monstrous, can be made and lie on the record for years without a person having the opportunity to deal with them. I understand this is Senator Tuffy's concern, but it is already addressed in the legislation as drafted. Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. The Senator would be surprised if I stated otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">There is a big difference between being able to respond to something in written form as opposed to verbally. If a person was allowed to attend and pick into the evidence, he or she would have a much better chance of saving his or her reputation than if he or she put something on paper. This is an obvious point which explains why we have courts, evidence and cross-examination in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">Senator Tuffy referred to the re Haughey case which does not apply here because it arose in very specific circumstances. It arose in the context of a very public inquiry. It is not a similar position in this legislation. The commission will decide how the person whose name is referenced in evidence can comment and the primary protection is provided by the fact that the evidence will be taken in private. Moreover, sections 34 and 35 provide for the protection that people will have prior notification if anything is to be published which would identify them. Under this section and section 12(3), which is dealt with by Senator Tuffy's amendment, one has the right to comment on the evidence and to produce counter-evidence to suggest whatever has been alleged is incorrect, invalid or simply untruthful.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">This section refers to the duty to inform witnesses of the commission's powers and to advise them of their own rights and obligations. It is important that the commission does this concerning any person who is asked to co-operate with and give evidence to the commission. However, helpful as ever, Fine Gael is attempting to make the Bill as watertight as possible. Amendment No. 17 proposes a form of words which would make the Bill more acceptable to the commission on a day to day practical level.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Legal eagles will scrutinise this legislation once it is passed. The first commission will be established and opinions will be advanced on how the commission has not performed its functions and has been in dereliction of its duties. Acceptance of amendment No. 17 would do a great service to the commission. We suggest in section 13(2) that if no legal representative is present to advise a witness, the commission shall in so far as is practicable advise the witness of his or her legal rights and obligations while giving evidence on oath or affirmation. That would make the subsection more watertight and is more straightforward. Rather than imposing sweeping obligations on the commission in the Bill we should be more precise. I predict that people will run to the High Court as soon as the commission is in operation, looking for glitches, shortcomings and the kind of sweeping obligations contained in section 13(2). I am not asking for a major concession but this would certainly make my day. I respectfully suggest that if the Minister of State were to accept this amendment he would help the commission to go about its work in as practical a way as possible. We do want not a situation to arise where a person runs to the High Court and says the commission is in dereliction of its duties, that it did not advise according to the sweeping obligations in section 13(2). If our wording is included it would give the commission the necessary protection when it is up and running.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_665">I take the point made by the Senator but to insert those words would be to weaken the available safeguards. As section 13(2) is worded, if no legal representative is present to advise a witness, the commission shall advise the witness of his or her legal rights. That is an important protection. A commission must be clear that it has a responsibility to give the witness the necessary advice as to his or her legal rights and obligations while giving evidence on oath or affirmation. To introduce the words, "in so far as is practicable" after the word "shall" in subsection (2) would be to weaken the protection afforded to the individual in subsection (2). It would do no service to the commission and could conceivably do a disservice to the witness. As the section is drafted it is clear and unequivocal that the commission has a responsibility which it must fulfil if that is appropriate. If the commission were to be sloppy or fail to fulfil that responsibility, it would know the consequences would be dire and that people would rush to the courts where their rights would be vindicated. The section is well drafted and it is appropriate that it puts the burden of responsibility on the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">In addition to the witnesses having to behave in a responsible manner, it is incumbent on the commission to do likewise. The Bill makes clear the commission's responsibilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_667">While I accept all of that there is another problem that must be confronted. We are not establishing a court. The tribunals of inquiry are not courts although they are judicial instruments up to a point. We have learned the lesson from the tribunal difficulties that if there is any kind of glitch, ultimately people who may have done some wrong run to the High Court and attempt to attack the tribunal. Tribunals are not courtrooms. As far as I am concerned the more of this work that is done in private the better; there will be fewer barristers and solicitors to carry out cross-examinations and people's right to their good name will be protected. I suggest our phraseology would not give an opt out clause to the commission but would make it more workable, practicable and sensible in the medium term. It is clear the Minister of State will not make my day but we will do our best.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">I will hardly surprise the Senator when I say I am not in a position to accept the amendment. In fact I oppose amendment No. 18 and suggest there are good reasons for doing so. Section 15 provides that a commission may establish or adapt rules and procedures especially on the taking of evidence. I am concerned that the proposal to have the rules and procedures published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i> would add a burden to the commission without, perhaps, adding greatly to the efficiency or the transparency of its operations. I am not sure what purpose would be achieved by requiring publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil. </i>We must look at the totality of the arrangements being provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I begin by directing the Senator's attention to section 13(1) which requires that all witnesses are to be provided with a written statement setting out the commission's powers to give directions to attend, to answer questions, produce documents and so forth. This is provided in advance of the witness giving evidence. The witness giving evidence will have clear advance warning. I suggest clear advance warning is more appropriate than simply publishing information in <i>Iris Oifigiúil. </i>In addition, section 23(4) requires that all witnesses must also be provided with a copy of the guidelines on costs before giving evidence. That is a significant matter. There are other provisions, for example, in section 34 that require the commission to provide all persons being identified in a report with an opportunity to respond in advance of the report being finalised. The Minister has already provided, by way of an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil, that rules and procedures should be made available to persons affected by them. That was in response to a proposition from the party of which the Senator is a member. That amendment, together with the other matters I have mentioned, will ensure that witnesses will be well informed about the commission’s powers and functions far in advance of their giving evidence and at a later stage of the investigation. In these circumstances, I suggest amendment No. 18 is not necessary and does not add anything to the Bill. Publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> would be an additional step that would not add anything to the existing protections. The spirit of the proposition made by the party of which the Senator is a member has already been taken on board in the amendment which the Minister accepted in the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_677">I read these amendments with interest. The provisions in this section apply where a person has failed to comply with the directions of a commission. The issue at stake is whether a commission should be required to give notice where it decides to seek a High Court order for compliance with its direction. The Bill is silent on the matter on the basis that any issue arising can be dealt with by means of the rules of court.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">I do not propose to accept the amendment for good and cogent reasons. While it is desirable that notice should be given to any affected party, there are occasions on which it is not necessary, possible or even desirable that this should be the case. For example, where notice of court action could produce circumstances in which evidence might be destroyed, it would not be in anybody's interests to provide it. The need to observe fair procedures will inform all of a commission's activities and I am satisfied that any gaps which become apparent can be addressed as they arise by amendments to the rules of court. It is preferable to deal with the issue in this way rather than by inserting a new provision in the Bill to oblige a commission to give notice even in cases in which notice would be impractical, impossible or result in a negative impact. I suggest that amendment No. 19 and the associated amendments, which are similar, be withdrawn.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_681">In page 17, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), line 39, after “information” to insert “or requires production to it of a document for the purpose of determining whether or not such document is privileged”.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The Labour Party feels the legislation is flawed in the way it deals with privileged documents. As drafted, the Bill requires in section 24(<i>a</i>) that a commission must examine a document to determine whether it is privileged. This is impractical and inappropriate. If implemented, the provision will result in circumstances in which an entire inquiry might become contaminated due to a commission becoming aware of a matter by looking at a privileged document. The problem is compounded by the fact that the members of a commission will not necessarily be persons with legal knowledge. Any person, regardless of whether he or she knows anything about legal or any other privilege, is entitled to be appointed to a commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The Labour Party is concerned that the production to a commission of a privileged document could have the effect of destroying the privilege of the commission and contaminating the minds of its members. The example of the High Court which requires documents to be submitted is apt. This is a different scenario as the High Court consists of extremely senior and eminent legal personnel who are used to dealing with these matters. The High Court is not a commission of inquiry which might take the information in a privileged document consciously or unconsciously and use it to make further inquiries. This is the reasoning behind our amendment. Subsections (4), (5) and (6) should be deleted and a commission subjected to a right of appeal to the High Court where it wishes to see a document to determine whether it is privileged. Such a provision would permit a determination of privilege without the commission having to see a document.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Amendment No. 22 deals with the same issue. The Labour Party is putting forward an alternative suggestion whereby a commission would be entitled to request to see a document and a person of whom such a request was made would be entitled to challenge it in the High Court by way of an appeal under the legislation. The commission concerned would not have to see the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Amendment No. 24 is an alternative amendment if the Minister of State does not accept the proposal to allow privilege to be challenged without the commission having to inspect a document. If it were believed that a commission had been contaminated, the court could use the provision proposed in the amendment to direct it to cease its inquiry or part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Amendment No. 28 seeks to insert a protection for reasons of constitutional policy. Usually, legislation authorising search and seizure contains an express protection for privileged documents. The Labour Party seeks to insert such a provision in this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_295" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_687">I thank Senator Tuffy for her explanation as the amendments are complex. As a general point, many of these matters will be under the overall direction of the High Court in any event. I will record a lengthy rationale as to why I will not be accepting the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The amendments relate to section 21 and arise from a concern that having seen and examined documents about which privilege has been claimed and which have not subsequently been entered as evidence, a commission may be considered to have contaminated the process by having knowledge of matters it may no longer consider as evidence. The mere sight of a document does not necessarily mean evidence has been contaminated. These are questions which touch on the impartiality of commissions and their processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The purpose of section 21 is to ensure that claims of privilege do not frustrate a commission's work while protecting genuinely privileged and confidential information. The section seeks to strike a balance. The problem identified by the amendment is a recurring difficulty for all legal and quasi-judicial bodies including the courts themselves. The problem can be overcome by reliance on the good judgment of the bodies concerned and the observation of fair procedures. One would expect a commission to exercise good judgment and be bound by fair procedures. Commissions will be subject to judicial review by anyone who feels that privileged material has not been properly handled. The protection of the individual is ensured through the judicial review process and by the fact that inquiries will be carried out in general under the direction of the High Court. It should also be recalled that evidence will have been received in private.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Several provisions are included to ensure that material cannot appear in reports without the affected person first having an opportunity to see it and seek changes if fair procedures were not followed. There is ample opportunity for an affected person to protect himself or herself from any privileged information. As the constitutional protection of the individual is the central issue touched on by Senator Tuffy, it is important to record these points. We do not propose to accept the amendments because we are satisfied that the provisions in the Bill, which were drafted with particular care and attention, strike the correct balance between, on the one hand, the need for a commission to have access to documents and, on the other, the need to reserve privilege and confidentiality. I am concerned that amendment No. 24 in particular could encourage lengthy and costly litigation, which is to be avoided at all costs, that being a central issue in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Amendment No. 28 deals with section 28, and the provision and the procedures in section 21 concerning determination about privilege attached to documents apply also to any document that may be seized using the powers of seizure under section 28, the final point about which Senator Tuffy was concerned. The amendment seeks to provide that privileged documents would not be subject to powers of seizure etc. being exercised by an officer under section 28. The question is who determines that a document is privileged. It is important to state that it is not a matter solely for the affected person to determine whether a document attracts privilege because clearly if the affected person were to be the determinant of what is and is not privileged, the affected person would view as privileged every document that is sensitive and that reflects negatively. The Bill foresees that it is the commission working with the affected person and, if necessary, under the direction of the High Court that determines these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Section 21 sets out a detailed procedure to enable a commission to identify what is a genuinely privileged or confidential document or confidential information. It involves asking the person who is claiming privilege to set out the grounds for the claim and allows the commission to examine the relevant documents. Where the claim is upheld the document is not entered into evidence, except where it is possible to extract certain relevant information from it without infringing on privilege. The section also provides provision for appeals to the High Court against a commission's determination as to the status of the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The provision gives, on the one hand, a clear basis for deciding where privilege exists and, on the other, provides the necessary balance and the protections to ensure that the rights of the citizen are protected but that people cannot falsely claim privilege in order to frustrate the work of the commission. Simple sight of a document does not necessarily mean that the whole evidence has been contaminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I accept fully the points Deputy Tuffy made, but from what I have said she will note that a considerable amount of thought has been given to them. The compelling nature of the arguments would suggest that the amendments are not acceptable.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_696">In page 19, before section 23, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_697">23.—Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance shall publish a table of the maximum level of legal fees payable by the State to barristers and solicitors engaged by witnesses or other persons appearing before or connected with a commission.".</p>
          <p eId="para_698">We all hope, as per section 10, that most of this work will be heard in private, thereby reducing costs so that people will not have to cross-examine each other to prove their good name. As the Minister of State is aware, under section 10, a major power is given to witnesses who come before a commission whereby they can seek to have the commission's work heard in public in connection with their own attendance there. In view of the substantial powers given to witnesses to call the commission in public, we believe that such power could be misused. Despite the fact that we all hope that the commission's work will occur in private, we believe that much of it will end up being heard in public because if one allegation is repeated in public, presumably the person at whom the allegation is directed will want to have his or her reply in public. Although we all hope much of this will end up in the private domain allowing a speedy conclusion to be reached, because of the provisions of section 10 it may happen that much of this work will end up in the public arena, thereby ensuring that the legal eagles will have their day in the sun.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">In section 23 the Minister introduced the notion of guidelines concerning the recovery of legal costs necessarily incurred by witnesses. That is a positive provision. In response to my colleague in the other House, a new section has been inserted later in the Bill in respect of tendering, which is a welcome development. People will have to tender for the work that they want to give. There is merit in the Minister of the day and the Minister for Finance publishing maximum amounts that will be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">As the Minister of State is aware, his colleague, the Minister for Finance, at his party's conference earlier this year stated that something would be done to address the colossal fees that are now being charged by the ladies and gentlemen at the Bar who are working in the tribunals, yet some four months later nothing has been done. The Minister for Finance stated that it is his intention to move towards an annualised payment particularly if a tribunal has been sitting for over a year or two years as against the per day rate which is currently in place, but we have not seen the colour of the Minister's money in respect of that proposal. We have seen fascinating announcements, headlines and even more fascinating interviews but we have not seen action. My party is giving the Minister an opportunity to stitch into this Bill the kind of guidelines that should be published along with the other guidelines he has at his disposal, including the excellent guidelines in respect of tendering, which, in fairness to the Government, it took on board on Committee Stage. I ask the Minister to look positively on this response. This proposal will not break the bank and it is not one that will undermine the commission. If anything, it will bring greater accountability and transparency to the substantial sums of money that are being made by certain people in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">In this regard, I believe they are close to his own prejudices, not only from the point of view of the public purse but from every other point of view. Controls on legal costs are due.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The Bill has been improved in the Dáil by the fact that the Government has taken on board some of propositions made. Senator Brian Hayes spoke about an amendment to section 8, which was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil, to provide a tendering facility when recruiting persons to provide advice and assistance, and section 8 now provides that the specified Minister may — as opposed to the word "shall" — following consultation with the commission, direct that a competitive tendering process should be used. A direction may also be used to decide whether tendering may not be appropriate in every case. The section also provides that tendering may in certain cases be availed of for the recruitment not only of lawyers but of other specialists.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Section 8 also provides that in deciding whether to use a tendering process, the Minister will have regard to the subject of the investigation. In other words, there may be instances where the subject matter is so specialised and specific and where the pool of expertise is so small that a tendering process would not be practical. In other words, there may be instances in which the subject matter is so specialised and specific and the pool of expertise so small that a tendering process would not be practical. The timeframe for the submission of the final report, the qualifications and experience required for the appointment and the functions to be performed and the likely costs, etc., are covered in this section. We all accept that there is a problem. I am not sure how effective these section 8 provisions will be as they are untried and untested but they are nevertheless in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Two further sections also touch on the issue of costs. A separate regime is provided in sections 23 and 24 in respect of cases where a witness seeks to have his or her own fees paid by the commission and the Minister. The costs referred to in these sections are limited to those necessarily incurred in the protection of the person's good name and reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Section 23 provides for general guidelines, including on maximum payment and the type of service to be considered. Section 24 provides for the application of specific criteria in each case where funds for fees are claimed. The guidelines under section 23 are to be prepared in advance and given to the witnesses in advance of their giving evidence. Therefore, they know what is available in terms of tariffs and will be in a position to know in advance of giving evidence how to plan their legal representation. The requirements in sections 23 and 24 address the substance of the Senator's amendment because he is suggesting that a tariff be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Section 17 sets up a procedure whereby when someone obstructs a commission or fails to co-operate with it so that other parties, the commissioner or other witnesses, for example, incur additional costs, that person can be held liable for those additional costs. In addition to noting these direct provisions on costs, the House must recall that the procedures to be employed will also help to reduce costs. I refer in particular to the emphasis on co-operation, private hearings and the limited opportunities for cross-examination — the very points Senator Brian Hayes has identified as comprising the essence of this legislation. These, along with other procedures, should have the effect of reducing the need for legal teams and, therefore, dramatically reduce costs and delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">A fixed tariff has certain appeal but it is not necessarily just in all cases. I share many of the Senator's evident prejudices on the matter of over-feeding legal eagles, vultures or other avian species. However, the reality is that a number of amendments have been made to the Bill in the Dáil with a view to ensuring that they subsist on a more circumscribed diet than they have done in the recent past. Therefore, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">This deals with the recovery of legal costs necessarily incurred and certain other expenses. Section 24 should be stronger to deal with cases in which people do not co-operate with the commission. Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 seek to ensure thatwitnesses fully and completely co-operate with the commission and that the level of co-operation provided by them could constitute a reason for non-payment of costs. What is significant about this Bill, apart from section 16, is that it does not rule out the possibility of non-co-operative people being able to recover their costs. It should be absolutely explicit that certain individuals who do not co-operate with the commission will not be able to recover costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">This is a matter of considerable public import in that Judge Mahon has issued a statement concerning those who either did not co-operate or were not fully co-operative in their dealings with the tribunal to date. There is a possibility that some of these cases may well have to go to the courts because, according to the legislation, one has to show that one has knowingly misled the tribunal. This is always a difficult charge to bring to court. We need to stitch into the legislation very clearly that where someone does not co-operate and leads the commission a merry dance, we can refuse to pay his or her costs. Both amendments to section 24 set out a definitive position on non-co-operative individuals and I ask the Minister to accept them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_303" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach">
          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_717">Senator Brian Hayes is correct in that if somebody tries to obstruct or impede the work of a commission, he should certainly bear the cost of doing so. Section 24 deals with criteria under which fees may be recovered. The amendment proposes new criteria to be considered before payment is agreed. For example, it proposes that the extent to which a person co-operated with the commission should be a factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Section 24(3)(<i>e</i>) was inserted on Report Stage in the Dáil and it enables the commission to take account of instances where the witness fails to co-operate and does so in a manner regarded specifically as improper. It therefore takes into account cases where, for good and proper reasons, a person would prefer to be under direction before handing over documents. There could be good and proper reasons why a person would not wish to hand over documents. For example, doing so could have some prejudicial impact on the witness. Public servants covered by the Official Secrets Act could fall into this category. The amendment inserting section 24(3)(<i>e</i>) was introduced specifically to address such innocent reasons for a person’s wish to be directed to hand over documents before doing so. A witness who wishes to be directed before handing over documents should not automatically be assumed to have acted improperly or to have obstructed the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">This section permits account to be taken of cases where there is deliberate or persistent failure to co-operate and provides that a commission can make an assessment of the degree, if any, of an improper failure to co-operate with the commission when making a determination of costs. It covers some of the Senator's concerns while at the same time accepts that a person might not be fully co-operative yet is not acting improperly.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Section 17 is also important in that it provides that where there is an obstruction, the party causing the obstruction may be held liable for costs incurred by others as a result of that obstruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">In light of section 24(3)(<i>e</i>), amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are not really necessary. In any event, it would be inappropriate to require a person to “fully and completely co-operate with the commission”. Some flexibility is required and the provisions of the Bill strike the correct balance, particularly in that withholding a document until one is directed to produce it does not necessarily mean one is not facilitating the commission’s work and behaving in an improper way. I am not sure if I have clarified the issue but it is clear that there are circumstances in which it is not improper to adopt the aforementioned approach. There may be good, cogent reasons for doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_723">There is a level of agreement here. The only difference between the Minister of State and myself is that I thought it would be more useful if this were specified in section 24(2) in the same way that subsection (1) specifies that before a direction is given to pay costs the commission must be satisfied that the legal costs were necessarily incurred and the level and amount of those costs are reasonable. We are suggesting that a level of co-operation with the commission should also be necessary before the consideration is made. However, if the Minister of State is telling me that section 24(3)(<i>e</i>) has the same effect as my amendments I accept his word on that. It is important to state that people should co-operate fully and completely with the work of a commission to ensure that a matter of public concern is resolved as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">Section 24(3)(<i>e</i>) was introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil in recognition of the fact that there may be circumstances where a person, for good reasons, would wish to be directed before surrendering a document. That would not be improper. Otherwise, if a person behaves improperly he or she carries the consequence of his or her behaviour.</p>

If someone has unwittingly failed to co-operate but has co-operated in every other degree and aspect, that can be weighed up. That is sensible and I withdraw the amendment.</p>

For example, if a statement is submitted and the commission decides, nevertheless, to submit its report to the Minister without making amendments, does the person who submitted the statement have a right to go to court? As the Bill stands, there might be a multiplicity of unnecessary applications to the court by a person who is not satisfied with the outcome of his or her submission. A person must make a judgment as to whether or not to apply to the court before he or she knows the effect of submitting a statement to the commission. The amendment would provide an option to such a person to apply to the court if he or she is not happy with the way the commission is dealing with a submission and would make clear the circumstances in which a person may apply to the court.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">This is an interesting amendment. It was submitted late and gave us pause for thought. The amendment relates to section 35, which deals with the circumstances in which amendments can be made to the draft reports. The arrangements in section 35 are designed to ensure that fair procedures and natural justice are respected, the points made by Senator Tuffy. Persons who are named in reports are to have an opportunity to seek to have changes or corrections made where they believe fair procedures are not respected. This can include going to the High Court for an order seeking changes or deletions of certain material. That is not to say a report may never give details about named persons. It may do so if that is in accordance with evidence and where fair procedures are respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Section 35 seeks to find a balance between the need to respect fair procedures and the need to ensure the timely completion of investigations and that publication of reports is not delayed unnecessarily or unreasonably by persons who do not like the conclusions reached, even where the conclusions are justified by the evidence and by all the circumstances. The amendment, if it were accepted, would tip the balance in favour of those who have an interest in delaying the work of a commission and preventing the publication of its report. I do not believe that is the intention of the Senator. For that reason, I am not disposed to accept it. While I take the point Senator Tuffy has made, there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that natural justice and fair procedures are protected. I would be fearful that if I were to accept the amendment the balance would be tipped to the point which would countermand much of what is good in the legislation.</p>

It is not clear whether or not a person could go back to the court after subsection (2) has come into operation. He or she probably could. It is uncharted territory. I will withdraw the amendment with a view to having it reintroduced on Report Stage and to give the Minister of State an opportunity to reword it with similar effect, if he so desires. I can see problems with the wording as it stands, but by withdrawing my wording the same problems will remain, although in a more unstructured way. I will give the Minister of State another opportunity to look at the question for Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_741">That is a fair and interesting question, which is another way of saying that I am not sure. When the Minister is here tomorrow, the Senator might ask him then.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I cannot see how the Freedom of Information Act could be used in a way that would have an inimical or frustrating effect on the work of a commission. The Freedom of Information Act provides for the release of information with certain discretion as to whether it will have a negative effect. It is not an absolute; a freedom of information request is just that — a request — particularly where it touches on functions of a judicial or quasi-judicial nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">It would be difficult to give an absolutely certain reply to the question because it would depend on the circumstances of the case. When freedom of information requests are being processed there is a distinction between the administrative element, which can be requested, and issues relating to judicial policy. It is impossible for me to say that the Act will apply either in every circumstance or under no circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Freedom of Information Act is clear on this in so far as it is believed by the Parliamentary Counsel to have an impact on this legislation.

I am not suggesting that any information at the disposal of the commission should be made public but there is a right of knowledge on issues such as fees, resources and staff. None of the information will upset the work of the commission. The public and the Oireachtas have a right to know how much money is being spent on a commission, what it is doing and how near it is to concluding. Even the interim reports are being sent directly to the Minister, removing Oireachtas Members from the loop again, so it is necessary that some of the correspondence between the Minister and the commission is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_756">The Minister of State and his officials will be aware that on Second Stage I spoke at length on the issue of the definition of a child being a person of not more than 18 years of age and the difficulty of children who, because of their special needs and disability, start school at a later age than other school going children. They sometimes start school at six and seven years of age instead of at the age of four or five. There is an issue about them reaching the age of 18 years before having completed their education. Often when children with a disability are in school, they also have additional health problems which means they need to spend longer at school. As I said on Second Stage, the onus is on the Government because the Opposition cannot insert an amendment, given that it would mean a charge on the State. It is up to the Government to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I have been informed by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that the Supreme Court has defined the age of a child to be up to 18 years. This is a fine Bill, a great Bill which is long awaited. I have no wish to disrupt its passage through the House but I cannot stand by and allow legislation to go through which I believe is fundamentally flawed. If children with special needs are being given rights up to the age of 18 years, then they should be given the right in this Bill and not in any other legislation, such as a disability Bill, to continue their second level education past the age of 18 years. It is not appropriate to define education in terms of years, given that these children have special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I appeal to the Minister of State and his officials to consider this again before Report Stage and to consider the possibility of amending the legislation somehow or other, whether in the definition or with the insertion of a new section, changing the word "student" or extending the age beyond 18 years. I understand there are legal issues to be addressed. I wish to put on record that the Bill as it stands is fundamentally flawed in that it does not address the special needs of children. If it is passed as it stands, we will have done a disservice to children who have special needs. While I will not vote against the section, if the Government is not in a position to deal with the issue on Report Stage, which I believe is scheduled for Thursday this week, I will find it very difficult to allow the legislation pass without making that point and doing something which I would very much regret having to do. I am pleading with the Minister of State that between now and Report Stage, he considers making it very clear in this House how the Government will deal with the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">I have specific questions which require specific answers. A child with special needs may start school at six and a half or seven years of age because he or she is not ready for junior infants until that age. During their schooling, the child may miss school for a year or two due to illness, such as a congenital heart disease. By the time the child reaches second year in secondary school, they may already be 17 years of age. The Minister of State's officials will say it can be seen whether the goals in the education plan have been achieved. We are then pushing the responsibility away from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Health and Children. We are saying to the parents of the child that they must now refer to different legislation, the disability Bill or whatever, which the House has not seen yet, and have the child's rights provided for by the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The difficulty is that when tighter economic circumstances arise and a Minister for Finance tells Ministers they must all keep their budgets within allocations, the Minister for Health and Children will not provide for the education of a person aged 19, 20 or 21 years with special needs if he or she does not have a legal right to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">There is no reason we cannot provide statutory rights greater than constitutional rights. The Constitution of which we are so proud is a statement of rights on which we can build. I appeal to the Minister of State to examine the Bill before Report Stage to find a way to address this issue and allow the Houses to pass it in a form that is right and proper for all children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_762">Having raised this issue on Second Stage, I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Cox. The Bill effectively excludes anyone aged over 18 years from benefiting from its provisions. It would be an advantage if we could identify legislation which would benefit such persons but we do not have a disability Bill and are not aware of its contents. Reports indicate, however, that the Minister responsible, who is not the Minister for Education and Science, is hesitant to introduce a rights based Bill. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill is long overdue but very good legislation. As Senator Cox and other Senators have pointed out, the glaring difficulty with it is its failure to provide for education for persons with disabilities beyond the age of 18 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Most children will start primary school at four or five years of age. Given that a child with learning difficulties may not be identified as having special needs at such an early stage, he or she will experience a delay in starting education. The law of averages indicates that he or she will experience additional delays while at primary school. One need only consider the delays many students have experienced in recent years while trying to have an assessment carried out. Many cannot get assessments and, as Senators will be aware, such children can expect repeated delays and excuses if they rely on health boards, an issue we will discuss later.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">In second level, students will experience further delays for various reasons. It is conceivable, therefore, that persons with learning difficulties will not reach the end of their education by the age of 18 years. For this reason, it is vital that the Minister re-examine this matter and use all means necessary, which are best known to him and his officials, to allow persons with special needs to continue with their education after the age of 18 years.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_768">I also raised this point on Second Stage. In making an assessment of a child which will form the basis of an education plan, we must bear in mind that a person aged 18 years may have a mental and reading age of six years. I am concerned there will be no continuity. Will a child who reaches 18 years of age in the middle of an educational programme be unable to continue the programme after the end of the school year? In other words, will the programme stop when the child turns 18 years? Will the Minister of State guarantee that the forthcoming disability Bill will provide for continuity to ensure that a child is able to complete any programme devised for him or her beyond the age of 18 years? Will he assure me that parents will be made aware that continuity is guaranteed irrespective of the location to which the child is transferred?</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I do not mind if the plan does not involve education provided the needs of the child will continue to be met after the age of 18 years. If the Minister assured the House that the forthcoming disability Bill would provide for this continuity, I would have no difficulty with the legislation. I am concerned that a child's education plan would be discontinued in the June following his or her 18th birthday, thus forcing the parents to start all over again with a new assessment and different expertise, and to place their child in a different programme. Will the Minister of State comment on this point?</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_770">Other Senators have largely covered the matters I wished to raise. I ask the Minister and the Department to reconsider this issue. The idea that the right to education no longer applies once a person turns 18 years does not fit in with reality on the ground. Most students will complete second level education at the age of 19 years as a result of transition year and the policy of many primary schools of accepting children from the age of five years, a trend which is likely to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">People have a right to free third level education provided they obtain a place. We are trying to promote the idea of lifelong learning. The constitutional right to education until the age of 18 years is outdated in practice. For this reason alone, but also for the reasons outlined by other Senators, including the different circumstances of persons with special needs or disabilities and the need to ensure they are properly provided for in terms of educational provision, we need to move the goalposts on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and other amendments have been ruled out of order because they impose a charge on the Revenue. Given that the legislation also imposes a charge on the Revenue by providing rights for children aged under 18 years, I do not understand the reason our amendments were disallowed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_773">I am sympathetic towards the concerns articulated on both sides. Nobody wants a lacuna to result from, or even be defined in, the Bill for post-18 year olds. Those of us who have been in the educational field or are parents will have children or know friends of their children who availed of or should have been able to avail of special educational facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I am not sure how amending the terms of the Bill would meet the needs and concerns of previous speakers in a way that it does not already. Perhaps the Minister of State or Senators will enlighten me in that regard. I was aware before Second Stage that the term "child" was defined in section 1 as a person not more than 18 years of age but also that section 15 dealt extensively with the need to have a transitional plan, namely a plan that would straddle both the end of second level education and the move into continuing education. I was also aware of the manner in which the Bill sets down the terms by which the principal of the school, the special educational needs organiser or the National Council for Special Education would address this important issue, which must be confronted by the Minister of Education and Science, his Department, the Government and Members of both Houses. It is difficult to see what more could be included in the Bill, beyond the provisions of section 15, to anticipate and account for these difficulties and what extra provisions, assertions or aspirations can be included to adequately address the concerns shared by all in this House and by the Minister of State. We would like to see the Bill meet these needs in a definitive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I understood before I spoke on Second Stage that there was a Supreme Court decision regarding the 18 years of age issue. That does not have to be sacrosanct in perpetuity. I also understood that the proposed disability Bill is deemed by the Government to be the more appropriate vehicle to deal with this issue. I may be wrong in this, as may the Government, but that was my clear understanding before Second Stage. I also understand that an advocacy mechanism will be launched next Thursday by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, as a consequence of a detailed study on the issue of advocacy for people with disabilities. What can be included in this Bill to meet our concerns and tackle the lacuna we all agree exists and which section 15 attempts to address?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_776">The amendments to section 1 have been ruled out of order but the substance of Senator Cox's contribution reflects their intention. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has been penalised in this discussion for being first out of the traps. He has produced the legislation he promised and he was very open to accepting amendments. The limit for such amendments is now unfortunately approaching because the Minister has to consider the interdepartmental allocation of responsibilities in this matter. The Supreme Court's judgment in the Sinnott case was very clear-cut on the matter of the right of children to receive free primary education and that this right ceased at 18 years of age. The Bill does contain some rights-based elements for those over 18 but that judgment puts a definite colour on how the Minister must relate to his colleague regarding the provision of services in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">That is not to say that a person with special educational needs will miss out upon reaching the age of 18. Section 15 expressly provides that regard must be had in the planning and reviewing of education plans to the provision that must be made to allow the child to continue his or her education beyond that age. It also provides that where a child will reach 18 in the following year, the council established under the legislation must assess the extent to which goals in previous plans met the child's special needs, the reasons for any failure in this respect and the effect this had on the child. The educational plan for that year must address any such effects. These measures can continue after the age of 18 and this will aid the continuation of services when the child becomes an adult and begins to enjoy rights under the proposed disability Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The forthcoming disability legislation will deal more specifically with the delivery of services including educational services to adults with disabilities. It will ensure that persons aged over 18 with educational disabilities have access to a further assessment of their needs, where relevant, and an individual service statement. The Minister has included a continuity provision in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2003 but subsequent to the Sinnott case he must have some basic agreement with the other Departments on the allocation of responsibilities. The Minister has not defaulted at all in that he has brought this legislation through the Dáil and is now presenting it for the consideration of this House. His Department has worked closely with officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure consistency and a complimentary approach between this Bill and the disability Bill that will emerge from that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">There is no disagreement in principle between the Minister and what Senators have said. The difference is simply one of approach in deciding how best to address the needs of those with disabilities. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a statutory framework within which the special educational needs of children with disabilities can be guaranteed as a right enforceable by law. Together with the introduction of an advocacy service for both children and adults under the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill sponsored by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, this Bill and the disability Bill will offer a complete and seamless service, albeit with different regimes, for both children and adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">In terms of providing that seamless service, the Minister through section 15 has ensured that there is at least joined up thinking coming from the Department of Education and Science regarding the establishment of that basic scaffolding of rights for all persons with special educational needs. The Minister is sympathetic to the points made by Senators and he discussed this issue with me before the commencement of Committee Stage in this House. Section 15 of this Bill and the forthcoming disability Bill address the needs of those with special educational needs. A careful examination of section 15 shows that this Bill does not exclude those over 18 years of age from its provisions. The Bill represents a rights-based approach at least in continuity and the provision of services consequent upon that continuity. That is as far as the Minister can go on that matter. The amendments have been ruled out of order because the scheme and purpose of the legislation is clear regarding the definition of the child contained in the interpretation section.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_330">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_781">I mentioned on Second Stage that we have already involved the Department of Finance in education and the situation is now further complicated by the involvement of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One does not have to turn the clock back far to realise how ineffective the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been in exercising those aspects of child education committed to its control. There was no place to detain those children in the first instance. We now find ourselves in a position where the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be drawn into the system of continuing education for people with special educational needs. I regret that the Minister of State cannot offer us anything better by way of guarantee of continuity within the Department of Education and Science. The Minister for Education and Science should have control of education for the child. The Minister of State said the school principal will be aware that there must be continuity in a child's education and he reassured the House that the principal will endorse the education plan so that there will be continuity and no disruption will be caused to the parents or the child. I am happy with the section.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_331">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_782">I am happy with the Minister of State's comments but my difficulty remains. By defining a child as someone under the age of 18, there will be a problem. Section 15 provides for a review of the education plans of children within 12 months of them reaching 18 years. They may attend school and have an education plan reviewed and evaluated that year but, in some cases, a child may not attend school during that important year because he or she is out sick for six or nine months. The school will no longer have the necessary supports in place that he or she needs. The child's parents will contact the principal the following September to say their son or daughter is ready to start again but the principal will say he must contact the Department of Health and Children to have an assessment carried out, ascertain whether the education plan is still all right and pursue resources because of the break in the child's school attendance.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">If the legislation provided that resources should be provided to such children until they were aged 21, the principal would not have to worry. He would not have to contact health boards and so on and he could deal with the issue himself. This provision should be enshrined in this excellent rights-based legislation. The Minister of State is correct that the Minister for Education and Science is ahead of his time and he should be commended on the legislation. If there is no difference regarding defining the age of a child in terms of continuity, then in the context of constricted finances in the future and other challenges that may have to be faced, the provision of resources should be copperfastened and enshrined in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I accept the Minister of State may not have the answer but it is our responsibility to enshrine that right in this legislation. I hope he will convey my comments to the Minister for Education and Science and that he may be able to do something before Report Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_332" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_785">Senator Ulick Burke referred to the position of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under the Children Act 1908, boys under 16 and girls under 17 are committed to the Department of Education and Science when they are convicted of offences and, therefore, the only children for whom the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility are male offenders aged 16 or 17 and females offenders aged 17. The number of female offenders is small.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The major difficulty in the implementation of the Children Act has been the issue of whether the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should provide a dedicated facility for 16 and 17 year old females. The scheme envisaged under the Act was that all offenders under 16 years would be the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and 16 and 17 year olds would be the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">The vast majority of juvenile offenders are detained by the Prison Service at St. Patrick's Institution on behalf of the Department. A number of them are held in other institutions for geographical reasons. I have arranged for a substantial teaching allocation for the new wing of St. Patrick's Institution which has yet to open. I appreciate the Senator's concern about this issue. There was always good educational provision in the industrial and reformatory schools. They will become child detention schools under the Children Act and the Department of Education and Science has always taken its responsibility seriously in this regard. Teachers in these institutions are part of the national school system, although the children are a little older than the national school age.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The education of male offenders aged 16 and 17 is the responsibility of the vocational education committee where the penal institution is located. I am glad there have been improvements in this area. I appreciate the Senator's concern that their needs are not always at the top of the education queue. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has begun to address its responsibilities in this area in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Senator Cox asked me to communicate the issue she raised to the Minister and I will do so. However, with regard to children who do not attend school in their final year, their right to an assessment is provided for in the legislation. That child is not in the care of a principal at a particular school but the right is enshrined in the legislation. Under section 15, the child has the right to a plan for his or her future educational needs. That right is not dependent on the existence of a principal or attendance at a school.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">However, Senator Cox referred to the case of a child who does not undergo an assessment that year. That must be dealt with under the disability legislation because the person will be aged over 18 by the time the right to an assessment arises. The disability Bill will determine that issue in terms of an independent right to an assessment by the health authorities. This relates to the interdepartmental division of responsibilities. I assure the Senator the issue will be addressed in the disability legislation and that is as far as I can go. Where the child has passed the age of 18, the independent right of assessment will be in the hands of the health authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The Minister for Education and Science and his officials have thought through the rights that need to be provided in the education system. I accept if joined up thinking is to succeed in this area, other Departments must co-operate through a clear statutory framework with the Department of Education and Science. The difficulty with the disability Bill is achieving interdepartmental co-operation and joined up thinking between the Departments. I am Minister of State at three Departments and while, happily, I do not have charge of financial decisions, I can see at one remove the need for greater joined up thinking between these Departments. The Department of Education and Science has gone a long way in this legislation. It is ahead of the pack and it has also provided for continuity. It is up to the other Departments to bring forward legislation that will lock in with this measure.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_797">2.—It is hereby declared that, in enacting this Act, the Oireachtas has had regard to the following principles:—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_798">(<i>a</i>) legislation in the area of education of persons with disabilities must be based on international human rights standards;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_799">(<i>b</i>) the overall objective of such legislation must be equal access to effective and adequate levels of education;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_800">(<i>c</i>) education should be provided within the mainstream education service or in the least restrictive alternative;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_801">(<i>d</i>) education services should be based on an individualised assessment of need;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_802">(<i>e</i>) parental involvement and where possible, involvement of the person with disabilities should be a central element of the process;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_803">(<i>f</i>) delivery of services should be based on the principle of progressive achievement;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_804">(<i>g</i>) a rights-based system of enforceable remedies is an essential component of any system of redress”.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The purpose of the amendment is to state a number of general principles we consider should apply to the legislation. The statement of principles is taken from the submission by the Irish Human Rights Commission, although it is slightly changed. The commission referred to judicial remedies in its final paragraph, while we suggest a more general formula relating to rights-based, enforceable remedies. It would be helpful to have these kinds of general principles in the legislation and it deals with a number of issues which came up on Committee Stage in the Dáil, such as requiring that education services be based on individualised assessment of needs, parental involvement and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">The amendment reminds me somewhat of Article 45 of the Constitution and the directive principles of social policy. Those are laudable aspirations which no one would disagree with, but in terms of hard statutory draftsmanship, everything in the Senator's proposal is already contained in different parts of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">For example, there is an aspiration in the amendment that the Bill be rights-based, but all the matters addressed in the amendment are inherent in the Bill. The amendment appears to take the place of the Long Title, which would be a more appropriate place to deal with the general objectives of the legislation. The Bill already refers to the desirability of conforming with best international practice. The Minister for Education and Science will be under a duty to conform with and promote best practice and he or she will be advised on that by the National Council for Special Education. Those roles would be confused by the amendment, which could be unenforceable. Again, the aspiration to equality is stated in section 13, where it has far greater effect. The Bill already requires the Ministers for Education and Science, Health and Children and Finance to make resources available for the implementation of the Bill's provisions. Senator Burke may have a separate argument on that section — he has already outlined his views on that provision and he may revisit this issue. We must be conscious of the need to ensure that children with special educational needs have the same right to avail of education as their peers without special needs. That clear statement is already made in the Bill and meets the aim of paragraph (<i>b</i>), as set out by Senator Tuffy.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Paragraph (<i>c</i>) refers to inclusive education and again, under the existing term, section 2 is a very practical and enforceable statement of the child’s rights under the Bill. The proposed amendment could not add to that and similar considerations apply to paragraphs (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>). While I do not want to dissent from the sentiments contained in section 2, objectives of that type — “sentiment” may be somewhat patronising — should be contained in the Long Title or set out with greater specificity in the individual provisions of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">I am not sure I agree with the Minister of State. What the amendment seeks would be akin to putting a charter in the legislation. The Minister of State said that certain things are inherent in the Bill but this spells them out more specifically. Paragraph (<i>e</i>) mentions the involvement of the person with the disability as an element of the process. The rights-based system is also specified here, which helps underpin the legislation itself and give some kind of charter. It is not the same as the Long Title; it is just a suggestion from the Labour Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_810">It is not normal practice in our tradition of statutory draftsmanship to have declarations of principles as ordinary sections in legislation. The declaration of principle or objective is contained in the Long Title and I do not want to recite that again, but it is very clear that the objectives set out in the Long Title conform, by and large, with the amendment. Please God it will not fall to this Bill to be construed by the courts too often, but if it does then clearly the courts will construe it in the light of that Long Title. It is not our normal practice to insert a separate section outlining general principles. That section would not have any particular weight as against the other sections, many of which already contain the statements of objectives or particular principles which the Senator has sketched out in the section.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_816">In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_817">3.—Where both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children have joint roles under a provision of this Act, they shall establish a central body with responsibility for the co-ordination of education and health services in these areas.".</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The Minister of State has dealt with this issue already. He mentioned greater joined-up thinking regarding his responsibilities in justice, health and education. On the other hand he also mentioned a division of responsibilities. This is important and all of us know of the delays which have occurred over the years with the Department of Education and Science depending on the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, for assessments and for any services for which they were responsible or which were requested by either inspectors or departmental officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The substance of this amendment would co-ordinate the efforts of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. My preference is for the co-ordination to occur under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science. Some of the bodies which made submissions clearly indicated that that Department would have responsibility for co-ordinating those efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">A parent who suddenly realises his or her young child has special needs experiences great trauma. He or she then has to hassle the Department of Health and Children for basic entitlements, never mind rights, which is a daunting experience. Moving on a few years, when the child is at school going age the parents have to take on the Department of Education and Science. I read into the record the delays people have experienced in getting assessments. The average wait is six and a half months, while a quarter of those involved wait nine months. Some must wait as long as five years. That causes great difficulties for young children with special needs who are receiving education. The delay is crucial and is having a serious effect down the line. It also relates to the section we dealt with earlier. Ordinary parents who are confronted with that difficulty will have to deal with two different Departments. For example, a family that had emigrated, returned home two years ago with three children, two of whom required special assistance. They went to the local national school and an assessment was requested but the principal could not obtain one at that time. In November 2003, the children's mother wrote to the relevant section in the Department of Education and Science. To date, however, she has not even received an acknowledgement from the Department, let alone a reply as to what it intends to do. This mother has had to seek an assessment privately. That assessment was sent to the Department subsequently but was never acknowledged. In the absence of a statutory provision by the Department of Education and Science, that parent went about the process but failed to achieve anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">From now on, we must co-ordinate the efforts of the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, under the auspices of the latter Department. The endeavours and expertise of both Departments must be combined. The Minister of State should include the new section in order to eliminate the hardship experienced by many parents, as well as the delays and difficulties faced by their children. Where such difficulties can be eliminated, the Minister of State should act to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">The amendment has much to recommend it and I support the principles articulated by Senator Ulick Burke. Over the years, many opportunities were lost due to a lack of co-ordination between the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The appointment of the Minister of State, whose responsibility spans all three Departments, is a clear vindication of the need for such interdepartmental co-operation. I commend him for his work and commitment to all three Departments. There is nothing about Senator Burke's comments with which I could disagree in principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">On an interim basis, sections 39 and 40 appear to address adequately the issues the Senator referred to concerning the establishment of a central body. It might be somewhat pre-emptive to establish a central body by virtue of this Bill, given that the disability Bill will follow subsequently. The Minister of State has stated categorically that the disability Bill will deal with all the issues running in parallel with this Bill. He has also made it clear that the education aspect is to be continued right through into adulthood. I am extremely supportive of what Senator Burke has had to say, but I am worried about the timing of the amendment and the appropriateness of deciding now whether it should be taken in the context of this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I support the amendment. I have experience of dealing with this issue that was raised with me by parents of children with special needs in a local school catering for children with autism. When I raised the issue with the Department of Education and Science, however, I was told it concerned the Department of Health and Children, and <i>vice versa</i>. The lines were crossed in that case but the proposed central body would help to prevent these situations from arising. If such an issue had to be dealt with, one could approach a centralised body that would provide an answer.</p>

          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_825">I agree with all the sentiments expressed. Over the years, various agencies have been created but they have not always improved efficiency. The issue is whether the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children do their jobs properly. The Minister has introduced some good reforms and has made transparent the systems within the Department of Education and Science catering for various requirements. However, we have ongoing problems. For example, we are still unable to find out from the Department whether appropriate facilities will be in place in a Galway school this autumn to cater for four children with special needs. This happens all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I do not agree with the method Senator Ulick Burke has suggested concerning the establishment of another centralised body with responsibility for co-ordination. The Bill sets required time limits for certain actions to be undertaken, so if the legislation is implemented appropriately in the Department we should be able to deliver the services to which Senator Burke referred. There is a great need for co-ordination, especially from the moment a diagnosis is made — whether that is in hospital when a disabled child is born or later on when autism or ADHD is identified. It then becomes clear that the child has special needs and parents must contemplate a range of issues they never considered before. We need to make that journey easier, both for parents and schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Given the responsibilities the Bill will place on school principals, we should give them the necessary support structures to carry out normal school business in addition to taking on those additional duties. It is a challenge for the Department to provide resources for special needs assistants and resource teachers, as well as helping teachers and principals to deal with their additional responsibilities arising from the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_828">Senators will be glad to hear that I will not be promising a disability Bill in aid of any matter that has been raised in respect of this section. I have a far simpler answer for Senator Ulick Burke, which is that in a sense the Bill does create a central body called the National Council for Special Education. In addition, the Bill provides for an appeals board. If the Senator examines the legislation he will note that the provision of appropriate education services to children with special educational needs involves the close co-operation and co-ordination of activities between education and health authorities. The Bill's provisions resolve current difficulties regarding co-ordination. In the case of a school going child, section 7 provides that the council must provide him or her with the services identified in the education plan as being necessary for the child to participate in and benefit from education. If the child is not of school going age, this responsibility rests with the health board. If the council or health board believes that the other body can provide the services more effectively, it must inform the other body of this and that body must then ensure that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">If a dispute arises between the council and the health board, it must be resolved by the appeals board. Creating another special body in addition to the two we are already creating in this legislation, far from ensuring greater co-ordination, would lead to greater confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Under section 39, the council will be empowered to request a health board to take specified action where it considers this to be necessary for the preparation or implementation of an adequate education plan, or necessary more generally to assist the council in carrying out its functions. We have conferred a specific power on the council in that regard to coerce the health board if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">Section 16 makes clear that health boards will be required to implement education policy and policy regarding support services formulated by the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children. This addresses the issue of joint responsibility raised by the Senator in his amendment. I do not disagree with the thinking behind the amendment but what it proposes is already met in the provisions of the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_832">I agree with some of what the Minister of State has said. However, the national council is a distant body, whereas when the local health boards deal with local Department of Education and Science officials an issue can be dealt with quickly using a hands-on approach. The Minister of State referred to the fact that one body must report to another and report back to the council. All of this takes time, which is of the essence. The Minister of State referred to this, as did the Minister for Health and Children in the Lower House. We will lose time through such a process of reporting from one body to another and on to a third, before waiting for a reaction to coerce the health board into doing something.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">When we have to use powers such as these, resistance grows which means that the people in need fall between two stools. If the legislation defers such action into the distance it will cause delay, which can prove crucial in some instances. Therefore, it is regrettable that the Minister of State does not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">As I pointed out to the Senator, the central body of the appeals board will resolve differences. The responsibility to address the co-ordination of education and health services has been addressed. I welcome that the Senator's amendment pointed out a need to co-ordinate the education and health services because the much-loved health boards will no longer exist in a very short period of time. Moreover, the problem with co-ordination will still remain and will have to take place between the health services executive and the council established under this legislation. The appeals board is enshrined in the Bill and will ensure that definitive decisions can be made in the best interests of the children whom the Bill seeks to protect.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">The way in which the Bill is worded at present means that if a principal knows that he or she cannot take measures that would address the educational needs of a student, he or she must implement the provisions set out in subsection (3) even though he or she may not have the ability to take such measures. The amendment seeks to allow for the principal to decide that he or she is not able to take such measures and can require the council to prepare an educational plan under section 7 in respect of the child. This would save time in addressing the needs of the child because the process under subsection (3) might be futile if the principal knows he or she cannot deal with the problem.

          <p eId="para_838">School-based assessments and education plans under section 3 are aimed at children whose needs are less complex or severe. If it is clear that a child has a disability or has complex needs, for example, a dual impairment, it is open to the parents to seek an assessment from the health board or the council. Therefore, there is no question of restricting the right of access of a parent to the council or a health board. The parent does not and should not have to wait while a principal applies other educational measures short of having an assessment carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">As was outlined on Second Stage, a disability can often be obvious very early in a child's life. Therefore, there is no need to wait until the child begins school to start receiving the services he or she needs. Parents can apply to the health board for an assessment under this legislation as soon as they believe their child may have a disability. I fail to understand the precise point the Senator is seeking to address by inserting the additional provision that the principal can request the council to prepare an education plan under section 7 because, in any event, the parents have a right to seek it.</p>

What is the position in this case? Irrespective of what the parents decide to do, surely the principal should be able to make a decision, as is the case under section 3(3) where, having taken measures, the student is not benefiting from the education programme provided. Why can the principal not make a determination before trying to implement a programme if he or she feels he or she cannot provide for the educational needs of the student, without having to wait for the parents to make such an application or implement a programme in the first place?</p>

Where the special educational need is deemed by the principal of the school — who, as a professional, is rightly the first arbiter of the case because of his or her statutory status in education — to be relatively uncomplicated, there is a clear onus on the principal to take a sequence of actions culminating in the drawing up of a local education plan within the school and its implementation. Where it is deemed that the education plan is not working, it is my understanding that there is a clear statutory onus on the principal to serve notice on the National Council for Special Education to set a process in train, initially by calling on the special education needs organiser to put a team in place to draw up a plan for what is, subsequent to the delivery of the preliminary plan, deemed to be a more complicated special education need.

          <p eId="para_850">It is an individual plan for an individual student but the Minister had advised it is not necessary to state that in the legislation. The effect of the Bill is to confer on all children who have a special educational need, arising from a disability, a right to receive an assessment, an education plan and support services where these are necessary to meet their needs. Referring to an assessment an individual assessment or one which is to take account of the student's specific needs does not add to the rights which children with disabilities will enjoy once the legislation is commenced. The assessment does not take place in a vacuum. It is an assessment of an individual but is not an end in itself. The Bill is clear that where an assessment identifies that a child has special needs an education plan must be prepared to meet those needs and that plan must be implemented. It is surplus to requirements to refer to it as an individual plan or individual needs. That is inherent in the fact that the child has special needs.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I disagree with the Minister of State. A plan for an individual is an assessment. If one is talking about a school where there are students whose special needs vary slightly from one another and one is preparing a plan, that plan can relate to more than one student. Therefore, it is not an individual plan as such as set out in subsection (3). If one is talking about an assessment for a group of children, that is a group plan as distinct from an individual plan. The additional workload imposed on the principal and teachers of the school or whoever else is assigned that duty is enormous and it has consequences for children in the school other than those in the special needs category. It is important, therefore, that if there is a specific student with a specific need there is an individual plan specific to that student. That is the reason I seek an individual assessment and an individual plan rather than a global one that may embrace others or many, as the case may be, in certain schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_852">I support Senator Burke's amendments. While the Minister of State has argued they are not required, they would add to the legislation and make it clear that what we are talking about is a plan for the individual's needs. The inclusion of these amendments would underpin the intention of the legislation and reinforce the idea of individual rights as regards the educational needs of a child.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">I am not clear why Senator Burke deems it necessary to include the adjective "individual" because my understanding of the Bill was that at its core was the individuality of the child. That core principle is consistent throughout the Bill. Perhaps I have misinterpreted it but that was my clear understanding of what the Bill was about. If it was not about individuality and the individual needs of an individual child it would be going astray. I have no problem with the inclusion of the adjective "individual" if the Minister of State has no problem with it. I still regard it as superfluous because the subsection states "...arrange for an assessment of the student to be carried out". If an assessment of a student's needs is carried out it is for an individual student. One can draw up an education plan only for that individual student. I have no difficulty with the inclusion of the word "individual" if somebody can convince me it is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_854">Senator Ulick Burke seeks to insert the word "individual" and the concept of specific needs into section 3(3). In this regard it is important to consider section 4, which deals with the issue of assessment. Section 4(6) defines what is meant by assessment, which is the point the Senator is seeking to address in his amendments. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_855">An assessment for the purposes of this section shall include an evaluation and statement of the nature and extent of the child's disability (including in respect of matters that affect the child overall as an individual) [it is a specific assessment and an individual assessment] and an evaluation and statement of the services which the child will need [note the use of the definite article in reference to the child. There is no question of plural assessments or plural service plans] so as to be able to participate in and benefit from education and, generally, to develop his or her potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The definition of the assessment in section 4(6) employs the level of specificity which the Senator seeks to introduce into the preceding section.</p>

          <p eId="para_857">In regard to section 4(6) I referred earlier to the use of the word "individual" and said it should be consistent throughout the Bill. That element is running through the Bill from start to finish. I do not understand the reason it is omitted from section 3(3). I am not sure of the appropriateness of the wording, "arrange for an assessment of the student to be carried out". The inclusion of the words, "to take account of that student's specific needs" would be far better as they would take into account the special needs of each student. With regard to the individual, if we want to be consistent as suggested by the Minister of State, individuality is provided for, as Senator Fitzgerald said, but why has it been omitted in this instance? Its inclusion would enhance the section.</p>

I thought that, perhaps, it was contained in the definitions but it is not. Senator Burke is concerned with continuity in the legislation. While "assessment" is defined in section 4(6), the definition is not linked to the reference to "assessment" in section 3(3). This represents a problem in the legislation quite apart from the issue raised by Senator Ulick Burke. While I do not know if this has been raised before, perhaps a definition of "assessment" should have been included in the definitions sections. If such a definition of "assessment" had been used in section 4(6), it might have dealt with the issue raised by Senator Ulick Burke.</p>

A period of three months may be considerable in the context of a referral. If a child is referred for an assessment at the start of the school year, it might well be Christmas or early in the new year before such an assessment is completed. A serious loss of time will be involved. If an assessment to put in place an individual plan for a particular student is made in January of the new year, it means the child will have lost out substantially. The organisation of an individual plan for a child within a mainstream school will subsequently cause very serious problems. While facilities would be in place to cope in a special school, within a mainstream school the peer group of a child beginning a plan in January will have started in September and advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">There is a great need for the Minister of State to shorten the period for which provision is made. It is within the competencies of the trained personnel and their facilities to accomplish what is called for within one month to lessen the impact of any delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">Section 3 of the Bill has a purely school context. The Minister for Education and Science undertook in the Dáil to examine all the time limits set out in the Bill, which he did. In a number of instances, he reduced the timeframes involved or inserted timeframes where none had been provided. Such instances included requiring schools to begin the assessment process within one month and requiring the appeals board to hear appeals against a failure to assess within six weeks and deal with disputes between the council and the health board within two months. The Minister reviewed the time limit in question in the Dáil and considered it as part of his review. Having re-examined the provision, the Minister took the view that an outer limit of less than three months is an unrealistic target to set for all assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I appeal to the Senator on the basis of — in the words of the Constitution — his practical knowledge and experience of the education profession. Many assessments require the services of a number of specialists and the principal or teacher is not on his or her own in this particular context. For that reason, the Minister decided to set the limit at not less than three months.</p>

While I accept the Minister of State's comments on the professionals involved, it is within their professional capacity to implement my amendment. As other Senators and I have said over and over again, time is of the essence in this area. The provision as drafted is impractical. If the school year starts in September and a plan is implemented in January, the time in between will have been lost. It will be impossible for a child with special needs to make this time up in a mainstream school. The imperative will be to have as many as possible of the children with special needs in a school matching the pace of the mainstream. We cannot say we are doing everything possible within the timeframe when it is possible for the professionals involved to provide a plan within one month rather than three. The delay is significant and must cause concern to all involved.</p>

I have difficulty with the amendment for a couple of reasons. It is very difficult to define the role of "partnership". If one were to include the words "in a spirit of partnership", certain difficulties would arise in the process. Ultimately, a principal is responsible on a school campus. To promote in the process a spirit of partnership involving parents and special needs organisers as proposed in amendment No. 27 could lead to a blurring of roles and ultimate responsibility and accountability. While I am very supportive of the promotion of parental involvement and the rights of parents to have a say, be consulted and kept abreast of developments at all times, I consider the phrase "spirit of partnership" vague. It is not easily defined and could lead to difficulties in the process. The buck must stop somewhere. The Bill rightly and properly causes the buck to stop firmly and finally with the principal of a school in the educational campus situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">I acknowledge that role. It is written into the Constitution and it takes precedence over any legislation. The parent or parents are the primary and natural educators of the child and no legislation enacted in these Houses can ever detract from that. It is important to note that we are dealing with a subsection that imposes an obligation on a principal in regard to the preparation of an education plan. We are not talking about the rights of parents; we are talking about the duties of principals.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">There has been much discussion in these Houses in recent years about rights-based legislation.

          <p eId="para_877">It a truism of all jurisprudence that without a duty, one has no right. Somebody must have a duty and the somebody in regard to this subsection is the principal. We are talking about a subsection addressing the duties of principals. Those duties in regard to the all-important function under the Bill is the preparation of an education plan, but the parent must be consulted as a matter of statute law under this legislation. The parent still has rights under the Constitution. That is not being argued, but as far as the principal's duty is concerned, the parent has a right to be consulted along with others.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">To insert the phrase "a spirit of partnership" is to introduce a vague criterion. It qualifies the involvement of parents in a manner that it would be impossible to properly define. I regret to advise the House that it is difficult to give a precise legal context to the somewhat elusive political concept of a spirit of partnership, something which many of our political leaders extol and which is spoken of highly in great dialogues between the social partners. The spirit of partnership, as a matter of pure statutory draftsmanship, does not add a great deal, if anything, to the section. It introduces, a vague, somewhat elusive criterion for the relations between the principal and the parent. Under the Constitution the parents' role is supreme and throughout the Bill the role of parents is emphasised.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The Bill places an obligation on the principal not only to consult parents, but to facilitate their involvement in the preparation of the education plan. That is written into the sections. The proposal regarding an amendment to an education plan following a transfer between schools is a collateral amendment tabled by Senator Tuffy. This can only occur after informing the parents of the proposed amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The rights of parents are carefully secured in the Bill as it stands. I am not persuaded and neither is the Minister that the introduction of a phrase referring to partnership adds to the certainty of rights as well as duties that we want in this legislation. If anything, it can be argued that it detracts from them because it is open to the principal to argue that the parent has been guilty of failure to observe the spirit of partnership as equally as it is open to the parent to argue that the principal has been in default in failing to observe the somewhat elusive spirit of partnership.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_881">The way the legislation is worded gives rights to parents but they are limited rights. Parents can request an assessment or there are certain decisions they can appeal when an education plan is drawn up. I will deal with this point later, but parents cannot appeal in regard to the contents of an education plan in terms of what is required by the student, although they can appeal in regard to other aspects. The provisions of the legislation keep parents on the sideline and does not involve them centrally in the drawing up of the plan. That is the purpose of my amendment, which proposes they should be involved in a partnership manner in the drawing up of the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The Minister of State said that by introducing the word "partnership", one is introducing uncertainty in the legislation. I am sure many members of the public would say they are not happy with the interpretation of the word "consult" when it is implemented in practice. That view could be applied to many areas where apparently there is public consultation. While people are of the view they are consulted, when it comes down to a decision their views are not taken on board. What we are seeking to achieve should be central to the legislation. It is to involve parents in the preparation of the plan and in deciding on its contents. Surely that is an objective we should have. If we do not insert it in the legislation, it probably will not come into play as much as it should. In many cases parents might be excluded from participation in the drawing up of the plan, except in terms of adhering to the basic notion of whatever it means to consult people.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">As an interim measure, will the Minister of State assure parents who have assessment reports prepared by professionally recognised persons in the private sector, lodged at present in the Department of Education Science — they may be in the dustbin at this stage — and awaiting recognition, for want of a better word, that these reports will be acted upon so delays will not cause children to lose out? It would be a gesture of goodwill, if nothing else, if the Department accepted that those assessments already submitted will at least be acknowledged and acted upon within the current framework.</p>

          <p eId="para_903">——but there is a current framework. We are talking about a revised legislative framework. I draw the Senator's attention to section 5(6), which states: "In carrying out an assessment under section 4, the health board or the Council, as appropriate, shall have regard to any relevant assessment of the child concerned that is available to it at that time." The right to have regard to those assessments is fully written into this legislation.</p>

The council or health board should have the power to refuse a request for an assessment where they genuinely believe there are insufficient grounds to support the view that a child has special educational needs. If they had to carry out an assessment in the belief that none was required, it would undermine the statutory scheme we are trying to frame and would also amount to a misuse of resources. A parent can appeal a decision to refuse to accede to a request and a decision on this appeal must be taken within six weeks. Therefore, the position of the parent and child is adequately protected.</p>

Alternatively, "assessment" should have been defined in the interpretation section, section 1, just as "education plan" and "council" are defined therein. Section 4 does not make it clear that the assessment referred to is always the assessment defined in subsection (6) of this section.

Pléadh na deacrachtaí céanna anuraidh i gcomhthéacs an Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill maidir le daoine a bheith á gcur isteach faoi bhrú in ospidéil mheabhairghalair.

I am sure Senator Fitzgerald used them and so did I. The Department of Education was vociferously opposed to them because they did not reflect the cultural background and values of the children. Peter and Jane were not the children we were teaching. That was true but, as teachers, we used the books because they were valuable in other ways.</p>

          <p eId="para_936">The amendment would regulate promotions in the same manner as recruitment. The Bill provides in section 6(1) for the possibility that the commission may regulate promotions at some point in the future in that it allows the Minister to make orders extending the remit of the commission to posts in the public service, including recruitment posts. The Minister will consider whether to make such an order in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Acceptance of this amendment, however, would automatically bring promotions within the remit of the commission. The Minister for Finance agreed with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that the Bill would regulate only recruitment at the outset and any extensions would be the subject of further consultations between the two Ministers before orders are made under section 6(1).</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The proposed amendment does not appreciate the structure of the Bill.

If a Department in Portlaoise needs to recruit 20 civil servants, be they specialist or otherwise, it would make more sense for it to do its own recruitment locally rather than finding 100 people who are scattered throughout the country and who do not want to go there. Central recruitment will continue where it is efficient but this Bill will offer the flexibility to recruit locally. The roll out to local authorities and to health boards will be an issue for the Minister. I expect that recruitment under the new Bill will be more efficient and equally fair in terms of probity and the merit of the applicants.

          <p eId="para_957">The issue of advisers occasioned some debate in the other House. The central question is why the section is in the Bill. Why is it necessary to exclude certain appointments temporarily from the ambit of the Act? I will not go over the Dáil debate as we all know the merits and otherwise of it. It would be a waste of the time of the House. Suffice to say most of us are satisfied with the way the appointment of special advisers currently operates. It is done in an adequately accountable fashion with the full glare of publicity and it is right that should be so. Most of us would agree that the post of special adviser needs to be separated from permanent jobs within the Civil Service. There was a suspicion which has been vocalised elsewhere that this section could be used in certain circumstances to facilitate gliding seamlessly from one to the other and it would be preferable for that not to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">I agree with everything Senator McDowell said. I do not think the special adviser system could be operated if there was some type of formal recruitment process. Special advisers are, generally speaking, personal choices of Ministers and all Governments. I fully accept that watertight safeguards are required. A certain danger exists in the system of patronage. I would not be averse to some legislative control of numbers, which is not dealt with in the Bill. It should not be extended infinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">A few years ago, I remember one Minister in a particular Government having a <i>cabinet</i> of five special advisers, and I am not referring to the Taoiseach of the time.

          <p eId="para_960">This section of the Bill deals with exclusion orders which can be made in certain circumstances to allow recruitment to certain unestablished posts to take place in an expeditious fashion. In any event, section 13 requires the commission to establish standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness and these standards will necessarily underpin all the activities and judgments of the commission, including the decision of when, whether and to whom to grant an excluding order. Senators can be assured that the commission will act in the public interest at all times and also provide that any recruitment process is undertaken in accordance with the principles set out in the Bill. I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The Senator raised the issue of special advisers and mentioned the suspicion which is not uncommon among Opposition Members. That amendment was taken at an early stage in the Dáil to exclude, beyond any doubt any opportunity of a special adviser being recruited into the Civil Service unless they went back to base and applied in the same manner as anyone else. We heeded that suspicion. There are no circumstances, unless there is a change in this Bill and another Bill, that a special adviser hired in a temporary, unestablished capacity could become a permanent adviser. Those amendments were accepted in the Dáil. There should be no further suspicions or concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_971">We dealt with this issue previously. The charging of fees was provided for under the previous 1956 Act and the Department of Finance was anxious to maintain this flexibility. It was used for one year in the mid-1980s and it is not intended to use it in future. We have identified some areas, possibly the recruitment of technical experts, where the provision may be used because of the significant expense incurred. The provision is included to maintain the flexibility in this regard under the 1956 Act. A minimum fee was applied for a short period in the 1980s when applications for Civil Service positions were at a very high level but it was quickly dropped. While it is not intended to reintroduce charges, it was deemed important to carry over the flexibility into the new legislation.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_973">In page 17, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_974">"(2) Where the Commission is of the opinion that there has been a failure to comply with the principles and policies of this Act, in particular if it forms the opinion that there has been a failure to apply codes of practice, it may investigate or cause to be investigated the matter on its behalf by a person appointed under <i>section 15</i>.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">Section 14 provides that if someone interferes with the recruitment process, the matter will be reported to the commission which will then take action. This is a one-sided approach which carries a danger that where an outsider who applies for a job fails to meet standards, the matter will be reported, whereas in circumstances in which those holding the competition also fail to comply with the highest standards, it may not be reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">Where the commission is of the opinion that the principles of the Act have not been applied, it should have the power to investigate the competition in question under section 15. This is similar to what is envisaged if the commission were to discover that an applicant had transgressed by canvassing or copying. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. If the recruitment agency or licence holder fails to reach the standard, the section should apply to it in the same way as it would apply to those applicants who do not reach the standard.</p>

          <p eId="para_977">Section 52 allows the commission to revoke a recruitment licence where the licence holder fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the licence. It states that the commission may revoke a licence where it forms the opinion that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_978">(<i>a</i>) a licence holder has failed or is failing to meet the terms and conditions of the recruitment licence concerned granted by them,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_979">(<i>b</i>) since the grant of the recruitment licence, the circumstances relevant to the grant have changed and are such that, if an application for a recruitment licence were made in the changed circumstances, it would be refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Compliance with codes of conduct issued by the commission is a condition of the licence. Section 43 states that the commission will grant a recruitment licence to an applicant only if it is satisfied that the applicant can and will observe the appropriate standards and codes of practice. Furthermore, it states that a licence holder is responsible to the commission for ensuring that the terms and conditions of the licence and relevant codes of practice are fully complied with. In addition, section 15 enables the commission to investigate the exercise of functions under the Act by a licence holder or listed recruitment agency. It does not imply there has been any wrongdoing on anyone's part.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">The proposed amendment would substantially increase the powers of the commission to conduct inquiries for "failure to comply with the principles and policies of this Act". This wording is less precise than the term "exercise of functions". Furthermore, the amendment would result in the provision being addressed to any person, not necessarily in the context of a person exercising a function under the Act. Not only is there a vagueness in language in the concepts of "principles and policies", but a failure to comply with a request under section 15 in this context would render a person guilty of an offence. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

Perhaps I am being too legalistic but we need to be clear as to what is proper and improper interference with the process. If I have understood the general thinking in this regard, I would expect that any suggestion that a person would seek to interfere with the process would, by definition, be improper and subject to the sanctions set out in a later section. The use of the words "improper" and "recklessly" suggests there is a measure of low level interference which is regarded as being perfectly acceptable.

          <p eId="para_986">I used the word "interference" without qualification. The Act includes legal obligations and section 54 sets out the obligations on candidates in recruitment and selection.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_991">(<i>e</i>) knowingly or maliciously obstruct a person engaged in the conduct of the competition or otherwise interfere with the general conduct of that competition,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_992">(<i>f</i>) knowingly and without lawful authority take any action that could result in the compromising of any test material or of any evaluation of it,</p>

For the sake of argument, let us take the example of a public representative who communicates with the PAS to inquire how a particular applicant's case stands, as public representatives sometimes do although perhaps not in the case of the Civil Service Commission. While he or she does not state that candidate X is a brilliant man or woman, in making the inquiry he or she clearly intends to indicate, without explicitly stating, a preference for a particular candidate.

          <p eId="para_996">The combined effect of sections 54 and 55 is to allow for a more comprehensive response to nefarious behaviour on the part of any actor during the recruitment process. The provisions of this Bill underline the seriousness of contravention of the rules of recruitment and selection competitions and provide more punitive penalties than were available under the terms of the 1956 legislation. Dishonesty will not be tolerated at any stage. A simple inquiry by a public representative as to whether an individual has secured a position would be met with a clear reply that the individual concerned will be notified in due course. I doubt that a representation by a Senator, Deputy or Minister on an individual's behalf would produce any advance information regarding that individual's application.</p>

          <p eId="para_1006">Section 17 relates to the making of assessments by the commission to determine whether a public service body should be regulated by it. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) of section 5 to which this amendment refers lists appointments in the local authorities, health boards and vocational education committees, VECs. The reason for this requirement is that these sectors contain large and complex public service bodies and I wish to ensure that regulation is rolled out in these sectors in a coherent and structured manner. Accordingly, the commission must undertake an examination of all bodies in these areas before making a recommendation regarding their regulation. The reference to section 5(<i>d</i>) in section 17(1) requires that the commission must undertake an assessment of recruitment practices in these bodies before making a recommendation to the Minister that they be regulated by the commission. That there is no reference to section 5(<i>e</i>) means that the commission can make a recommendation that any public service post other than those in the local authorities, health boards and VECs should be regulated by the commission without the need to conduct a prior assessment. This is an important element of flexibility which means that the commission can bring these bodies under its remit on a case by case basis without the need for bureaucratic exercise and investigation. I do not accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1018">Section 17 relates to the making of assessments by the commission to determine whether a public service body should be regulated by it. These assessments are set out in a report to the Minister which will contain the commission's recommendations. The commission will assess recruitment practice and make recommendations in line with the standards of probity, merit, equity and fairness required of the commission under the provisions of section 13. Section 17 provides that the report must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas if that recommendation is not acted upon in the manner and time provided for in subsection (3). This is required in order to ensure that Ministers take seriously the recommendations made by the commission. Accordingly, section 17 serves a distinct purpose and it would be inappropriate to tack on the new section proposed in this amendment. The commission is required under section 43(5) to examine and evaluate licence holders to ensure compliance with conditions set out in section 45 on recruitment licences. Both of these provisions adequately address the objectives of amendment No. 6.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">There is reference to "good practice" in the Bill. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was consulted regarding the use of and the meaning of the term "best practice". That office advised that words and phrases which have recently come into circulation or which are imprecise should be used extremely carefully if their meaning is not fully understood and is still developing. Phrases such as "best practice" should therefore be avoided. For clarity's sake, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that it is standard practice to avoid the use of vogue words or phrases.</p>

The commission does not have the powers to decide whether somebody should be appointed.

For example, the special adviser to the Taoiseach is required to submit a declaration to the Taoiseach as well as to the commission.</p>

It is appropriate that, since these individuals will be holding public offices, their declarations of interest should be made to the commission and, on that basis, I support the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">When the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 was going through the Oireachtas, there was a good deal of debate about the level of declaration that would be required of different office holders. As Senator Mansergh will be well aware, the declaration required differs between special advisers, Ministers, Deputies, Senators, other office holders and so on. The section provides the Minister rather than the commission with total discretion to decide the declaration of interest required, which is inappropriate, given that no definition is provided. Assuming the Minister of State will not change his mind on this matter, what level of declaration will be required? For example, there is a requirement on Ministers to declare property or interests of their spouses. Will this be extended to commissioners? What will commissioners be required to declare?</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">The Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2000 require office holders to furnish declarations of interest as a general safeguard of probity in public office. The purpose of the section is to require the members of the commission to inform the Minister of interests that would affect their membership of the commission. These may be matters that would not figure in a general declaration relating to the substantive posts which qualify them for <i>ex officio</i> membership of the commission but which might be relevant to their membership of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">For example, a relative of a commissioner might run a private sector recruitment agency which applies to the commission for listing as an approved agency. The relevance of the fact would be immediately apparent to the Minister who would raise it with the member concerned, if declared, whereas it might be lost on the Standards in Public Office Commission. In addition, the <i> ex officio</i> members of the commission are persons of the highest calibre. One of these is the chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission. Accordingly, it is considered more relevant that the Minister should be informed of such interests. That provides double cover.</p>

He or she would be under pressure to resign but the decision would still be valid and the failure to declare an interest would not be an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">If somebody fails to disclose an interest under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, it is a prosecutable offence but the fines are relatively small.

          <p eId="para_1058">The general perception is that there is very little reward for extra productivity in the Civil Service and it is important to reward those who show extra initiative or productivity. I know that is changing a great deal and that teaching, for example, has changed greatly in the last ten years. That could be extended across the entire public service.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_1059">This is an interesting amendment. I have taken an interest in this subject over the years and wonder whether the Minister of State can update us as to where we are. I know where the long-standing talks with the trade union representing trade unions stand and to what extent we have moved towards performance management within the Civil Service, as higher civil servants have had a system in place for quite some time. Is there any real prospect of it extending through the middle ranks of the Civil Service in the near future? The Minister of State is familiar with the argument that if we choose not to remove non-performing or under-performing civil servants, and we cannot sufficiently reward those who are performing above average or particularly well, then we have stasis within the service, which is not healthy. People are not incentivised to perform well. I know that many people within the Civil Service unions have doubts about this, feeling that it would vest undue discretion in managers at various points in the service and that if one is doing a certain job one should get a certain level of pay. However, most neutral observers looking at the service would say that there has to be some mechanism other than promotion, which we know is pretty rigid, where we can reward those who are performing in a particularly good way or in a way which adds value to what is being done in a Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">I am asking the Minister of State to give us an update on whether there are continuing talks with the issue and where they stand. I do not expect him to accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_1061">The amendment proposes arrangements for performance-related pay in the public service, something with which I agree wholeheartedly. As I said on Committee Stage, this subject matter is entirely outside the remit of the section, which deals with the board of the PES. It is also outside the remit of a Bill dealing with recruitment in the public service. Perhaps the Senator should take this up with the Minister for Finance when he is next in the House, as he is more <i>au fait </i>with the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I am afraid I am a little in sympathy with some of the trade unions to which Senator McDowell referred. There are ways, other than promotion, of rewarding people, for example, by giving them interesting and worthwhile jobs. Most matters in the public service involve teamwork. While there are important individual contributions and there may be occasions on which particular individuals can be picked out, much of the time it might be difficult and invidious to do so. In addition, there is pressure to extend it to everyone, which defeats the purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">There is some reward in a good job done and one does not necessarily need special monetary recognition for doing one's job well. In certain situations, such monetary recognition also lends itself to a certain degree of favouritism for particular individuals and I wonder if it is more trouble than it is worth. Some moves have been made along those lines, but I do not have the details and I do not know if the Minister of State has them either. I do not like the notion in the private commercial sector that one must have lots of money to be incentivised. As Gene Kerrigan would say, "To get out of bed in the morning, you need dollops of bonuses and incentives".</p>

What reward did most of the civil servants get who took part in the recent EU Presidency other than warm thanks and congratulations from the Taoiseach, his Ministers and the rest of us? I do not accept that special monetary bonuses should be used to pick out particular people. When I was in public service I did not like the fact that the occasional person would start comparing himself or herself to a chief executive in a private company. They were generally very senior people who claimed that they were not paid enough. If people want to be paid dollops of money, they should not enter the public service. It has its own ethic and ethos and I do not have a problem with it.</p>

I am not suggesting that huge bonuses should be paid at the end of any given year, but Senator Mansergh picked a good example in the EU Presidency. There would be nothing wrong with some tangible reward — nobody is talking about anything outlandish — being given to those who performed roles of particular importance and usefulness to the State. At a certain point in the system, perhaps at principal officer level, individual personnel managers should be vested with the power to give that extra reward to individuals in particular circumstances. To that extent I am with the Progressive Democrats on that point.</p>

We have looked abroad, however. The strategic management initiative came from the New Zealand experience some years ago. I am not sure whether it is necessary to state it explicitly because staff exchanges and conferences take place. The Civil Service is pretty well alive.

Section 58 states that the promotion competitions will be carried out in accordance with the codes of practice. Does this in some way confer a power on the commission to change the way in which promotion competitions are carried out? For example, a certain number of posts are generally held over for internal competition and a certain number for cross-departmental competition. Will it be possible for the commission to decide that some posts are to be filled from within particular Departments or within particular geographic areas? Will it be able to decide that a job in Loughrea, for example, should be filled in Loughrea or within a particular Department?

          <p eId="para_1095">Section 17 provides that the commission may inquire only into the recruitment practices of public service bodies prior to making a report on whether certain posts should be subject to the remit of the commission. There is no impediment on the Minister making an order under section 6 to bring any professional post in the public service within the remit of the commission. Amendment No. 13 would create the unnecessary precondition of an investigation before the making of any such order. In respect of subsection (2) of the proposed new section, any report made by the commission, pursuant to section 17, is already subject to the procedure whereby the Minister must make a statement if he or she does not propose to accept the commission's recommendations.

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_1114">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Áire. I regret the fact that out of frustration I have had to put down this motion. A resident of Carlow who could not vote for me in the last election due to the boundaries attended as a child the residential institutions of St. Patrick's, Navan Road, and St. Philomena's, Stillorgan. As these institutions were not listed in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, she could not seek compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">I understand that institutions which were left out in the past are being added to the list to allow those who attended them to seek compensation. In trying to address this matter, we have been given the run-around from various agencies which assured us that the Bill would come before the Houses of the Oireachtas last Christmas. Subsequently, it was stated that the Bill would come before the Houses in January but five months later we are into July and it has not appeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">I hope that in her reply the Minister will give the woman on whose behalf I have raised this matter a definite indicator as to when the institutions she attended will be listed to allow her to proceed with her case. The lady in question is unwell and there are other complicating factors in her case. The Minister would not want anyone to suffer any longer than this lady has already.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1117">I dtus báire, ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil ar son an Aire; ní raibh sé in ann bheith anseo. Tá mé thar a bheith buíoch den Seanadóir as ucht an ocáid a úsáid le cur in iúl don Seanad cad atá ag dul ar aghaidh go díreach faoi St. Patrick's and St. Philomena's.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on the inclusion of St. Patrick's, Navan Road, and St. Philomena's, Stillorgan, on the Schedule of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. The Act which was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002 provides for the establishment of both the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the Residential Institutions Redress Review Committee. The board and committee have been put in place and are fully operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">A serving member of the High Court, Judge Sean O'Leary, has been appointed chairman of the redress board and nine other members have also been appointed. The review committee is chaired by Judge Frank Murphy, a former member of the Supreme Court. A further three members have also been appointed. A total of 31 administration staff have been appointed to the board and the committee. The latest information available to my Department indicates that the redress board has received 3,945 applications to date and made offers to 1,370 individual applicants. The average award to date has been €77,000 and awards have varied between zero and €300,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The purpose of the Act was to establish a framework to enable victims of institutional abuse to apply for redress. Awards are being made in line with the recommendations of the Ryan report and are equivalent to the level of awards made by the High Court. The provisions of the Act allow the board to make awards based on a lower threshold of proof than is required when taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of his or her identity, that he or she was resident in an institution and injured while so resident and that the injury was consistent with any abuse alleged to have occurred. An applicant may accept or reject an award or may submit it for review to the review committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">In framing the legislation, the Government was conscious that it was putting in place structures to provide redress for victims of abuse and to bring closure to a tragic period of Irish history which spanned almost six decades. Currently, 128 institutions are listed on the Act's Schedule. The provisions of section 4 allow the addition to the Schedule of institutions identified as reformatories, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function. The Department has received correspondence from individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions which may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">As a first step in the process, discussions have taken place between my Department and other Government Departments which may have provided a regulatory or inspection function in the operation of these facilities to ascertain whether they are eligible for consideration. In some cases, the initial information received was limited due to the long period which had elapsed since these institutions were closed. The process of verifying each of these institutions has therefore been time consuming and is continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">Officials of my Department have sought confirmation from the Department of Health and Children on any regulatory or inspection function it may have had in respect of St. Patrick's, Navan Road. To date, the Department has not been able to confirm any such responsibility. The Department of Health and Children continues to check its records and has agreed to revert to my Department should any such records become available. The Department of Health and Children has confirmed a regulatory or inspection function in respect of St. Philomena's, Stillorgan, and the institution is under consideration for inclusion in the Schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">Inquiries as to the eligibility of all institutions of which my Department has been notified have not yet been completed. I am considering proposals which are at an advanced stage to permit progress on institutions in respect of which inquiries have been completed.</p>

        <heading>Essential Repairs Grant.</heading>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_531">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_1125">I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to reintroduce top-up funding for applicants who have secured essential repairs grants but cannot afford to pay the personal contribution. The essential repairs and disabled person's grants have been a tremendous success and helped to update and refurbish many houses which were in need of new doors and windows, heating and sanitary services. Local authorities have administered the grants and provided funding of 75% to 90%. While most applicants have had to come up with the remaining funds, some on the bread line and those dependent on pensions cannot afford the sums of up to €4,000 which may have to be added to the grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">According to my information, until last January community welfare officers could top up the grant to help those people who were needy. Sixteen savage cuts were introduced last January and these people now have nowhere to turn. I have spent the last two weeks approaching my local health board, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Social and Family Affairs but nobody appears to be able to help these unfortunate people. I ask the Minister to tell me who took this decision and to put in place a system to ensure that the most needy are not forgotten. Winter is fast approaching while the most needy are living in houses which need doors, windows, heating etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">Given the numbers of people working for the Government, I cannot believe Departments cannot liaise with each other to find out who has been left out following a cut. I have spent two weeks speaking to those in charge of various Departments and agencies who have told me there is nothing they can do. I ask the Minister to reinstate the top-up grant from community welfare officers to ensure that needy people do not go without.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_1130">I am delighted to have the opportunity to reply to this Adjournment debate and to be afforded the opportunity to clarify the position on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the regional health authority. It provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their basic needs and those of any dependants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">Eligible people living in the State who satisfy a means test and who have applied for any other benefit, assistance or allowance to which they may be entitled, may be eligible to receive assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Assistance may be provided in the form of a basic weekly allowance or supplements which may be paid in respect of such needs as rent, mortgage interest, special diet or heating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">The scheme also provides for exceptional needs payments which are once-off payments made where a person has exceptional essential expenses which he or she could not reasonably be expected to meet from within his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment. These payments are made at the discretion of the health board. Every decision is based on careful consideration of the circumstances of the particular case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">In reaching a determination on an application for an exceptional needs payment, a health board will consider the nature and extent of the need and the resources of the household. The health board will also consider the availability of an alternative source to meet the need, for example entitlements from other Departments or State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The essential repairs grant, referred to by the Senator, and the disabled person's grant are the appropriate schemes to provide assistance to people who need financial help with essential repairs. As the Senator will be aware, these schemes are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and are administered through the local authorities. In addition to these primary schemes, the health boards operate a home improvement scheme which is designed to provide assistance with minor repairs to improve the living conditions of older people living alone or in unfit conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I am aware that in some exceptional instances additional funding by way of exceptional needs payments has been provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to people availing of these schemes. However, there is no provision in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to make such assistance available on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">There are obvious difficulties if the supplementary welfare allowance scheme becomes involved in providing assistance in an area which comes within the remit of another Department. Any changes relating to the level of funding being provided under the terms of the essential repairs grant or the disabled person's grant would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">It would be factually incorrect to say this source of income is not available. It is available as an exceptional needs payments. My Department has always liaised with people who have particular difficulties. It is given at the discretion of the community welfare officer under section 31 of the relevant legislation. If there are particular circumstances, a community welfare officer would be forthcoming in supporting a person by giving him or her additional support where the person might have a difficulty in meeting the differential between the grant and the amount of money to be paid. It is often done is consultation with local voluntary agencies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or the local care of the aged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">In no way has that flexibility in regard to the scheme been removed on my behalf as it is administered through the health boards. Perhaps the Senator could speak to the supervisory person in the health board to ensure that the needs of the constituent concerned are met.</p>
