#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	At this meeting, we will have a discussion with the Irish Universities Association and the Institutes of Technology Ireland on the possible reform of the third level entrance system and the need to ensure a better skills match between industry needs and third level graduates.  I welcome the following: Mr. Ned Costello, chief executive of the Irish Universities Association; Professor Linda Hogan, vice provost and chief academic officer of Trinity College Dublin; Professor Anne Scott, deputy president and registrar at Dublin City University; and Mr. Lewis Purser, director of academic affairs at the Irish Universities Association.  From the Institutes of Technology Ireland, I welcome Dr. Brendan Murphy, president of the Cork Institute of Technology and chairman of the Institutes of Technology Ireland; Mr. Pat McLaughlin, president of the Institute of Technology Tallaght; Dr. Annie Doona, president of the Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Dún Laoghaire; and Mr. Gerry Murray, chief executive officer of the Institutes of Technology Ireland.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	On behalf of the IUA, I welcome the opportunity to address the committee on these matters.  On the possible reform of the third level entrance system and the leaving certificate, our submission contains the text of a report prepared by a multidisciplinary working group for the IUA council on this topic.  The group included representation from the universities, Dublin Institute of Technology, IBEC, the ESRI and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD.  The report was presented at the recent joint NCCA-HEA conference on transition.  Central to the report, and consistent with the discussion at the conference, is the need for reform of second level - the leaving certificate examination in particular - and of the third level admissions system to co-evolve.What emerged at the conference and in our report is a strong sense that the structure of the leaving certificate exam and its marking system is driving teaching and learning behaviours at second level in a negative way.  However, there are also concerns about the so-called backwash effect of the points system on second level.  In that regard, our working group developed an extensive set of options for change and situated these on a line of connectedness to the leaving certificate.  I will not go through all of these in the time available but will mention some key categories that are expanded upon in the report.  The categories include supplementary tests and portfolios, etc., less granularity in points and the use of random selection, and threshold entry systems coupled with broader first year curricula, with specialisation moving to the second year of university.  The universities are now in a process of exploring these options more thoroughly and testing their feasibility.  We would be happy to discuss these matters in more detail with the committee.I will now address the matter of the skills match between industry needs and graduates.  I will cover the spectrum of university graduates from NFQ levels 8 to 10, from honours bachelor degree to PhD.  The fundamental purpose of a university education has not changed in the sense that it is a preparation for life.  University education aims to develop rounded individuals who have domain-specific knowledge that is complemented by broader skills such as critical thinking, teamworking and communication.  Critically, we aim to inculcate in students an aspiration towards the achievement of excellence.  This is the vital core quality employers seek of our graduates.University education also aims to produce people with the skills to be lifelong learners - the most important learning of all, according to renowned educationalist John Dewey.  This has become ever more critical because the pace of change is continually accelerating and, as a result, the pace at which today's industry skills needs become obsolete is quickening all the time.  Therefore, it is essential we have people who are strong in their discipline but also widely skilled and capable of adapting to new learning and employment opportunities as the specific needs of the labour market evolve.In terms of the composition of provision of university education, health and professional degrees such as law and accounting, but also including engineering, make up a large proportion of third level enrolments.  There is a direct connection between the syllabus in these areas and the requirements of professional regulatory bodies.  However, even outside these specific areas there is a high level of interaction between the universities and enterprise in informing curriculum development.  Our background material provides examples of this.  Greater emphasis is being placed on the broad attributes of graduates, with DCU's Generation 21 initiative being a good example of this.  We also include in our submission details of UCC's overall approach to skills development, with reference to the important area of study abroad.In terms of the structure of the curriculum, modularisation has been a key development.  In this context, modularisation has two important effects.  First, it allows for greater multidisciplinarity.  UCD's Horizons programme is a specific example of this but the approach is widespread across the sector.  The aim is to produce more rounded graduates by allowing students to move, in ways that suit each learner's own interests and ambitions, beyond the specific disciplinary focus of the degree.  Second, it allows a more mobile curriculum where modules can be and are frequently updated, in many cases annually, to reflect changes in knowledge arising from research or developments in industry.  Employability skills are significantly enhanced by providing opportunities for placements in industry and for community engagement by students.  Such placements and engagement are a prominent and growing feature of university education.  We have included some examples of NUIG's approach to engagement in our submission, while Professor Scott can talk about DCU's INTRA programme.Research activity is having an increasing influence on university education.  At fourth level, Ireland has become a leader in the area of structured PhDs, which are situated within graduate schools, and aims to maintain the core of the research-based PhD but supplement it with other skills relevant to employability in the wider economy.  This is important because the whole strategy for science technology and innovation is predicated not purely on producing PhDs for academia but also for industry.  The principles behind our structured PhDs are reflected in the principles of innovative doctoral training included in the new EU strategy entitled Supporting Jobs and Growth - an agenda for the modernisation of Europe's higher education systems.Research is also a source of spin-offs from universities, leading to companies that come directly out of university research activity.  In this way, research directly provides the skills for new employment creation.  The expansion of research has also greatly strengthened the overall ethos and relationship between industry and the universities in the sense that collaborative programmes such as the SFI centres for science, technology and innovation and the Enterprise Ireland innovation partnerships have deepened our understanding of industry needs.  Universities are also taking initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, for example, Trinity College and UCD's shared innovation academy and UCC's ignite programme.To deepen our interaction with enterprise, the IUA has established a new university-industry round table.  This will be a regular forum involving the university presidents and CEOs of leading Irish companies.  The first session of the round table takes place tomorrow morning and it is intended there will regular interaction thereafter.  At the session, we will discuss issues relating to the learning environment and the broader environment within which universities operate.To conclude, I would like to mention the work undertaken by the expert skills group.  The group undertakes studies and makes recommendations relating to specific sectoral skills issues and also undertakes a valuable role in providing intelligence on overall skills gaps in the economy.  I have added to our submission some detailed information on skills gaps at a sectoral level.  Some important points emerge from that data.  First, the sectors showing vacancies are predominantly the high-tech sectors. Second, with the exception of the ICT industry, the level of vacancies is low.This reflects the state of the economy.  However, given that the export sector is performing strongly in GDP terms, this suggests that by and large skills needs are being met.  This conclusion is consistent with external assessments such as that of ECOFIN and employer surveys underpinning the university rankings.  Despite the fact that some universities fell in the recent rankings, the employer feedback element held up remarkably well and improved in some cases.However, as well as responding to immediate skills shortages, we also need to look to the future and to play to our strengths not only in the technology area but also in the areas of arts and culture, which have significant economic potential.  Indeed, emerging evidence on competitiveness suggests that the most competitive regions are those which are creatively strong across all these domains.  By continuing to expand our links with enterprise to widely inform the delivery of an excellent education for rounded, employable people, we can accelerate growth and recovery from the present crisis - a goal to which we are fully committed.Thank you.  We look forward to discussing these matters with the committee.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the important issues of the entry mechanisms to higher education and the need to ensure a better skills match between industry needs and third level graduates.  We have provided written submissions on both topics, so in this short statement I propose to highlight some key themes.With regard to the possible reform of the third level entrance system, our submission cautions against an over-emphasis on the CAO system when there are now many ways through which students enter the higher education system.  Indeed, the likelihood is that as the system continues to develop, the percentage of people entering higher education other than through the CAO system will continue to grow.  We also share the Minister's stated view that the points system is objective and transparent, but it has unintended consequences.  The committee will be aware that Professor Áine Hyland prepared a discussion paper entitled Entry to Higher Education in Ireland in the 21st Century, in advance of a conference on the topic just a fortnight ago.  In response to a request from the Department of Education and Skills in May this year, the institutes of technology registrars undertook their own examination of the entrance system and their conclusions are broadly similar to those that emerged in Professor Hyland's paper.The points system has come in for significant attention and criticism lately.  We said in our written submission that with few exceptions, people entering the higher education system with high points will be successful in all higher education programmes.  Again with few exceptions, people on low points will struggle and either drop out or fail.  There is, however, a vast middle ground where predictions are much more difficult.  It is our view that a coherent and vibrant further education sector that could draw students who would traditionally have gone directly to higher education and encountered difficulties progressing would be a very welcome development as a bridge between second level and higher education.  We believe also that given the importance of literacy and numeracy, there is a case for including leaving certificate results in English and mathematics in the calculation of points for entry into all higher education programmes.Striving to maximise points results in students entering programmes at higher education with inadequate preparation in underpinning principles or competencies in cognate areas.  We would like to draw the attention of the committee to the requirement in the international baccalaureate for students to take subjects across six different groups: native language, additional language, experimental sciences, mathematics, arts and social sciences.  We suggest that either requiring all students at leaving certificate level to choose a subject from each of these or similar categories or requiring an innovative linking of higher education discipline choice to appropriate studies at leaving certificate level would lead to a better handshake between second level exit and third level entry.In addition, we propose that consideration be given to considerably lengthening the academic year, particularly for first year higher education students, to help in their assimilation into higher education and thereby reduce the pressure on the students and the lecturers.  It always seems churlish that it is expected that all the solutions should be at second level and that none should be proposed at third level.I would now like to turn to the question of ensuring a better skills match between industry needs and third level graduates.  When a programme in an institute of technology is being designed, stakeholders from industry and commerce provide input into the curriculum design process and the course content.  Furthermore, our system of external quality assurance and programme review utilises panels of external experts, which must include industry experts.  Many of our academic staff have industry experience along with academic and professional qualifications.  This adds to the store of our knowledge on industry skills needs.  We strongly value job placement opportunities and internships, as they not only enrich our programmes and students but also give employers opportunities to assess potential employees.Throughout the 14 institutes of technology, there are countless examples of bespoke programmes for upskilling for particular industries and cases of the sector bringing programmes directly to the workplace.  The BlueBrick.ie project is a recent highly successful project aimed at enhancing skills for employment.  The  project REAP, the roadmap for employer academic partnerships, has been chosen as a model of good practice by the EU directorate general of culture and education.  The REAP project has resulted in real change and reform within the higher education institutions in the way in which the full range of engagement activities is supported and developed.  A key initiative of the project has been the development of professional outward facing centres to support all forms of engagement, examples of which include the work-based learning and engagement office in Athlone Institute of Technology, in my institution, the CIT extended campus, the corporate partnership network in DIT, enterprise, support and engagement in WIT and the create-start-up enterprise platform programme in the Institute of Art, Design and Technology in Dún Laoghaire.Significant attention has been paid to unfilled vacancies in the ICT sector and the resulting need to import skills for that sector.  It is unquestionable that in 2002 the dotcom collapse frightened students away from ICT higher education programmes.  That trend has now reversed.  However, there is a time lag between students coming into the system and meeting the needs of industry.I will conclude by stating that we need to know how business and industry view our higher education system.  To this end, the universities and institutions of technology are working with the private sector on the development of a comprehensive employers' survey.  We expect to pilot the survey next year, before continuing to apply it on a regular basis.  We are happy to respond to any questions the committee may have.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I thank Dr. Murphy and the delegates for their submission.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank Dr. Murphy and Mr. Costello for their presentation.  There is no doubt that change is needed at both second and third level education.  The committee is dealing with the third level sector today but we have already had some discussions with departmental officials regarding second level.  It is a positive sign to have representatives from both the universities and the institutes of technology here together in such significant numbers and who are willing to answer our questions.I acknowledge the positive developments in the provision of supplementary routes to higher education for mature students and those with disabilities.  However, these are often not acknowledged because we tend to focus a little too much on second level education.  I commend the institutions for their work over the past ten years.  The main topic of today's meeting is to examine the CAO system and the effect of competition for the high points courses upon the whole educational system.I have read both submissions which are excellent.  I refer to some of the options for change.  As regards the common or generic first year, the IOTI solution is quite strong on pointing out concerns about some aspects, including some professional courses.  Is there general agreement among the institutes of technology that provision could be made to provide a common first year for other courses?  The Irish Universities Association submission is largely silent on that issue.  It mentions a common first year as an option but so far as I can tell from reading the submission it does not make a definite choice one way or the other.  The submission neither expresses any concerns nor embraces the idea nor describes what level of discussions have taken place.A generic first year could be a very positive development.  It would help people who are effectively killing themselves to achieve sufficient points for medicine or law and other such courses with the resultant pressure which is generated throughout the system.  It would also give students a better insight into their own aptitudes and interests so that they would be better equipped to choose a course most suited to them before they tie themselves to one particular course.  There is much merit in such a system and it has worked successfully.  A conference was held in UCD two weeks ago which described how the system has worked very well in the University of New South Wales.  I would like to hear more feedback from the delegation about the discussions in the two sectors.I am concerned about one aspect of third level entry which is supplementary testing.  I can see that the significant emphasis on the leaving certificate as a terminal examination is not a good policy and there is scope at second level to have other forms of assessment where students are competing on the same playing field, so to speak.  However, I am concerned about the addition of extra tests such as SATs or other aptitude tests because students can study in advance for these tests.  I refer to the ESRI research done by Dr. Emer Smith which shows the social disparity between those who can take grinds and those who do not.  This adds another element of advantage for those who can afford to pay for private weekend courses.  I am a little concerned about any additional testing.  I am very interested to hear the delegates' comments on the generic first year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I will address the question about the generic first year.  The options supplied in the submission are those options which each of the institutions is considering for its own use.  We are in the relatively early stages of looking at the option across the sector.  I will, therefore, be focused in my response as it applies to DCU.Dublin City University has two areas where the experience is quite significant and positive.  The faculty of science has a common entry level.  Our five main science courses, including physics and right through to health and human performance, share a common first year, or at least, a common route, into those disciplines and a common entry into engineering.  Some students are taken directly into the straight physics programme but a proportion of places are reserved for common entry students.  This enables the students to have a bit more time to make a decision as to which area they wish to enter and also to get an in-depth taste of the science they may not have experienced in second level.An issue which arose at the UCD conference is that this option places significant strain on the three-year programmes.  DCU degree programmes are of four years' duration.  This provides more flexibility to enable students gain a little extra leeway while achieving a common foundation level for certain science or engineering disciplines.  In my view it would be very difficult, I suspect, to be able to include this much in a three-year programme.  However, the system contains good examples.  We could look at those students who have been tracked through common entry into the designated programmes to see how the system has worked from the perspective of the student and this information could inform the discussion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The idea of the generic first year is aimed at solving two problems, the first being the issue of student choice.  Students are asked to make decisions and choices at a very young age and they are also asked to make a large number of choices in the CAO system.  Students will usually know the area, such as the arts or science, in which their interest lies  and therefore it is advisable to make the first year as generic as possible.  This option enables them to fine-tune their choice as they progress.  Towards the end of that generic first year, they are beginning to specialise in subjects and this means every student's skills and special interests are being addressed as part of that first year programme.  It might be useful if they begin in the generic course and in the second semester or the third term move towards more specialised subjects.The institutes of technology are interested in exploring in that first year the development of employable skills and skills which provide a transition from second to third level.  We refer in our submission about the skills of creativity, innovation, problem-solving and applied knowledge.  Part of the idea of a generic first year is also to use that time to develop those kind of skills that make the transition easier.  We described in our paper the notion of an extended year, particularly for first years, so that more time could be devoted to what is for some students that very difficult transition period.  They could thus begin to learn the skills which employers tell us they want.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	We echo what was said about the shorter cycle programmes, in the two-year or three-year programmes, which produce a substantial number of graduates and these are graduates for industry.  Something gives if the short cycle is made more generic.  Inevitably, these programmes will be lengthened as a result and if they expand to more than one or two modules, then an additional year is required and this is an additional cost to the student and to the State.  For instance, a two-year programme could quite rapidly become a three-year programme and a three-year programme become a four-year programme.  This has happened in the area of engineering where the professional body has driven the requirement for chartered status in engineering.  Now, for all intents and purposes, a five-year programme is required in order to become a chartered engineer.  This is the inherent danger.As regards my own institution, our four-year engineering programmes offer common engineering entry and we also offer common science entry.  It is interesting to note that this is not a popular choice among students.  It is usually a lower points course in the CAO and it is an easier way into engineering but it is not a popular choice.  Students vote with their feet and they prefer the denominated entry into a specific engineering or science discipline.  We have no inherent objection to a common first year entry course but we are studying the cost and what would be involved.   It would delay making a choice by six months.  Will this better inform the person?  Of course, some of these choices are made in secondary school anyway because of having taken subjects which minimise choices.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I echo what Professor Scott stated at the beginning, which is that the universities have mentioned this option but no extensive discussion has taken place in the particular universities on a generic first year or a first year during which generic skills are prioritised.  Even in Trinity College, which has four year programmes and where our denominated courses are very popular, the approach we would like to take is to develop generic skills throughout the curriculum and not only in first year.  Generic skills such as communications must be taught and learned throughout, and we do not see them as something to be done exclusively or primarily in the first year.  With regard to getting a balance with in-depth knowledge of one's subject area, whether in a two subject or single subject degree, it is important not to lose the degree of depth that subject areas can attain for their graduates when they are focused on it from the first year all the way through.Many of the skills that students need to learn, in terms of transition from second level to third level and generic skills, can be taught through educational supports that run parallel with degree programmes.  These supports include peer-to-peer learning, maths support clubs and language learning.  From our point of view, while we think generic skills are absolutely critical, we would be slow to rush to the idea of a generic first year because we would be fearful that we would lose the depth of the knowledge and understanding that students gain as they go through a degree programme.  It is important to balance this, particularly if the third level sector is focused on master's degrees and PhD attainment.  We must ensure our level of attainment at primary degree level is excellent.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I agree with the need for skills to be taught throughout a course.  Regardless of what course is being studied, modules such as entrepreneurship and communications should be included.  A question was asked on whether the universities have come to an agreement on a generic first year and it is evident that meaty discussions on it have not taken place and that the paper was more about setting out options as opposed to the result of great discussions.  Do the universities intend to have discussions on it?  It would be interesting to see a consolidated response from the sector to the idea of a generic first year, whether positive or negative.I accept there may be a cost because it may be necessary to lengthen some courses.  However, an inherent cost to the State and the individual is built into the system because some courses have very high dropout rates.  Is it possible for this to be mitigated by a generic first year?  It may cost more but people will end up going in the right direction rather than dropping out because they find courses unsuitable, or completing a degree and deciding they do not want to work in the area because they were never interested in it and merely went through the motions.  Do the universities intend to write a joint paper setting out their approach to the idea of a generic first year?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The emphasis on lifelong learning is very positive.  However, a problem exists, because the universities are less accessible to part-time or evening students.  For example, someone who wants to study law must go to one of the law colleges.  We must examine ways to facilitate people to up-skill while remaining in work, as this will allow flexible lifelong learning.  There is no incentive to remain in work and complete a degree part-time or in the evenings.  There is no form of grant aid assistance or exemption from fees and this will have to be considered seriously.The strong focus on industrial work placements is to be encouraged.  University degrees are becoming more commonplace and what employers seek is experience, particularly hard-nosed experience.  Graduates are considered in much the same way as they were 30 years ago, which is as coming straight out of college without being properly guided or given experience in industry.  Industry-specific training is vital to make third level education relevant.Modularisation, which allows students to use course credits from a wide range of disciplines, is also a positive step and is to be encouraged.  The more disciplines students are allowed to try the better as it will give them a better idea about the career direction they will take at a later stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I will respond to Senator Power and Professor Scott will answer Deputy Fleming's questions.To put this in context, the Minister asked for a response from the universities in a tight timeframe leading up to the conference and it was important that the response be received for the conference.  The time involved did not allow in-depth probing of the feasibility or the balance between the various options we set out.  The working group took a very specific decision to try to put down as many options as possible, which obviously means they need to be sifted and analysed, and this is the process in which the sector is now involved.  Further detailed consideration will take place followed by a response, which will not be simply laying out the options but will be a consideration of what should be done.I will comment briefly on the generic first year.  This is not to be negative about it, but we point out in the paper that it moves making a choice from leaving certificate to the end of first year in university.  It does not remove the pressure of making a choice completely.  However, it allows one to be subject to the more extensive range of assessment mechanisms in university.  Without wishing to return to discussing second level, there is an argument that if more continuous assessment, which is being introduced at junior certificate level, existed at leaving certificate level some of the pressures would not exist and therefore the decision may not need to be moved to third level at all.  This needs to be part of the debate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	14	On the question of having a joint position, all higher education institutions would be very conscious that students must not be expected to navigate their way through a system with 23 publicly funded bodies with different entry requirements.  As with the matter of bonus points for maths, although all are autonomous bodies they accepted coming together to provide one solution so that students could navigate their way through the system.  We must remember that the learner is supposed to be at the centre.  I can speak only for ourselves, but all of my colleagues would be very conscious that if a decision was made on generic programmes it would be a higher education institution-wide decision, and this is with respect to every institution's autonomy.  One must look at it from the point of view of the student trying to navigate the system.With regard to Deputy Fleming's question on grant aid for part-time education, for the first time the Higher Education Authority has changed the funding model for higher education institutions this calendar year.  We are funded on a credit basis, so a distinction is not made between full-time and part-time students.  Rather, it has to do with how many credits each student undertakes.  I accept that full-time students have free fees, as they are affectionately known, whereas part-time students must still pay them.  However, the funding reform is a step towards the recommendation in the national strategy.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I will address a couple of issues before answering Deputy Fleming's question.  We must be careful to understand the information that is available on the drop-out rate.  Our third level sector has one of the best retention rates in Europe.  The one area in which we experience significant problems is ICT.  This was confirmed as recently as last year through the HEA report.  We should recognise that in many ways the sector constitutes an exceptionally good story in terms of retention.  The drop-out rate in ICT is of concern and is directly linked with mathematics performance.  We have exceptionally low drop-out rates in the health sciences, medicine and many professional disciplines.  The rate begins to creep up from almost 0.5% to 10% in some other disciplines.  This is a high retention rate internationally.Regarding Deputy Fleming's question, I support Dr. Murphy's comments.  The Hunt report underlines the fact that we need to equalise the playing field.  The HEA is funding on a credit basis, which should provide some support.  As the sector comes to terms with the need to grow the mature student population in particular, it must recognise that most mature students are not necessarily interested in full-time face-to-face programmes on a continual basis.  They may wish to move between full-time face-to-face, part-time face-to-face and online programmes.  Each of the institutions is moving ahead in this regard.  For example, well over 2,500 students of DCU's 11,000 population are in online-part-time mode, which is a decent performance nationally.Quite a bit of evidence provides international recognition and evidence of the fact that Irish graduates are extremely employable.  Our sector has done well in meeting the needs of employers.  Last year's ECOFIN report put Ireland first out of 28 countries in terms of our graduates' employability.  There is always room for improvement, but we should recognise how effective the sector has been.The pack supplied to members contains information on my institution, which has used work experience placements as part of its undergraduate degree programmes since its inception.  Nursing and teaching accounts for approximately 500 students.  Excluding them, we placed 800 students with nearly 900 companies last year.  These placements lasted from two months to 12 months, depending on the programme.  Including our professional programmes, 36 or 37 of our 50 programmes involve work placements in approximately 1,000 different companies.  It is just one of many examples across the sector of this type of engagement.  Unlike many European systems, the Irish system involves a close interaction between third level programmes and the business sector.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The idea of a common first year merits strong discussion within the sector's institutions, but it would not be a trivial change to a particular programme and would need to balance the needs of a variety of stakeholders, including students, employers, professional bodies and the institutes.  A reconfiguration would be required.  It would not be suitable for all programmes.  It is a question of creating space early on, that is, developing depth rather than breadth through the current model from the inception stage.  We would be getting into discipline-specific teaching straight away.The idea has significant value, in that it has the potential to develop the ability of students to learn.  They would be learning to learn.  The benefit in first year would be broader and could then be applied in developing depth more quickly than is allowed for under the current model.  It merits serious consideration.Reverting to the issue of lifelong learning, industry cannot wait for our graduate output.  The workforce in industry requires its skill-set and knowledge base to be developed regularly.  Through a variety of interactions, both sectors have engaged with industry.  It is a key requirement that we respond to the skills and knowledge needs of industry, be it for multinationals or, more importantly, indigenous small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Our sector has a long tradition of responding quickly to and facilitating the needs of industry.  We will leave the campus and deliver programmes in industry that have been customised for particular companies to meet specific needs.  Industry can understandably be more focused on the training end of the spectrum as opposed to the broader educational end.  We wrap what we do with industry in a broad, value-added educational qualification while meeting a company's specific needs and skill set requirements.

The points system is horrendous, as it kills creativity, abolishes all need for independent thought and has created a scenario in second level schools whereby people scramble around for the requisite points to enter into whatever third level courses they want.  Students are pressured by parents and teachers to get grinds, eat up notes and spit them out onto a page.  However, the system is fair, transparent and trusted.  In a country like Ireland where there is a whiff of corruption around pretty much everything, it is nice to know that we have a system in which people have faith.  The 1999 points commission was referred to, but it did not devise an option that was viable at the time.  If we are to change the system, can we be sure that people's faith in it will be retained?  Will the witnesses expand on the suggestion that, in terms of literacy and numeracy, English and mathematics should be mandatory for the calculation of points and qualification for third level?Professor Scott asked about ICT in third level.  I would be interested in hearing more on this matter, as I have strong opinions on the level of technology and science tuition in primary school teaching colleges.  That level may have changed since I attended college, but not radically so.  Heavy emphasis is placed on Irish and religion much to the detriment of English and science.  Will the witnesses comment on this matter?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I wish to comment on the question of whether the CAO is fair and transparent and if there is an alternative system.  It is certainly transparent.  It is fair within certain constraints, that is, it is fair if one can access grinds and supports.  It seems to replicate and reinforce some of the advantages which already exist in the system.  I have studied the issue and in terms of alternative models, a critical question is the form of assessments in place at second level which are then counted as student achievements.  The Deputy is correct that the leaving certificate is a memory test of rote learning.  We must ensure that the assessments at second level are assessing those kinds of things we know are necessary for achievement at third level and are exactly those skills that employers prize very highly, such as critical analysis, interpretation, reflective skills, creativity, problem-solving and communications skills.These skills are not assessed at second level in the leaving certificate.  We have to find a system whereby those critical skills are to the fore in the assessment process.  We must find a system to then map these achievements onto a points or an entry system and this is almost a technical question.  However, unless assessment is carried out at second level of those factors which point to future achievement at third level, then whatever system is in place will leave us with the same problems.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I will comment further on this topic and then address the question on ICT.  Society needs to recognise that entry mechanisms into third level programmes operate as rationing gate-keepers.  There has been a very high growth in third level places over the past ten years in particular and beginning in the 1980s.  It has been a phenomenal growth year on year and decade on decade.  As is described in the report produced by the IUA for the transition conference, Ireland is in quite a unique position in Europe in that a very high proportion of our second level school leavers expect to go to third level.  Therefore, as the population grows - we are expecting a bulge coming through second level and into third level - the pressure on places becomes almost indescribable.  Even if we were to continue to grow at 10% per year over the next ten years, we will not keep up with the demand.  We have to have some rationing system and this is the simple part; the more difficult part, as Professor Hogan has indicated, is how the exit from second level is matched with third level entry requirements.Unfortunately, I do not think we have come up with any best international model.  There may be less effective, less useful, less fair and less transparent models but we have not come up with one really good model.  This is, in essence, the reason the transition paper suggested we should stop looking for a single mechanism but rather that we should consider a combination of mechanisms.The sector is very happy to work together.  As Dr. Murphy has indicated, we have worked together on the question of bonus points.  More important, one of the points raised at the transition conference was our willingness and keenness to work with our colleagues in the second level sector.  We all want an educated population and an effective second level curriculum and assessment system in particular.  What came through in the UCD conference was that people were not necessarily worried about the second level curriculum but they were very worried about the terminal examination assessment system.As a society, as workers in the third level sector and as future recipients of health care and all sorts of other things, we all want a well-educated, competent population.  It behoves us to work together and possibly for the first time in a considerable period, everybody is ready to do so.  Part of this working together will require public re-education.  Just because something is trusted does not mean it is necessarily the best option and this is a societal discussion which will be required.As to the comment about ICT, I come from two different evidence bases.  The report produced by the HEA last year showed the progression rates from year 1 to year 2 in ICT subjects, the rates for completing computer applications and software engineering.  This area has one of the highest drop-out rates nationally.  Some of the third level university programmes have quite worrying drop-out rates, at perhaps 25%.  DCU has a very large school of computing and its flagship degree for many years was a very large computer applications degree.  Following the dotcom burst, we saw a significant drop in demand for places.  DCU normally had an intake of approximately 300 students but the demand collapsed, as did the academic performance of the students coming through from the leaving certificate.Instead of automatically assuming one would have students with in excess of 450 points coming into this programme, we began to see students with 320 or 340 points.  These students did not always have either honours maths or an A or B in ordinary level mathematics.  We began an analysis to see if this was linked with overall leaving certificate performance or whether it was directly linked to any particular subject.  Following a number of years of analysis, there emerged a clear correlation with performance in leaving certificate mathematics and progression success in the computing degree.  I join with the national concern about mathematics and science teaching in general.The comment about the primary curriculum would have been warranted about ten years ago.  My own children started primary school in Scotland and when we moved to Ireland we discovered that my older son did not study any science until he left primary school whereas it had been part of the curriculum in Scotland from primary year 1.  The primary level curriculum has changed but we still have an issue to address.  If the Irish system is compared with the Scottish system which is a relatively comparable system at both primary and second level, and if one compares the first four choices for honours level subjects among males and females doing the Scottish higher examinations and the Irish leaving certificate, there is a very different pattern of subject choice.  Both male and female students within the Scottish higher system will have both mathematics and a science subject in those first four most popular choices.  This is not the case in the Irish system, particularly among female students.  Fewer girls take honours maths or physics and chemistry in particular.  Those subjects do not drop outside the top ten choices but they certainly drop down to the sixth, seventh or potentially eighth choice.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Not necessarily.  There may be a link in some places with the provision of honours maths classes but this has decreased as an issue and it is not necessarily the reason.  It may be to do with the approach used in teaching mathematics.  For example, the Scottish primary system was cited as a European model system in the ten years I lived in Scotland and many of the Scandinavian countries came to Scotland to see how primary level mathematics or science were taught in the Scottish primary system.  Even though the situation has improved and the curriculum has placed more emphasis on science in the primary curriculum now than ten years ago, we still have a way to go in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I agree with Professor Hogan that while the current system is transparent and understood it certainly could not be accused of being completely fair.  There needs to be a debate about continuous assessment and project work.  However, we can take action in the short term as regards the final examination.  My daughter has just completed the junior certificate and I know that the same questions come up year on year at junior certificate and leaving certificate and one can almost predict when a question is due to come up.  A change could be made in quite a short period, and soon, in the questions and the problem-solving aspects of the final examination.I wish to make a point about further education. The point was made that the higher education system is becoming very large and that there is a massification of education, but it seems that in Ireland we do not seem to have considered the further education option as a viable alternative.  We talk about PLCs and we talk about further education as being PLCs.  The leaving certificate has become the gold standard, but I feel we need a serious debate on the role of further education.  What is the role for those students aged 15 or 16 who are not doing very well in school?  Is there a way that further education and the kinds of programmes that can be developed in that area can be seen as a viable option?We have also talked about further education as a bridge between second level and higher education.  That notion of a bridge is unhelpful because further education needs to be developed as a sector in itself that provides a level of programmes that are viable and meet industry needs.  It might sound strange to say that, but it might be a better option for a number of students than going into higher education and dropping out of programmes, as currently happens.

I will call Deputy Lyons, followed by Deputy Barrett.
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I thank the many witnesses who are here.  Due to the fact there are so many of them, it takes a long time to provide a response.  I agree fully with Professor Scott who said earlier that there is always room for improvement and always ways of doing things better.  I commend DCU on its generation 21 initiative.  I was clued in on this before it was launched and I understand DCU has revamped most of its modules, equipped students with an e-portfolio and is developing the types of attributes it believes will make students more employable and more in line with the employment available.I wish to put my question to everybody else here.  I know people are doing things in their own way, but what DCU has done is good practice.  Perhaps there are better ways of doing it, but I do not know of them.  Perhaps the university and technology sector here may not be able to respond on this practice, but it is something that is important to do.  The DCU approach acknowledges that we need to push the types of skills that ensure we have a more rounded and employable person and that these skills are in line with what students do at college.  Where do the other universities stand in comparison to what DCU has done?  If they have not done the same, why not and do they intend to do it?I have a concern with regard to the institutes of technology proposals on literacy and numeracy.  Although I commend the fact that the institutes are looking for a solution with regard to access to third level, I am unsure what exactly is involved with regard to the points they wish to allocate for those who score well in English or maths.  People from disadvantaged areas tend to do worse in English and maths, yet I am aware that people who have gone through access programmes have done well.  I know about DCU's access programme because it is in my constituency and it has a high success rate for students who go through the programme.  Many students achieve above average results, yet some of them would have struggled at school.  The excellent results are possibly to do with the resources put in to catch those students and prevent them falling through the net.  I am somewhat scared and concerned about the direction being taken regarding the proposals on literacy and numeracy and the weighting of points in that regard, because this affects some people.  We already know that people from less well-off areas are all too under-represented at third level.Witnesses may not be able to answer my final question today, but I would be more than happy if somebody could give me an answer.  Secondary school teachers must have a professional qualification in order to teach.  This is crucial.  Anecdotally, many teachers say the higher diploma was nothing.  It was everything to me because it gave me the theory and practice behind how to bring about the learning process.  I am not sure what the position is at third level with regard to professional qualifications for teaching.  I do not imply in any way that the quality of teaching and learning at third level needs to be questioned.  I am curious whether, since secondary teachers must obtain a professional qualification in order to become teachers, third level staff must do the same.  What is the position on that?  People often think that because universities close from May until October some people are not working.  I know some university lecturers work 24-7 and work really hard and would not like to create a false picture.  I know of many who answer calls and e-mails from students at any time, even after midnight and at any time of the year.My main question concerns DCU's generation 21 initiative.  Where do the other groups stand in that regard?
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I thank the Chairman for facilitating me.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance also, where the problems are far greater than those we are examining here.  I also sit on the Trinity board representing the academic staff and was elected by Trinity graduates to the Seanad.  However, two issues discussed here - extending the academic year and changing the points system - were never mentioned by either group to me, despite my being elected again in April this year to the board.I said in the Seanad that I was quite surprised the points system conference was taking place as there had been no discussion of it by the board on which I sit.  It has been the unfortunate trend in Irish higher education that the people at the top "know better than you what you should think and what you should do".  There is student and staff representation on the board. However, the heads of the Irish universities are still what has become the Irish Universities Association.  The name has been changed, but the practice has not.  The heads should talk to people who give the lectures to 400 first year students in the Edmund Burke lecture hall.  Then they might find out something that would be of value to them.  This trend continues.  There was no working lecturer or researcher on the Hunt committee, the innovation committee nor the smart economy committee.  It is a bit like being employed by colonial governors.  They see one there, but they only talk to other colonial governors.  The heads of Irish universities must get real and get in touch with real students and academic staff.I voted against bonus points for mathematics because they do nothing for the 80% of children who are taught mathematics by somebody without a qualification in the subject and reward those who went to a school with the one fifth of qualified maths teachers or who could afford grinds.  The bonus points are a bogus solution.  They let the universities off the hook and let them suggest the maths and education departments should get together to ensure a supply of adequately trained maths teachers.  If there is consensus on bonus points, I was not part of that consensus.We have a new provost and team in governance in Trinity College now and many of these issues will be discussed, probably for the first time.  A strategic innovation fund spent €6 million changing the pieces on the draughts board or drawing lines on maps.  Afterwards, a survey of the academic staff showed that one out of 181 thought he or she could do more research as a result of the expenditure of that €6 million.  The obsession with administrative structures diverts money away from where it should be spent or from where we want it spent in education.I caution also -----

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Could these documents be sent to the governing bodies of universities before they are announced to the media?  Could we have a proper discussion on mathematics?  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has been given responsibility for this by the Minister.  Bonus points are not the solution.  I put it to our visitors that bonus points are a bogus solution to the problem of mathematics teaching in our schools.Given that employment in industry has fallen by 53,000, from 287,000 to 234,000 since June 2005, allowing industrialists too much of a say in the running of Irish higher education could be ill advised.  I would not want any bankers advising on economics courses, given the trouble they have got us into.  Education must have some pride in itself.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I would not trivialise it for a moment.  Our submission tries to show that there is a huge variety of approaches to industry engagement across the sector.  There is an important point about the need for diversity in higher education.  There is widespread agreement that we do not want a higher education system that becomes completely homogenous and offers the same student experience to every student, regardless of the character of institution.  While it is important that there is a high level of industry engagement and that we are following up with the presidents of universities and the chief executives of large and small major companies in Ireland, it is important that this is translated into something with colour and variety.  We know that is what students want as well.
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	32	On the question of why every university is not the same as DCU, I am trying to refrain from mentioning any aspects of individual institutions but some have decided that stagnation rather than transition is the way to go.  That is unacceptable in universities or institutes of technology.  I gave an example of good practice and if we were to crawl through every corridor of most university sectors there are elements where there is room for improvement.  That is the message I would like Mr. Costello to take home.  I am not looking for a homogenous third level sector; I am looking for a vibrant third level sector that meets the demands of the students today.  When I went to university, finishing in 1998, I had a fantastic experience but I do not know whether it equipped me to be employable in a transient world where one job is not a job forever.  That is what I want to resonate from today's meeting.  It would be unfair to say that everyone is trying different approaches.  Aspects of our university and institute of technology sector are not meeting the need to change.  The onus is on the team of people responsible for each of those universities to ensure we are delivering an up-to-date experience that will allow anyone who passes through those doors, whether on a full-time or part-time basis, the best opportunity to be employable in the future.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	33	We agree with that and it is the reason we are here today.  Universities are constantly seeking to up their game.Regarding access and Senator Barrett's reference to the strategic innovation fund, under that programme we completely transformed our access system and put in place the HEAR and DARE schemes for disadvantaged students and those with a disability.  Senator Power made reference to this.  This interfaces with the points system and is relevant to the question raised earlier about what we can do with the points system.  We integrate in the HEAR and DARE schemes through the CAO system.  One can still work with the points system and achieve some objectives.  We know that, once such students get into college, if they have the appropriate support and access routes, they often do better than those who come through the mainstream points system.  We are conscious of that.I am not sure about the specific questions Senator Barrett raised.  The Minister asked us to examine the points system and we are anxious to respond to requests from the Minister.  While it might not have come up in the way the Senator mentioned it, the UCD conference was vastly oversubscribed and it was attended by several hundred people.  From our participation in it, it was clear that it is a matter of major national importance and debate.  That is why we are anxious to engage with it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I will take up the question on maths and English.  Our perception, as the HEA report indicates, is that there is a correlation between student performance in maths and English in the leaving certificate and the ability to perform and succeed at third level.  I take the point about students from disadvantaged areas potentially underperforming in those areas but, potentially, the issue is much more serious than that.  Many secondary schools must be challenged to have greater expectations for their students.  Sometimes, in an attempt to get a set of excellent results, they stream the children very early.  My daughter performed adequately at the junior certificate English and she got a C in the honours paper, then she took transition year, and found that the cut-off point in the school was determined as a B in the honours papers.  There is no evidence base for that and no rationale.  I would far prefer to see my daughter getting through honours English and passing it at the leaving certificate rather than trying to go for an A at ordinary level English.  The level at which the child is stimulated to think and perform is very different and it sets up the children to be able to cope with third level rather than assuming they are not going to be able to manage it at 14 years of age.  This is an important point.Regarding the query on teaching qualifications, I come from an interesting stable on this.  I was required by my professional body to have a teaching qualification before becoming an academic.  I speak from a position of some knowledge on this topic.  Most people who take most higher education courses will learn something from them and benefit from them.  It is a myth to assume that, just because people have been through a teacher education programme, they will automatically become good teachers.  Understanding of, and enthusiasm for, the subject is what makes one a good teacher.  Nonetheless, the Hunt report begins to address this and we have a number of very good third level teacher preparation programmes.  Some are established, as is the case in DIT or the universities that are providing upskilling programmes at graduate, diploma or masters level to provide people with the skills to engage with the digital generation.  We were not necessarily purveyors of this.  DCU has been working on a teaching quality enhancement scheme, which looks at how we can support staff, particularly those facing large numbers in lecture theatres.  This was pointed out by Senator Barrett.  We must consider how we can equip people to handle this and also to handle one-to-one interaction or small seminar groups.  Universities are looking at this but we should learn from the experience in the UK, which is that if one requires this as a compulsory mechanism, people will pay lip service to it.  We must urge people to engage in it because they want to do the job better and because we are looking at enhancement rather than compliance.  We have a lesson to learn.Regarding the bonus points, the new provost in Trinity was part of the registrar group we worked with and a decision on bonus points was not put through the sector until it had gone through all the academic councils.  I can only vouch for the depth of discussion in my institution and it certainly happened.Regarding industry engagement, we must be careful not to dichotomise and create schisms that do not need to exist.  Industry, business and service are looking for exactly the kind of generic skills that makes someone succeed as a third level graduate.  We are looking for an inquiring mind, skills and critical analysis and excellent judgment.  We are looking for the ability to problem-solve, and we try to facilitate civic and global engagement.  Mr. Donohoe from IBEC would recognise those skills just as I do.  We need to be careful not to create false dichotomies.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I would like to continue on that point.  I agree with Professor Scott.  It is important to be cognisant of the fact that the arts, humanities and culture are also very much part of the remit of universities and they are also part of the context in which we need to develop these entrepreneurial and innovative skills.  In the submission I prepared, I wanted to stress that all of these issues are there for the arts and culture as well as for the STEM subjects.  In Trinity College, not only do we try to ensure that students in science, technology and engineering undergo internships and engage with industry, but we also recognise that culture and the arts is where much of our national growth will come from.  Rather than being exclusively focused on the classroom, students are also out learning about arts management in publishing companies, doing translation, working with digital humanities and so on.  That is an important part of what will allow for economic regeneration in this country.I have a final comment on the issue of teaching qualifications for third level.  When I had my first academic post in the UK I was required to do a diploma in teaching and learning in higher education, which taught me a great deal.  However, the university I was working in abandoned the compulsory element after about five years - precisely, as Professor Scott said, because it was a requirement rather than something people really believed they needed to do to enhance their teaching quality.  Most universities now have extensive programmes for developing skills.  That is critical for the quality of the student experience.  I absolutely endorse what Deputy Lyons said.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I have another follow-on to that.  Deputy Lyons's comment has aroused a lot of interest.  I am another UK graduate with a professional teaching qualification, and if you asked me whether it enhanced my teaching when I taught in further and higher education, I would say "possibly," but I can definitely say it did.  The programme of continuous professional development that we have within the sector is important not just in the teaching of skills, as has already been said, but in teaching staff how do deal with students with learning difficulties or disabilities and how to cope with a broad range of social problems.  At IADT we have a dedicated teacher training centre for our own staff, who are also doing master's and PhD degrees to continue gaining academic knowledge on the research side.There is a slightly old-fashioned view of the academic.  At IADT we have many staff who work with us part-time but also work in industry, as radio producers, in television, as photographers or in arts management, and they bring that day-to-day real world experience to us.  The notion that an academic is a full academic may be true in some cases, but there are a lot of cases in which real-world day-to-day experience is brought in.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I would also like to respond to Deputy Lyons's comment on teaching and learning.  First, the HEA is currently working on a proposal for a national academy of teaching and learning.  This is not an out-of-the-blue thing; it is designed to bring together many of the initiatives that were spawned under the strategic innovation fund in the area of teaching and learning, all of which is within the area of enhancing collaboration.  The other thing is that demonstration of teaching competence and the development of teaching portfolios is a major part of assessment for promotion in universities, so it is something that is strongly recognised.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I assure Deputy Lyons that there are a number of lights under a variety of bushels in the IoT sector.  Maybe we do not get them out there in the way we should, but we certainly can give a list of initiatives that are having an impact on the ground in terms of rounded development for students.  As Dr. Doona said, much of this is in concert with industry partners.

#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I welcome the delegation.  I ask Mr. Costello to expand on something in his written submission.  He urges that we play to our strengths in arts and culture, and he is referring to that from an economic perspective.  Perhaps he would say a little about that.One of the big challenges is to broaden participation at third level across the social spectrum.  There is major inequality at the heart of Irish society.  I have not heard much about that today and I would like to hear some brief thoughts.  Perhaps the witnesses would refer to some of their policies, initiatives or ideas in this area.There has been much emphasis on aligning the education system with the skills required in the economy, which is of course important.  However, we live in a fast-moving world, and the requirements of the economy change quickly.  There is a danger that we will skew the education system too definitively in that direction, and I am uneasy about that.  I would like to see how we strike this balance, particularly the balance between training and education.  We must distinguish between those two activities, and the balance should perhaps be more sensitively struck because, as I said, the economy can change so quickly.One of the speakers spoke strongly about further education, and I am delighted to have heard this.  What is striking about the further education system is how successfully, and inexpensively, it has straddled the continuum of education, training and employment.  For example, Ballyfermot College of Further Education, in my own area, has practically rewritten the credo for the film and animation industry, and has been very successful in that regard.  One could pick out lots of other examples, in areas of economic activity such as arts and culture and child care, in which high quality but inexpensive delivery models have been successfully honed by VECs.  They have 150 years of experience.  The great colleges that the vocational education sector has nurtured and cultivated in this country include the DIT at Bolton Street and Kevin Street and colleges of art and design and music.  Thus, there is a backdrop of expertise and experience in the education, training and employment continuum.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I welcome the witnesses.  It is a pity Senator Barrett has gone as I wanted to reply to his comment by saying that one of the worst lecturers I ever had was in mathematics.  I am sure he was well qualified but he did not know how to lecture properly.My point is about the emphasis that is put on Irish in our education system.  A third of the kids who did their leaving certificates last year did not do Irish, which means that two thirds did.  Is there a connection between that and the fact that students must have Irish to enter the NUI universities?  If the NUI universities decided not to have Irish as a compulsory subject for entry, would there be a drop in the numbers doing leaving certificate Irish?  I did a science degree and I found it strange that I came across no Irish at all throughout my degree course.To follow on from what Deputy Lyons said, when I spent a short while teaching, I was required to do the ceard teastas Gaeilge even though my subjects were maths, science and biology.  In order to teach mathematics, biology and science at second level, I was required to have the ceard teastas Gaeilge.  It was compulsory to have it in order to teach, regardless of one's subjects.  Do the delegates agree there is an over-emphasis on the Irish language in the education system?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Mr. Costello indicated that the paper we are discussing today is the outcome of a request from the Minister to examine the issues concerned.  Reading through the paper and listening to the delegates' comments, it seems there is not necessarily an imperative for change coming from the third level authorities.  My impression is that if they had not been asked to do so, they would not be inclined to devise these options for consideration.  Are the delegates of the view that there is in fact an imperative for change?  As Professor Scott remarked, there is no best option identified but rather we have a list of suggestions to consider.  My concern is that there may be an element of change for change's sake and that there is a danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  For all its failures, the current system is seen to be transparent and although not perhaps as fair as it could be, it at least attempts to be as fair as possible.  I am concerned those elements could be diluted.Has analysis been done of the respective performances of third level students pre and post the points system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	43	In terms of the difference between training and education, our fundamental concern is that all our courses offer participants knowledge, skill and competence.  Those three words are referenced repeatedly by the National Framework of Qualifications and are written into all our course objectives.  Any proposal for a new course must demonstrate the level of knowledge, skill and competence it will impart to students.  Many of the institutes of technology grew out of vocational schools.  My own institution, Cork Institute of Technology, has its origins in Crawford Technical College, Crawford College of Art and Design and the Municipal School of Music, the oldest music school on the British islands - if we are allowed to use that term in this august building - dating from the 1850s.  We have built on a long tradition.Reference was made to a particular organisation in regard to its cheap mode of delivery.  The reality is that we are tied into a system of contracts.  Some 80% of my budget goes on pay and those contracts are negotiated not by me but at a national level.  That is the primary cost factor in any delivery.On the Irish language, Deputy Lawlor will be pleased to hear that the requirement in institutes of technology is either English or Irish.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I am aware of that.  I was not referring to the institutes of technology in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I understand.  Deputy Ryan asked whether we in the higher education system accept the need for change.  Everybody accepts there have been unintended consequences of the points system in terms of the behaviour it has driven.  Going back to Deputy Lyons's point, we have proposed putting a value on English and mathematics in the leaving certificate.  If one does not put any value on particular subjects, students take a message from that.  As a society, we should send out the message that these are important subjects in the leaving certificate.  We, as higher education institutions, should place a value on them.  We want students who can communicate and who are numerate.  Even those who enter humanities programmes must be numerate as well as literate.However, it is also, as Deputy Ryan observed, about maintaining fairness in the system and safeguarding the faith and trust people have in it.  It is not about changing the system radically but rather according a particular value to the points obtained in mathematics and English.  In regard to the proposal on the international baccalaureate, it was a question of seeking to return to what the leaving certificate originally set out to be, namely, from a curriculum point of view, to provide a broad general secondary education which every citizen should have.  It is one of the more dramatic proposals.The Deputy asks whether tinkering with a system that fundamentally works will have a negative impact.  That is a concern.  If we could predict with certainty what the impact of certain changes might be, we could play around with it more freely.  One must make changes slowly and deliberately and consider the consequences.  It is vital that we avoid simply driving a different set of behaviours.In regard to supplementary testing, I have been long enough in the system to remember when all prospective third level students were interviewed.  Could one guarantee that such a system would be fair, open and transparent?  The simple answer is no.  None of us wants to return to that.  We should also bear in mind that mass higher education is a relatively recent phenomenon, leading to the current situation where two out of three leaving certificate students go on to higher education.  One of our recommendations, as referred to by the Deputy, is that a route through further education might ease some of the problems encountered by those with low point scores.  A low point score is not necessarily indicative of academic problems but may point to other problems.  Some young people need time to find their way and may benefit from a certain amount of remedial work.  We sometimes forget that people mature at different rates and that 18 year olds are not all the same.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I am delighted to have an opportunity to comment on access.  It is an issue that is dear to my heart and which was a significant element of my PhD.  At the Institute of Art, Design and Technology some 15% of our students are mature students, which is quite high for the sector, and some 7% are students with disabilities, which is also high.  However, we have a very low percentage of students from the disadvantaged schools in our area.  We have been doing some work to discover why that is.  Within the institutes of technology and the universities there are several schemes which seek to redress that balance, including the higher education access route, HEAR, and the disability access route to education, DARE, schemes which encourage participation by students with disabilities.  There are also programmes and articulation arrangements with further education colleges to facilitate the route to which Dr. Murphy referred.One of the most successful initiatives I have seen was a project on which I did some work with the University of Southern California.  It was a long-term project which began by engaging with primary school children and their parents in order to instil the notion of higher education as a possibility for them.  We have done some work in Dún Laoghaire, with the help of dormant account funding, with young Travellers and their parents to discover whether the notion of high education is even on their radar.  We came up with some very interesting results from that.  The bottom line with access is that we must go right back to primary level, working in community organisations and with parent groups.  We also must look at the fears and concern that hinder access, of which money is certainly one, with the expense of supporting a student through higher education being prohibitive for some.  The issue of student registration charges or fees - whatever one calls them - must be addressed.  It is only by engaging at the start, with very young children, that we can begin to make the change that are needed.  The schemes currently in place are only partially working.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I will respond to two questions from Deputy Conaghan and one from Deputy Ryan.  Deputy Conaghan asked about the economic element to which we referred in our submission on the creative side.  I suppose that goes back to work by Michael Porter in the early 1990s that underpins the Culliton report, which emphasises the agglomeration effects and clustering.  More recently, Richard Florida has developed this theory of creative cities and has emphasised that most successful regions have industrial strengths as well as a strong creative class, which is more in the arts and humanities field.  The fusing together of these two fields has a very powerful effect.  It results in areas where people want to live and thrive.  It also, as Professor Hogan mentioned, creates spin-offs in the area of the creative and cultural industries.  Those sectors then become industries in their own right, alongside the technology sector.  That in essence is what we were referring to.Deputy Michael Conahan also asked about the danger of the instrumentalisation of learning by being too narrowly vocationally focused.  That is what I was emphasising when I spoke about diversity in the system.  The registrars of the universities had an interchange with industry about a year ago on what industry wants from our sector.  What became clear is that there are two different views.  One segment of industry wants very tightly vocationally qualified people while another wants the broader, rounded and not necessarily so discipline-specific type of graduate.  Our higher education system has to cater for all of that.  As was emphasised by colleagues here today, we agree there is a set of core competencies and, as Professor Scott has said, we and the industry representative bodies are completely ad idem on a set of core competencies that need to be inculcated throughout the higher education experience, but done in a diverse way as no one size fits all.Deputy Ryan asked about the points system.  Dr. Murphy has put it very well, somewhere in the nexus of the leaving certificate and the transition to third level, but with the rationing of third level places there is a problem.  It needs more debate and discussion as to where the problem lies and precisely what are the right solutions.  We point out in our report, if one takes the various attributes that one would like an admission system to achieve, there is no one perfect system.  The current points system majors on certain aspects but is weak on other aspects.  Probably any other solution will have a different balance of pros and cons.  The Deputy is correct that we are of the view that one treads carefully in this space because a number of Deputies have made the point that the current system is flawed but works.We want to ensure that if we replace it, that we will replace it with something better.  That requires not just an educational but a societal debate.  It was interesting that when Professor Hyland's report was published, one of the options - the lottery type system - started to provoke a negative reaction in the pages of the media.  It goes to show that one can put forward options but we need to have them fully debated.  It is an educational as well as a societal issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I wish to address two of the issues that were raised during the last set of questions.  On the issue of access, I fully agree with my colleague from Dún Laoghaire when she states that it must begin with engagement with primary and secondary schools in the locality, really changing culture as well as providing access routes.  The Trinity College access programme has been very successful in that, albeit in a very limited way.  The major challenges for access programmes is to ensure that when students participate on them they are fully integrated into the student body, that the services provided are done in a very integrated way and that the retention of students is high.The Trinity College access programme has a very high retention rate, so that is not an issue.  The question is how we can resource it in terms of rolling it out.  It is an excellent programme but it is far too small.  We know that if we broaden it without the resources we will probably have larger intakes but the retention of students through the system will not be as it ought to be.  It is about balancing that.On the question of the Irish language, I do not have a view on whether there is an over-emphasis on Irish but one of the great challenges for Ireland is that learning a language at such an early age and running through the system has not seemed to equip our students to learn and be fluent in other languages.  One thing we have not mentioned is that the real skills shortage is the combination of technical and technological knowledge plus language skills.  We have missed that in our discussion today.  It is a mystery how we could have such intensive language teaching and such low levels of fluency.  When one learns one language it is commonly known that there is a much greater aptitude to learn another.  That does not seem to have translated in our educational system.  We must look very seriously at the teaching of all languages in our system.  That is where the next generation of challenges will come from for Irish graduates in terms of industry.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	May I address Deputy Conahan's fear that we may appear to be slaves to industry.  I can assure Deputies that we are not, but that is not to lose sight of the fact that we are in the business of changing people's lives for the better via education.  There is no better way to change people's lives positively for the better than to give them an active stake in society.  What better way to give them that but through active participation in a vibrant workforce.  We try to underpin this requirement for fundamental knowledge and these core competencies in and around the broader skills and knowledge sets of transferable skills.  We also try to get students to the stage where they can cope with the dynamic of change in the workplace and respond to that dynamic.  That is something that takes time through the educational process and one does not see the impact of that until the third or forth year of a programme.Let us look at my institution, the Institute of Technology, Tallaght.  About two years ago we looked at the variety of routes into the institution.  We have 14 different ways through which one can enter the institution, the vast majority targeted at access provision and second chance education.  We have taken, and we are happy to take a lot of students from Ballyfermot who performed exceedingly well on a great many of our programmes.  We can see that continuum from a structured and formal further education sector as being a real positive development, if it were to come about nationally.  There is a responsibility on industry and ourselves to start promoting real careers in industry sectors all the way from primary school, where we get to children and encourage them to start to develop a passion in terms of what they want to do.  We want to get them to look beyond the fireman and the premiership football examples.We must start to sell the value of real careers to schoolchildren right the way back through the educational continuum.  We need to co-promote that idea.  When people see us arriving at a school, they think we are promoting courses but we are at pains to try to tell them that we are promoting life changing opportunities for them for active citizenship and active engagement in the workforce.  If we stood side by side with our partners from industry who can give real examples of this, we would do the State a huge service.  The point has been made that, in terms of how we support the remediation of the access students, this matters in terms of approach.  That is extremely difficult to deliver through our current resourcing model.  We still strive and are available to do it but it is becoming increasingly difficult.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I will pick up directly on that point.  DCU has the oldest access programme in the country and probably the largest, but it is in the middle of one of the areas with the lowest participation rate in higher education in the country.  Just over 20% of our intake comprises a combination of disabled, lower socioeconomic and mature students.  The issue of straight from school access is one of expectation as well as economics.  As Professor Hogan has pointed out we work directly, through the HEAR scheme, and intensively with 120 feeder schools, some of which have traditionally low participation rates in higher education.It requires a full-time member of staff who does nothing else.  If resources are tight it means the person focused on that area cannot do other things.  In the current environment it is becoming an increasingly difficult issue, as is the expense of higher education.  It is not simply a fees issue, there are basic issues such as where people are going to live, whether they have heat and electricity to study and where they are going to buy books.One way we have tried to deal with such issues is to work with our foundation to raise funding for access students and examine their economic backgrounds and level of support.  Some students need full residential support while others may require a book grant.  It requires a huge amount of fundraising effort to integrate students, as Professor Hogan said, and give them a fighting chance of succeeding in terms of equalling the playing field.  The playing field is not only academic; students may need extra tutorial or academic skills support.  There are many other factors not directly linked to academics for which students need support.Over the past four years we have worked with Ballymun regeneration but we will struggle to continue this work.  We have a physical presence in Ballymun on Shanowen Road to try to demystify the institution and make access easier by having students participate in minor taster modules or level 6 or 7 modules which feed into other programmes.  It is a huge resource constraint.  Currently 50% is paid by us and 50% by Ballymun but as our budget gets squeezed we may have to reconsider it.  The broadening access agenda is very dear to DCU's mission and the entire sector has worked hard to implement the HEAR and DARE schemes.  A public discussion needs to happen because while there is no doubt there are inequalities in the system, it takes money to bring people on to an even playing field.I am of the same mind as Professor Hogan on the Irish language.  I have no strong feelings one way or the other regarding the level of teaching but we have a significant issue.  We should have much better history and modern languages teaching than we do.  Irish mirrors performance in German, French, Spanish and Italian in our schools.  Students leave school with a literature background in languages.  They do not have the level of linguistic competency required.  There is already a major issue.  It has not hit the media yet because as soon as people began to feed it into the media they said there was no problem with STEM, science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  However, there is a problem with STEM and modern languages.It is not an Irish problem but Ireland should be in a much better position to address it than our UK neighbours who do not generally take a second language.  Most of our students take a second language and we are still struggling to have them work through third and fourth languages.  It is a major economic as well as intellectual issue for us.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I thank the Chairman for inviting us to attend the committee today.  It is great to see we acknowledge there is a skills shortage, something which was debated earlier.  This is a significant issue in our sector where there are currently 2,500 jobs lying vacant because we cannot find people to fill them.I wish to refer specifically to a comment that was made in the last session by the university representatives.  They said that Irish graduates were extremely employable internationally, which is a fact.  They are extremely employable by all other countries seeking to have a smart economy.  They are proactively incentivising Irish graduates to work overseas.  A number of our members have lost staff who went to work in Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom.  All of these employers are pursuing their own strategies to attract digitally skilled staff.I want to take a practical approach to today's meeting by providing the committee with a set of proposals and recommendations.  Earlier this year, the Irish Internet Association, IIA, launched its own policy proposal on retaining skilled workers in Ireland.  The IIA proposes a short to medium-term strategy specifically targeting employees to stay here.  We want people who have gone through the education system in Ireland to be incentivised to take up the 2,500 jobs, if not more, in the sector.  This would be done through the development and implementation of a tax credit programme for them to incentivise them to invest their futures here.In addition, we would like to consider the possibility of a repatriating and relocation grant specifically targeting this important indigenous Irish industry.  At the moment, international organisations in the sector here can pay to relocate international workers to take up such positions.  Indigenous businesses do not have the same opportunity, so we propose a relocation grant to help in the short term Irish SMEs, which could not ordinarily afford to do so, to source people overseas to take up these positions here.The second issue is that of attracting students to take up study in this area.  I was particularly impressed by one of the previous witnesses who said we need to promote careers, not jobs.  We are conscious of that too and for that reason we are proposing a qualifications and accreditation programme for developers.  The developer community currently includes everyone from self-taught teenagers to experienced postgraduate students.  In other professions and trades there is a minimum requirement for either a primary degree or a postgraduate qualification that would afford them some professional status.  That does not exist for the developer community at the moment, but we think the benefits of having such a system would be manyfold.  It would ensure that in the recruitment of an employee or the engagement of a company's services, the employer-customer is able to make a reasonable, objective and timely evaluation of that candidate's skills.With such a system, standards in the industry would rise as rogue traders leave the market or, at the very least, would be forced to reach minimum standards of professionalism to compete for jobs.  Currently, many people who have gone through a 13-week course, and have done a few hours on Ruby and Java, can legitimately say they are web developers when in fact they are not.  That is the reason I have grown men ringing me in tears because they have just paid €9,000 for a poor standard e-commerce site.  They have not received what they were supposed to get.  Traders like that exist, but professionalising the sector would eliminate it.  It would provide greater clarity, as well as a structured education and career path for those investing their futures in this field.The previous speaker alluded to the importance of promoting careers.  We want people to take up jobs in our sector but we need to minimise the risk for them.  We do not want to go through an experience that we went through in 2000 where, as was claimed earlier, students were frightened off studying these subjects.  In fact, students were not frightened but their parents and career guidance teachers were.  They were influencing 15 year olds when they were choosing what to study in the leaving certificate.  Much of the time, those students look to their parents and teachers for that level of guidance.There is an old adage in our sector - I hope my colleague from Microsoft will excuse me for saying it - which is that no one ever got fired for buying IBM.  No parents ever got disowned by their children for recommending that they become an accountant, solicitor or engineer.  No career guidance teacher took that kind of risk either.  We want to eliminate or remove some of the risk in studying these subjects and taking up careers in this field.The proposed system would also promote assurances of standards for businesses investing in Ireland.  For example, if a multinational organisation was planning to establish a business in Ireland, we would be unique in recognising the developer community as a profession with recognised standards.  Following what the previous session discussed concerning continuing life-long learning, it would include an element of continuous professional development.  This would ensure that graduates in this subject matter would be compelled to comply with a number of continual professional development hours throughout the year.I have already mentioned the importance of career guidance for second and third level students.  Despite a movement in this year's CAO applications towards science and technology, we believe that there is still room for improved career guidance support for students from parents and teachers in raising awareness of how these subjects can not only lead to a secure, but also a fruitful career.  Many students are not aware of this.  Additionally, graduates of arts and business degrees do not fully explore the opportunities of postgraduate specialisms in these fields.  Teachers and parents are more likely to influence students towards traditional professions until we can eliminate some of the insecurity around what the future holds.We have just heard an extensive review of third level education.  As regards our sector at this time, at best, most third level syllabi are reflective of the previous 12 to 24-month historic needs of industry.  However, by the time students graduate from a technology course in this country, it is entirely possible that their studies are in fact three to four years out of date.Ballyfermot, which was alluded to earlier, has produced outstanding, world-class graduates who have gone on to perform internationally, as well as winning Oscar nominations for their animation work.  Animation currently employs 800 people in Ireland but it could easily employ double that figure.  I recently attended the launch of an animation business where three CEOs were arguing over who would be first to ring a person who was available in the market.  They were fighting over that one person.  I know of one animator who is seeking 25 new people but he cannot find them anywhere.  Ballyfermot used to deliver the graduates required by this sector but it is now slipping backwards.We propose more frequent and consistent industry consultation based on future thinking for syllabus development.  We need to ensure that all our graduates are equipped with the skills needed for a modern economy.  This includes technical and engineering, as well as business and arts programmes.  It is our experience that relatively recent graduates of marketing and business, for example, are undertaking further postgraduate studies.  The Irish Internet Association runs its own diploma in digital marketing.  It is alarming to see the number of newly graduated marketing students who are now undertaking diplomas in digital marketing.  This is because the digital element of their studies was, quite clearly, not reflected in the universities or colleges they had attended.Students in corporate finance and accounting need to reflect that business models have changed and are now based more on internationally-traded services and cloud businesses.  We also need to provide a stronger emphasis on entrepreneurship for technology students.  We need our best and brightest developers equipped with the requisite degree of commercial acumen to make the transition from being a "techie" to being a technological entrepreneur and business founder.Current secondary school computer rooms are equipped to teach students the European Computer Driving Licence or ECDL, but this module is almost 20 years old.  We are teaching 14 year olds how to use PowerPoint and Excel, which is the equivalent of teaching them how to use a mobile phone.  They have been doing it since they were six.  We need to teach them not how to use, but how to develop the applications because that is where the opportunities lie.Computer rooms should be language labs but as well as teaching French , German and Spanish in schools, we need to be teaching the international languages of Java, PHP and Ruby.  In that way, students would have international computer languages thus allowing them to compete for jobs internationally.  In addition, it would allow Ireland to compete for such jobs to be located here.  Once one has grasped a foreign language, it is relatively easy to learn others and this applies equally to programming and coding.  Currently, we do not have teachers who are qualified to teach computer studies, which is frustrating for teachers and students alike.  I was recently talking to a secondary school teacher qualified to teach mathematics and geography.  She was asked this year to go into the school to teach computers.  She said she knows how to use a computer but not how to teach computers.  We devalue the teaching profession by asking people to teach subjects they do not know how to teach.  We need to equip them to do this.  At present, that service is being provided by a 19-year-old boy from Cork.  I do not know if the members are aware of James Whelton; he won our "Best Rookie" award last Friday night.  James, at the age of 18, set up computer clubs for students between the ages of 12 and 18 to learn programming languages.  He is currently filling the gap that should be addressed by the education sector.  The IIA is wholly committed to recognising the needs of all of our members from global technology corporations, such as Microsoft, to individual developers, start-ups - this is why Mr. Iain Mac Donald of SkillPages is present - and SME consumers of technology.  We want to make sure that our industry, our shared economy, has the necessary human capital to ensure sustainable growth, and we believe that the skills shortage needs to be addressed immediately by a coalition of those associated with education, industry and good governance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	On behalf of my colleagues from the Interactive Games Association of Ireland, I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak today.  It certainly has been educational thus far.  We listened with great interest to what the education institutions had to say.  Since this is the first time my organisation has appeared before the committee, I will introduce the industry representatives.  I am accompanied by the chairman of the Interactive Games Association of Ireland, Mr. Barry O'Neill, and the senior director of Activision Blizzard, Mr. Barry Kehoe, who will help me in my responses.  The two complement each other quite well.  Mr. Barry O'Neill will speak about the experiences of small and medium-sized enterprises.  Mr. Barry Kehoe is the senior director of the biggest employer in the games industry in Ireland and the world, Activision Blizzard.  We have an harmonious message that the games industry does suffer from a skills shortage.  Like Ms Mulvihill, we have a shopping list that we would like to make known.The Interactive Games Association of Ireland represents companies involved in the creation, development, publishing and distribution of computer games on the island of Ireland.  We see ourselves as an advocacy group seeking to drive sustainable growth in the industry at a very crucial time for this country.  We want to create better awareness of the Irish industry as it stands and lobby for initiatives that could help the local industry grow, in addition to expanding the scale and scope of the international industry in Ireland.  Our members include international stakeholders such as Activision Blizzard, Big Fish Games, PopCap and local pioneers including Havok and Demoware.As members may know, the video games industry is the most dynamic player in today's entertainment industry.  Its global value is scheduled to grow to €80 billion by 2015, and its unique mixture of creativity, technology, interactivity and fun give it a head start on the competition.  Ireland is ideally placed because its rich reservoir of talent, technique and tenacity means it is placed perfectly to play a leading role in today's video games sector in Europe.  The industry has grown rapidly in the past 30 years from one involving early home and arcade consols, which members may remember, to today's ever-diversifying scene, which is increasingly online, mobile and social in terms of connections to very popular applications such as Facebook.  Games have been found to have clear educational, social and communicational benefits and are increasingly used as part of educational programmes in schools.  The Europe-wide Games in Schools programme, for example, is run by European Schoolnet.  It is run in co-operation with the industry and it successfully integrates digital games into school curricula.There is currently an excellent opportunity to expand the industry in Ireland.  The biggest companies representing the entire games value chain already have operations here.  Consol, online, social, mobile and middleware, a software that makes games work, are all in this country.  We have a dynamic, locally developed industry that has spawned world-class companies such as Havok and Jolt and a start-up scene with some very promising early-stage operations.  These companies run into the hundreds.We see our association's role as supporting these companies, providing a strong lobbying voice for the industry and working with the Government to introduce incentives that will increase development and the size of the industry, with a widening of the types of activities that are carried out in Ireland.  We point to examples such as Canada, where the size of the industry was quadrupled over a five-year period as a result of targeted Government support.My organisation is very grateful for the early recognition of the industry's key role in the coalition's programme for Government, and it is especially happy that senior Government figures will be addressing international industry events, to be held next week in Dublin, on the games industry.We have five pillars on which we build our agenda.  The first four are to ensure Government incentives fully cater for the industry; to encourage inward investment, new enterprise and entrepreneurs; to attract creative talent to foster local talent; and to market and develop education and skills.  We want to ensure the courses offered by third and second level institutions are clearly in line with and anticipate the needs of the industry.  We need to transform young people's passion to play video games into a desire to make them while equipping them with the right skills for the industry today.Our members often tell us that graduates from Irish third level institutions all fall short of the standards required for certain roles in our games industry.  Too few graduates are produced to meet industry needs.  My colleagues will speak about this.  As a result of the deficit, local companies are often forced to look outside the country to fill certain key positions, as Ms Mulvihill explained in her presentation.We will shortly set up working groups with educational institutions and State agencies to advance the following objectives.  We want to align educational institutional curricula with industry needs, to foster better awareness of the industry among career guidance teachers and lecturers, and to encourage industry and academia engagement and peerage, including through industry incentives and sponsorships.  We want educational institutions to consider the acquisition of curricula and resources from overseas universities and we want prioritisation, fast-track processing and the granting of visas for suitably skilled non-EEA citizens needed to fill the hundreds of job vacancies that exist in the Irish games sector.  We hope all the aforementioned issues will be addressed in the imminent Forfás study of the Irish games industry.My organisation is dedicated to putting the Irish industry at the forefront of the international games sector.  We want Ireland to be the best place in Europe to develop a games enterprise.  The Irish industry needs to position itself for further development within Ireland and abroad and move away from being a service-only industry to being an indigenous and robust high-growth one with consequent high-quality or "sticky" job creation.  This can  happen only if our educational institutions and games industry are aligned to foster the talent that this diverse, rapidly changing sector of our economy needs to continue to divide and prosper.
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I have a couple of questions, the first of which is directed at Ms Mulvihill.  I read the presentations before hearing them today.  My first question is on secondary schools.  I totally agree that we are teaching the equivalent of the alphabet in IT education in second level schools.  All the material has cobwebs on it at this stage.  We are really not meeting the demand, such as demand for education in Javascript, PHP, etc.  What needs to be done in order for this to change?  The process of introducing a new subject would take time.  Is Ms Mulvihill aware of whether the Department is open to this?  Has she had discussions with it?I will address my next question to Mr. David Sweeney.  Gaming has become a policy priority in Canada, as he mentioned, and in France.  The United Kingdom is also looking into it.  The countries have all used tax incentives to bolster growth in these industries.  Is Mr. Sweeney aware of any educational policy responses the countries have employed in addition to the tax incentives?We all know the value added is in software application development.  If I am correct, this is where the real money is.  Third level needs to change to meet the demands of being able to build on the software application level.  Will Ms Mulvihill elaborate on this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Deputy Lyons asked whether the education sector is aware.  It is unfortunate that the representatives who were present earlier have left.  We have not approached the education sector.  We understand that bringing in an extra course would be a challenge and would take time.  That is one of the reasons we put in the critical skills retention policy as an immediate short-term solution.  We will not change the entire system overnight.  Industry, as was highlighted earlier, cannot wait.The reform of the education at second and third level must be done but we need to do something immediately and that is where, to go on to the Deputy's next question, the tax incentive element comes in.  He asked whether this is being done elsewhere.  It is being done in Canada and Korea and Mr. Sweeney referenced the issue of visas for people to come and work here.  This is something we support but just because someone can work here, it does not mean he or she will choose to do so.  All Irish citizens can work here and they are choosing not to do so.  They are choosing to invest their careers, for their security and for their families, overseas.  We need to put in the visa policy in the short term but we need to couple that with a meaningful incentive to encourage people to come here and that is why we want it to be an employee-related tax credit system, which is not dissimilar in model and principle to the artists' tax exemption.  We must apply all the learning we got from the misuse of this exemption.We are not talking about a 100% exemption or a blanket application to everyone in the sector but about looking at the critical skills required in the list I provided in the briefing pack.  If an accreditation programme recognised where the digitally skilled were in place, one would know who to apply it to because it could be applied to a standard.  Everything we have presented is about having a cohesive strategy that addresses everything once a child is 12 years and enters the secondary education system to the end of his or her career in the pursuit of lifetime learning and having the mechanisms in place to incentivise them throughout that entire process whether it is through tax or the selection of the correct subjects.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I find myself echoing most of what Ms Mulvihill says because when she gave her presentation earlier, she covered many of the issues which equally apply to our industry.  The two big success stories internationally for the games industry are Korea and Canada in terms of the growth of the industry and employment.  In both territories, there was engagement between the companies and the education institutions.  We talked in our presentation about sponsorship and issues such as that whereby some of our member companies would consider engaging with third level institutions regarding course direction and sponsorship.With regard to the question of tax treatment and a favourable environment to attract key talent, we have made it clear in our discussions with Oireachtas Members that if we were to get favourable tax treatment for people coming in to work in the industry locally or from abroad, that would be tied to a situation where that key talent would be responsible for training five or six other people as part of their contract in order that ultimately those people would be able to rise to a similar level to the key talent?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Is Mr. Sweeney saying short-term contracts will be provided for people coming in to do training and they will be eventually be replaced?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	We referred to tapered relief, which would only be applicable if the employer took on five people and as part of the contract for the person availing of the tax benefit, the relief would taper over three years and he or she would have to train in those five people.  For every incentivised position filled, five new jobs would be created and, ultimately, those people brought to a higher skills level.  Most of the Irish companies in this sector say there is a huge amount to be said for internal training programmes and providing as much context to external skill or raw skills coming out of universities.  The context is important.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I would like to come back to the question of what we could do with the schools.  The proposed reforms of the junior cycle, which will be presented to the Minister shortly, offer us an opportunity to provide short courses, which could look at the issues of programming and languages.  They will not necessarily deal with the short-term issue but we need to consider the short, medium and long-term issue.  In the industry in which I am involved, we need a pipeline and it takes time.  The overarching issue is if one does not expose all children to the programming languages and the technologies when they are aged between 13 and 15, it will be too late by the time they get to university for them to have a deep understanding and to see what is the potential.  That is the opportunity we are missing.There is a lot of discussion about the skills gap in the ICT sector but for a more fruitful solution to that, we need to be clear what we are talking about.  There are three buckets for what is required in the area in which I am involved.  Software engineers have a skill set.  There is then business information systems encompassing applications, project management and programme management and then the emerging cloud skills that are required.  This is a follow on from the previous two, particularly in applications such as CRM.  The skills required there are the ability to sell and market underpinned by the technology.  A more fruitful debate with our friends in the third level sector should address how we tailor initiatives such as Springboard to meet the demands in the short and medium term.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	64	With regard to quantifying the problem relating to skills shortage, will Ms Mulvihill firm up the numbers?  Qualifications and accreditation are important for the industry but she stated the rookie of the year is doing great work.  Would the need for qualifications cut off an avenue for someone like that?  With regard to accreditation and how it would work, she referred to the need to teach students how to develop the application rather than teaching the application at secondary and primary level but given the lack of skills in the teaching profession to even teach the basics, how can that gap be filled through in-service training and so on?  She referred to Irish people choosing to invest their career elsewhere.  Do they have the skills required?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Yes.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Why are they choosing to do that?  Is the package the industry offering not good enough to attract them?  Is that part of the problem?If international companies decide to locate there, it is counterintuitive that they would do so if there is a skills shortage.  Many issues have been raised and I am sure the Forfás study will address some of them.  Are both groups happy to wait for the study or do they need to us accelerate something ahead of it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	There are 2,500 jobs documented as being vacant.  That is not an absolute number and I suspect another 1,000 in addition to them are not currently advertised.Our rookie of the year is aged 19.  I do not suggest that 19 year olds are fine on their own.  He is building a computer club for 12 to 18 year olds and teaching them how to write code in an accredited format.  If a 14 year old writes a great line of code, he starts off with a brown belt and he works his way up to a black belt, depending on how often the line of code is reused.  That would be similar.To answer the third question on how we would apply an accreditation programme for this industry overall, I do not want to bring anything overly bureaucratic or burdensome into the debate.The fourth question asked why are people are choosing to leave.  It is because we are not offering them enough money.  A study done recently by Prosperity Recruitment stated that gross salaries in Ireland for the sector were on a par to what they were in other countries.  People were choosing to emigrate because they felt that their quality of life in terms of net income would be better elsewhere.  Therefore, even though they were paying more direct tax in the United Kingdom system they would be better off in terms of their net income because of the basket of goods that income could buy them.  They were electing to work there not because there was any significant difference but that they were better off in terms of their net income working somewhere else.This is an issue we must face in the sector because many of the employees they were talking about with those skills are young and mobile.  This is not like other sectors.  We are talking about a very young, unique, dynamic group of people who are being sought after proactively by other countries and we need to give them an incentive to stay here or relocate here.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	On a point of clarity, is that a recent trend or has it been a problem for a number of years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	One would suspect-----
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I will not suspect.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Sorry.  The emigration position is something that has occurred more in the past two years.  It is an emerging trend.  For example, one of our members, a digital agency, currently has six vacancies.  Three people who were working for a global brand here walked into the office one day and said, "Hi, we are off.  We are going to New Zealand to set up our lives there."  That was prior to the Rugby World Cup and therefore it has nothing to do with the match.  That was at least 12 months ago.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I echo what Ms Mulvihill stated.  Ms Mulvihill has a much bigger constituency than the one we represent.  We were solely in the game industry whereas Ms Mulvihill represents a plethora of different industries aligned around the Internet.  We have figures running into the hundreds in respect of jobs that are not filled.There are two sides to the issue as far as we are concerned.  We want to develop the industry here in such a way that the jobs on offer are the type of jobs that are attractive and encourage our talented youth to remain here, as well as attracting people in to mentor those who are here.  We are looking at it from both sides of the coin.  We have similar issues to those outlined by Ms Mulvihill.  Does Mr. Kehoe wish to add anything on the vacancies?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I can give a specific statistic from this year.  One of the groups, Activision, has a large footprint in employment.  One of the groups is a research and development middleware company.  Part of its group is based in Vancouver and it had a certain amount of open internships for this year.  It planned to put most of them into Dublin and a few in Canada and so far this year it has recruited 11 successfully in Vancouver and one in Ireland, which was specifically put down to the quality of the applicants as opposed to any other reason.  The preference for the most part was for them to be in Ireland.  In the areas that require high level mathematics, advanced physics and so on, which are integral to certain aspects of making games, it is finding that many of the graduates cannot compete with people leaving colleges in other parts of the world, and that is where the jobs are going.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	If I can respond to Deputy Ryan's statements and questions, I run an Irish entrepreneurial company.  There is much talk about foreign direct investment and the importance of satisfying the needs of foreign direct investment into the country, particularly in the area of ICT, but I come from the perspective of supporting indigenous companies involved in ICT.  We are business which employs 28 people, mostly with a mathematics or computer science postgraduate qualification.  We run a skills based social network and our raison d’etre is to connect people with skills to people who need them on a global basis.  We launched the platform in January of this year and nearly 2 million people from 160 countries around the world, but predominantly from the United Kingdom and the United States, have joined us.  In terms of growth, that would put us on a par with the likes of the early days of LinkedIn or Facebook, which would be our international peers who have been very successful in growing significant Irish businesses.I will give some real life examples of the way the issues referred to here by my peers in the industry affect a company like ours.  In terms of the access to talent, we find it extremely difficult to acquire the talent necessary for us to succeed.  That is because we are not competing against other Irish companies.  Our competition is in Silicon Valley, Singapore and other countries.  Competition in terms of us succeeding is directly relevant to the calibre of our staff.  There is no disambiguation between those two factors.  For us to recruit we have attempted to recruit heavily in Ireland.  Less than 50% of our workforce is Irish.  We have had to recruit from Romania, Poland, Italy, Spain and more recently from India.In terms of the requirement for skills, in our Irish workforce we find the quality at the upper level of computer science, which is our main area, to be excellent but there is not enough of them.  It is not a problem that can be solved overnight but that is our issue.  I will leave it to my colleagues to describe how that can be addressed on a long-term basis.With the majority of our users located in the US and the UK we are increasingly asked the reason we continue to locate in Ireland.  We do that because we believe there are advantages to locating in Ireland.  The tax regime is attractive.  There are significant advantages from a research and development tax credit perspective, which are essential to us staying here.  If they were not available I could not justify it, neither could my board.The reality is that increasingly as we scale our employee numbers must grow.  Our expectation is to grow towards 70, 80 or 90 employees by the end of next year but my No. 1 concern as regards our ability to continue to succeed against our international competitors is the access to talent.  I cannot overstate the importance of that.In terms of providing a demonstrable and immediate solution, which is required, what Ms Mulvihill referred to in terms of the wage gap is our biggest issue by far.  We can pay somebody €100,000 to come and work for us in Ireland but it is not attractive to move from Poland, Romania or Italy to do that because the cost of living here and our tax burden on the employee is so high.  It is simply not possible for us to compete, even if we can attract people here.To encourage them to come we offer them opportunity which does not relate to pay.  That is the role or the experience they are being given in a fast growth consumer Internet business but there are only so many people who will agree to do that and as the company gets bigger, that attraction decreases because they are not involved in such an early stage and taking a job with us would be the same as taking a job with our competitor in a foreign country, and it will not be possible to do that.  That will require us to seriously consider the future of our head count drive and its location in terms of whether it will be in Ireland or elsewhere.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	It is interesting that this discussion follows the previous discussion.  The previous witnesses spoke about flexibility, a responsive curriculum and so on but unfortunately the reality in that regard is quite different.I was surprised to hear about the 2,500 vacant jobs.  I did not realise it was at that scale.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses expand on the visa problem in terms of people coming here but I am more interested in the tax credit system.  The witnesses might expand on that or if they have a paper on it they might forward it to political parties in the House.  It would be difficult to sell, however, because people would say if we can give these credits to people coming here why can they not get them.  I accept it is primarily to grow the industry.  The same argument could be made regarding the artists' subvention, bringing in film crews and so on.  It makes sense in that regard.Approximately 70 graduates leave Ireland every week.  Part of the difficulty is that unless we can offer them something that will keep them here, such as a programme or whatever, they will move to New Zealand, Australia or elsewhere.  The difficulty is that the system is slow to respond to that.Ms Mulvihill mentioned the lack of response to the needs of industry.  There are links between the universities and ITs with industry but there are no links with schools.  In my local authority area, the Connect project ties in with the local authority but we do not see companies taking part, even though we all accept that 13 and 14 year olds are like sponges and would benefit from these connections.How are the new sciences, like web design, graded and how does the system respond to that challenge?  We have all heard of people who have claimed to be one thing but are not exactly all they say.  How do other jurisdictions manage this?  If it is done properly somewhere else, we could jump on the back of it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I included the document on tax policy in the briefing pack which we presented earlier this year.  We had a couple of meetings with the Department to explore how it would be practically implemented.  On the tax incentivisation programme directly relating to an individual, we absolutely appreciate it is a challenge to even countenance the idea of a tax break for any individual group but we are very practical on how we want to apply that.  It is not a blanket tax credit for anyone working in the sector, it is directly linked to the skills required at present and then it would be reviewed annually.  The measure of the tax credit might be as little as the difference between what someone was taking home and the quality of their life in 2008 compared to now.  We would be bridging the gap between where we were after everything starting to go wrong.  We are interested in pursuing that and this is the opportunity to bridge the gap immediately.  We understand that involves longer-term reform of education.How do other countries grade this?  We would defer to the expertise of the education sector on how to grade it but it is taught in other countries.  We could go to a high school in the United States and learn to programme from an early age.  That is not possible in Ireland.  We are not proposing something that would be totally unique.  The professionalisation of the sector in a postgraduate sense, however, would be unique to us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Any tax incentive would be carefully structured.  There are precedents in other European countries for this in the past ten to 15 years.  We have a carefully refined proposal that takes account of the current market conditions and the economy; we know it is sensitive at this juncture.We want to get into talks with both second and third level institutions.  A certain flexibility was shown today in the contributions by the educational institutions and we would like to see more of that.  We hope to drive a working group to bring the needs of industry closer to the forefront of what is being considered.  There is a gap at the moment and there are areas like computer science where needs are being met but we hear again and again that maths and science are very weak.  Those are subjects that people get to grips with at second level and that are important for future participants in the industry.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Our membership base is so broad that half of our members would be technology consumers, where they see Internet capability as being fundamental to the growth of their business; they are more on the sales and marketing side.  While there are a number of multinationals based in Ireland because of research and development tax credits and incentivisation programmes in that space, they are also here because we have a long and strong tradition in sales and marketing.  Where we are failing to educate our marketing graduates and our business students is in the use of digital marketing technologies for the growth of those businesses.  We know for certain that there are more vacancies for SEO experts and pay-per-click experts than we have people to fill them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Deputy Crowe asked about visas and it is a difficult situation.  There are companies in the games industry here who have found that candidates that have been issued with documentation to attend Ireland for job interviews are being turned away at the airport for some obscure reasons.  We have seen situations whereby visa applicants have been denied visas for programming jobs because a company made people redundant on the commercial side in the previous six months.  There is also an overly bureaucratic appeals process that can last up to four months, during which time any reasonable candidate will find a job elsewhere.  The example I cited of someone being turned away finished with that person going to the USA and securing a visa for an engineering role in that country.  It is strange to find it is harder to get a work permit to work in Ireland than in the USA.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	They are currently lobbying in Silicon Valley for a special visa programme for start-ups.  That is what we are competing against.  We will have a situation where US companies founded by Irish people based in Silicon Valley will want to locate in Ireland in ten years time and if we had had the good sense to incentivise them to stay here in the first place, that would be working in reverse.  I do not even want to countenance that possibility when we have the opportunity to keep them here and incentivise them to work here.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The system allows it but it moves so slowly that it is difficult to fulfil it.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I have one question for Mr. Sweeney, who referred to the need for educational institutions and the games industry to be aligned to foster the talent that is so scarce.  How are the discussions with individual colleges going?  Are particular colleges being targeted?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	It is interesting that we have just started the process in the past few months and the first institutions that came to talk to us were commercial colleges, the privately run third level institutions in Dublin, that were very open to working with us.  We understand that bigger institutions move more slowly but we hope, with the co-operation of the Civil Service and Government agencies, to work with some of the institutions here today in the short to medium term and we hope this issue will be dealt with in the Forfás report when it is published on Monday.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	We appreciate the delegation coming today.  Some of us attended the presentation by Deputy Donohoe on the industry's behalf and it was very informative.  Most of us realise there is a gap and that we must address it.  Anything we can do to help, we will do.  Clearly we want to tackle this.I am surprised there has not been contact with the colleges before now.  In recent months this has become a very important issue but was it ignored before then?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Frankly, we were not organised.  There are trade bodies that represent the gaming industry in many different countries around the world.  Ireland was not one of them but that has changed.  Since we got organised last year we have had immense traction with Government, State agencies and the industry itself.  We are starting our discussions with people who want to move things along quickly.  Those people at the moment are to be found in the private colleges.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The breadth of our membership is so extensive that we are talking about every syllabus in every college.  This is our first foray into this question.  Ballyfermot has an excellent track record.  We can do it.  We simply need to identify and organise what needs to be done.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	If the right decisions are made this year how long would it take to tackle this problem and solve it?  Is time on our side?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Some of the proposals related to the convergence courses for unemployed architects and civil engineers who have proven their ability at mathematics in their primary qualifications and are currently redundant.  There is a misconception that they will miraculously appear out of a university in 12 months time and jump straight into a job writing code.  That is not going to happen for at least another 24 months. We need to be realistic about how we address the problem immediately.Funding has gone to courses which, ostensibly, provide training to make people into developers, but do not do so.  People are coming out of ten week courses, having spent an hour doing this and an hour doing that.  They have had something like the generic first year which the university representatives spoke about earlier but they cannot function realistically in this sector.  They are still far behind the grade.  We seem to think that patching will address the issue.  We are talking about highly-skilled experienced people whom we need immediately.An immediate solution would be to take the tax incentivisation proposal, put it in the budget as quickly as possible and give people a reason to stay who will otherwise hop on an aeroplane in January.  Once they see what we all know is coming down the track in December they will go.  Any chance of recruiting anyone else to come here will also be gone.  The Oireachtas must do that immediately to stem the flow of emigration and attract others to come here and, in parallel, work on the visa side of things.  We will address longer-term educational challenges relating to convergence courses.  We could then buy ourselves 24 months.My greatest concern is that the next Twitter will announce it is going to set up here and I will be paralysed with fear that they will realise we do not have the people they need.  That will be a real problem.  We want them to come and stay and be happy with their experience so that we can have long-standing relationships with these organisations, as we do with Microsoft, which has a strong investment in the ecosystem through its BizSpark programme, and with all the other companies it supports and invests in in Ireland.  We need to have that kind of sustained growth from those businesses here.  That will only happen if we give them an assurance of supply of highly skilled individuals.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I endorse all of that.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I would not recommend disagreeing with Ms Mulvihill.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The big names in the game industry are all in Ireland now.  We spoke about encouraging the creation of medium to high-level jobs which would attract the right type of graduate here and bring in the right type of skills.  That is where we see things as being very important in the next few years.As Ms Mulvihill has said, changing the curriculum will take more time and will not be an immediate solution.  We must have other solutions in the short term.  They are aligned to a tax incentive to get the right people in, train them in-house and make sure the level of expertise grows.  In the game industry that would ensure that games are increasingly produced and developed in Ireland, as opposed to being produced and developed outside of Ireland with various service aspects being catered for here.  We want these high quality jobs in Ireland and the industry to grow, based around the nucleus that is there now.  Every day we hear of more opportunities.  An additional 200 jobs were announced last week at BioWare in Galway and a couple more job announcements are on the way.The companies are here.  The two biggest publishers Activation and Electronic Arts are both present in the Irish market.  If the climate is right and the talent is there, those jobs will be created and those companies will grow.  Ireland will then have a headstart in the game industry, as it should have.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Ms Mulvihill made a wonderful pitch for a tax incentive to attract people.  Has she made a submission to the Department of Finance on this proposal?  She will appreciate how difficult this issue is now and what the reaction would be to singling out one sector for special treatment under the taxation code.  That is not going to an easy one.  On the other hand, I can see the need to do something.  The Department of Finance would have strong views on this issue.  It is important that a submission be made to the Department highlighting the difficulty of retaining and recruiting people and the short-term difficulty for the next 24 months.  If that case were made something could be done on a short-term basis so that we can hold onto the companies we have and attract badly needed people from overseas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	94	As the Chairman has said, I do not like it when people disagree with me.  I have not gone to the Department of Finance yet.  We started with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation because this is not about profit.  It is, genuinely, about the people in the jobs and having the talent we require.  This is a jobs question and we need to invest in it.  We started with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Is Ms Mulvihill sending a copy of the proposal to the Department of Finance also?  That Department calls the shots.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I thought they could shoot the messenger rather than me.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The committee will send a submission to the Department of Finance.  The Minister for Finance has specifically requested proposals for job creation.  It would help to send a written submission to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  This committee will also follow it through.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Chairman, you mentioned the possibility of a short-term solution.  That is all we ever wanted to suggest.  I am a taxpayer too.  I would be humiliated, embarrassed and would not be able to live with myself if, in 20 years time, I realised I had been responsible for an idea that involved sectioning a certain group of society for special treatment in the payment of tax.  This is a short-term solution for a very urgent challenge.We had an initial meeting with the Department and will have a further meeting on Thursday next to examine the practical mechanics of making this work.  We are not proposing anything we have not calculated to be cost neutral, at the very least.There are 75,000 people employed in the tech sector in Ireland and a further 200,000 employed in ancillary jobs supporting those.  In filling the 2,500 job vacancies other jobs will be created.  In addition, someone who has emigrated is not paying any tax.  No tax is being paid on the 2,500 jobs that are currently vacant.  The scale of the tax credit is not significant.  It would be cost neutral.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	99	In the games industry, we looked at proposals for creating new jobs.  We were looking at proposals that would be 100% accretive to the Exchequer.  These incentives would not mean a loss to the Exchequer.  The training incentive would create five new taxpayers.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	We can consider that proposal in detail.  What level would those five people need to be at in order to benefit from the training?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	101	We have a very good games industry but we are less strong in Ireland in the creation of games, which requires a different skills base.  We do not have game producers, game project managers or art directors.  The training would take people who might have studied the humanities or arts or even computer science and who might have a knowledge of the games industry and its processes.  We would line those positions up and bring in a superstar type position from overseas to impart those specific skills over a period of time, when the tax relief would taper.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I have a final question on that subject. If Mr. O'Neill does not have an answer to it now he can forward his response to the committee clerk .  What number of trainee positions would Games Ireland be willing to create?.  In making a case on its behalf, we would need to be able to say whether 100 or 200 places will be created.  Even 50 would be great but we need a rough estimate of the number of positions likely to be created if we are to back it up.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Figures on what Forás believes the industry can grow to will be available next week.  I do not wish to pre-empt that.  There is scope in terms of the way that the Canadian industry increased its industry size five-fold to more than 8,000 people over a period of five years.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It increased from 5,000 to 14,000.  The figure now stands at 15,000.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Mr. Kehoe may be able to say more about Activision Blizzard in that regard as, in terms of levels of employment, it has worldwide involvement in studio positions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Activision Blizzard in Ireland currently employs 40 people in high end research and development type roles and approximately 1,100 people supporting the development of video games, be it in localisation, which I run on behalf of the company, or in supporting World of Warcraft, which is the biggest MMO game.  A core couple of thousand people are supporting that.We are currently losing high end roles to Canada because we cannot attract the people or work through the graduates here to fill the roles we require.  In the online space, we are gathering data on, for instance, what players do, namely, shooting someone in the head or leg and so on.  There are many jobs in the area of mining that data, figuring it out, twisting it and turning it around to give us information to help make better games or provide better feedback information to consumers.  These are highly based on mathematics, calculus and mathematical modelling and so on.Teamware worldwide has doubled in the past year from 20 to 40 people and is expected to grow to approximately 120 people in the next 12 to 18 months.  All those jobs could be located here but will not be because we cannot get the right people.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	107	We proposed an accreditation scheme.  The challenge for quantification of all of this training and on-the-job training is that we do not have any accreditation.  We do not have any professionalism of the sector.  If we are to invest in the appropriate education measures for addressing this skills shortage we need to have a proper accreditation system for continuous professional development so that people can invest in a career and not just a job.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	108	We can look into that and perhaps make a recommendation in that regard.  We have had a useful discussion today.  Following our earlier discussions it is easy to identify the gaps, which we will work to close.  The groups may feel free to feed into the committee on an ongoing basis in terms of our addressing this challenging issue.  The delegations appear happy that the Forás report will reflect their views on this issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	109	We were given an unofficial preview of the report about two weeks.  What we heard was positive.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	110	It was positive.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Yes.  We have been involved.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	112	That is key in all of this.  We have come across many groups that are not permitted to get involved in certain reports.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	113	We have not been consulted at all.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Perhaps when she receives it Ms Mulvihill will forward us her views on it.  We will then have them reviewed.I thank everyone for attending this afternoon and for their submissions, which will be beneficial.
