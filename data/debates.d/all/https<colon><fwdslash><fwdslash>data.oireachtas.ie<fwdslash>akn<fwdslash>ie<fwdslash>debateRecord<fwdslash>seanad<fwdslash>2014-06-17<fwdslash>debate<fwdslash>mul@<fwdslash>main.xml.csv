#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	0	I have received notice from Senator Colm Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health to have Fampyra, a medication used by multiple sclerosis patients, covered under the GMS long-term illness drug payment scheme. I have also received notice from Senator John Crown of the following matter:Recognising both the personal, social and economic impact of stroke and the cost of stroke to the State, the urgent need for the Minister for Health to prioritise the development of community rehabilitation services, for example, the early supported discharge programme currently running from the Mater Hospital, and to publish an implementation plan in respect of the National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2001-2015. I have also received notice from Senator Mary Ann O’Brien of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to consider joining Ireland to New York Academy of Sciences global network. I have also received notice from Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to outline the plans for developing the N59 between Oughterard and Clifden in Galway, the present position in relation to the development and the timeline for completion. I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

We felt the banking inquiry issue had been put to bed last week but, as a result of statements made yesterday by the Minister for Finance and earlier by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the escapade regarding what happened at the meeting of the Committee of Selection and in this House seems to have grown legs. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade accused us of pulling a stroke last week and, thankfully, the Leader clarified the position on the record of the House, which I appreciate. Yesterday, I was amazed when listening to the news to hear the Minister for Finance repeating the word "stroke". Today, it had developed into a coup, according to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Each one of the politburo within the Government-----

It has scored a spectacular own goal, which no own goal in the World Cup will rival. In scoring this own goal, they have tried to attack individuals in this House. There was an attempt to assassinate the character of one of the nominees, Senator MacSharry. There were also attempts to damage the workings of the Committee of Selection and to say the House did not know what it was doing. Has the Leader a line of communication open to the politburo in the Lower House? I am sure the Taoiseach was involved in this appointment. The Tánaiste, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach are smarting and hurting because of the own goal that was scored. The committee system was set up more than 20 years ago and it is unprecedented to enlarge the membership of a committee to ensure the politburo gets it way, has a majority and can dictate the terms of reference of the inquiry. They will try to project and gauge the outcome of the inquiry and set it out in such a way that it will be politically damaging to Fianna Fáil more so than others. There was a suggestion that the membership of the inquiry committee would reflect the numbers in both Houses. If that was the case, why were the 14-member Fianna Fáil group, Sinn Féin, the Independents and others not consulted about who should be the Opposition spokesperson? While I do not want to go down that road, it is imperative that we get to this because the banking inquiry has been damaged in the eyes of the public. The continuing remarks, which are offensive to me and many other Senators, by the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, who are all within the politburo of the Government, are trying to do down what happened at the Committee of Selection and this is only adding to the fact that they were caught out trying to engineer the inquiry. They have spectacularly failed and the public will state that to them. I would like to put on record my admiration for Deputy Donnelly for having the wisdom, good faith and trust to stand down from the committee, which has a particular agenda and motive.

I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who yesterday made a vicious attack on this House and the Committee of Selection, come and explain to the House where he got this notion of a stroke. This would not have happened if there had been proper communication between the Fine Gael and Labour Party groupings and the Leader, for whom I have great respect and whose integrity is certain. I want the Minister to come and explain what is going on and clarify his remarks in order that this House will no longer be dragged into this mire that the Government has created. That is the least that could be done. The Minister should come before the House today as a matter of urgency to clarify his remarks and stop codding the people and trying to throw the blame for something it created. The Government should wake up and state: "We tried to engineer this banking inquiry. We will dictate the results."

I thank my Trinity College Dublin colleague, Mr. Paul Horan, for bringing this to my attention. I mentioned at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that 18 June marked the 750th anniversary of the earliest known Irish Parliament for which there is a definitive record. It met on 18 June 1264 at Castledermot, County Kildare. There is an article by Mr. Horan in this month's edition of History Ireland. While we will talk more about the issue tomorrow, I thank the Leader because it is nice that we are able to mark this anniversary. As I am sure others will, I record my condemnation of the shooting of a six year old boy in Dublin on Friday evening. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, also issued a statement condemning the shooting. It was particularly heinous and appalling to see a young boy literally caught in crossfire. I know that everyone will wish to share in that condemnation. I commend the former President, Mrs. McAleese, for her comment that it would be "completely bonkers" to ask 150 male celibates to review Church teaching on family life and the Catholic Church. Former President McAleese was pulling no punches with her words which certainly have resonance for many of us here.

I second Senator Denis O'Donovan's proposal that the Minister be invited to address the House to clarify the matter. He must know. I issued two statements on it last week and Senator Denis O'Donovan has clarified it. I pay a particular tribute to the Leader of the House who made it absolutely clear what the situation was. Nobody can criticise him. He laid his reputation on the line. I am demanding that they stop lying. It was my vote. Fianna Fáil Members were quiescent. They sat there and it obvious that it was a fix-up. We had this ludicrous voting where, instead of voting in one election for two out of three candidates, we voted for all three. What utter nonsense. When we did this, we put in first Senator Sean D. Barrett who was the person my group and I wished to see there because he was an international expert and respected by the Government. When we went to vote again, I naturally voted for Senator Marc MacSharry because I wanted to see a fully independent Oireachtas inquiry, not a Government inquiry. The Taoiseach had already muddied the waters months ago by prejudging the outcome of the whole matter; therefore, his hands are already sullied.It was most definitely not a Fianna Fáil stroke. I welcome the fact that Deputy Joe Higgins has been recommended because I believe somebody from the hard left is required to ask the difficult questions. The Irish people did not frolic en masse and engage in gambling and misbehaviour. This is happening now in order to pay the gambling debts of German banks to the tune of some €47.5 billion. In the same vein, the debts of French and British banks are €27.5 billion and €12.5 billion, respectively. We are stuck with the bill for this even though we did not run it up. I want to know how and why this happened. I reiterate that I did not realise the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was in on the act in this squalid way. However, on three occasions I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, say on RTE radio news that this was a Fianna Fáil stroke. It was nothing of the kind and I demand that he retract this and reflect on the truth of what happened.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	15	It is worth noting that it is a beautiful day and many Irish citizens are in good humour because of the fine weather. With this in mind I request a debate on an industry that is doing very well and that the Government has got right. I speak of the tourism industry. We have seen numerous initiatives in the area, including the retention of the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector. This rate was initiated and retained by the current Government, which is significant. The travel tax has been abolished and this has resulted in hundreds of thousands more passengers entering the country through Shannon Airport alone, not to mention Dublin Airport, Cork Airport and Knock Airport, all of which have benefited greatly. There has been a significant increase in the number of tourists coming to Ireland and spending money here, so I would like a debate on the future of the tourism industry. The past three years have seen remarkable year-on-year growth in the sector and I believe this is only the beginning and that tourism will ultimately transform the economy. Ireland is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and it is even more beautiful when the sun shines. We must seek to increase investment in tourism and create further initiatives in the tourism sector. It may not be popular to mention, but I suggest bringing back tax incentives as they will encourage small towns to develop tourism initiatives. Such incentives would be wise and would bring great benefit. I ask the Leader to organise a debate on tourism with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.

I welcome Senator Norris back to the House and wish him a very speedy recovery. The timing of his return to the Committee of Selection was impeccable and I commend him on this. He has spoken the truth about that meeting and has set the record straight. The Government has made a serious effort to use public relations to downgrade that meeting and Senator Norris has explained the situation very well. We in this House should be proud that David Norris is a Senator. He is a national treasure. I request that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, appeal to the kidnappers of the three teenagers taken near Ramallah in Palestine.I was in that city - it was a city under siege - with the late Deputy Tony Gregory, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, now Tánaiste, former Deputy John Gormley, Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh and Deputy John Paul Phelan. It is certainly a tinderbox in relation to what will happen in the Middle East. One young man, Ahmed Sabarin, has already been shot by the Israelis; he is one of the first to be shot in that regard. It is certainly an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. I ask the Tánaiste to appeal to whoever is responsible, whether it be Hamas or some other element in Palestine, not to incite the wrath of the Israeli army at this particularly sensitive time. The Tánaiste would have influence in that regard. He was there with me as a guest of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and we met all of its leaders at the time. He is in a strong position to appeal to those responsible for the kidnapping of the three teenagers to restore them to their families without further delay.
#AideenHayden	unknown-#AideenHayden-party	unknown-#AideenHayden-dob	unknown-#AideenHayden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	19	There are some 150 families in the Dublin region living in hotels because they are homeless, at a substantial cost to the State and with significant distress caused to them. I want to bring the attention of the House to a new initiative launched today as part of a campaign to prevent families from becoming homeless in the Dublin region. It is a collaboration between the housing charity, Threshold, with which I am involved, and the four Dublin local authorities. As part of this service, Threshold will operate a freephone helpline for families who are worried about losing their rented homes. It will work with these families and the local authorities to make sure as a matter of priority that they do not become homeless. One of the interesting things about the scheme is that an agreement has been reached with the Department of Social Protection to increase the amount of rent supplement that such families will receive where it is not possible to keep them in their rented homes because of increases in rents. It is a most welcome initiative which will prevent a number of families in the Dublin region from becoming homeless.  This is the tip of the iceberg. I am conscious about the fact that, while the initiative relates to Dublin families, there are many single people in the Dublin region who are at risk of homelessness. Threshold is a national service and we know that many families outside the Dublin region are also experiencing this problem. As a matter of urgency, similar services need to be rolled out across the country. I suppose one could say this is like putting a finger in the dyke. We need to look at issues such as rents going up at a dramatic rate, by 20%, 40% and 50% in some cases. There has been a lot of debate in the media about rent controls. I ask the Leader for a similar debate in this House. We should also look at the supply of housing, particularly for low-income families because there is no doubt that housing for such families is a major issue, particularly in urban Ireland.

One does not want to draw any imputation from that incident, but it brings up the wider issue of the safety of children in residential neighbourhoods. I briefly met the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, in whose constituency the dreadful event happened. He believes we need to look at planning law, but, even on existing residential roads, could we not have traffic calming measures and impose restrictions on vehicles in order that children are able to play on those streets? In extending sympathy to Jake Brennan's mother, father, brother and sister, perhaps the House might like to address how we can make residential roads safer for such six year old children. I note Senator Ivana Bacik's concern about another six year old. The House owes a duty to young citizens.I am concerned that the vital post of Secretary General at the Department of Finance is to be filled without open competition. According to The Irish Times: "This reflects concern within the Government that a newcomer would not have enough time to learn the brief while preparations intensify over the summer for the October budget."

Has this deficit been rectified and is it a good idea that we do not have open competition for this vital post? Perhaps we could have a debate in the House with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and discover whether there has been a policy change. He seemed to favour more outside representation for the top level appointments committee, TLAC.

My colleague, Senator Conway, mentioned the tourism industry, and this will have a major impact on it. Lissadell used to attract approximately 40,000 visitors when it was going well. Unfortunately, the case was before the courts and the house closed for approximately five years. The Taoiseach will reopen it on Friday, which is very good. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, will come to the Seán MacDiarmada Summer School on Friday evening and this will have a major impact on tourism in the west and north west as we approach 2016. Hopefully, it will bring large numbers of people into the area, and the two events combined will be very positive.  I welcome the announcement this morning that those who lost their medical cards will have them returned.

I support Senator Hayden's call for a debate on housing. Many of the Senator's points indicate an abject failure by her Government colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to resolve these issues after three years in government.  I concur with Senator Comiskey in welcoming the Government's announcement today that it will review the medical card issue and restore the cards. It has been a long time coming. I spent most of yesterday afternoon with a family whose card expired in February and who have spent the last few months living from hand to mouth trying to cover medical bills. One of their children has a very serious health issue and they were in a very distressed state. Today's announcement should not be seen as putting the issue to bed. The Minister has not addressed the issue the Ombudsman brought to light when the review was announced, that the medical card reports done initially in each of the local areas are missing. The Minister should explain how it happened that when the medical card system was centralised, the files were not centralised. We need to find out where the files are.  I would also like the Leader to try to clarify the status of the HSE report on the procurement of maternity services in the West-North West Hospitals Group and whether a copy can be made available. The Minister should come here and explain his actions around the report. Can we have the Minister here to discuss these issues? When the Minister for Children replied to me about a €10,000 cut to therapeutic language services in Ballinasloe, he said these cutbacks must be made, yet we are not tackling the disgraceful top-ups being made to people in the HSE. The Minister needs to come here and explain why essential services for children such as therapeutic language services in Ballinasloe, are being cut back although the money involved is relatively small and we can still pay top-ups to senior executives in the HSE. It is a disgraceful situation.

We all have many stories like Senator Ó Clochartaigh's of families and people in dire need with serious medical conditions who unfortunately had their medical cards withdrawn. I welcome the move to reinstate them.  I spent the weekend at the Special Olympics Ireland Games in Limerick in the company of some of the most amazing and dedicated people I have ever met, ranging from the parents to the volunteers to the Special Olympics staff, the local and national community and, most importantly, the athletes who took part. I witnessed friendship, sportsmanship, compassion, competitiveness and hard work that cannot be captured or replicated anywhere else. It was a truly unique event. I was very impressed with the number of volunteers at the event over the weekend. Up to 3,000 volunteers from all professions and walks of life gave of their time. The athletes were provided with a free eye examination and health check. All the health care professionals provided an excellent free and voluntary service to the athletes and their families, which I know was very much appreciated by all those present. I would also like to commend the Army whose personnel volunteered and collected and transported the athletes' luggage to the train station. All of this was a pure reflection of the goodness and generosity of the people - people who were doing things that nobody even knew about - in this country. I commend the Special Olympics staff and volunteers on the excellent organisation of the national games. The work they do is second to none and it is appreciated by all 1,500 athletes and the others who were present. On a related matter-----

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	30	I ask the Leader to consider conveying to the Government the two great lessons of digging. The first is that when one is in a political hole the best thing to do is to stop digging. Unfortunately, we saw the debacle last week initiated by the Taoiseach but carried on by his Minister for Finance, by the Tánaiste, and now by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The public have seen through this. While spin may have got the Government through its first few years in office, it is obvious now that the public have seen through it and it has worn thin. Unless it cops on to that, the Government is on a very short leash indeed. I suggest that the second lesson is the one raised by Senator Hayden. We have seen a complete lack of a housing policy from this Government, which is now in its fourth year in office. The number of homeless people has grown significantly. The number of people on waiting lists in every council area has increased enormously and very worryingly. There is no coherent policy to tackle these issues. We have a situation now in which people in the public service are advising those who are young that they should not aspire to owning their own homes. In very difficult times back in the 1930s, more difficult than today, we had a good policy under a Fianna Fáil-led Government. Much of the local authority housing stock was constructed throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when there was real economic hardship. Many of the people who occupied those houses could never have aspired to owning their own homes in those days but subsequently, through tenant purchase schemes, they were able to achieve that. Many of them moved on to take up other schemes and moved into private housing. We need to get back and start digging foundations for new houses. It is not only the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who should take the blame. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is extremely culpable in this regard. He was the one who cut public capital expenditure as a softer option instead of dealing with the overspend in current expenditure.That has led to a situation where in the past few years when we could have invested in the construction of a housing programme which would have provided jobs for those who needed them in the industry at the time, we would now be dealing with what has become a crisis. I join with Senator Hayden in calling for an urgent debate in this regard.

This has lost the entire confidence of the country. I was shocked by what the Minister for Finance, a man for whom I have huge respect, said yesterday. He said that it was normal practice for a Government to add extra members. It is not normal practice that a democratic outcome to a vote would be ignored.

Some weeks ago, I was critical of the fact that people with lifelong medical conditions, acute illnesses and disabilities had had their discretionary medical cards withdrawn. I welcome the fact that approximately 15,000 people will benefit from this morning's decision. Their cards will be restored within three weeks or so. However, I am still cross that it took this long to get the issue sorted and that some good councillors lost seats as a result of the debacle. I welcome the publication this morning of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report for Ireland for 2013. It showed that 32,000 people started businesses in Ireland in 2013 and that one in 11 of the adult population was engaged in some form of early-stage entrepreneurship. The latter represents an increase from 6.8% in 2012 to 9.2%. Ireland is ranked second across the EU 15 and ninth among the EU 28 countries. This is particularly good news in terms of employment prospects. Will the Leader arrange for a further update from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on the Action Plan for Jobs, if not before the end of this session, then early in the next session, given the fact that some 8% of early-stage entrepreneurs can expect to become employers? I will renew my call from a couple of weeks ago for an early debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, on serious crime, given the case raised by Senator Bacik of the six-year-old who was shot last weekend. I heard an horrific story at lunchtime about a young person who had three fingers amputated as a result of criminal activity in the Dublin area. Serious crime is horrendous in Ireland, and particularly so in Dublin. An early discussion with the Minister would be welcome.

I commend my fellow Kerryman, Senator Paul Coghlan, on his honest statement, which echoed last week's equally honest statement by the Leader. Recently, I was in the company of a friend, a punter who had been having a bad day at the horses. He had backed four or five losers in a row. I offered him some information that might have been of assistance in balancing the books, but he told me that he would quit while he was behind. The three most senior Ministers other than the Taoiseach should take a lesson from this comment and quit while they are behind. They put their feet in it at the weekend and reopened a debate that we had robustly concluded in the Chamber last week. No more on that. On a more positive note, I commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and his Department on the comprehensive circular we recently received about the 2014 leaving certificate. It made for interesting reading and will benefit those students who sat the exam as well as their parents and teachers. It explained how the system operated, the integrity of the people who set and marked the papers and the probity of the system. For many years as a teacher, I was an examiner of higher level English papers in the leaving certificate. The first lesson one learns when attending the Department's two or three-day marking conference in Athlone is not to open one's mouth to anyone about how the system operates, particularly the media, or bring anything back to one's school principal or students that might benefit them in any way. It was a top secret omertà.Woe betide anyone who breaks that rule. The partition has since been broken down and students now know how the system works. The more information they can get, the better. It is a good day's work.

The Garth Brooks concerts are proving to be the secret weapon of the tourism industry this year. I understand 100,000 of the 400,000 tickets for the concerts were bought by people abroad. This will provide a great boost for trade and tourism and, no doubt, generate further tourism in the years ahead. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is also trying to have American football become a regular fixture at Croke Park. Members will be aware that the Notre Dame v. Navy American football fixture in 2012 brought a €60 million dividend to the country and was a tremendous success. Last week in the lift of a hotel I met two visitors from the United States who, when I asked if it was their first visit to Ireland, responded that they had been in Ireland almost two years ago for the Notre Dame v. Navy American football match and had returned on this occasion with four or five neighbours. I am pleased to announce that on 30 August a fixture between the University of Florida and Penn State will be held at Croke Park. Given the natural affinity between Ireland and the United States and our mutual love of sport, I would love to see Ireland hosting American football games on a more regular basis with, perhaps, some taking place in Cork, Galway, Dundalk and so on. It is good news for the tourism industry.

How dare those who hold the highest public office in the country try to denude or take away from his integrity in his role in that regard in the past two weeks or so. I also acknowledge the return to the Seanad of Senator David Norris who looks re-energised and ready for battle. During the past week to ten days, some people in politics have done the State a disservice. They have done the bankers a great service, but they have done the people and the State a disservice. Last weekend I met people in my constituency clinics who were struggling to hold on to their homes. The banks are riding roughshod over the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and using loopholes in that process to allow them to repossess family homes, even though people are trying to repay some of their mortgage liability. All the while, the Government which is supposed to govern and promised before the last general election that the bankers would be taken to task is engaged in political games. More than three years on, not one banker has faced the barrel of scrutiny by the Government, yet in the establishment of a committee of both Houses to facilitate an inquiry into the banking sector political games of sabotage are being played. How dare the Taoiseach and Ministers who over the weekend, through various media outlets, sought to damage the credibility of the inquiry play into the hands of the bankers. The credibility, independence and usefulness of the banking inquiry has been called into question.I am not so sure whether it is useful to proceed with the banking inquiry in its current format or whether it should be scrapped.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	71	I welcome the decision to reverse the decision on the removal of discretionary medical cards. It is important to understand that since January 2011 the number of people with medical cards has increased from 1.733 million to over 1.95 million. In fact, once the discretionary cards are restored we will probably exceed 2 million medical cards, which means that more than 43% of the population will have one. It is important to realise that there is a cost factor involved. It is also important to realise that the Government, in dealing with the issue, must come forward with a comprehensive review of how discretionary cards are granted into the future and that the decision is reached at a very early stage. It is important to hold a debate on the housing issue, and I support my colleague, Senator Hayden, in her call for the debate.  I wish to remind Senator Walsh that from 2000 to 2010, while his party was in Government, fewer local authority houses were built than in any of the previous six decades. During that period, more than 90,000 houses were built per year, but very few of them were local authority houses. That was at a time when the Government received €44,000 from every €100,000 paid by a house purchaser. What did his party do with the money during that ten-year period?

What may be needed is some kind of independent forum where people who do not have an axe to grind are in a position to ask hard and searching questions. Even then, one wonders whether they could come up with answers that other bright, well-intentioned and capable people, such as Mr. Nyberg, have not been able to find already.Deputy Stephen Donnelly was right to pull back from the inquiry in light of what happened last week, but I believe the Government should call the whole thing off.

I hope we can move on from this issue, but it might be necessary, as has been requested, for clarification to be given in the House. We are advised that the big step forward now is the so-called removal of the whip for committee members by one or two of the political parties. It is extremely ironic that when the Taoiseach and some of his Cabinet colleagues have a political difficulty, they believe the whip should be removed. However, 12 months ago in this House and the Dáil, when numerous colleagues had a serious political issue of conscience, the same Cabinet did not believe in the removal of the whip-----

Senator Bacik referred to the shooting of a six year old boy last Friday, which was a dreadful act, and asked that we have a debate on crime. Senator Mullins also requested such a debate. Senator Conway spoke about the increased tourist numbers, which will be welcomed by all.They are due in part to the VAT reductions initiated by Government and the abolition of the dreadful travel tax which prevented people coming to the country. The future of the tourism industry is a matter we should debate and I will try to arrange a session with the relevant Minister in early course. Senator Brennan also raised questions on tourism with particular reference to concerts taking place in Dublin for which more than 100,000 tickets have been sold to people from outside the State. He referred also to sporting events including American football, which are coming to Dublin. They all add to the tourism product we have and are to be commended. Senator Comiskey referred to Lissadell House in the context of tourism. It will certainly be a major boost to tourism in the area. There were more than 40,000 annual visitors to the house in years gone by. Senator Leyden referred to the three Israeli youths who were kidnapped in Ramallah. I assure the Senator that the Tánaiste will do everything in his power to assist in any way in the matter. Senator Hayden raised measures to assist people who face homelessness. I commend the work of Threshold. Senator Hayden pointed out that a great deal of work is being done on rent allowance. I remind the House that we will take Second Stage of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 tomorrow when the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, will attend. Quite a number of people were looking for a debate on housing and there is no better opportunity for them to come in to speak than when legislation comes to the House. Senator Barrett raised the safety of children in residential areas. We express our deepest sympathy to the family of the six-year old child who was killed in Kilkenny. The safety of children in residential areas is primarily a matter for local authorities. One can see that many of these areas have speed ramps and children-at-play signs. Everything that can be done should be done to allow people to play safely in their areas.  On open competition for senior positions in the Department of Finance, I will certainly convey the matter. It is something the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has advocated in the House previously. I will bring it to his attention once more. Senators Comiskey, Ó Clochartaigh, Mullins and Burke referred to the restoration of discretionary medical cards. The HSE will restore cards issued on a discretionary basis to persons with serious medical conditions to well in excess of 15,000 people who held medical or GP visit cards which were lost on completion of an eligibility review between 1 July 2011 and 31 May 2014. The HSE will review its records and restore cards automatically. The HSE estimates that the process will be completed in a three-week period. That is to be welcomed by all. It is a matter which has been raised in the House on many occasions by many Senators. It should be welcomed as it was by Members who spoke today. Senator Ó Clochartaigh referred to the files. That issue will have to be resolved. If files are missing which did not get from the initial health board area to the centralised point, it will have to be ascertained where they are. I agree completely with the Senator on the matter. Senator Moran raised the matter of the Special Olympics and praised the voluntary effort by everybody involved. All Members will concur with her remarks. Senator Walsh referred to housing as did Senator Burke.Despite the adverse economic circumstances in which the country finds itself, the Government will add approximately 5,000 homes to the social housing stock this year. This will be achieved through a variety of means, including direct construction, renovation of vacant buildings and leasing and other schemes. This year sees a return to the construction of mainstream social housing for the first time in many years. It is on a small scale as it reflects the state of the public finances but it is also an important statement of the Government's intent in respect of housing. I think Senator Colm Burke also pointed out that very little social housing was built during the boom, which is a very relevant point.  Senator Mullins spoke about the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, which found that more than32,000 people set up their own businesses in Ireland last year. That is a wonderful statistic that should be discussed with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in a debate on the Action Plan for Jobs.  Senator O'Sullivan complimented the circular from the Minister for Education and Skills regarding the 2014 leaving certificate. As the Senator said, it is opening up the system and creating greater transparency in an area where light did not shine for many years.  Senator Ó Domhnaill spoke about the code of conduct for mortgage arrears. If banks are not complying with that, they should be reported and the matter should be investigated. If he has information about those cases, there is a mechanism with which to appeal those decisions.  Senator Colm Burke also said that almost 2 million people will be in receipt of a medical card in due course.  In respect of Senator Mullen's comments, freedom of religion is a cornerstone of the Government and is written into our Constitution so there should be no ambiguity with regard to that matter.  I think I have addressed the other matters addressed by Senators relating to the banking inquiry.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	135	I move amendment No. 1:In page 63, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:" "accountant" means an individual that stands approved as an accountant with the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA);".As the Leas-Chathaoirleach said, this is a small Bill. There used to be an advertisement on television which used the tag, "It is a short name but quare stuff". This is certainly quare stuff. The amendment is intended to ensure the Bill clarifies the definition of "accountant" once and for all to provide better protection for the customer, both businesses and individuals.The fact is we do not currently have legislation regulating the term "accountant", and the amendment aims to rectify this. I also have a later associated amendment which proposes to impose fines on people who misrepresent themselves as accountants. There are a number of problems in this area, including the fact there are a number of accountants who have been expelled from professional bodies but who are still offering their services to the public. That is not correct and I do not believe we knew it was happening. While there are strict standards within accountancy bodies, such as codes of practice, they are in essence voluntary. We then have those operating outside of the system, and even someone with a criminal conviction can set up a business and offer his or her accountancy services to the public without the public knowing. This is not a proper situation and Ireland is unlike many other EU member states which give much-needed protection. What I am calling for from the Minister of State is some form of mandatory regulation within the Bill to cover the term "accountant" in order to provide better protection for the customer. Specifically, I strongly believe the term "accountant" should only be allowed to be used by those accountancy professionals who are supervised or authorised by the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. This makes perfect sense. The amendment would merely ensure that an accountant is someone who is properly accredited, nothing more, nothing less. I should emphasise there would be no cost involved due to this measure. It would simply give more protection to businesses and individuals against fraud, deception and poor performance. From speaking to businesses on a regular basis up and down the country, I am well aware how some of them have suffered in part due to not getting a properly accredited person. This is particularly important for smaller businesses, which may not have the funds to employ an accountant and must hire an external professional. This is something we should all welcome. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and my later amendment, which I will discuss later. It aims to curtail people who misrepresent themselves and who could do damage to their customers on that basis. The Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned two other amendments.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	140	I do not support the amendment. The primary objective of the Companies Bill is to be business-friendly and to reduce red tape or unnecessary regulation where possible. Supporting this amendment would result in the introduction of an onerous regulation which would disproportionately affect business and will fail to adequately address the cardinal problem which the accountancy bodies allude to. New regulations should only be introduced where there is clear evidence of market failure or very damaging consumer harm. That has not been established factually as being the position here. We must bear in mind that it is also possible that new layers of regulation could also stultify further growth and innovation. When the matter was reviewed by the Department at the time of drafting, the conclusion was there was no case for introducing a system of regulation for the profession generally. On the contrary, it was felt that introducing such a system would put at risk the flexibility of the profession and its ability to respond to client needs, be it in traditional areas such as tax advice or management accounts, or in emerging fields such as succession planning.Regulation could also stultify further growth and innovation. Having examined the issue from the standpoint of the principles of better regulation, the Competition Authority concluded there was no public interest case requiring legal protection of the term "accountant". That is the Government position.

This is the ideal opportunity to solve the problem and I urge the Minister of State to rethink before Report Stage as I believe it is worthy of consideration. I believe the words I have used are correct but I had some problems with the term "turf accountant" and was not sure how it would be dealt with. Some customers are concerned about this matter and have experienced difficulties in the past.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	142	For the record of this House, we note the concerns expressed by accountancy bodies. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has agreed to undertake an assessment of the issues by consulting with key stakeholders such as the professional bodies mentioned by Senator Quinn, consumer representatives, small business representatives, regulators, the Revenue Commissioners, the Companies Registration Office and other official bodies with an interest. It is not as if we are ignoring issues, it is merely the case that for the purposes of this Bill we do not support the amendment. This is not to say that there is not an ongoing consultation process with the very bodies Senator Quinn mentioned.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	143	I thank the Minister of State but it seems a shame to me that it took around 11 years to construct this Bill yet the intention is to leave things that have not been dealt with until later. I will not push the issue but I ask that a stronger term be used. I will now address amendment No. 127 which applies to section 879 of the principal Act and states "A person commits an offence if they make any misrepresentation whether oral or otherwise as to their status as an accountant unless they stand approved as an accountant with the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA". This is very similar to the original amendment.  Amendment No. 128 relates to section 880 of the principal Act and states:"A person guilty of an offence under section 879 is liable to a fine.-(a) on summary conviction to a Class A fine, or (b) on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.”. It sounds as though the Minister of State will not accept these amendments at this Stage but I feel it is important to give these matters serious consideration. I believe the Companies Bill should not become law while the Government says it intends to address its flaws only after enactment. I hope the Minister of State will do something about this. When discussing amendment No. 1, I explained how harmful it can be to individuals and businesses when a person misrepresents himself or herself as an accountant so these amendments aim to provide a concrete disincentive to persons who present themselves to the public, without accreditation, as offering so-called accountancy services. After all the years that went into the production of this formidable and worthy Bill that deserves our support it would be a shame to leave something out on the basis that the Minister will examine it later. I urge the Minister of State to consider these amendments, if not today then before Report Stage.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	146	I will take the sections together.I have previously advocated the view that it is within the remit of the accountancy profession to engage in an awareness campaign informing the public of the advantages of engaging the services of only fully qualified and properly regulated accountants. Similar public awareness campaigns have been run, for instance, in relation to electrical contractors, and they have proven successful. It is worth restating that the primary objective of the Companies Bill is to ensure that Ireland has a company law code that will enhance its international competitiveness, help improve ordinary business and make it easier for companies throughout the country to establish and operate. On a technical drafting matter, this amendment would be ineffective, as it would impact on others - for example, as the Senator has mentioned, those practising as accounting technicians or as turf accountants. It also fails to cover all details which would be required in terms of qualifications, standards and so on. For those reasons, it would not be appropriate to support the amendment. The accountancy profession is in general adaptable and agile, and is able to respond to new market opportunities and directions. That is to a great extent because it is not tied down by layers of regulation. There are detailed statutory provisions relating to auditing and, to a lesser extent, insolvency practice. The Competition Authority holds the view that this is the way things should stay. Additionally, my Department is committed to reducing the level of Government-imposed red tape on business. To this end, significant progress has been made by my Department in reducing administrative burdens by 25% in areas including company law. If this amendment is supported without proper consideration being given to its impact, it could have an adverse consequence for business by creating an additional layer of regulation and, in doing so, would fail to advance consumer protection. For those reasons, we do not support the amendment.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	147	I thank the Minister for his words, but the accountancy bodies remain concerned. They are particularly unhappy at the fact that somebody who has been expelled from the accountancy bodies for "misbehaviour" and has been found to be a criminal will now be able to go back into the profession and continue to act as an accountant. That is a dangerous situation. I do not like it being left to persist any longer. The Companies Bill gives us an ideal opportunity to get it resolved. I am sorry to see the amendment being put on the long finger. I urge the Minister to resolve this matter in this Bill rather than leave it to a later Bill. Amendment No. 180 relates to section 1430 and is about restricting the number of partners in a partnership to 20. It is on a similar theme to that of the previous amendment. In particular, there is a problem with subsection (1)(c), which aims to give some relief to accountancy firms constituted as partnerships. However, this relief will be ineffective, as the Bill refers only to "statutory auditor". In the modern day, individuals in accountancy firms cover a wide range of areas and many of them have on board what I call "non-audit specialists" - for instance, taxation or financial analysts. A partnership will often cover people who do not have an audit background or who do not hold a professional accountancy qualification. With the Bill as it stands, some accountancy firms may not be able to avail of the relief on offer in section 1430, which may be seen as unfair. We should aim at a level playing field.Some accountancy firms may even have to engage in more red tape and bureaucracy to get their affairs in order at great administrative cost for no concrete benefit. It is a clear case of "less is more", and that is why I propose to delete the part of the Bill that stipulates all partners should be limited to a partnership of 20. It is worthy of consideration.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	148	The section is partly new and derives from a wide range of statutory provisions, including section 376 of the Companies Act 1963 and section 13(1) and 13(2) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1982 and various statutory instruments. Provisions in secondary legislation relating to thoroughbred horse breeding and providers of investment in loan finance have been brought into primary legislation. I do not know if the Senator refers specifically to that industry. Provision is made for the Minister to make further exceptions to the 20-partner limit by order in consultation with the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. Exceptions are made in respect of limited partnerships and investment limited partnerships. I am not sure if that fully addresses the point and perhaps I am missing a trick in terms of the Senator's argument.

I raised this point about the transition period and specific issues about it on Second Stage. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for responding in his Second Stage speech to some of the comments I made. Since Second Stage I have received correspondence from Mr. Brian Walker, who I know has been in touch with many of us to helpfully give us some thoughts on his experience. He is a barrister and has been travelling around the country presenting seminars on the Bill and has met many accountants. He has a question following on from what I said on Second Stage about the transition period and in particular about the commencement date. Clearly, the transition period in section 15 means the period expiring 18 months after the commencement of this section. I realise that section 1 deals with the commencement but can the Minister of State clarify if a commencement date has been set? The Companies Office, according to Mr. Walker, appears to be gearing up for a commencement date of 1 January 2015 but I am not sure if that has been agreed or confirmed anywhere. The reason that is important is that while most practitioners agree the 18-month transitional period is ample and sufficient to allow companies avail of the transition period, they are anxious that many aspects of the Bill would come into force sooner rather than later. Section 16 allows for the extension of the transition period and there is some concern about uncertainty about the actual time period. That is a particular issue. The other issue of interest is that Mr. Walker points out that there may not be a substantial number of companies making the application to convert over to the new limited company since they may take the view that if it is going to happen automatically at the end of the transition period, it may be simpler to allow the default to occur. Those are some of the issues I raised about the transition and the practical impact of it and I thought it would be worth raising them again under this section.

There is general agreement that the 18-month period was the best period. We will aim to have a specific date as soon as possible, which I appreciate does not give the Senator too much comfort. There is a recognition of the need to aim for a specific date as soon as possible and we are very cognisant of that.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	165	The purpose of these amendments is to ensure consistency with the model constitutions. For example, the model constitution of Schedule 1 contains a clause to the effect that the liability of its members is limited and the amendment ensures that both the section and Schedule 1 are uniform. The other amendments grouped under this section aim to achieve the same result with regard to the section and Schedule reflecting one another.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	166	The purpose of this amendment is to provide an exception from the prohibition that neither a body that is not a company nor an individual shall carry on any trade, profession or business under a name which includes as its last part the word "limited" or the words "company limited by shares" for industrial and provident societies, as initiated.Only volume 1 companies are permitted to end their name with "Limited". This amendment is necessary to provide for the approximately 900 industrial and provident societies in existence which have the word "Limited" in their name. I am also considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide that the provisions of this section will not apply to an external company.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	169	The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the provisions of regulation 4 of SI No. 163/1973 - that is, European Communities (Companies) Regulations 1973 - into the Bill and to impose a publication notification requirement in respect of the few items listed in the amendment. These are: any copy of a winding up order in respect of the company; any copy of an order for the dissolution of the company on a winding up; any return by the liquidator of the final meeting of the company on a winding up; and any notice of the appointment of a liquidator in a voluntary winding up of a company. This section provides that the registrar shall publish in the CRO Gazette notice of the delivery to or the issue by the Registrar of certain documents and particulars listed. The section requires such a notice to be published within ten days after the date of the relevant delivery or issue.

#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	171	I move amendment No. 9:In page 88, line 34, to delete "privileges." and substitute the following:"privileges,in so much as such action does not undermine or take precedence above a person's right and entitlements as provided for in existing legislation or international treaties and agreements to which Ireland has signed up.".What struck me was the size of the explanatory memorandum. One would almost need an explanatory memorandum just for that. One of the most striking but largely unremarked changes is that section 38 proposes to give a company the same capacity and authority as a human person. The idea behind the change is to remove the danger of ultra vires and the necessity for lengthy object clauses. Our concern is whether the provision of full and unlimited capacity for a company to carry on and undertake any business or activity or to act or enter into any transaction, having the full rights, powers and privileges of a human being, is going too far. As to amendment No. 10, it is difficult to determine the ultimate use companies and directors could make of the provision in the Bill. In the US, this type of right has resulted in companies claiming a breach of their human rights when they are, for example, required to allow workplace inspections or, in terms of free speech, to abide by advertising rules or laws on unfair labour practices. Could this provision muddy the waters as regards the human rights obligations of those companies to which State services have been outsourced? It would be an unintended consequence, but we would be naive not to anticipate the possibility that companies could attempt to take every advantage of their newfound full and unlimited capacity, rights and privileges and seek to maximise same in their favour. Like ICTU, Sinn Féin is of the view that this section of the Bill should be referred to the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, for an assessment and recommendation. What is the Minister of State's opinion in this regard?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	172	I propose to respond to the two amendments together. I am not in favour of them. I draw the House's attention to section 38(2), which reads: "Nothing in subsection (1) shall relieve a company from any duty or obligation under any enactment or the general law." This safeguard prevents an argument to the contrary being made. In such circumstances, amendment No. 9 is already provided for in the Bill. Amendment No. 10 is misconceived in law. It is contrary to the Constitution and the principles of natural justice generally to provide that, in the case of a clash of "rights and privileges", a natural human being's rights and privileges must always take precedence over those of a company. Companies are legal persons and, as such, have a number of rights that must be protected. Therefore, I am not in favour adopting these amendments. I will avail of this opportunity to clarify that section 38 grants private limited companies the full legal capacity to enter into transactions and undertake business activities. Section 39 provides that a company, should it wish to do so, may authorise a person to bind it, that is, act on behalf of its board of directors. The provision contained in section 38 is new while section 39 is drawn from section 6(3) of the European Communities (Companies) Regulations 1973, although this is not a direct re-enactment. Section 38 is modelled on section 16(1) of the New Zealand Companies Act 1993. The rationale for the innovation in section 38 is to prevent its use in the avoidance of corporate contractual responsibility to the detriment of a particular creditor. Under current law, if a company does something outside the scope of its objects, it has committed an ultra vires act. This means that, if a company has entered into a contract and is subsequently found to have acted outside its powers, that contract will be deemed to have never existed. This section reflects the reality that 90% of Irish companies are closely held ones, that is, companies in which the shareholders and management often consist of the same people. Thus, in circumstances where the demarcation of management and shareholders is virtually non-existent, the doctrine of ultra vires has little meaning. I am satisfied that section 38 will add certainty to the law and is to be welcomed. As a result of this provision, any contract that a company enters into will be legally binding on that company. Therefore, I am satisfied that the introduction of section 38 does not mean that the company somehow can usurp the human rights of any person or ignore its legal obligations. A company is a legal person that has rights and duties of its own. It is not possible or proper to insert a provision that would undermine these rights.

#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	174	I thank the Minister of State for his reply in which I think he ruled out any possibility of this section being referred to the Human Rights Commission for consideration as, in his opinion, to do so would not be proper or right. Will he confirm that he has ruled out referral of this section to the Human Rights Commission for assessment and recommendation? I do not propose to press the amendments at this point as I would like to revisit them on Report Stage, in particular amendment No. 10 in the light of the Minister of State's statement that what is proposed would be in contravention of the Constitution. I reserve my right to resubmit the amendments on Report Stage.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	175	In regard to amendment No. 10, suggesting we ought to set out in statute that a person's rights would, regardless of circumstances, always take precedence over a company's rights is misconceived in law. Like human beings, companies have rights which must be protected. For example, a company can enjoy the right of freedom of speech and be afforded a nationality. While I appreciate that this section has been interpreted as somehow strengthening the corporate personality at the expense of human beings, that simply is not the case. It is not appropriate to attempt to introduce a hierarchy between various rights in statute law. It is a matter for the courts to interpret the facts of a particular case and apply the law. It ought to be appreciated that rights are not limited and that it is normal that different rights conflict with one another. It is on that basis that I cannot accept amendment No. 10.

That is a hugely important and significant step in reducing paperwork and red tape for the small companies referred to by the Minister of State. The purpose of this provision is to do away with that need and provide capacity for companies not to be hidebound by specific objects and an objects clause.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	186	Amendment No. 13 has been grouped with amendment No. 14. The purpose of these amendments is to correct an oversight in relation to companies that re-register as designated activity companies. The amendment will preserve the model of regulation of Table A to the Companies Act 1963, for companies limited by shares. Table A will continue to apply to these companies save to the extent that it is contrary to mandatory provisions in the Bill. Government amendment No. 14:In page 104, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:"(9) If, by reason of section 58, an existing private company was, immediately before the making by the company of an application under subsection (3), governed (in whole or in part) by the regulations contained in Table A, then for the purposes of this section and in addition to the other cases where their continuance in force for a particular purpose is provided for by this Chapter, those regulations shall, despite the repeal of the Act of 1963, continue in force and upon the issue of the aforementioned certificate of incorporation the articles of the designated activity company shall be deemed to comprise the whole of those regulations or, as the case may be, to include the parts concerned of those regulations, but—(a) this is save to the extent that those regulations are inconsistent with a mandatory provision;(b) those regulations may be altered or added to under and in accordance with the conditions under which the designated activity company’s articles are permitted by Part 16 to be altered or added to; and(c) references in those regulations to any provision of the prior Companies Acts shall be read as references to the corresponding provision of this Act.(10) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) of that subsection, the regulations referred to in subsection (9) shall be interpreted according to the form in which they existed on the date of repeal of the Act of 1963.”.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	187	The purpose of this amendment is to remove the discretion from the private limited company in relation to its duty to require a member, or transferee of shares, to furnish the company with information as to the beneficial ownership of any shares. This subsection (7), like Regulation 7 of Part I of Table A of the Companies Act 1963, provides that a company is not bound by or compelled to recognise the beneficial ownership of its shares even if it has notice of it. As the Bill stands, subsection 7 goes on to provide that unless its constitution provides otherwise, subsection 6 does not preclude a company from requesting information as to the beneficial ownership of shares when reasonably required.SECTION 69

In these circumstances it would fall back on the State to make the payment from the insolvency fund. The purpose of the amendments is to save the Exchequer money. One of the Government's policy objectives is to ensure employees are protected in every case. Similarly, the Government seeks to limit the State's exposure to potential shortfalls in the context of redundancy or insolvency. Unpaid remuneration in these times of contraction is all too common. We have seen a plethora of employees having to fight very hard to ensure they get what they are entitled to. The amendments seek to ensure workers who have expended their energies, efforts and brain power to make profits for companies or businesses would be protected. I urge the Minister of State to consider them.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	203	I am not in favour of adopting the amendments which propose unduly oppressive conditions on legitimate businesses. The suggestion that a majority of directors be EEA resident might particularly dissuade foreign direct investment companies from doing business in Ireland.This is bad for Ireland and Irish commerce generally. Second, section 137, which re-enacts existing law, ensures that companies that do not have at least one director who is resident in an EEA state must put in place a bond in the prescribed form that becomes payable to a person nominated by the registrar or the Revenue Commissioners. The purpose of the bond is to discharge any fine imposed on the company in respect of an offence committed by it and prosecutable by the registrar and-or for the purposes of discharging certain fines and penalties imposed on it by the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The moneys can also be used to cover expenses that are reasonably incurred in the collection of said penalties. The bond cannot be used for any other purpose. Therefore, the amendments proposed do not achieve any legitimate policy goal. Their sole effect is to create an arbitrary restriction on non-EEA companies trying to do business in Ireland. It is on that basis that I do not support the amendments.

The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax-resident in Ireland. As Minister of State in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law. Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance. Additionally, the proposed amendments are illegal both under EU and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the EU law on freedom of establishment, which is a core aspect of EU law. Compliance with this is closely monitored by the European Commission. Ireland has recently been required by the Commission to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State. This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the EU and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland.  Furthermore, this proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is completely unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and Ireland's reputation internationally so it is on that basis that I am not in favour of accepting the amendments.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	214	The purpose of the amendment is to delete language which could be interpreted in a discriminatory manner. This refers to the somewhat outdated term “unsound mind”. While the term is legally sound, it does not represent everyday language and understanding of situations where a director is no longer, for medical reasons, capable of fulfilling his or her functions as a company director. The wording proposed is more in line with the wording used in the Employment Equality Act. This section provides that the office of director is vacated if a director becomes bankrupt or disqualified and, unless the constitution provides otherwise, where the director resigns, can no longer be reasonably regarded as possessing an adequate decision making capacity, is restricted, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an indictable offence, or is absent for six months without permission. This section substantially imports model regulations 91 of Part I of Table A of the First Schedule to the Companies Act 1963. A new requirement that the conviction must give rise to a sentence and to a term of imprisonment - actual or suspended - has been inserted. I pay tribute to Mr. Jim Breen from Cycle Against Suicide, who brought the issue to our attention. On foot of representations made specifically by him and people close to him, we sought to change the wording and reflect language that is more caring and apt for the society we live in. On the basis of some consciousness-raising, we introduced this amendment. I acknowledge the work of our officials in bringing it forward. It represents a positive change in how we use language about issues such as this.

an obligation imposed by or under section 194.(5) A person who contravenes this section is guilty of an offence.”.”.For a long time we have talked about red tape, regulation and costs. By its nature, regulation involves extra costs and creates a level of red tape for businesses. No one is arguing that we should get rid of regulations totally, but Irish businesses would be more competitive if they were not required to write health and safety statements or if we were to get rid of all regulations to prevent problems and ensure firms adhered to their responsibilities to their staff, the environment, the community and the Government. However, the point we are trying to make which has been echoed by other organisations, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is that there is a balance to be struck between the responsibilities to the greater community and the responsibilities to make a profit for shareholders. There is a need to strike the balance between these competing ends. The belief that the Bill is a watered-down version of what is required has been stated. According to the ICTU, the majority of its concerns and those of other organisations were ignored. In my experience, we have seldom seen such strong statements from three disparate organisations in critiquing this element of the legislation in terms of the need for regulation. If we are to learn anything from the collapse in recent years, it should be that regulation, when necessary, is valuable, that it saves money in the long term and reduces the cost burden on the State. The new section proposed is rather large. I seek the opinion of the Minister of State on whether he sees particular problems with it or whether the section could be improved. Perhaps any alteration could be addressed on Report Stage.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	225	This section contains the form of directors compliance statement as recommended by the Company Law Review Group. Having analysed the provisions contained in the 2003 Act, the group determined that such extra duties as set out would do little to increase compliance and merely result in an increase in red tape at considerable cost to Irish businesses. The set-up costs for a business were estimated at €90,000 and the ongoing annual costs at €40,000. A streamlined version of the directors compliance statement proposed by the Company Law Review Group removed the requirement that the statement include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments which could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant since companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas and their inclusion in the directors compliance statement did not add substantive duties. A wide majority of the Company Law Review Group, that is, more than 80% of the members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the directors compliance statement. There is a strong European Union impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. The amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs for Irish businesses without adding value in terms of protection. It would disadvantage Ireland competitively as it would move beyond other countries. The directors compliance statement, as it stands, has broad support. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve the directors compliance statement as it stands within the Bill. On this basis, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.

I am also considering introducing an amendment to Chapter 15 on Report Stage in order to bring the audit exemption criteria in line with Article 52 of Directive 2013/34/EU. The aim of this directive is to simplify the accounting requirements for small companies and improve the clarity and comparability of companies' financial statements within the Union. The new directive takes the small company or group as the starting point and imposes additional requirements on medium-sized companies and groups and even further requirements on large companies and groups, as well as on public interest entities. Essentially, the latter are listed companies, banks and insurance undertakings, whether listed or not, regardless of size. This is described as a "think small first" approach. Directive 2013/34/EU must be transposed into national law by July 2015.
#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	229	I move amendment No. 61:In page 266, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:“(d) a certificate of tax compliance,”.This amendment relates to an issue which arose in the context of a young man with a young family who set up a construction company and subcontracted work to a contractor. Over a period of seven or eight years he allowed the contractor to build up a level of credit on the understanding that the latter was tax compliant. Halfway through the period the young man invested a considerable amount of money in his business before discovering that the contractor had not been tax compliant for six or seven years but was still trading. The young man's business collapsed as a result of the level of exposure that had built up. It is important that we ensure that companies operating in these areas are tax compliant. This amendment provides that companies that are making annual returns must provide certificates of tax compliance as part of that process. It is also designed to ensure that a company may not continue to be registered if it is not fully tax compliant. There is an issue with regard to syncing annual returns with tax returns but it is intended that tax compliance certificates be available for the most recent year. This would be a positive development because it would give confidence to those along the supply chain that there will be no danger of those whom they are dealing with exposing them to future risk.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	230	I have sympathy for the situation of the person to whom the Senator refers but I cannot accept the amendment. What is proposed would not be a logical inclusion in companies' financial statements. Such statements relate to companies' financial performance and not to their tax obligations. Fiscal accounting addresses tax obligations. If the Government were to consider a requirement to oblige businesses to obtain and publish certificates of tax compliance, the appropriate place to do so would be in tax law rather than company law in order that both company and non-company businesses, which also pay taxes, would be contemplated. The introduction of the suggested requirement would be entirely without precedent across the European Union. It is on this basis that I am not in favour of accepting the amendment.

Senator Reilly referred to red tape and bureaucracy and I am aware that the Minister of State has a campaign to avoid these. The section states: "if those records are not kept by making entries in a bound book [I have never heard that term before] but by some other means, adequate precautions shall be taken for guarding against falsification and facilitating discovery of such falsification, should it occur." This implies that having something written down in a bound book is somehow a protection against fraud. It sounds like a contention a law firm might have put forward 50 or 100 years ago. Bound books are no longer used in this, the age of the computer. I would love to see the introduction of the mandatory recording of activities in the banks by outside agencies in order to protect against another collapse. If we use the software which is now available, we could protect taxpayers against another collapse similar to that involving the former Anglo Irish Bank. Section 282(2) offers no concrete definition with regard to what might actually constitute the detection and prevention of fraud. This aspect is already adequately covered in section 282(1), which states that adequate accounting records should "correctly record and explain the transactions of the company". The word "adequate" implies no falsification of a company's records. My amendment aims, therefore, to simplify the legislation by deleting section 282(2), which adds nothing in the context of combating falsification but which encourages those who keep bound books - I love that term - to take fewer precautions against falsification. This part of the Bill is quite strange. What is proposed could have unintended and potentially risky consequences for smaller companies in particular because it implies that they can take more risks if they keep bound books. I hope the Minister of State understands where I am coming from and I hope he will accept the amendment because it makes a great deal of sense. Amendment No. 64 proposes the deletion of section 282(6), which states that "any computer (the “server computer”) that provides services to another computer, being services the provision of which to the latter is necessary so that the accounting records, and the other foregoing information and returns, stored in the latter can be accessed at all times, shall be kept in a place in the State." It is sometimes not feasible for companies with operations in a number of locations across the globe to keep in the State a computer on which accountancy files are stored. There are other technical issues which arise, including the emerging area of cloud computing. The latter is rapidly expanding and allowing data to be accessed from any computer in any location across the globe. That fact may make the requirement contained in the legislation redundant in just a few short years. I wish to strongly emphasise the fact that it is likely that no other country has such a provision. Thus, we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage compared to our competitors, even those across the Border. We are making Ireland less attractive as a place in which to do business, especially to big multinationals. The latter is something we should avoid at all costs. I know the Minister of State and I have similar views on this matter. The purpose of the amendment is to delete the requirement to keep bound books and thus place Ireland on a level playing field with its competitors. I urge the Minister of State to accept the changes to section 282 which I am proposing. He could not accept earlier amendments in my name but he did indicate that he intended to give further consideration to the matters to which they relate. I am of the view that he should give serious consideration to these amendments and I hope he will accept them.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	234	I shall take the two amendments together, if I may. I am unclear as to why the Senator has proposed the deletion of subsections (2) and (6), particularly as the proposal does not include any replacement texts. I can only surmise that he is opposed to the Bill making provision for alternative methods for the storing and managing of accounting records, rather than the requirement to keep accounting records on a continuous and consistent basis. Perhaps he will clarify the matter. The purpose of subsections (2) and (6) is, respectively, to ensure that accounting records must be kept on a continuous and consistent basis, and that they must be available for inspection in the State. This stems from existing law, specifically section 202 of the 1990 Companies Act. It ought to be noted that the requirement to keep proper books is not an obligation to act as a passive custodian of books, but rather a positive and continuing obligation to create books and records in a particular form and with specified content. The provision has to be general in some respects because technology may change and one cannot be over-prescriptive at the same time.  Subsection (2) in the Bill is cognisant of the fact that ledgers exist in electronic form and, therefore, requires that such ledgers must also be updated and safeguarded from falsification, in a positive manner. It is important that the Bill reflects the realities of the majority of modern company practices. I am not in favour of deleting existing law from this section, on that basis.  The Companies Bill anticipates that where such records are kept, other than book form, safeguards shall be taken to guard against falsification. Subsection (6), subject to the provisions of subsection (7), ensures that where accounting records, other information and returns are kept on a computer that the computer shall be kept in the State. This is another positive duty that recognises that many modern companies no longer rely on ledgers and paper when maintaining or recording any transactions. I cannot support a proposal to remove references and safeguards relating to technological innovations from this section. This Bill aims to strike a balance between good regulation and the need to ensure that the operating environment for companies in Ireland is informed by the realities of modern companies. Record management is a crucial aspect for modern companies. The rationale behind these provisions is to ensure that the companies availing of modern technologies shall take certain precautions to ensure that said records are accessible and authentic.  With regard to the second point made about records, we could take a look at that on Report Stage. I also take the point that the Senator made in relation to cloud computing which is something we must have due regard for. Perhaps we could come back to it at a later stage in the proceedings, if that is okay with the Senator.

It was the term "bound book" that got me because I thought it sounded like something from Dickens or whomever. I was also struck by how cloud computing is so big. This morning I dropped into the Springboard demonstration or launch taking place at Customs House Quay. It was amazing to witness hundreds of attendees meeting organisations and colleges from around Ireland and, very often, they were selling cloud computing. I spoke to one man who had travelled all the way from Waterford to the event because he had got a job but wanted to locate a specific course. Another person asked him what he could do and he promptly demonstrated his cloud computing skills. That person said to him, "I need you immediately, will you start next week?" That scenario reminded me how strange it would be for us to include a provision stipulating that the information must be kept in a bound book and kept in the State. To the best of my knowledge, this provision does not apply in other countries. We should change the provision in order to make us more competitive. I was happy to hear the Minister of State say that the matter would be given consideration. It is one of the amendments that needs further consideration before we reach the Final Stage. I was pleased to hear that the Minister of State has agreed that he will do so.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	241	This is a significant amendment and arises as a consequence of the CLRG's recommendation in 2013 that company law be amended to allow companies that meet two of the three criteria relating to balance sheet total turnover and number of employees, to qualify for audit exemption. The intention here is to use the available provisions in EU law to help small companies.The Bill, as it stands, incorporates section 32(3)(a)(ii) and section 32(3)(a)(iii) of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999. It provides that a private company limited by shares that meets three specified criteria may be exempted from the general rule that the annual accounts of a company must be audited. The three criteria and their current thresholds are: the annual turnover does not exceed €8.8 million; the balance sheet does not exceed €4.4 million; and the average number of employees does not exceed 50. The current thresholds were set in August 2012 and are given effect in two statutory instruments: the European Union (Accounts) Regulations 2012, SI No. 304 of 2012; and the Companies (Amendment) No. 2 Act 1999 (Section 32) Order 2012, SI No. 308 of 2012. This legislation transposes into Irish law elements of the fourth Council directive on the annual accounts of certain types of companies, which provides that member states may exempt companies from the obligation to conduct an annual audit where they meet at least two of the three criteria. When introducing this provision into Irish law in 1999, the Oireachtas chose to require companies to meet all three. The Bill, as initiated, carried forward the existing legislative provisions on audit exemption and now proposes to extend the scope of the exemption. In this regard, the Bill also provides for the application of the exemption for the first time to companies limited by guarantee. It provides that a company may be either a parent or subsidiary applying the three criteria to the group as a whole and not to individual companies within the group. This also proposes the application of the audit exemption to a dormant company.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	249	The purpose of these amendments is to provide for a modification of the rules governing priority of charges. "Priority of charges" refers to where two or more successive mortgages are created over the same property.The current rule of priority is that the first mortgage has priority over the subsequent mortgage, subject to an exception where the second mortgagee gives notice to the first of the creation of the second mortgage, in which case the second mortgage will have priority over amounts secured by the first mortgage advanced after the date of such notice. This is known as the tacking of further advances. As far as charges on land are concerned, the exemption is contained in section 111 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and section 75 of the Registration of Title Act 1964. However, there is no equivalent legislation which governs assets other than land, rather the same result is arrived at under common law. As the Bill stands, section 412 provides that unless their priority is otherwise governed by another enactment, charges will rank in priority in accordance with their date of registration in the CRO and makes no provision for the tacking of further advances. Accordingly, if the section is enacted in its current form, the position on the tacking of further advances will vary, according to whether the assets charged are land or assets other than land. The holder of a second charge over land will be able to get priority over further advances, whereas the holder of a second charge on other assets will not as there is no legislative provision for it. This would not be a desirable outcome. The purpose of the further amendments is to bring the chapter in line with the recommendation made in the CLRG's second report to exclude a notice of crystalisation of a floating charge, events giving rise to crystalisation or provisions for dealing with payments of proceeds to be made into a special designated account from the particulars of a charge received by the registrar and entering into the register. Subsection (5) sets out provisions filed in form C1 which should not be taken for filing to cut down on the work of the CRO in preparing the form while retaining the requirement to file details of charges. Negative pledges are excluded under section 412, but notice of crystalisation events, a floating charge, events giving rise to crystalisation or provisions dealing with payments or proceeds to be made into a special designated account should also be excluded. This was recommended in the CLRG's second report. The section contains various transitional provisions relating to priorities and ensures priority as between charges created just before commencement but not registered until after and charges created just after commencement will be determined according to the rules of sections 412 and 413, not according to existing law.

#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	257	I move amendment No. 104:In page 488, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:"(5) Where a breach of employment law is committed by a body corporate or by a person acting on behalf of a body corporate and is proved to have been so committed with the consent, connivance or approval of, or to have been attributable to any neglect on the part of, a person who, when the breach was committed, was a director, manager, secretary or other similar officer of the body corporate or a person who was purporting to act in any such capacity, that person (as well as the body corporate) shall be liable to be proceeded against as if guilty of the breach committed by the body corporate.".The first amendment seeks to insert a form of words to increase responsibility. It pretty much does what it says on the tin and holds people to account. This Bill offers us the opportunity to strengthen employee rights and ensure that individuals who have been mistreated have an opportunity to hold these companies to account for reasonable amounts of money in the wind-up process and elsewhere. While an approach to the court would be a very unwieldy and difficult activity for an individual to proceed with, the very fact that employees' rights are written in law would encourage most companies to take these rights more seriously. The law in its own right does serve as a guideline for the proper functioning of society. It would only be necessary to pursue the matter through the courts in a small minority of cases.  In respect of amendment No. 111, I know the total amount payable was already increased in the legislation but in reality, it would be very low and we could increase it. The figure of €40,000 that we provide is an example and is just above the average industrial wage. 
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15168	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	258	I am not in a position to adopt these amendments. The Bill is concerned with company law only. In general terms, company law concerns itself with the fiduciary duties that a director owes to the company alone while recognising that a director ought to "have regard to the interests" of his or her employees. It would be wholly inappropriate to include the proposed provisions in the Bill. Legislation governing employee rights should be considered in the context of employment law. By addressing such a matter in a company Bill, the provision is not providing protection for all employees such as sole traders and those working in partnerships. Second, employment law already provides for redress in less cumbersome and costly fora than the High Court. Equally important, it must also be borne in mind that company law must balance the rights of all creditors, many of whom are employers in their own right, in winding up situations. I appreciate that the Senator is attempting to achieve laudable goals here but the simple fact is that company law is not the correct vehicle for these ambitions and it is on that basis that we are not in favour of the amendments.  In addition to the general objections previously noted, amendment No. 104 would fail in substance as prosecutions thereunder would be doomed to fail due to the ambiguity of the phrase "breach of employment law". There is no indication as to what is meant by this. No such provisions are workable but only in the context of a specific and appropriate enactment where the transgressions are clearly identified or identifiable. Finally, the amendment proposes that the separate legal personality of the company would be breached for a transgression of civil law rather than criminal law. In all the other circumstances where this phrase is used, for example, in health and safety legislation, it requires a criminal offence.  Amendment No. 105 suggests that a company may be wound up in court where it owes an employee or a group of employees more than €1,500. The Bill sets a limit at €10,000 as it was considered that greater balance and proportionality must be achieved in circumstances where the sanction of wind up is potentially so severe. The section does not distinguish between an employee and any other creditor. In the circumstances, any creditor is entitled to issue a letter demanding payment and if after 21 days, such payment has not been received, the creditor is entitled to petition the High Court. I am sure the Senators present appreciate that petitioning the High Court is not a simple or low-cost exercise. It would have to be questioned whether winding up was really the most effective way to settle a debt for €1,500. It must also be borne in mind that there are provisions in both employment and health and safety law alongside common law remedies that already provide for the type of situation described. For example, the Payment of Wages Act 1991 provides more efficient remedies for employees who have not been paid their wages than an attempt to have the company wound up in the High Court with all of the associated costs.

Some 850 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed every year and 150 people die every year from melanoma. Data from the HSE indicates that the cost of treating it ranges from €6,000 to €10,000 per patient but new treatments that have recently come on stream range from €50,000 to €100,000. The passage of this Bill is timely. Men's health awareness week ran from 9 to I5 June and according to Men's Health Forum in Ireland, men experience a disproportionate burden of ill health and die too young. In this context the National Cancer Registry Ireland has indicated that in the next 25 years the incidence of melanoma is projected to rise by 175% for women and by a whopping 327% for men. We can change those horrifying projections by taking very simple measures. I would encourage everybody to take action to minimise their exposure to UV radiation. I thank the Irish Cancer Society, the Marie Keating Foundation, the Environmental Health Association of Ireland, and let me restate what I said at their conferences, they are the unsung heroes of our health service. The work they do is below the radar but it saves many lives. This Bill will further enable them to protect our children against the danger of sunbed use. I thank the industry representatives, the officials of my Department, the Environmental Health Service, the HSE, the National Cancer Control Programme, the members of the National Implementation Group and colleagues in both Houses. The contribution of all Members and that of the groups I have listed has ensured that we will have a robust tool to protect children and to inform adults about the dangers of sunbed use and the need to protect ourselves from deadly UV radiation.

It is great news that the Bill has passed. In addition to the practical implications of protecting young people against the harmful effects of unnecessary ultraviolet radiation, it gives us a great opportunity to hammer home the message that Ireland's gene pool has the highest incidence of malignant melanoma. Irish people who live in sunny places such as Australia have the highest demographic of this disease anywhere in the world. This is an emergency problem facing Ireland. The Minister has outlined the numbers, 400 cases in 1998, 800 cases in 2008 and 1,100 this year. The incidence of melanoma is rising very dramatically. There have been, as the Minister pointed out, extraordinary advances, probably bigger advances in the treatment of this cancer in the past two years than of any other cancer. They will give us unique health economic challenges in the next few years when very expensive and effective new drugs are presented for health technology assessments to HIQA. Virtually all cases of metastatic melanoma can be prevented if people were diagnosed early. It must be stated that the key problem is diagnosing the disease when it is confined to the skin, when it has an extremely high rate of cure. Having successfully shepherded this laudable and worthwhile Bill through the Seanad, the next challenge is to ensure that we have dermatologists in the south east region and that Ireland is lifted off the bottom of the league table of dermatologists per head of population of any country in the OECD, which is a distinction that we do not need. In addition, we need to make as major an educational effort on wholly avoidable excess sun exposure, sunburn, dangerous UV radiation exposure as he and others have done successfully with tobacco. We need to make this a major priority. When I was a medical student and studying oncology, we thought of melanoma as a terrible but a very uncommon disease. It is not uncommon any more. Melanoma is now more common in Ireland than many of the other cancers which have much higher profiles. As a cause of death from cancer, melanoma is no longer rate. It is becoming a major problem which must be tackled on all fronts, prevention by this worthwhile legislation and education, facilitating early diagnosis by having adequate numbers of skin specialists. We need to be ready for the challenge we will face when the new drugs come on the market. I congratulate the Minister and say well done for shepherding this Bill through this House.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	270	I thank the Senators for beginning this Bill in the Seanad. It is appropriate, given that we have just finished another public health Bill which will protect our citizens, particularly our children, from malignant melanoma, which, as Senator Crown said, is highly preventable. The Bill we are now discussing is another that will lead to a great reduction in the incidence of cancers in this country, particularly lung cancer, which in the vast bulk of cases is entirely preventable. I will begin with a few quotes to give a sense of what we are dealing with here. "We don't believe it's ever been established that smoking is the cause of disease," "I'm unclear in my own mind whether anyone dies of cigarette smoking related diseases," and "I do not believe that nicotine is addictive." These statements were made, under oath, by the vice president of the Tobacco Institute, Murray Walker, the chairman of Philip Morris, Geoffrey Bible, and the chief executive of Brown and Williamson, Thomas Sandefur, as recently as 1994 and 1998. The tobacco industry has a dark track record of hiding the truth to protect its profits. Do not expect it to change now. Its internal documents clearly show its own scientists were warning that smoking causes cancer since the early 1950s and that smoking is addictive since the early 1960s. For five decades, the industry deliberately concealed these facts in an attempt to deceive Governments and the public of the dangers of smoking. Now, it is using bogus arguments about illicit trade to terrify responsible retailers into opposing this legislation. I believe its arguments today remain as bogus and as dishonest as they have been for the past five decades. The consequence of this legislation is clear. It will protect our children from marketing gimmicks that trap them into a killer addiction. If the tobacco industry did not get our children addicted, the industry would disappear within a generation. We all know that to be true and so does the industry. To replace the smokers who quit and, sadly, those who die, the tobacco industry needs to recruit 50 new smokers in Ireland every day just to maintain smoking rates at their current level. Given that 78% of smokers in a survey said they started smoking under the age of 18, it is clear that our children are targeted to replace those customers who die or quit. Research has shown that, when consuming cigarettes from the standardised packs which we intend to introduce, smokers are 66% more likely to think their cigarettes are of poorer quality, are 70% more likely to say they found them less satisfying and are 81% more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day and rate quitting as a higher priority in their lives. This Bill will regulate the appearance of tobacco packaging and products. The aim is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive to consumers, to make health warnings more prominent and to prevent packaging from misleading consumers, particularly children, about the harmful effects of tobacco. The Bill will also implement some aspects of the newly adopted tobacco products directive of the European Union and it will give effect to Ireland's obligations under the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. What is standardised packaging? It means that all forms of branding - trademarks, logos, colours and graphics - would be removed from tobacco packs. The brand and variant names would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands, and the packs would all be in one plain, neutral colour. I will now take the House through the Bill section by section to clarify its provisions. The Bill is divided into four parts. The first part of the Bill deals with preliminary and general provisions and covers sections 1 to 6. Section 1 of the Bill makes standard provisions setting out the Short Title of the Bill, the collective citation for the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts and arrangements for its commencement. Section 2 deals with the interpretation of the Bill and defines the meanings of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill. Section 3 deals with regulations, allowing the Minister for Health to make regulations to bring the legislation into operation. Section 4 is a standard provision dealing with expenses. Section 5 clarifies that nothing in the Bill operates to prohibit the registration of a trademark, or will be grounds for the revocation of the registration of a trademark. It also makes clear that nothing in the Bill will affect the law in regard to tax stamps. Section 6 makes transitional provisions which will allow retailers and manufacturers time to comply with the new measures. Current packets may be manufactured until May 2016, and there will then be a one-year period to sell outstanding stocks. Non-compliant retail packaging may not be manufactured from May 2016 and may not be sold after May 2017. Part 2 of the Bill deals with the retail packaging and presentation of tobacco products and covers sections 7 to 14. Section 7 sets out the requirements for the retail packaging of cigarette packets. The Bill specifies that cigarette packets must be a prescribed matt colour on the outside and inside, not have any decorative features, such as ridges or embossing, or coloured adhesives, and may not have any marks or trademarks other than a barcode or similar identification mark. Packets may not have anything inserted or affixed to them, apart from items prescribed by law. The colour and decorative feature provisions will not apply to the health warnings that must be printed on packaging or to other items prescribed by law. The Bill allows for the brand or company or business name and a variant name to be printed on the packet, but regulations will set the font type, size, colour and positioning of these. The wrapper must be transparent, not coloured, and must not have any decorative features, marks or trademarks, or affixed items apart from those provided for by law. It may have a tear-strip, which will be prescribed for in regulations. These provisions will apply to retail packaging of all cigarettes intended for retail sale in the State. This section also transposes provisions of the 2014 EU tobacco products directive which must be applied to those products for sale in the EU: namely, the cigarette packet must be cuboid in shape, although it may have rounded or bevelled edges; it must be made of carton or soft material; and may only have a flip-top or shoulder box hinged lid. Section 8 lays down the requirements for the appearance of cigarettes. These must be white, with a white or imitation cork tip. They may have a brand or business or company name and a variant name printed on them, but in accordance with regulations which will set the colour, font, size, positioning and appearance. It will be an offence to manufacture, import or sell non-compliant cigarettes. These provisions will apply to all cigarettes intended for retail sale in the State. Section 9 provides the specifications for the appearance of roll-your-own tobacco packets. These are similar to the requirements for retail packaging of cigarettes. These provisions will apply to retail packaging of all roll-your-own products intended for retail sale in the State. This section differs from section 7, however, in that it allows a unit package of roll-your-own tobacco to be either cuboid in shape - similar to a cigarette packet - or cylindrical, or in the form of a pouch. As before, these provisions were included as they transpose parts of the 2014 EU tobacco products directive and, therefore, must be applied to packaging of all cigarettes for sale in the EU. This section also sets out how the brand or business or company name and variant name is to be printed on different-shaped packs. They must be printed in a colour, font and size to be laid out in regulations. Section 10 provides specifications for the retail packaging of tobacco products other than roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes - for example, pipe tobacco and cigars. It contains the same features as sections 7 and 9 pertaining to colour, decorative features and so on, and allows for cuboid and other shaped packets. Section 11 deals with the linings of unit packets of tobacco products and provides that, where a lining is present, it shall be of a prescribed colour and material. Section 12 provides that the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content shall not be printed on any form of retail packaging of tobacco products. As this is, again, transposing part of the 2014 EU tobacco products directive, it applies to all tobacco products for sale in the EU. Section 13 deals with the general appearance of tobacco products and, again, transposes in part the 2014 EU tobacco products directive. As before, therefore, it must be applied to the packaging of all cigarettes for sale in the EU.It is an offence to manufacture, import or sell tobacco products that do not comply with section 13.  Section 14 prohibits sound effects and sense features that alter appearance after sale.  The third Part of the Bill sets out the offences, proceedings and penalties and covers sections 15 to 19, inclusive. Section 15 sets out the offences under the legislation. It will be an offence to package, manufacture, import or sell tobacco products that do not comply with section 7 or sections 9 to 14, inclusive. However, the Bill provides for a defence if a person can show the he or she made all reasonable efforts to comply with the legislation. Under section 16 there are three types of penalties for offences under the Act. For a first offence a person may be liable to a class B fine or six months imprisonment or both. For subsequent offences a person may be liable for a class A fine or 12 months imprisonment or both. On conviction on indictment a person may receive a fine, or eight years imprisonment or both. A person convicted of an offence may also be ordered to cover prosecution costs and expenses. Section 17 sets out provisions relating to offences committed by bodies corporate and their directors, managers or officers. Section 18 states that proceedings under the Act may be brought and prosecuted by the Health Service Executive.  Section 19 sets out provisions relating to evidence brought before proceedings. It states that tobacco products or packaging bearing the name or trademark of an importer or manufacturer will be used as evidence that the products were manufactured or imported or packaged by that person unless the contrary is proved.  Part 4 of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters. Section 20 amends section 5A of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts. The legislation will now provide that if a person registered to sell tobacco under section 37 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts is found guilty of an offensive under the current legislation he or she may be removed from the register for a specified period. Section 21 amends section 37 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts so that offences committed under the current legislation will be taken into account when a person applies to register to sell tobacco products.  Section 22 amends section 48 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts, as amended. Section 48 will now provide the Health Service Executive with the necessary powers to enforce the current legislation. This is a killer product. It kills some 5,200 Irish citizens and 700,000 European citizens every year. It will kill one in two of the children seduced by its packaging and gimmicks into taking up the killer habit. We cannot, must not and will not allow this to happen. I commend the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill 2014 to the House.
#MarkDaly	unknown-#MarkDaly-party	unknown-#MarkDaly-dob	unknown-#MarkDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	271	I welcome the Minister and thank him for introducing this Bill, which we support. As the Minister pointed out, some 5,200 people die as a result of tobacco products every year and this is equivalent to the population of Tipperary town. Some 22% of the Irish population is hooked on the drug and it costs taxpayers €500 million per year to deal with the health problems tobacco causes. The main question to ask is whether this Bill will work. Will plain packaging have the desired effect of helping move us towards a tobacco-free society? Australia is the country that implemented this measure most recently and tobacco consumption there has fallen by a third. In total, Australians have spent $1 billion less on tobacco since the introduction of plain packaging. Some 81% of smokers there said plain packaging would make them consider quitting and, as the Minister said, this means they are considering it more often than those using branded products. We must examine what the tobacco companies are doing as they perceive this measure to be a threat to their profits. Profit is their only motive. As the Minister pointed out, they are instigating a huge campaign around the world to rubbish the idea that plain packaging will have any effect in reducing tobacco consumption. Numerous red herrings have been used, including a supposed potential increase in smuggling and consequent loss to the taxpayer. They allege that plain packaging will make the activities of smugglers easier. However, as the Minister and Mr. Mike Daube have pointed out, the tobacco companies have lied for 50 years so why would they stop now? They will not stop lying but they will not stop lobbying either and this may be more worrying as we are used to lies but not so much to lobbying. In the US, prior to the hearings on Capitol Hill, the chief executive of Brown and Williamson, Thomas Sandefur, made the famous statement that he did not believe nicotine to be addictive. In fact, the people in question had evidence nicotine was addictive. The more nicotine in cigarettes the more addictive they are. It is hard to believe the chairman of Philip Morris, Geoffrey Bible, said he was unclear in his own mind whether anyone dies of cigarette smoking related diseases when his own company's research showed it caused the death of millions of Americans. This suggests that whatever lobbying and research is carried out by tobacco companies they will continue to perpetuate lies. Any lobbying by tobacco companies and their public relations firms should be taken with a grain of salt. The ban on smoking in the workplace has had a very positive effect on people's health, especially those employed in the service industry in bars, restaurants and so on. It is hard to imagine someone lighting a cigarette on an aeroplane or entering a public building clouded in a haze of smoke. This is all thanks to the Government and the health industry slowly pushing back against the tobacco industry. I support this Bill. It may require technical amendments but it is welcome. It will be attacked by the extremely wealthy tobacco industry but we must fight for the greater good. We must think of the 5,200 people that die as a result of tobacco products every year. More important, children targeted by the tobacco industry take up smoking in Ireland at a younger age than in any other European country. We are fighting for the health and well-being of the children of this State and it is a cause worth fighting for.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	272	The introduction of this Bill is welcome and long overdue. The Minister has already outlined the difficulties faced in this country and, along with my colleague, Senator Daly, pointed out that tobacco kills some 5,200 Irish citizens and 700,000 European citizens every year. It is amazing that these figures neither deter people from starting smoking nor encourage them to stop. The death of 5,200 people per year translates to 100 deaths per week and this is a lot of people. Yet some young people are still attracted to smoking and become addicted at a young age. We must address the issue of the number of young people who are smoking and ensure the information is circulated so that the number falls. Not long ago three out of ten people were smokers but more recent figures show this has fallen to 2.2 out of ten. There is still a long way to go. Much progress has been made with young people and the introduction of this legislation is very welcome. In the early 1960s the surgeon general in the US identified the clear connection between smoking and cancer.Yet, 50 years on, the product is still for sale and people willingly spend a substantial amount of money on it every day of the week. Much research has been done over the years and the direct connection between smoking and the various health issues that arise from it is unchallenged. Not long ago, major film stars advertised that the only way to be popular was to smoke a particular product. It took a substantial time before we were able to restrict advertising and move forward, and this is another major step in taking on the challenge of the tobacco industry. It has been argued that introducing standard packaging will increase smuggling, but let us face that challenge if it arises. Smuggling and the illegal importation of cigarettes happens and the Garda and customs officials have a major challenge on their hands but are being very proactive in dealing with it. It is important that we all assist them by ensuring that any information we or the public have is made available to them to reduce smuggling and the trade in illegally imported cigarettes. We all have a part to play in that. It is not just about the tax revenue but about health. I have raised the issue that there is nothing in the legislation to prevent the production of holders for cigarette packets. We need to keep a watchful eye on it because people will be only too willing to produce these holders that will cover the negative message highlighting the dangers of smoking which we want to give out through the packaging. I welcome the legislation and it is important that we enact it. There is a three-year time period, up to 2017, for the full enforcement of the provisions in the Bill. Although there is a likelihood of legal challenges if we enforce it too quickly, it is a substantial time period and I wonder if it can be brought forward. Because it is a health issue, we should re-examine the timeframe. Overall, I welcome the Bill. It is the right step forward and will make a substantial contribution over the coming years to reducing the number of people whose health is adversely affected by smoking.

As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children I had an opportunity to participate in an excellent series of hearings on the heads of the Bill, and I thank Deputy Buttimer for his chairing of those hearings. We heard from a wide range of witnesses, including health experts, advocacy groups, children's rights organisations, legal representatives, and representatives of the business and retail sectors and the tobacco industry. In preparing for each of these hearings I studied the submissions and presentations, and I will share with my colleagues the experiences I had of sentences repeatedly jumping off the pages of a number of submissions. The footsteps of the tobacco industry over certain submissions were clearly evident. Submissions cited many reports, such as the KPMG Star report, the Transcrime Factbook on Illicit Trade in Tobacco Product, LECG, the report on the impact of plain packaging of cigarettes in Australia, and the SKIM report on the impact of plain packaging on the illicit trade in the UK. All of those reports were commissioned by the tobacco industry.

#JillianVanTurnhout	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-party	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-dob	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	275	I read the reports. I also read the Roland Bergen report, which is often cited. Surprise, surprise - it was commissioned and funded by the tobacco industry. I studied it very carefully because it said we would have job losses if we introduced the legislation, and we are all concerned about job losses. The figures are based on estimates rather than evidence. The Australian data comes from the trade and not from official figures. The report drew from other reports, the ones I have already mentioned that were funded by the tobacco industry. Therefore, I urge my colleagues, when evidence is put before them, to ask who funded it and what research it is drawn from. Senator Colm Burke mentioned the warnings on health hazards from the US Surgeon General 50 years ago. The report of the US Surgeon General released in January 2014 shows that cigarette smoking is even more hazardous than previously thought. The report documents that, by a wide margin, smoking causes even more diseases, kills even more people and costs the nation even more in medical bills and other economic losses than has previously been reported. As we heard during the hearings, tobacco is the only product that kills when used as intended. My colleagues have talked about the number of people who die of smoking-related diseases each year. We heard very compelling testimony from Dr. Finbarr O'Connell, who stated that 95% of lung cancer cases in Ireland are directly related to tobacco. Everybody can think of somebody they know who has had lung cancer. Consequently, that startling figure brought home to me the realisation that it is within our grasp to improve people's health. My colleague, Senator Crown, will be able to give more information on the health aspects. As the Minister said, in Ireland tobacco companies need 50 people a day to take up smoking in order to replace those quitting or dying. Given that research shows that 78% of people start before the age of 18, the target is 39 children every day. At the committee hearings the tobacco industry representatives told us it does not aim products at children. I clearly told them that either they are getting the marketing wrong or they are targeting children, because that is way past any margin of error. If anybody heard of a polling company that had a 78% margin of error, we would question its figures. Irish people begin smoking at an earlier age than in other European countries. Let us be clear that the tobacco industry’s biggest growth market is children. At the hearings we heard very clear support from children and children's rights organisations for the legislation. The warnings about smuggling are scaremongering. At the hearings we heard from representatives of the Garda, who cited the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, the Revenue Commissioners and Customs and Excise. They stated that there is no evidence to indicate that the introduction of plain packaging will lead to an increase in the illicit trade of tobacco products. The only independent research on smuggling rates in Ireland has been carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the HSE's national tobacco control office. It shows a smuggling rate of 13% in Ireland, which would alarm one until one examined it. One percent of this involves "illicit whites", cigarettes that are produced illegally but are not counterfeit.Some 1% is counterfeit and 11% of the product is from legal industry. Of that 13%, 11% comes from the industry. It is clear from evidence given in 2002 before the United Kingdom Committee of Public Accounts by ASH UK that exports of tobacco to Andorra, for example, increased from 13 million in 1993 to 1,520 million in 1997. To put it simply, the amount of cigarettes being supplied to Andorra in 1997 meant that every man, woman and child would need to smoke 130 cigarettes a day, every day. They oversupply certain countries in order to supply other countries. That is absolutely clear. Last October, the Rt. Hon. Margaret Hodge appeared before the UK Committee of Public Accounts and stated that the supply of some brands of hand-rolling tobacco to some countries in 2011 exceeded legitimate demand by 240%. The evidence is there for us to see. In November 2013, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said in the Dáil, "I have a suspicion that the legitimate trade is involved in the production of illicit cigarettes". We need to be careful in this debate that we throw around the word "illicit". I believe the tobacco companies are fuelling this market. It must be remembered that of 13%, 11% is from legal product. The words "smuggling" or "counterfeit" are to make us all feel worried and they are to disarm us, but we need to make sure that we say clearly that these figures cannot be substantiated. It is in the interest of the period in which we are debating the Bill that the tobacco industry will be able to point to smuggling and job losses. We will have all that scaremongering. They themselves are fuelling this market. The only criticism I have of the Bill is that it is not taking effect soon enough and, in particular, the transitionary measures. Australia used two months as a wash-through period for retailers to exchange the cigarette products. From the time the Bill is enacted, the Minister is allowing 12 months for it to go through the system. I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to reduce that period to three months. Three months is ample time, given the lead-in time that will be available. The Minister has my unequivocal support. Clearly, this is a children's rights issue. In supporting this Bill we are protecting our children and young people from taking up smoking. We do not need any more reports to tell us how much smoking kills. The evidence is there. I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House.
#JohnGilroy	unknown-#JohnGilroy-party	unknown-#JohnGilroy-dob	unknown-#JohnGilroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	276	I welcome the Minister. It is appropriate that the Minister has introduced the Bill in the Seanad on the same day that we concluded legislation to prohibit the use of sunbeds to those under the age of 18 years. Those are two pieces of legislation which undoubtedly will save many lives into the future. His introductory comments where he quotes senior members of the tobacco industry, as recently as ten years ago, who blatantly deny the great harm that tobacco does are worth noting. They point to the lengths to which the industry will go to protect its profits. Truthfulness or integrity does not enter into it where profits of such large proportions are being made. Some 50 new smokers are required every day to maintain the current customer base and one third of those customers are required to replace customers who have died by the use of it. That is worth reflecting on. Senator Jillian van Turnhout has pointed to the fact that tobacco is the only product we know of where its intentional and stated use is to shorten one's life and kill one prematurely. We know that children under 18 years of age are the most likely cohort to target to replace customers who have died. It is the same cohort that is most amenable to advertising. It makes perfect sense that we should do everything possible to reduce the number of children who start smoking. The Minister said that 76% of people start to smoke before the age of 18 years. We have a good history in Ireland with regard to pioneering legislation when it comes to harmful products. We can point to the Minister's predecessor who was responsible for banning smoking in the workplace. At the time the industry issued all kinds of dire warnings and said the sky would fall in on our heads if this was done. We did it and life just carried on very much the same as before. The industry raised hares that were not accurate in its efforts to maintain market share. The tobacco industry is acting a little more insidiously this time, rather than directly confronting the Minister and the Department. This time, it is raising red herrings and things that are not directly affected. On the issue of smuggling, I would point to Andorra as Senator van Turnhout has done. The industry does not care where the tax is being paid. The differential in prices is what makes it worth smugglers' time doing it. The industry receives a profit from Andorra and places where low taxes apply. That they are subsequently shipped across borders illegally is of no concern to the industry but it is a matter of great concern to us. Smuggling is the great red herring that is being raised.  I have heard it stated many times that the Bill will not work. On TV3 the Minister gave an interview in which he said he was confronted with the argument that there was no evidence that this will work. Other arguments put forward suggest that if one is serious about doing anything about reducing tobacco consumption, one should do something else. Those who say that singularly fail to point out what the "something else" might be. There are many reasons the tobacco industry can put forward such as, there are other things in society that are more harmful than cigarettes. The point has been made about sunbeds that if one was serious about preventing cancer, one would ban sunbeds. At least we did that. That is one argument that can no longer be made to us. The evidence is contained in this and 76 reports and reviews and in Australia where the demonstrable effects or benefits are there for all to see.  I commend the Minister on his work in this and many other areas. He has been a pioneering and reforming Minister in this area. Let us do it.
#JohnCrown	unknown-#JohnCrown-party	unknown-#JohnCrown-dob	unknown-#JohnCrown-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	277	I welcome the Minister. This is a very good day for him. I laud his efforts in public health and I think he will be remembered for the good work he has done on these two Bills, among other aspects of his good work. Some 5,000 per year is the figure. Let us put a perspective on that. This is a little country of 4.5 million people and we lose 5,000 people per year from smoking. We are all aware of the appropriate level of national introspection the US has had over the loss of its young military men and women in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, wars it has collectively referred to as the "war on terror". In ten years, the US has lost approximately the same number of people as we lose every year from smoking. That is a country of roughly 80 times our population. Therefore, it puts a perspective on the scale of the loss. Everybody has to die. Some of the folks who die from smoking are old folks who may get other illnesses within a few years in any case but many deaths are from preventable causes. Many of them, by definition, are premature causes of death. This sets the context. We are in a war against terror, the terror of the tobacco industry. We are and should be implacable and irreconcilable foes. There is nothing they want that we do not want to oppose. There is no partnership, no meeting of minds, no common ground. The fundamental core of what they want to do is opposed to what we, as thinking members of society charged with the well-being of the public, want to do. They want people to smoke whereas we want them to stop. There is no common ground. We must be blunt about this. The lack of common ground extends all the way down the tobacco chain. What do we want for the tobacco companies? The answer is bankruptcy. We want them gone. We want them out of business. If they do not have the wisdom and the good judgment to reinvest their financial and capital assets into other areas we would prefer if every one of them went out of business tomorrow. If collectively the entire world had a colossal burst of messianic insight tomorrow and stopped smoking and not one more cigarette was sold tomorrow and all that tax revenue and all those jobs disappeared and all people had to find other employment, it would be better for the world. It would be better for everybody if that happened. None of us is trying to protect any part of this industry. We want it gone. We want the retailers on the corners to sell something else. I cannot make this happen, but as a backbencher I would love to bring in legislation which would allow the Government to give financial incentives to shops that declare themselves to be ethical, tobacco-free businesses or I would like to ensure that shops, pubs, hotels, restaurants and whole shopping centres that would declare they would sell nothing that contains tobacco on their premises would have a lower rate of VAT on everything they sell, be it jeans, food, clothes, pharmaceuticals or whatever. I would like to be able to do that, but we cannot. I am trying to get money for research in order to look at a very interesting area of cancer biology, heterogeneity diversity, which is the amazing ability tumour cells have to keep mutating or this bad trick they can do to stay ahead of our smart bomb treatments by their ability to mutate and change their genotype. This research would look at ways of linking this to what causes cancer. I have been advised by some of the smart cancer scientists with whom I work that we should exclude tobacco from the equation altogether, because the mesmeric, breath-taking list of things in one puff of cigarette smoke which cause cancer is so complicated that it is almost impossible to study it or to make any kind of sense of it. In addition, its ability to induce that kind of genetic instability, at the earliest stage in the cancer process, may be unique, in comparison with other things which cause cancer. With tobacco, we know we are dealing with a phenomenally bad product which is sold by phenomenally bad people and bought by people because they are addicts. Rational people do not act against their self-interest, but addicts do. This is why people who overwhelmingly know tobacco is bad for them, continue to smoke. This brings me to this plain packaging legislation. It is extraordinary how this coalition has emerged - the coalition of the tobacco companies and their various front organisations. Looking out the window of this Chamber, I can see the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, which some months ago unknowingly and unwittingly ended up hosting an indirectly tobacco company funded symposium on how to stop smoking. This was sponsored by an organisation called the Institute of Economic Affairs, which I believe is a paid gunman for the tobacco industry, and by local PR companies such as Red Flag. This tells us something about the lengths tobacco companies will go to try to stop the Minister in his tracks. Why is this? They say plain packaging does not work and there is no evidence that it will make any difference. If it does not make any difference, why are they investing so many millions of euro into lobbying, PR and, probably, bribes at European level, to try to thwart the attempt to get the legislation passed? It is because they know it does work. They would have us believe that it is because they are trying to block smuggling. Those of us who watched the World Cup every night this week, soccer fans like me who worshipped Bill O'Herlihy for years, are sad now to see him and know that he organised a meeting of leading tobacco company executives with members of the Government to try to persuade everybody that their concern was smuggling. We know the tobacco companies love smuggling. Most of the product smuggled is product they sell. Our primary means of controlling their activity is through our tax laws. Smuggling is a way for them to outsmart our tax laws. Smuggling is a weapon they use against us. It is important to realise this is a war. Anything the tobacco companies oppose, we propose. Anything they propose, we oppose. They are our implacable foes and we want them gone. We would like to offer them the olive branch of asking them to do something else, but if they do not, we would prefer to see them on the bread line. That is what we want for these companies, because they are making their money out of the misery they inflict on our fellow citizens. I believe the Minister will be in the firing line on this, but no better man. As he has been forged in the steel of various firing lines over the past several years, I believe he will be able to bat these puny challenges aside. However, it is critical we look at the international context in terms of what these companies are capable of doing. Why did Ukraine take a World Trade Organization case against Australia over plain packaging? It is widely recognised that some tobacco interests got to the Ukrainians and persuaded them this is something they should do. Why did the world tobacco organisations gang up on little Uruguay, the GDP of which is less than the revenues of Philip Morris International? Thankfully, Mayor Bloomberg came to Uruguay's defence and provided a legal defence fund which enabled it to try to deal with the problem. This is a call to war and we will support the Minister in his declaration on it. I will put forward some amendments to the Bill, because like my colleagues I see no reason we cannot do this tomorrow. I have looked at the data from Australia and am convinced this initiative will result in some decrease in the number of people who smoke. Sometimes people will be put off by the plain packaging, but this is another opportunity for us and the Minister to get the debate on smoking going. Every time the debate becomes public, more people think about the effects of smoking and are motivated to stop. The plain packaging has one other spin-off benefit. If it hurts the companies, that is a good enough reason to do it.

I welcome the Minister. I wish to endorse everything that has been said. This Bill is probably as significant, in terms of the impact it will have on the general health of the population, as that of the former Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, which introduced the smoking ban and hopefully that legacy will remain for all time and the Minister will be remembered for it. Much comment has been made on the Australian experience. I agree the three-year period seems long and will support amendments to reduce it. In the context of the significance of packaging, a study in France which monitored the eye movements of people when shown a plain pack of cigarettes and a branded pack showed that people spent longer looking at the health warnings on plain packs. In Canada, research has shown that people remember health warnings better from plain packs than from branded packs. Plain packaging eliminates the last great marketing tool for the tobacco industry, which is why the industry is fighting a rearguard action as has been pointed out by Senator Crown and others. The Minister has commented on what standardised packaging will do in the context of the impact on smokers. Currently, cigarette companies use design-heavy packaging and colours, imagery and design are used to attract smokers and reduce the impact of on-pack health warnings. In 2010, a trade magazine tobacco reporter ran a series of articles on the importance of packaging to the industry's business. This stated: In many countries, the cigarette pack is now the only remaining avenue of communication with smokers. This development is challenging packaging suppliers to be creative.The extensive legal challenges to standardised packaging in Australia show how effective the tobacco industry expected standardised packaging to be at reducing the take-up of smoking among young people.  Due to the short time available for my contribution, I just wish to endorse everything that has been said. I will conclude with an anecdote in the context of people's perception on smoking. The late Nat King Cole, who died of lung cancer, smoked what he believed to be a product that helped to give timbre to his voice, so he smoked menthol cigarettes. That was then, but some people still believe that different cigarettes may be less harmful. This legislation will ensure we now have a level playing field. The tobacco industry must now shape up or ship out. I agree with Senator Crown that this is a war we must win.  I agree with the comments made by Senator Burke in regard to cigarette holders. This is something the legislation should examine. The tobacco industry is not only ingenious and vile, it is a creative industry and it will fight tooth and nail to ensure it keeps its share of the market. Therefore, anything that in any way helps that cause should be stopped in its tracks.

I congratulate the Minister on bringing forth both pieces of legislation. It is disheartening to hear that the average smoker began smoking at around 16 years of age. The health consequences of that throughout a person's life are horrendous. It was mentioned that 5,200 people die as a result of smoking. Many other people are also affected, including relatives, friends and others who often suffer respiratory illness and poor health as a result of second-hand smoke. In addition to those who lose their lives there are knock-on consequences for many others.  This legislation is a major step in the right direction. I do not believe that the Government, the Minister or the Irish people should be bullied by the tobacco industry. In terms of my use of the word "bullied", I believe that is what the tobacco industry is doing. I agree with Senator van Turnhout that the smuggling issue is a red herring being floated by the industry. I contributed to the previous debate in this House on cigarette smoking, following which I received a request from representatives of the industry to meet with me to discuss some of my commentary. I met with them but the only item on the agenda was the smuggling issue, which is being fed by the industry because it produces the cigarettes. While some of the smuggled cigarettes are produced in factories which are not regulated, the vast majority of them are made in regulated factories. In terms of the smuggling issue, the industry is flying a red herring. The Minister might when responding indicate whether European approval is required before this legislation can be implemented. I agree with Senators van Turnhout, Mooney and others that the sooner this legislation is implemented the better. The lead-in period should be only two or three months. I again congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation. It is not often Members on this side of the House praise Ministers. However, today we praise the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.

It gives us the opportunity to again focus on the enormous damage tobacco smoking does to the health of people and the huge cost to society of tobacco smoking. It also provides us with an opportunity to address the ongoing campaign to reduce and, hopefully, eventually eliminate this practice, creating a smoke free society. There will always be a remnant of smoking among a small minority but for maximum effect the aim has to be a smoke-free society in Ireland. Much progress has been made. Measures undertaken by successive Governments and the campaigning work of the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, ASH Ireland and others have greatly reduced the number of people smoking and have unquestionably hugely improved public health. A combination of public education and pricing measures has ensured the reduction in the number of people who smoke. It is still a startling statistic that just under 25% of the population in Ireland are smokers. The number of young people taking up smoking and becoming addicted at an early age must be continually addressed. It is estimated that smoking causes well over 5,000 deaths each year, mainly as a result of conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and emphysema. Almost one third of cancer deaths and 90% of lung cancers in Ireland are attributed to smoking. The cost to society in human and financial terms is enormous. One estimate of the cost to the State in health service provision in a single year is €1 billion, approximately one third of which goes on hospital admissions. It is estimated that if smoking continues to increase at the current rate it will be the single biggest cause of death worldwide before the middle of this century. This is because the tobacco industry’s greatest area of expansion is developing countries that have not yet put in place the preventive measures that have been provided for in developed countries such as Ireland. The tobacco industry is an industry of death and it is exploiting the most disadvantaged people on our planet. However, there are still people who lobby on its behalf, including in this country, happy to benefit from the enormous profits reaped by these multinational drug pushers. It has been rightly said that if the tobacco drug was first developed in our time it would never have been authorised for sale and would have been banned outright. That is not an argument for a ban on smoking, as prohibition would be unworkable and would merely drive it underground, thus benefitting organised crime. However, the point does underline the lethal nature of this drug. In terms of legislation, the ban on smoking in enclosed workplaces has been a huge success. As well as improving the health of workers and those visiting premises, the knock-on effect of making smoking less socially acceptable has been profound. It is now common for people who smoke, especially those with children, to do so only outside their homes. This Bill provides for plain, standard packaging for tobacco products and as such is a welcome addition to the legislative framework. It will not, of itself, I believe, lead to a dramatic reduction in consumption but it has to be seen as another element in the campaign to reduce smoking.  The tobacco industry spends enormous sums on product design and presentation. It is also opposed to legislation of this type, which is reason enough to support it. Guím gach rath ar an reachtaíocht seo agus tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh sé chun cinn chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.

It is symbolic that on the day we debated in this House legislation governing the use of sunbeds, we do not need them in Ireland. The Minister is now, in terms of the legislation currently before us, proving we do not need tobacco either. I hope this is a double triumph for the Minister. On 10 June, the British Medical Journal contained an article in the name of 600 specialists in the United Kingdom which was in favour of measures such as those in the legislation the Minister is proposing today. An article in today's edition of the British Medical Journal in the name of 100 of those specialists relates to the dangers of e-cigarettes. I have no doubt that overwhelmingly the evidence supports what the Minister is proposing here today. I wish him every success in that regard. I note the ingenuity of the tobacco industry in having strawberry and bubble gum flavours added to the nicotine in e-cigarettes. The Minister will be aware that e-cigarettes are due for categorisation by the World Health Organization in October under the general controls on tobacco. I wish him well in that endeavour. I often pass the Player Wills building on the South Circular Road, which is derelict. It was previously a major centre of the tobacco industry but is no more. I hope, too, that that is symbolic of what we are trying to do. As we move towards becoming a smoke-free society, we should no longer permit cigarettes to be sold in food shops, petrol stations or duty-free shops. That is not the type of introduction we want for people coming to our country. In addition, EU subsidies to the tobacco industry should be abolished.  Like other Senators, I propose to table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. Section 12 provides that tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content shall not be printed on the unit package. I would put the alternative proposition that that information be included on the package so that people can see how damaging the product is. I will discuss the matter further with the Minister on Committee Stage.  In the UK, there is support for what the Minister is proposing today in terms of the Chantler report. As I understand it, the issue is currently being considered by the British Minister with responsibility for public health, who is supported by the Labour Party shadow Minister. Many tactics are being used against what is being proposed. I will like to deal briefly with two of them. On the claim that the legislation infringes people's intellectual property rights, it does not. Only the wrapping is being changed. It will still be possible to produce this type of poisonous product and to derive profits from doing so. A change to the wrapping is not an infringement of intellectual property rights. I am sure the tobacco firms will bring a legal case against the Minister in that regard. On the claim that what is proposed interferes in the free trade of the European Common Market, that is not true. It will still be possible to export these products. I recommend nobody consume them. The only change is to the packaging. From now on the packaging will be plain but the product remains exportable. I am sure the tobacco industry will be hiring the best brains in the Law Library to take a case against the Minister. I may also table amendments to provide that neither the right to engage in free trade nor one's intellectual property rights are infringed by plain wrapping. I wish the Minister the best of luck with this legislation.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	284	I applaud and support the Minister in his efforts in this regard. In my view, the tobacco industry is evil. People say it is a bad industry but I believe it is an evil industry second only, in my opinion, to the abortion industry in that abortion directly targets the life of the baby while in this instance the lives of people are being directly targeted. Some 50% of people who smoke will die from a tobacco related illness. This is an industry which for many decades has been well aware of the risks and dangers of tobacco. As has been said, it has continued to exploit people, particularly poor people, across the world who through marketing and advertising became addicted to this product. As a consequence, many of them have lost their lives. The Minister should not allow himself to deviate from his intention as a result of propaganda arising from the tobacco industry. It will happen. Smuggling was mentioned. Yesterday I was in Belfast to attend a hearing of the sovereign committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and heard that there has been an increase in smuggling in Australia since the introduction of these packets. I do not know whether that is true; it may well be propaganda. However, the Minister should look at the packaging to see what can be done to counterfeit-proof it, in so far as he can, and the industry should be made pay for the initiative. We provide that extra security for currency and other things. There must be some way for us to add something to the package that will make it very difficult for anybody involved in illicit activities to tamper with them.  Finally, the Minister might consider - whether as a next step or as part of this Bill - a requirement for the tobacco industry to enclose within cigarette packages some sort of information leaflet which would detail every single chemical ingredient in the cigarettes, and outline the risks and effects that each ingredient will have on the health of an individual who uses the product. We do that with medication, with the co-operation of the pharmaceutical industry. The risks and effects are clearly set out and attached to medication and we could do the same for tobacco products. The tobacco industry uses a wide variety of chemicals and we could make it a very strongly punishable offence not to name every ingredient. The tobacco industry needs to be taken on, and taken on strongly, and the Minister has the full support of this House in doing so. It is great to see that the House is unanimous on this live issue, and I wish we had had such unanimity in the past. We have it now, so we should harness it and back the Minister in what he is doing.

As I have said elsewhere, it is political, it is professional and it is personal. I thank all the Senators for their very supportive views and comments this evening. I also thank and acknowledge the Irish Cancer Society, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Asthma Society of Ireland, the organisation dealing with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ASH Ireland and many others for their support. Let us remember why we are here this evening. Ireland has been to the fore, as others have said, with tobacco control measures. We can be proud that the measures we have introduced to date are working. There has been a decrease in the number of people smoking. In 1998 the percentage of people smoking was 33%, but the most recent figures we have indicate that 21.5% of Irish adults now smoke, and data on school-aged children also indicates a clear downward trend. However, we cannot be complacent. To achieve the target set out in Tobacco Free Ireland, a lot of work needs to be undertaken. This includes the ongoing development of educational initiatives, media campaigns and cessation services. It also includes further legislative initiatives such as the smoking in cars legislation, developed by Senators of this House, which I hope to initiate in the Dáil in the very near future. It is important that we de-normalise smoking and educate parents as well. There is nothing more conflicting and confusing for a child than to learn in school, from a teacher he or she trusts, that cigarettes kill, only to get a contradictory message when he or she goes home and sees a parent or parents smoking.

It will also de-normalise how society views tobacco and smoking. We are not alone in pursuing standardised packaging. As people have said, Australia has introduced standardised packaging; the UK will consult in the near future on the introduction of legislation in this area; and New Zealand has started the legislative process for standardised packaging. The initiative is steadily being embraced globally. There is a wealth of evidence to support the introduction of standardised packaging. In preparing the legislation, my Department commissioned an international expert in the field, Professor David Hammond, to carry out an evidence review on standardised packaging of tobacco products. The review unequivocally found that tobacco packaging is a critically important form of tobacco promotion, particularly in countries such as Ireland which have comprehensive advertising and marketing restrictions. The review outlined the strong evidence base in existence for the initiative. A legal challenge by the tobacco industry cannot be ruled out, and I say that with tongue in cheek because it is inevitable as far I am concerned. However, I am confident that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and, importantly, is a proportionate and justified measure. The threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to our making progress on public health policies. We must press on with our mission to make Ireland tobacco-free. Ireland is a small country, like Uruguay, so the tobacco industry thinks it can bully us and influence public health policy. It will not do that, especially when it comes to the life of our children. Many other countries are watching us and holding back to see how Ireland gets on. The tobacco industry operates by intimidating one country, thus intimidating other countries by proxy. That ploy will not succeed, as the Members of this House have shown their unanimous support, and I am sure we will have tremendous support in the other House as well. Also, to comply with our European and international obligations, the Bill has been notified to the EU and the World Trade Organization.  In response to one of the few issues that were raised, smuggling will be unaffected, according to the Revenue Commissioners. A classic ploy by the tobacco industry is to pivot away from the real issue. It kills one out of every two customers it creates by getting them addicted to its products, and talks about something else like smuggling in order to sanitise the situation. The time period for implementation is three years, and there are reasons for that which we can go into at a later date. People have talked about job losses here and we have talked about it in the European Parliament. It should never be a case of job losses versus loss of life, because it is totally in a different league.  Senator Crown made a lot of points about the industry and said we were in a war. It does resemble a war, because people die in wars and people are dying in this war. Our citizens are dying and our European friends are dying as well. Therefore, we must protect children and remind adult citizens that what they are doing harms their health.

With regard to stating the carbon monoxide and tar content of cigarettes on packages, the reason it is not allowed is part of the EU directive and the rationale behind the policy is that it allows the industry to pretend that one cigarette is less harmful and better for one's health than another type. However, they all kill, and that is the point we are trying to get across.  Counterfeit products were mentioned. I can assure the Senators that the packets are counterfeit-proof. They will be more counterfeit-proof now because they will have a tax stamp.  In closing, I wish to express my gratitude again to the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, and members of his committee. The public hearings held by the committee in February informed the composition of the Bill. I thank the committee for its invaluable contribution to the issue and for the assistance it provided to me and my officials. I also thank my Cabinet colleagues for their support on this initiative. We have some heavy hitters from abroad leaning on the Government. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to working closely with my colleagues in the Seanad as we discuss the legislation in the House. I thank Senators again for their support.

It has been brought to my attention by a patient using the drug on a trial basis with positive effects that it is not covered by the GMS or drugs payment scheme. The patient's consultant, Dr. Brian Sweeney in Cork, has recommended that she continue using the drug, but it is costing her approximately €250 per month. She does not qualify for a refund and the expense is causing her problems. The advantage of the drug is that it improves mobility and reduces fatigue, although it does not work for everyone. That said, it works for a large number of patients and many consultants have recommended its use. It is recognised in many other European countries and I ask the Minister to consider recognising it here, too, in the GMS, the long-term illness scheme and the drugs payment scheme.

I actually dealt with this issue earlier today but thank Senator Colm Burke for raising it in this House. The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The executive received an application for the inclusion of fampridine or Fampyra in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, conducted a pharmaco-economic evaluation of fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness in the Irish health care setting, it was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website. The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. In these circumstances, the HSE has not approved the reimbursement of fampridine under the community drug schemes.  I understand studies are ongoing to assess the wider impact of fampridine on both walking and quality of life for persons diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The results of these studies will contribute to the evidence base demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of fampridine which can be used to support future applications for its inclusion in the lists of reimbursable items supplied under the community drug schemes. In this context, it is open to the manufacturer, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of fampridine in the community drug schemes. The manufacturer has indicated to the HSE that it intends to submit a revised application for fampridine and it is my understanding the company may actually have done so this morning. The HSE and I fully understand patients are very anxious that this product be made available under the community drug schemes. Therefore, the HSE will reconsider the application on receipt, in line with the agreed procedures and timescales for the assessment of new medicines, in order that the matter will be addressed and dealt with as quickly as possible.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	360	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. I fully understand the position of the HSE and the Department on this issue and accept that pricing is important in the context of drugs being accepted for inclusion in the community drug schemes. In this case the drug has already received approval in a number of other European countries and evidence to support its effectiveness is available, although I am open to correction on this. The patient to whom I referred is responding well to the drug and experiencing obvious beneficial effects, particularly a reduction in fatigue. She contacted me because the drug was proving so successful. She will probably continue to use it, but because it has not received HSE and departmental approval, she will have to fund the treatment herself.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	361	This particular drug costs approximately €6,000 per year. As I understand it, many of the people who are using it are being supplied by the manufacturer on a trial basis. Approximately 7,000 people in this country have multiple sclerosis, which would equate to a bill of €42 million per annum. Fampridine does not work in all cases - far from it. It is estimated that it will only be effective for 20% to 25% of multiple sclerosis sufferers. Admittedly, for those patients for whom it does work, the effects can be dramatic, with the ability to carry out the activities of daily living greatly improved to the point where they can go to work and lead a much more normal life. We would dearly love to be able to provide the drug for them, but we cannot do so at its current costing. We have a limited pot of money available and €42 million would be an enormous sum to take out of it. What other items would we sacrifice to do this? The price of the drug must be more realistic. I call on the pharmaceutical industry, as I did earlier in Dáil Éireann, to enter into risk sharing with the Government, on behalf of the taxpayer, for whom we are trying to provide services and medication. There is no risk sharing. For example, there is no arrangement whereby we could agree and pay a certain price for those patients for whom the drug is working. In the first instance, we must demonstrate that the drug works, as it clearly does for some. We also need to have a sense of the type of patient for whom it is likely to work and limit its prescribing to such patients.Subsequently, we would like to enter into a risk-sharing agreement with the drugs companies that reflects, in a more realistic and affordable way, the cost of medications that we want to make available to our people.  The pharmaceutical industry is hugely important to this country, employing tens of thousands of people directly and more than 100,000 indirectly. We are very proud of that industry and supportive of research and innovation to develop new drugs. However, all parties, including policy makers, physicians, patients and drug companies must accept that there is a limited pot of money and if we take a large amount out for one area, that means other areas will suffer. Unfortunately, unlike the United States of America, we cannot engage in printing money or "quantitative easing" as they call it.
#JohnCrown	unknown-#JohnCrown-party	unknown-#JohnCrown-dob	unknown-#JohnCrown-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	362	One of the saddest things I can recall is seeing my own father recovering from one cerebrovascular accident but making a poor recovery from a second one which took his life many years ago. During the recovery phase after his first stroke he was blessed in that he had wonderful sisters, Florrie, Doreen and Betty, who really took him on board as a project and rehabilitated him. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge their wonderful memory. All of them have sadly passed away. We have 30,000 stroke survivors in our republic. Ireland's national audit of stroke care in 2007 identified rather substantial deficits in the services available to those who survived acute stroke. The main deficits were in the areas of discharge planning, rehabilitation and secondary prevention. There were also many criticisms of communication with both patients and their families in the context of services that were in place. In response, a group of investigators from the Royal College of Surgeons, led by Frances Horgan, Mary Walsh, Chris Macey and Cliona Loughnane performed a national survey of stroke survivorship in 2013 on 200 patients. They found very substantial physical, emotional and psychological problems in the survivors of this dreaded medical catastrophe. Fully 83% of those surveyed had severe mobility problems. In roughly equal proportions, others had fatigue, arm problems, memory problems, unsteadiness leading to falls, emotional problems, concentration difficulties and sphincter problems. Around half of those surveyed said they felt that their problems had not been addressed and that appropriate help was not available to them.  The Minister for Health has an excellent track record in terms of attention given to acute stroke treatment, stroke units and so forth. I ask him to look to the next stage, which is the development of early supported discharge programmes such as those piloted by the Mater Hospital. Can we look at rolling out plans like that nationwide? Can we also look at the implementation plan in respect of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland 2011 to 2015? Given his interest in community-based care, I ask that the Minister devotes his attention and skills to improving the community-based rehabilitation services. Specifically, I ask him to outline the time lines for the implementation of the excellent recommendations of the national policy and strategy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	363	I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity in Seanad Éireann to speak on the subject of rehabilitation services for stroke survivors and neuro-rehabilitation services. Since the publication in 2010 of the national cardiovascular health policy, significant improvements have been made with regard to access to acute treatments for coronary heart disease as well as the development of stroke units across the country. New and existing stroke units have been provided with additional therapy, nursing and consultant posts. Thrombolysis is now available to acute hospitals admitting stroke patients, 9.5% of whom are being thrombolysed, which compares extremely well with the best European figures. Senator Crown is aware that no less a man than Don Berwick, President Obama's main health adviser, made special mention of the stroke programme here and what can be achieved in a country in pretty dire financial constraints. We have gone from the bottom of the league in Europe to the top in terms of thrombolysis and patient care. All hospitals which accept stroke patients now have stroke units which has improved outcomes hugely. The stroke programme estimates that the number of people with enduring disabilities as a result of stroke has decreased as the percentage of patients with stroke discharged from acute hospitals to nursing homes has dropped from 17.3% in 2009 to 14.5% in 2012. The percentage of patients discharged directly home has increased from 49.4% in 2009 to 51.1% in 2012. The stroke foundation education programme developed by the stroke programme is leading to improved patient experience of stroke service provision. Patients requiring more intensive rehabilitation are referred to the nearest available rehabilitation service. The establishment of managed clinical rehabilitation networks for neurological and prosthetic rehabilitation services in each of the four HSE regions contributes to rehabilitation services. The National Rehabilitation Hospital provides specialist stroke rehabilitation as a national hub and links in with regional services. There are plans for a hub and spoke development across the country.  The Department of Health's national policy and strategy for the provision of neuro-rehabilitation services in Ireland, in collaboration with the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine provides for improved access to and quality of services for patients requiring rehabilitation. The rehabilitation medicine clinical programme and the HSE disability services division are developing an implementation plan for the neuro-rehabilitation strategy. A certain percentage of stroke patients will be suitable for early supported discharge, which involves intensive specialised stroke rehabilitation provided in the patient's home for up to eight weeks. This reduces the length of hospital stay, reduces long-term dependency and the risk of further disability after six months, as well as reducing the number of patients requiring long-term care. Early supported discharge services are currently funded in a number of locations, including the Mater Hospital. The feasibility of implementing this model in geographically dispersed populations is limited. The National Clinical Programme for Stroke, NCPS, continues to provide funding to these sites. Primary care also plays an important role in stroke rehabilitation. The HSE's National Service Plan 2013 provided for additional funding of €20 million to strengthen primary care services and provides for additional primary care posts. As of 6 June 2014, 221.5 of the 264.5 whole-time equivalent posts in the primary care teams have been filled or start dates agreed. The HSE is striving to have the remainder of the posts filled as soon as possible in 2014. Taken together, all these developments show that we have made significant progress in preventing stroke and its complications. Nonetheless, I hear the Senator loud and clear - there is more to be done. I agree that more needs to be done but we face extreme challenges in the health service in the context of our budget which curtail our ability to expand our services in the way we would like.

Obviously, with our aging population and the demographic risks we are facing, including the obesity epidemic, diabetes and high blood pressure as well as the smoking problem, cerebrovascular disease will continue to be a huge issue in this country. Not only is it very humane to treat terribly vulnerable people who are at their lowest ebb in terms of the betrayal of their own bodies by their circulation, it also makes great economic sense to try to rehabilitate and treat them as efficiently and quickly as we can. The downstream effects of having bad rehabilitation services in the community for our stroke patients are seen everywhere. Not only do patients get less good care if they are being looked after for extended periods of time in an inappropriate setting, where they run the risk of acquiring hospital infections and so forth, others who could use those hospital services more appropriately are denied them. A vicious cycle can set in. We must try to identify those patients who are good candidates for early, appropriate, humane, well-looked-after, rehabilitation-focused discharge.

My own father suffered a stroke at the age of 66 and was left with cortical blindness for his remaining 14 years.I am acutely aware, therefore, of the impact on families and the stress caused for them. He was a smoker and a doctor. We have made great progress. The principle underlying health policy is that patients should be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient, and as near to home as possible. Early intervention is part of this to allow for better outcomes for the patient and more treatment nearer to home. We need to develop stroke rehabilitation services in the context of primary care. I have opened many health centres in the past three years. We have opened them at a rate of one a month. Many of them have physiotherapy and occupational therapy facilities; therefore, the service is evolving. I look forward to us continuing to improve outcomes for patients. However, the Senator is correct that prevention is better than cure and in moving from hospital-centric services to primary care we also have to move resources. There is only one pot of money which is constrained, but we continue to move as much of the service as possible out of the hospital into the community where it is more cost effective and convenient for patients to use it.

Will the Minister for Education and Skills consider joining Ireland to the New York Academy Global Network and attending the global science, engineering, technology and mathematics, STEM, alliance international launch? This is due to happen at the United Nations next September. We all regularly speak about the importance of education and skills and focusing on science, engineering, technology and mathematics. The future of the global economy relies on the education of our children today and the technology and intelligence that can make the planet a better place for us all. A colleague in America mentioned that I was serving as a Senator and I was approached by a staff member of the New York Academy of Sciences. This is a no-brainer. The children of the country would be able to interact and discuss science, technology and mathematics with their counterparts around the world and participate in mentoring relationships with the most brilliant early career scientists through this alliance. I have all the details and I am interested in what the Minister has to say.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	367	I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, to outline the current position to the House. The Department of Education and Skills recognises the need to provide ready access to STEM career role models-pathways-information for young people. This is the ethos underpinning the Smart Futures programme, the recently launched Government-industry initiative co-ordinated by Science Foundation Ireland. The Government is incorporating STEM for students in primary and post-primary schools across the country, through curricular reform at junior and senior cycle, for example, through the high profile Project Maths initiative. The ICT action plan 2014-18 was developed as a direct response to specific skills shortages in the ICT sector. It outlines a range of short, medium and long-term measures to develop a sustainable domestic supply of high quality ICT graduates to support the further expansion and development of the ICT sector and support innovation and growth across other sectors of the economy. Ireland's education system will have a critical role to play in the coming decades as we seek to build an innovative, knowledge-based economy that will provide sustainable employment opportunities and an informed citizenship. Central to this is a commitment to build on our provision of STEM in primary, post-primary and third level education. We also need to strengthen and expand the entrepreneurial partnerships that are evolving between industry and schools which will make STEM become a reality for students, not just an academic curiosity. Competitions such as the BT Young Scientist Exhibition and SciFest give students an opportunity to showcase their knowledge. The Government is promoting science, technology, engineering and maths to students in primary and secondary schools across the country. The message is beginning to get through to school leavers and other potential students that there are increasing employment opportunities for high quality graduates in these disciplines. Such is the priority accorded to it, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, has responsibility through both the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for promoting STEM. The Department of Education and Skills considers it to be a priority to focus on the current national initiatives such as the promotion of STEM in schools and the Smart Futures programme in industry and academia which aim to motivate young people's interests and aspirations in the STEM areas. Given the ongoing range of work, it is not considered timely to join the NY Academy Global Network. However, the Department is supportive of this initiative and will be interested to hear about its progress.

I admire the work being done in the STEM area and acknowledge the focus the Department has put on it. I have a little girl aged 14 years and I am well aware of the focus on STEM in the education system. However, this is low hanging fruit. I am sometimes critical of the Internet and the effect it might have on young people, but this is a global social network for highly gifted students to be mentored and network among each other. If the Minister of State does not mind, I will pursue the Department and keep in touch in this regard. In recent weeks the United Kingdom, China, Qatar, Kuwait, Serbia and Nigeria have joined the alliance. I fail to understand why Ireland will not do so and will not sent representatives to attend the launch at the United Nations in September because it is for the good of young people.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	369	The bottom line is that the Department is supportive of the initiative and asked to be kept informed of progress in this regard. The door is half open. I leave it up to the Senator to make sure it will be opened fully.

I am sure both of us would prefer to be back in the west in the sun, but we have to do our business in the House. The issue I raise relates to the N59 between Galway and Clifden which passes through Moycullen and Oughterard, with which the Minister of State will be familiar. I appreciate work is being done on the road and acknowledge that planning for the Moycullen bypass has been advanced. However, I refer to the section of the road between Oughterard and Clifden which passes through Maam Cross in Connemara. What is the state of play in this regard? There have been two An Bord Pleanála hearings on the section between Oughterard and Maam Cross. The route chosen differs from the current one and there are concerns in the community that this might prove detrimental to the area. Environmental concerns have also been raised and we might be in bother at European level if we are not careful. During the An Bord Pleanála hearings the National Parks and Wildlife Service was not as vocal as it should have been. Given that the Minister of State is from Westport, he will be well aware of the Delphi bridge disaster which happened a number of years ago. Mayo County Council got into a little bother because the European Union felt the habitats directive had not been fully complied with by the council and that insufficient account had been taken of the ecological issues raised by experts at the time. The Government got into trouble over the issue. There is a sense that we might take the same route on the section of the N59 between Oughterard and Maam Cross if the Government is not careful.I would welcome the Minister of State's thoughts on that. Issues are also being raised about the failures and the completeness of the environmental impact statement, EIS, and the Natura impact statement, NIS, as well as the fact part of this will be a DBO project. The nature of a DBO project means the plan is not available when the EIS is being prepared, so it is hard to gauge from an ecological point of view what the impact is going to be. This could lead to problems on an environmental level and, although this might have gone through the national planning process, it could be appealed to Europe. I want to know where we stand if that happens. We all want to see the improvement of the road. It is very important for the people of south and north Connemara that we have good road routes to make the area accessible. Given the Minister of State's own involvement with the Wild Atlantic Way, he will be very aware we need to try to get people through the area in a proper manner but we also need to be very careful that we do it in the best way ecologically and in keeping with the needs and wants of local communities.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	371	I thank the Senator. In a personal capacity, it is an area I love. It is the most beautiful part of Ireland, as far as I am concerned, and I have an interest in the place. With the walks and other projects for which we are providing funding, it has a very bright future. It is one of the most beautiful parts not just of Ireland but of the world. We must make sure we protect it in whatever way we can. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to discuss this issue in the House on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. I am sure all Members of this House will now be well aware that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads, such as the N59, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. I am aware that the route in question is well known as one of the most important tourist routes in the country and is the principal access to and through Connemara and the many tourist attractions of the region, including Kylemore Abbey, Connemara National Park, the iconic landscape that envelopes the N59 route and the numerous towns and villages that draw tourists from home and abroad. The N59 Oughterard to Clifden scheme originally consisted of a 44 km upgrade of the existing road. I understand that, due to environmental issues, it was decided in June 2012 to divide the scheme into two sections, namely, the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross section and the N59 Maam Cross to Clifden section. The preliminary design, environmental reports and compulsory purchase drawings for the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross section were prepared first and submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval in October 2012. As regards the Maam Cross to Clifden section of the scheme, further environmental studies are required before environmental reports can be produced. It is anticipated that this section of the scheme will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála in July 2014. Oral hearings into objections to the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross section were held in February 2013 and re-opened in August 2013 to revisit some aspects of the environmental impact statement, as well as compulsory purchase order-related issues that arose at the first hearing. An Bord Pleanála approved the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross project on 23 December 2013. The highly sensitive and protected environment of Connemara, combined with traffic volumes of fewer than 5,000 vehicles per day, have made it difficult to justify significant realignments. In regard to improvements or realignments to the route, Galway County Council has procured consultants to prepare design and contract documents for the 10 km section of this project between Bunnakill and Claremount. An allocation of €1 million has been provided to Galway County Council for the N59 Clifden to Oughterard scheme in 2014. In addition, stimulus funding of €200,000 has recently been provided to Galway County Council for advance works on the Bunnakill to Claremount section ahead of construction of the N59 Oughterard to Maam Cross scheme. The advance works will include ground investigation, archaeological works, fencing of acquired lands, works on a section of the Connemara greenway and other areas of work related to peat restoration areas and advance bridge works. As regards the timeframe for completion of the scheme, future progress on this scheme is subject to both the outcome of the decision of An Bord Pleanála on the second section of the project and the availability of future funding. It should be noted that the section of the N59 from Oughterard to Clifden is part of the overall route to Clifden and, of course, the most heavily trafficked section is from Galway to Oughterard. Within a constrained budget, the Department and the NRA continue to improve facilities for both motorists and cyclists along this route. In this regard, my Department recently announced a grant of €2 million for a greenway between Galway city and Moycullen. As part of the recent stimulus moneys, the NRA will shortly commence works on widening a 1.1 km section of road south-east of Moycullen village at a cost of €1.5 million.

I thank him for the full report on the development. To follow on from that, the Minister of State might go back to the Minister and ask whether he is concerned that certain people believe the NPWS took a hands-off approach to the second An Bord Pleanála hearing and that its full input was not given to that hearing. Therefore, there may be questions around the ecological aspect of the development between Oughterard and Maam Cross in particular, which may be challenged at a European level. This could have a serious impact on the development of the road. Parallels are being drawn between what happened in the Delphi bridge disaster and what could happen close to Oughterard. Is the Minister concerned about this and will he address those concerns?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-17 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	373	I will bring the Senator's concerns to the Minister's attention. As I said, it is an area I know very well and which I would like to see developed. While making progress, however, we have to retain its natural beauty. People in the area depend on tourism and the jobs it brings. The one thing we have in the area is its natural beauty, for example, at Kylemore and in the Connemara National Park - one could go on and on. We also need to develop infrastructure and roads, however, and I would like to see that happen. If the Minister has anything to correspond to the Senator in this regard, I will ask him to do that.
