There are 30 seconds, and 30 seconds only, for Deputies to put their questions and the Minister has two minutes to respond. Deputies have a supplementary question and the Minister answers it. There is a final supplementary question and a final answer from the Minister. I ask Members to adhere strictly to that so that we get through as many questions as possible.

What are the Minister's views on the delay between BusConnects phase 2, which relates to the bus spines and new corridors that we, on this side of the House, strongly support, and the implementation of phase 1, which relates to the network changes?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	3	As the Deputy is aware BusConnects is one of the flagship investments to be delivered under Project Ireland 2040 and the ten year national development plan, NDP. The programme is made up of a number of different components, namely, building a new network of improved bus and cycle lanes; redesigning and expanding the network of bus services; introducing simpler fare structures and new ticketing technology; implementing a new bus livery; providing new and improved bus stops and shelters and new park and ride sites; and, importantly, transitioning the entire urban PSO bus fleet to low emission technologies. The objective of these proposals under BusConnects is to improve bus journey times that will benefit many millions of passenger journeys each year; provide a bus service that is easier to use and understand; enable more people to travel by bus than ever before; and also provide a network of cycling infrastructure that will enable more people to cycle across the city. Each of the components is significant in its own right while collectively they have the potential to transform how we use the bus in Dublin and in the other cities when rolled out there. The Deputy's question seems to suggest discord where none exists. All significant investment programmes such as BusConnects are made up of different components which can be progressed at different times and at different speeds. With BusConnects Dublin, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has been running the consultation phase on two distinct components, first, the network redesign - this is about configuration of all the bus services that will run for passengers - and, second, the proposed new bus lanes. These are the dedicated road infrastructure that will form the 16 main corridors into the city on which the bus services, and cycleways, will run. We all know of the significant public consultation that has taken place in recent months in relation to the bus network. There was a huge response to that consultation, with more than 30,000 submissions.  The NTA is currently considering all submissions received with a view to issuing a revised network design for further public consultation in 2019. It is envisaged that the implementation of the final network will take place in 2020. The network redesign can be implemented on the existing road network with some enhancements at key interchange locations which will be provided as we roll out the new network.

Phase 2 puts in place the infrastructure. We believe it makes more sense to implement phase 1 first, to put in place the corridors, and then change the network. According to a briefing we received last week by the NTA and Dublin Bus, some of these corridors will not be in place until 2027, the date for the construction completion and implementation of the metro. What will happen between now and then? There will be an increases in the bus fleet and a network redesign, about which the Minister and I both had issues, despite our support for the project from the start. What will happen between 2020 and 2027 as traffic congestion increases in the city and without the corridors to carry it? What are the Minister's plans for this?

Bus corridors are not the first thing to go in in this situation. The last major overhaul of the bus network in Dublin was implemented without any infrastructure developments accompanying it. The network redesign, which is the first thing, can be done in advance of the introduction of the new bus lanes. This will obviously take time. A large number of corridors, 16, will be brought in. It will not all be put in in 2027. There is a process which will involve many different applications, representations and consultations because they are controversial. It is not the case that we will plonk them down in 2026-2027, and the gap that the Deputy is suggesting is not the case.

There will be some compulsory purchase orders, which is regrettable but that will happen. There will be a large amount of public consultation to ensure that the corridors are put in the correct places and convenient to the people involved and the residents who will be affected. It will be a long process, not a short one, but it is for the convenience of the Deputy's constituents and my own.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	8	That is the point - it is a long process. I would love if the Minster devoted the same energy as he does to traffic safety, which is laudable, into a dynamic intervention into this. People cannot be encouraged or expected to switch from cars to buses if the bus infrastructure is not in place.This speaks to the matter that arises time and again. I raised it yesterday with respect to the policing of bus corridors and the Minister did not particularly respond on any initiatives. This is the kind of matter that should keep the Minister and me up at night thinking of solutions for the intermediate term. It will be ten years before that bus corridor network is filled. How can we hope to encourage drivers to switch from cars to bus services if there are no corridors in place and if the project is not to be completed until 2027? That will lead to completely obstacle-free routes, leaving buses as essentially a Luas tram on rubber wheels, but drivers will have to wait for ten years until the entire infrastructure is built. I would like the Minister to take a real leadership role in pushing this on and meeting representatives of the National Transport Authority, NTA, to make it happen as quickly as possible. We must get the compulsory purchase orders and a couple of eggs will have to be broken to make this omelette but we must get the NTA to push this through. The Minister should devise some intermediate solutions to encourage drivers to switch from cars to public transport.

He should not be under the impression that nothing will happen with bus corridors in the next decade. A National Transport Authority-led public consultation on four of its new bus lanes in Dublin started on Wednesday, 14 November, as the Deputy is aware. It runs until early next year. The corridors are Clongriffin to the city centre, Swords to the city centre, Blanchardstown to the city centre and Lucan to the city centre. As I stated, there are to be 16 corridors in total and consultations on the next six will start in January and run until April. Consultations on the final six will start in February and run until May. Phasing the consultations will allow for the appropriate level of engagement with property owners and communities along each route. It is really important that these consultations are given time and space. Nobody wants to see these bus corridors become invasive or an impediment to people's daily lives. We want to see as much accord, agreement and consent as possible given to the process, and it will take time. The idea that they will not happen until 2027 is wrong and the consultation processes are beginning already. The processes will go on and they will be phased in. They will not all happen in parallel as that is not necessary.

There were reports in the media that the Government was considering the establishment of a dedicated transport police to deal with crime on public transport and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was to meet the Minister for Justice and Equality on the matter. What was the outcome of that and what plans have been outlined?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	11	I thank the Deputy for putting the question, as the matter is of concern to a large number of Deputies, particularly in the Dublin area. It is a matter of some angst for people on some modes of transport and less in others. It is a relevant and well-intentioned question. The safety and security of public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with anti-social behaviour, are important matters that, first and foremost, must be managed by every public transport company in conjunction with An Garda Síochána where appropriate. Whereas the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident, I am concerned to ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to guarantee the safety of all passengers and staff travelling and working on our bus and rail networks. Therefore, following representations from the National Bus and Rail Union seeking the establishment of a dedicated police force for public transport, my Department wrote to Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus to seek their views on the issue of anti-social behaviour and ensuring the safety of both passengers and staff. In its response, Iarnród Éireann outlined a number of measures that the company has taken in an effort to safeguard the security of passengers and staff. These measures have included the allocation of additional security and supervisory operatives, particularly at night and in certain areas, as well as more resources for centralised closed circuit television, CCTV, monitoring stations. The company also emphasised that it works closely with An Garda Síochána on anti-social behaviour in general and receives the full support of the Garda. More recently, Iarnród Éireann has advised that security and supervisory operatives have been allocated, particularly at night, in certain areas and at sensitive times, such as the Christmas period. In addition, I understand Iarnród Éireann has now commenced the deployment of on-board customer service officers on intercity trains; their primary focus will be on customer service but their presence is intended to deter anti-social behaviour and will enable rapid contact with security or An Garda Síochána should this be required. Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus responded that the level of anti-social behaviour is relatively low and noted a declining trend, which is very positive. Both companies also stressed the strong and close working relationships with An Garda Síochána. Dublin Bus has advised my Department that it will have enhanced levels of co-operation and engagement with An Garda Síochána over the Christmas period. The company has highlighted the areas of greatest risk and requested additional support.

It is my understanding it costs Iarnród Éireann upwards of €3 million per year to provide security services. The Minister also knows that security personnel do not have the power of arrest and it is arguable that the presence of gardaí would be a stronger deterrent to would-be criminals or those causing anti-social behaviour. Currently, transport workers and passengers feel threatened because of a lack of security and the Minister should be aware of recent media reports of an apparent increase in anti-social behaviour. It is a worry not just for workers but for passengers. The Minister indicated the Government would look at a new and specific policing unit but has that idea been shelved? Does the Minister have an update on that? I have taken on board his response.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	13	The Deputy mentioned the need for additional resources and I have given Iarnród Éireann an extra €115,000, of which I know the Deputy is aware. That has come from my Department's Vote very late in the year in order to assist with this specific problem. The additional funding from the Vote will enable Irish Rail to take further measures that can reassure passengers and staff that they will be able to travel and work in safety and peace over the festive season. Irish Rail has spent €100,000 of this on extra security patrols on evening DART and commuter services between Dublin city centre and Howth, Drogheda, Maynooth, Kildare and Greystones. These patrols will be in addition to Iarnród Éireann's existing measures to safeguard the travelling public against anti-social behaviour and the company's long-standing strong working relationship with the Garda Síochána. The remaining €15,000 of the extra funds will be used by Irish Rail to provide additional security personnel at fleet maintenance depots in order to counter the threat of vandalism, including graffiti attacks on trains. The issue of anti-social behaviour on the public transport network has come increasingly to the fore over recent months thanks to the Deputy and others and we have responded to it. I must also thank Mr. Dermot O'Leary of the NBRU, who also brought this to our attention. We have responded very positively to it because we recognise there is a common interest in looking after both the staff and the passengers.

Is Iarnród Éireann satisfied it is sufficient to bring about an effective deterrent and curb the rise in anti-social behaviour? Are the unions satisfied that the funding is sufficient? The Minister should be aware there have been more than 1,000 anti-social behaviour incidents in the past 18 months and the rise in incidence across all statistical areas. It is something that must be dealt with promptly and effectively. Are the parties satisfied that the additional funding will help sort out the problem?

We will see what happens and what will be the result. We are not even over the Christmas period yet so we cannot see the effect it has had.They must be pleased with the fact that the Deputy's representations, the trade union's representations, their own representations and our awareness of the fact that appalling things were happening on public transport, made us proactive. I hope they are happy but of course we are happy to talk to them again if they think there is anything more we can do. That is not a promise of funding but it is certainly a promise of support, moral or otherwise for what they are doing. I have been in touch with the Minister for Justice and Equality and he has been in touch with the Garda Commissioner in turn and it is being looked at very seriously. It is ultimately a matter for the Garda Commissioner.

Tokyo 2020 is fast approaching and at the moment it is asked that we suspend boxing competitions from the Olympics. Can the Minister of State please comment?
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	17	I thank the Deputy for raising this because it is a very important issue and a serious issue for our boxers. I am aware of the recent announcement by the International Olympic Committee, IOC, to suspend planning for the Olympic boxing tournament at Tokyo 2020. This announcement was accompanied by a statement of the IOC’s intention to initiate a full inquiry into the internal governance arrangements of the International Boxing Association, AIBA. At present, it is my understanding that the IOC has not yet made a final decision on the inclusion of boxing at the 2020 Olympic Games. It is important to clarify that international sport organisations, such as the IOC, are independent, autonomous bodies that are responsible for deciding their own operational procedures and competition rules. No government has a role or function in such decision making. As we know, boxing is our most successful Olympic sport. We have won about 31 medals in the history of the modern Olympics, 16 of which have come in boxing and seven of those were in the last three Olympic Games. There is no doubt that we have a number of really good prospects for Tokyo so it is critically important that we would have this matter resolved. My primary concern in this is for the athletes and to give them certainty. It is very difficult 20 months out from the Olympic Games for an athlete to not know for certain whether their discipline will be included. I want to do whatever I can do to help ensure that certainty is there for those athletes. I am glad that there is excellent collaboration between Sport Ireland and the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA, on this. I have been in contact with both organisations about this. I contacted them immediately on 30 November to try to ensure that everything that could possibly be done to help the situation is being done and I am confident that is happening. I also understand that on the international front, the IOC has prepared eight possible scenarios around what may happen with boxing but this is certainly something that we will continue to work on and something I am confident that our sports agencies, Sport Ireland and the IABA, are doing everything they can about at the moment.
#KevinOKeeffe	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-party	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#KevinOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	18	I acknowledge the Minister of State's response and I appreciate that there are talks ongoing to get the matter resolved, but as he can see, this is an international issue. The issue that has arisen is not just about the quality of the sport, it is about the governance of the organisations in question. In other words, we have governments issuing warrants to the president of the International Boxing Association who, seemingly, has a precarious background. That is why the IABA has been suspended. All of this is happening in a situation where we have some of the best athletes coming up in boxing. As the Minister of State said himself, it has given our highest return in recent decades in Olympic medals. It would be a shame going forward, for a sport that anyone in society is able to participate in no matter their creed or financial background, if we did not do enough to get this resolved. Tokyo 2020 is only around the corner.

These are the people who basically put their lives on hold, in most cases from the time they are very young, to pursue their dream. To have this level of uncertainty, this relatively close to the Olympics, is just not good enough. It is something that all of the international boxing associations will have to come together on and to work with the IOC to get resolved because at the centre of this are Irish athletes and athletes from other countries who have worked really hard to get to where they are and are now wondering whether they will actually be in Tokyo or not. On the IABA and Sport Ireland, I am confident that they are doing everything they can possibly do and I am quite happy with the level of interaction that we have had on this to date in terms of trying to get it resolved but I am happy to keep the Deputy informed of developments because it is critically important to the entire sporting nation, given our recent successes. I look at Kellie Harrington's recent success in particular. Kellie and many others have really great prospects for Tokyo 2020 and we want to ensure they have the best possible preparation in advance of that.

I have two straight questions. Has the Minister of State spoken to the Irish Athletic Boxing Association? When the Minister was in the capital of the US, Washington DC recently - where they have initiated concerns about the president of the International Boxing Association - attending the World Anti Doping Agency conference where he made tremendous deliberations, did he not use the opportunity to speak to representatives of the other political bodies that attended that meeting and ask them what was happening with the international boxing situation? Given the Minister's remit in this jurisdiction and the manner in which he is always able to put his hand in someone else's pie, will he tell us whether he talked to them about it in America? That was only two months ago and this issue has been hanging in the balance for over 12 months. We seem to be getting no progress and the future of Irish boxing is in jeopardy because if we do not get recognition at the Olympics it causes trouble.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	29	I thank Deputy Coppinger for the question. The question appears to be on the tendering of Bus Éireann routes and asks me to make a statement on the matter. I will respond to the other part of the question later if the Deputy wishes. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding relating to public transport. However, I am not involved in the day to day operations of public transport or in public service obligation, PSO, contract arrangements. It is a statutory function of the National Transport Authority, under the Dublin Transport Authority Act, 2008, and EU Regulation 1370/2007, to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered PSO services. In 2015, as part of the bus market opening, the NTA sought expressions of interest from public transport operators to operate bus services on certain routes in the Dublin metropolitan, Dublin commuter and Waterford areas. This resulted in approximately 10% of PSO services which were operated under direct award by Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus being competitively tendered. As the Deputy is aware, Bus Éireann won the contract for delivery of the Waterford services which are expected to commence in March 2019. Go-Ahead Ireland was announced as the winner of the other competitions, including the Dublin commuter competition for certain commuter routes on the Kildare corridor into Dublin previously operated by Bus Éireann. It is expected that Go-Ahead Ireland will commence operations on the Kildare corridor routes in quarter 2, 2019.The competitive tendering that has recently been introduced by the NTA into the bus market is happening at the same time as significant growth in public transport services. The market opening will therefore not give rise to a reduction in employee numbers or in services by Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus as they both need drivers to operate new expanded timetables on their remaining routes. Of course, these expanded and intensified services by Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus will be subvented by the NTA, so the 10% market opening will not result in a corresponding reduction in their PSO subsidy, as might otherwise be expected.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
The NTA's current direct award public service obligation, PSO, contract with Bus Éireann expires at the end of November 2019. The NTA is required to follow a statutory process underpinned by both EU and national legislation before the direct award contracts may be renewed. As part of this process, the NTA launched a public consultation process in early October on the bus services contracts. This consultation informed the NTA's recent decision on the renewal of the contracts, including in respect of the direct award and competitive tender balance of contracts for Bus Éireann. Regarding the direct award contracts post 2019 in respect of Bus Éireann, the NTA has announced it will directly award an equivalent service level that the company has in December 2019, amend that contract in 2021 to reduce it by up to 5% of services and provide the removed services through a separate contract following an open competitive tender process. It will be open to Bus Éireann to tender for these services if it so wishes. The new direct award contracts proposed by the NTA will provide a guaranteed level of PSO funding to Bus Éireann up to 2024. As the Deputy is aware, the public transport PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money. Overall, its funding has increased by some 35% in the past three years. This year €285 million in funding has been allocated towards funding our PSO services.

Go-Ahead starts its bus drivers on €28,000. How is one meant to buy a house in this city or any other city in this country on such a wage? The top rate of pay is €32,000. That is €14,000 less than a Bus Éireann worker could earn after a number of years of service. There are no break facilities. Obviously, the Minister thinks it is fine for a bus driver to pull in and eat a sandwich on the side of the road. In reality, drivers have been leaving the company en masse. They were not able to take over last week the routes they were meant to take over. They are working a 12-hours-a-day roster whereas 11 hours is meant to be the maximum. It just will not work. We have already seen the Ryanair model fall apart. I know the chief executive officer is a good friend of the Minister. There is a revolt by workers and employees of Ryanair against that type of model, and this will not work either.

I have never been in his house and he has never been in mine. I think I have met him once for a cup of coffee or a light lunch in the past 25 years. I have met him on other occasions which have been businesslike and nothing else. I therefore ask the Deputy not to throw across the floor of the House the allegation that the Minister is in some way compromised by friendship. It is not true. It is not the case at all. I will answer the Deputy's question and some of the things she has said which are just not correct. She mentioned in her opening remark the privatisation of these companies and routes. There is no privatisation. There is an ongoing tendering process, to which she very accurately referred in her initial question but to which she unfortunately did not refer subsequently. It is a fine tendering process and is not in any way meant to undermine the incumbents, namely Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann. This tendering is for the benefit of the consumers and the passengers and it also benefits the staff. What Go-Ahead has done is introduce 425 new jobs and a large investment in the Irish economy. We must welcome this, and Deputy Coppinger should also welcome it. It is in no way meant to be a privatisation of anything. No assets are changing hands. This is just operators tendering for new routes, some of which they are getting, some of which the incumbents are getting.

The NTA does not want Bus Éireann to be able to maintain its own routes. In reality, it is not allowed compete. What is happening is a fragmenting of the network. Bus Éireann is expected to show a profit despite all the challenges of the NTA increasing licences and curtailing Expressway. The NTA guidelines are meant to be cognisant of the public service obligation, which does not seem to have been the case with Go-Ahead. At least with Bus Éireann the surplus money is reinvested into the economy; with companies like Go-Ahead, but specifically with Go-Ahead itself, 83% of the company is stock market-owned. What will happen is that the public service, the taxpayer in effect, will end up subsidising these jobs because many of the workers will have to claim the working family payment. The Minister has nobbled Dublin Bus as well. It is only allowed to make a profit of €1 million and must run its fleet on that. The NTA takes anything above that. Dublin Bus increases its passengers and generates revenue of €20 million and the NTA takes back €19 million. How is this allowing the public service in any way to compete? The Minister may not be a friend of Mr. O'Leary - I will rephrase that - but he is certainly an admirer and has tweeted very approvingly about the activities of the Ryanair boss, just voted the worst boss in history. My concern is for workers and commuters, who will not have services when they need them.

Thank God public transport is expanding, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus are expanding and the number of passengers travelling on them is expanding. Go-Ahead is entering a market and, I hope, doing well because it is accommodating a large and growing number of passengers which it is absolutely essential to accommodate. Happily, there is room for all, both the incumbent and its competitors and its new operations, in this new environment. We should be saying "thank God" we have Go-Ahead to do this, to compete and to improve by competition the lot of the passengers, to keep fares down, to help consumers and to provide more jobs.

I have also asked my Department to engage with the CEOs of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann to seek their views... Once I have received their responses, I will, in conjunction with stakeholders, including my colleague, the Minister for Justice and An Garda Síochána, review the measures in place to ensure the safety of all passengers.What is the current position in this regard?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	51	I thank the Deputy for her question. It is a serious and worthy one and is along the lines of what we have already heard about the necessity to protect the staff, which is essential and which I agree is not adequate in all cases. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy on and overall funding of public transport. The safety and security of Bus Éireann staff is a matter first and foremost for Bus Éireann in conjunction with, as appropriate, An Garda Síochána. Bus Éireann has advised that driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor single-deck and double-deck bus fleet. I am advised that manufacturers currently do not supply a solution for screens on coaches and consequently screens are not fitted to this fleet type. I have been assured that the company will continue to review this with coach manufacturers.However, their challenge remains safety-related as a result of the significant constraints arising from the design and layout of a coach cab area, the high operating speeds of coaches and the driver's need for a clear and unimpeded view of the coach at high speeds. Bus Éireann has further advised that the safety and welfare of employees are key priorities for it, that all assault and anti-social behaviour incidents are fully investigated and followed up with the Garda as required and that any employee involved in an incident is supported by the company through local management and the company welfare scheme. As already stated, while the vast majority of public transport passenger journeys occur without incident I am concerned to make sure that the necessary arrangements are in place in order to ensure the safety of all passengers and staff travelling and working on our public transport network. As a result, following representations from the NBRU regarding the establishment of a dedicated police force for public transport, my Department wrote to Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and the Railway Safety Advisory Council, RSAC, to seek their views on the issue of anti-social behaviour on our public transport network. All three companies emphasised their strong and close working relationships with An Garda Síochána in the context of addressing anti-social behaviour.

There have been four assaults on Bus Éireann services in the past couple of weeks. Until recently, I did not know that Bus Éireann does not record assaults unless the worker is absent for more than three days. A worker could be assaulted but it is not recorded if he or she comes back within two days. Each assault should be recorded so that there is a proper account of it. There is a call for a dedicated Garda transport division that has the ability to arrest anybody who causes criminal damage on a bus or attacks a bus worker. That is what the bus workers are looking for and that is what the Minister should be seeking. He mentioned that the Minister for Justice and Equality had met the Garda Commissioner. What was the outcome of that meeting? The Minister for Justice and Equality would have to provide funding in respect of extra officers if there was to be a dedicated Garda transport division. Does the Minister have an answer in that regard? Is he at least willing to provide funding for certain areas initially and then extend them if necessary?

I do not think he met him; I am not sure. I do not know what the outcome of that was, but I think it was quite recent. I could find out and come back to the Deputy. I know it is a matter of some urgency. In reply to the question about what is being done, I wrote to the RSAC. In its response it recommended the establishment of a dedicated unit of An Garda Síochána to police the rail network on occasions when the possibility of anti-social behaviour is high. Bus Éireann, in which Deputy Joan Collins is particularly interested, reported that the level of anti-social behaviour was relatively low and noted a declining trend. That does not make it acceptable for one second. However, the rate does seem to be coming down. Some of the measures seem to be having an effect. Bus Éireann confirmed once again that the incidence of assaults and anti-social behaviour is low but that safety and welfare of its staff is a key priority. Driver security screens are fitted to the entire low-floor single-deck and double-deck bus fleet.

There are safety concerns. I am sure that the health and safety committee could look at something like that. Where there is a will there is a way. If something needs to be done and can be done, it should be done. Assault screens should be fitted on all public transport to protect workers. As a stakeholder in these public bodies, it is the least the Minister can do to ensure that workers are safe. I would appreciate it if the Minister could come back to me regarding the Garda transport division. The Minister responded to the NBRU on 26 June. Six months later we still do not have any clarity on that except for what the Minister has stated, namely, that the RSAC advised on the rail network. I would be interested to find out more about that.

In addition to what I said about security screens being available on the low-floor single-deck and double-desk bus fleet, I note that according to Bus Éireann all assaults and incidents of anti-social behaviour are fully investigated and followed up with An Garda Síochána as required. Any employee involved in such an incident is supported by the company through local management and the company welfare scheme. Emergency support for drivers on the road is provided through their 24-hour control centres. The company has invested in extensive CCTV coverage throughout the bus fleet for the added protection of employees and customers. Bus Éireann has improved customer education with clear signage on buses regarding respect for staff as well as a customer safety video. An additional conflict management module has been included in Bus Éireann's employee training programme to help support employees in difficult situations and improved CCTV coverage has been put in place in the driver's cab area, with consideration of an additional camera over the entrance door fully covering the cab. I do not want to make light of this problem. I agree with the Deputy that it has to be addressed. It is being addressed. It has come to the notice of the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality and me. I would welcome any further suggestions.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	58	I welcome the pupils from the school mentioned. They have a worthy representative speaking on behalf of Donegal today, who will no doubt give me and successive Ministers a difficult time if we do not deliver for Donegal.  I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 41 together. First, I would like to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have overall responsibility for funding and policy concerning the national roads programme. However under the Roads Acts the planning, design and operation of individual roads is a matter for the relevant road authority in the case of local and regional roads, or for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the relevant local authority in the case of national roads. The TEN-T priority improvement projects in Donegal consist of improvements and realignment of three sections of the national road network. These are the Ballybofey and Stranorlar bypass on the N13 and N15; the N56-N13-N14 Letterkenny to Manorcunningham route;
and the N14 link between Manorcunningham and Lifford, Strabane and the A5. TII has advised my Department of the current status of the projects. Technical advisers are continuing to develop the schemes through phases 1 to 4 of the project management guidelines. A number of route options have been identified and it is anticipated that the preferred routes will be presented to the public in early 2019. The preferred routes will then be brought forward for further design and appraisal during 2019. The construction timetable is estimated to be in the region of approximately 36 months with an estimated completion date at the end of 2027. However I would like to stress that any timeframe is dependant on obtaining the necessary consents at various critical stages, including at the route selection, detailed design and tender stages. Meeting the requirements of the public spending code, obtaining planning consent from An Bord Pleanála and an adequate capital budget are also critical to delivering the project. These TEN-T projects will greatly improve journey times, improve safety and significantly improve local and regional connectivity which will help strengthen economic growth for Donegal.

I would like to think that every opportunity would be given to those who are affected by the construction of the new road. I refer to Ballybofey and Stranorlar in particular. In my time in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport we had already decided on a route for a bypass. It has now moved to the other side of the town. My concern is that it may be so far from the twin towns of Ballybofey and Stranorlar that it may affect their economic development.I would like to think the Minister will pass on my views to the TII and ensure that the selection will not have adverse effects on the town. The route from Letterkenny to Manorcunningham, which is the Bonagee link, is vital and it is important that those along the route have an input. After the Manorcunningham to Lifford route is constructed to link up with the A5, it will ensure that through the A5 and M2 there will be a motorway all the way to Dublin. It is important the Minister makes my views known to the TII and ensure we can progress quickly.

I will make sure they are passed on. He should not underestimate the cost of the project, which is €400 million. It is split approximately as follows: section 1 from Ballybofey and Stranorlar will cost €115 million; section 2 from Letterkenny to Manorcunningham will cost €99 million; and section 3 from Manorcunningham to Lifford and Strabane, which is the A5 link, will cost €186 million. These are only estimates and the budget costs will be clear when the projects progress to business case stage. The TEN-T projects in Donegal form part of the designated comprehensive network. The Deputy will be familiar with the TEN-T regulation targets from his time at the European Parliament. In Donegal, the TEN-T includes the N15 as far as the junction with the N13, the N13 to Letterkenny and onto the Border and the N14. In June, the European Commission published a proposal for a new regulation for the connecting Europe facility, CEF, which is the funding instrument for the European transport network, to come into effect from 1 January 2021. The comprehensive cross-Border road link between Dublin, Strabane and Letterkenny is included in the annexe to the proposal, meaning the Irish elements of the route could, in principle, apply for CEF funding when the regulation comes into effect.

Whatever the outcome of Brexit, Donegal will be more affected than any other part so it is vital we have a motorway right through to Dublin. This is not the end of developments in Donegal. I acknowledge the work being done on the N56 in Mountcharles, Inver, my area of Glenties, Dungloe and around the coast. It is important there are linkages from the north, west and east of the county into the TEN-Ts as otherwise only one part of the county might benefit. We want to ensure a proper road structure throughout. I acknowledge the work done on the N56 and we are grateful to the TII.

It is important to the Deputy and his colleagues that Donegal does not suffer as a result of Brexit but this is in flux. In these circumstances, the Border areas of Donegal, Monaghan, Cavan and others that have made special pleadings in the House have the right to be looked upon sympathetically and I will do so. The Deputy has made a good case. The situation with TEN-T funding is something upon which we cannot depend but irrespective of the funding mechanism, every opportunity will be taken to access any EU funding that may be available and appropriate for the projects the Deputy has mentioned. I assure him that the matter will be kept under review and that I will convey his views to the TII.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	64	Rosslare Europort is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but is instead operated as a division of Iarnród Éireann. Iarnród Éireann recently completed a detailed report on Rosslare and a €15 million plan to transform Rosslare Europort has been approved by the board of Irish Rail. Investment in the port is a matter for the company and Iarnród Éireann is examining how it will raise the capital necessary for planned investment. I understand that the company also intends to appoint a business development and sales manager to promote the port. Last week, Iarnród Éireann and Rosslare Europort briefed my Department on the company's plan for strategic development of the port over the coming years. The Deputy will be interested to know that there is also ongoing engagement between my Department and the port on Brexit. The efficiency of Ireland's logistics sector has been built up over many years on the basis of the advantages provided under the Single Market. Brexit has the potential to disrupt this logistics supply chain. In response, a whole-of-Government approach has been adopted on our key ports and airports through the establishment of an interdepartmental committee. The OPW, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Health, supported by my Department and other Departments, are working together with Rosslare Europort to plan to manage and minimise any impacts that may arise at the port as a result of Brexit. Plans are being developed under both a central case scenario and a no-deal scenario to minimise any future disruption to the port as a result of the UK becoming a third country. Over the past months, there have been numerous meetings between Rosslare Europort and the individual Departments to identify the requirements for the port and to plan for their establishment. The port authorities have also met on a couple of occasions with the full interdepartmental committee.  The Deputy may recall that I visited Rosslare Europort earlier this year at the invitation of my ministerial colleague, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and was briefed by the europort's management on its commercial position. This was a particularly valuable opportunity for me as Minister to witness the central role that Rosslare Europort plays within the economy of Wexford and the wider south east, and to see at first hand its potential in terms of future development as a vital part of our country’s trading infrastructure.

As he and the Department know, I have raised the issue of Rosslare Europort on almost a weekly basis since I came into the Dáil. It is a source of frustration in Wexford and the south east that the significant potential of the port has not been developed. In the face of Brexit, and what we are witnessing in the UK where the situation is varying from farce to effective chaos, the situation of Rosslare Europort has become acute. I understand the OPW is looking at putting in additional facilities. The manager of Rosslare Europort told Wexford County Council three weeks ago it would take approximately three years to put the facilities in place. Brexit, which is increasingly looking like a hard Brexit, is happening in less than three months. This time last year, I asked the Minister to raise the ownership issue when he met the UK Minister with responsibility for transport. As I understand it, there are no political or economic reasons Rosslare Europort and Fishguard Port cannot be separated. What it requires is minor legislation in the Parliaments in Dublin and Westminster to separate the company into two different ports. Rosslare Europort could then act as a stand-alone port.

However, it might also provide opportunities for Rosslare. The advent of Brexit might or might not provide opportunities. There will have to be changes in many of the ports and Rosslare will not be immune from them. I am sure the Deputy is aware the process of agreeing the future trade relationship between the UK and EU, including Ireland, is at a sensitive stage as we speak. Clearly the outcome of the process will have implications for this country's ports, notably Rosslare Europort, in view of its position as an import-export trading route to mainland Europe for those businesses that now or in the future may wish to consider alternatives to the use of the UK land bridge, which is a pivotal issue for people in Rosslare.Departmental meetings with Rosslare Europort and Irish Rail in the context of Brexit are ongoing. Most recently, the Department, as the Deputy will know, met the CEO of Iarnród Éireann and the general manager of the port last week and was briefed on the company's recent consultancy report and its plans for the future strategic development of the port. Ports are one of the top items on my Department's agenda when it is involved in any talks on Brexit, and Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port would be top of that list.

The concern is that the sword will fall and nothing will have been prepared for that. If the Minister wants to bring Rosslare Europort up to speed to deal with a hard Brexit where if we lose the UK land bridge either because of issues of legal access or financial constraints regarding its use, the port needs to be expanded along with development of access roads. The authorities in Dover and Calais have publicly printed plans to deal with a hard Brexit, but Rosslare has not. The authorities in Dover and Calais are predicting ten mile tailbacks. Rosslare has no plans in place to deal with that. The manager in Rosslare Europort was reported in the local newspaper as having told Wexford County Council that the Government's policy is not to invest in ports. He seemed to be outraged that Iarnród Éireann had to spend its own money on its own port because the Government would not spend on it. Facilities in Rosslare Europort are required for customs, the Garda and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It can then make an application to the EU to be upgraded to border inspection port status and then get tier 1 status. There is a great deal of work to be done in Rosslare Europort to make it suitable to deal with the impact of Brexit, as the required work has not been done to date. If we lose access to the UK land bridge for the transport of roll-on, roll-off freight, Rosslare Europort will be the only game in town. We can send freight through any port in the country but for the movement of perishable, pharmaceutical and agricultural goods transported by the drivers of trucks direct to the Continent, Rosslare will be the only game in town.

All contingencies are being prepared for in the event of Brexit. It would not be correct to spell all of them out here in public, and I do not believe the Deputy would expect me to do that. However, he can be rest assured that that includes Rosslare Europort and Dublin Port. My Department has been engaging with Rosslare Europort not just about Brexit but also about the land bridge and how that will affect that port as well. The Irish Maritime Development Office, in conjunction with my Department, has undertaken a study into the use of the UK land bridge by the Irish road transport industry, importers and exporters. The report, which was published recently, established the volume of traffic currently using the UK as a land bridge to the rest of Europe, the potential consequences that Brexit will have on land bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable. As I said to the Deputy, many of those involved in Rosslare Europort are looking at opportunities as well as the difficulties that will be encountered.

There has been a lot of talk about the development of greenways and dedicated cycle ways but I want to know the amount of money that has been sanctioned either by the Minister or any of the agencies under the remit of his Department for the development of greenways and dedicated cycle ways this year, and the amount that has been spent on the ground.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	70	I thank the Deputy for his question. There are two separate sources for funding of cycling infrastructure within my Department. The tourism development division provides funding for greenway construction while the public transport investment division provides funding to the National Transport Authority, NTA, for the provision of cycling infrastructure, including greenways, within the greater Dublin area and the regional cities of Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway. I have secured a substantial increase in funding for all forms of cycling and walking infrastructure investment over the coming years. This includes €110 million specifically dedicated to cycling and walking infrastructure in our major urban areas; €135 million for sustainable urban transport measures; and €750 million towards the BusConnects programme in Dublin, which will include the delivery of around 200 km of segregated cycling lanes, where possible. I am also providing €53 million to support the development of new greenways up to 2021 in more rural areas, in line with the greenways strategy published earlier this year. As can be seen, these are multi-annual capital expenditure programmes which will positively assist with the better development and provision of cycling and walking infrastructure across the State. In addition to these infrastructure measures, my Department also provides funding to the NTA in relation to behavioural change programmes and to Cycling Ireland to develop the national cycle training standard Cycle Right, which was first rolled out in January 2017 and is expected to have trained approximately 20,000 primary school students this year. In relation to cycling facilities specifically, the NTA has statutory responsibility to secure or provide cycling infrastructure in the State. I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply. With regard to the funding provided from my tourism development division, in 2018, €3,650,000 was allocated for greenways. As there was no open funding call at the time, and there were no new projects commencing this year, this allocation was for ongoing projects that were funded by my Department in previous years. To date, €3,256,402 of this allocation has been spent in 2018.

Do I take it that the total State investment in greenways and dedicated cycle ways this year across the 30 local authorities is only €3.65 million, which is the equivalent of approximately €100,000 per local authority - it is nothing - and the expenditure is even less? Can he confirm that is all that has been spent on greenways and cycling infrastructure, despite all the talk of plans for years? When will we get something delivered in that regard?

The Deputy said derisively that only €3.6 million was allocated this year, but what does he say about the €53 million which is available for greenways from 2019 to 2023? The current application form for that was issued in August and the application process closed on 30 November 2018. He should not dismiss that. The Deputy plucked figures out of the air which are convenient to him but €53 million is the amount that will be given, and that process is already in train. It is wrong for him to say we have not spent enough this year without acknowledging that €53 million and that there is a commitment to greenways in the Deputy's area as well as others. It would be far more laudable if he said, "Thank God the Minister is embarking on a great adventure with greenways". Greenways have been a great success.

The Minister threw out big figures. This Government has been throwing out big figures about housing but it has not been building houses. This Government throws out big figures for projects into the future but it does not deliver. I asked a specific question about delivery this year of either formal approvals of money for greenways or cycle paths or actual delivery on the ground.Can the Minister confirm that the amount sanctioned this year for greenways and dedicated cycleways was €3.65 million across the State, and that the expenditure was €3.2 million? That was the question and that is the answer I want confirmed on the record of the Dáil. He must remember I represent the whole country, as we all do, including the Minister. Can he tell me that those are the facts and stick to the question that has been asked of him?

I repeat for Deputy Ó Cuív - it would be good if he acknowledged this - that Galway County Council has gone for two, Kerry County Council for three, Donegal County Council for three and Wexford County Council for two. I congratulate the Deputy for all he did for greenways in his time in government but for some reason, he magicked all this funding out of the air. Fianna Fáil overspent when it was in government. We will not spend money we do not have.

It is amazing the play on words by both the Minister and the CEO of the NTA, who have consistently stated that bus services have not been privatised and have only been tendered out, and a private company happens to have won that tender even though Bus Éireann underbid it by €3 million. Its workers face lower wages and worse terms and conditions than their colleagues in Dublin Bus.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	88	It is a statutory function of the NTA, under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and EU Regulation 1370/2007, to award PSO contracts and to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered PSO services. As I mentioned in an earlier response, the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money and has increased by 35% in the past three years. Some €285 million in funding has been allocated toward funding our PSO services in 2018. International experience indicates that introducing competitive tension into our PSO bus market, that is, a mixture of direct award and then competitively tendered contracts, should allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value in the use of taxpayers' money in securing the provision of PSO services. It is well-recognised that good public transport is a key enabler of both social inclusion and economic progress and opening up the bus market forms part of the Government's commitment to improving our public transport system and services. It is important to note that neither Dublin Bus nor Bus Éireann is being privatised. Competitive tendering is not privatisation, as nothing is being sold, services are not being deregulated and control remains with the NTA. We are placing passengers at the centre of our public transport policy and the recent arrival of Go Ahead into the bus market introduces competitive tendering, not privatisation, and encourages everybody to focus on his or her customer's needs. It also encourages innovation and improvements to service quality for bus passengers. I remind the Deputy that all public transport services, whether they are provided by direct award contracts or through competitive tender, will continue to be regulated by the NTA in order that Leap, free travel pass, real-time information, etc., will all continue to operate on these services and fares will continue to be regulated by NTA. The NTA has the statutory responsibility to award PSO contracts and to determine the appropriate mix of directly awarded and competitively tendered PSO services. Under the law, this is not an area in which I have a role and I have no plans to change the law in this regard.

The Minister could amend the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to stop further competitive tendering so that when this 10% tender won by Go Ahead next goes to tender, serious consideration could be given to the competitive tendering of Bus Éireann. In this case, Bus Éireann under bid the Go Ahead company by €3 million, had the staff and had good pay and working conditions. The assaults on drivers is an aspect of conditions that the company can improve. Certainly, the Minister can intervene in a way that directs the NTA to change what it is doing. The Minister must bear in mind that drivers start at €28,000 in Go Ahead. Their maximum, at €32,000, is €14,000 less than Dublin Bus drivers earn. Their conditions are different. They do not have proper breaks and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 must be examined in respect of the hours that these drivers work.

I keep being accused by Members of having some sort of privatisation agenda. What is happening here is that there has been competitive tendering. Routes have gone out to tender and, as the Deputy will be aware, the incumbent is entitled to bid for those routes. The incumbents bid for those routes. In certain cases, the incumbent, Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann, has won those bids. In others, it has not, but that is what competitive tendering is about. It is absurd to suggest there is some sort of a privatisation agenda when Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann wins the competitive tender. We only want to do the best for the customer, the taxpayer and the staff.

It is the words used. The Minister spoke of the "PSO bus market". We do not have a bus market. Our public transport service needs to be protected, developed and funded, and needs more buses on routes, which is important as the cuts that have been made since the austerity years. More buses are needed on our streets. That determines the thinking behind this and the NTA's thinking as well. We must get away from thinking of the PSO bus market. We must make the point repeatedly that the Government has a public service obligation to provide public transport. It is crucial to climate change and in trying to get people out of their cars to have a proper, well-funded and well-run public transport system to serve the people of this city and the country.

Some of it is a matter of language and rhetoric. The passengers and those who have a social need for a transport system need to be protected and preserved. I do not believe that is inconsistent in any way with competitive tendering. Competitive tendering is responding to a need for more passengers having a hunger for more routes and it is not true to suggest that in some way the incumbents, the State bodies, are not being protected. The Deputy does not like figures but let me give her some.

Over three years, PSO subvention will have increased by 36% in total. That is a projection and it is correct. In 2018, €285 million of Exchequer funds was allocated to support the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services throughout the country.

Of course, Ireland performed badly. We were 48th out of 56 countries. A third of our emissions are from transport.The amount the Minister has provided in the national development plan for green transport or environmentally friendly transport is €8.6 million. We were supposed to have an all-of-government plan from the new Minister for the Environment, Planning and Local Government.

This allocation will be invested in public transport infrastructure and services, cycling and walking initiatives and other measures designed to reduce our carbon footprint. The framework for this significantly enhanced level of funding is of course the national development plan, which outlines a number of significant measures designed to support sustainable mobility. These measures include BusConnects in all major cities, MetroLink, DART expansion and increased funding for the heavy rail network generally. In 2019 we will see expanded PSO bus fleets through the provision of around 65 additional buses to the bus fleet in Dublin alone, while we will also see around 85 older buses replaced by more modern and environmentally friendly buses as part of the bus replacement programme. This order also represents the last diesel-only order as, from 2019 onwards, the NTA will end the purchase of diesel-only buses for the urban PSO bus fleets. In support of that move, a comprehensive series of low-emission bus trials has just commenced in Dublin, with support from the green public transport fund and from multiple agencies, including the National Transport Authority, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann. It is expected that the trials will conclude in April 2019. A final report will be produced which will further inform the best lower-emission option, or options, for our PSO services in the greater Dublin area and the regional cities.  Next year will also see consultations continue on the BusConnects Dublin programme with a second round of public consultation on the proposed new bus network and consultations continuing all through the first half of the year on the proposed new bus and cycle lanes. BusConnects is a significant programme, with an allocation of €2.4 billion over the lifetime of the national development plan, and will deliver improved journey times and expanded services that will benefit tens of millions of passenger journeys each year. In 2019, we will also continue to plan for the delivery of MetroLink.

For example, there is a major shortage of rolling stock, which the Minister knows is one of the major reasons we have had chaos, confusion and serious and dangerous overcrowding on the north-side DART and west-side commuter lines. He dodged key decisions, for example in regard to the equalisation of diesel and petrol and the provision of significant sums for green infrastructure. Aviation has been a major contributor to carbon emissions over the years, and its contribution is growing. I noticed Ryanair now asks its passengers to make a contribution to deal with their carbon footprint. Nonetheless, the Government has not examined the issue of kerosine. There has been insufficient progress on the rolling out of an electric vehicle network. On a range of areas, all the Minister has done is mark time; he has done nothing significant.

On electric vehicles, the Deputy is quite right that they have been very disappointing to some extent. Certainly up to this year, they were very disappointing but the Deputy will be aware that the number is now rocketing. Admittedly, this is from a low base but the number is rising very fast and we are very optimistic that electric vehicles will become a far more common and successful product. We are going to buy into them in a big way; we have to. The incentives we have produced have sent numbers rising very quickly. On the other points, the Deputy has not given the Government due credit. BusConnects, MetroLink, the DART expansion, the work on the Royal Canal and the Dodder, and the greenway from Clontarf, near the Deputy's constituency, to the city centre all involve clean transport.

Meath has a population that is now approaching 250,000. It is the fastest growing population in the country. Meath is now one of the most populous counties. It has the highest number of commuters per capita. The majority of workers this morning left the county to go to work. That happens in no other county in the country. Meath is unique in that regard. Meath residents commute farther than commuters from any other county, yet Navan is the biggest town in the country without a rail line. When will the rail line to Meath be built?

I believe it was raised before. I wish the Deputy well in his new venture. I welcome the fact that he has not lost sight of the home base while doing what he has to do. As the Deputy is aware, the Navan corridor, or M3 corridor, is currently served by a commuter rail service that commences at M3 Parkway and serves Dunboyne before continuing through to Docklands. The service also allows for interchange with Maynooth line services at Clonsilla. Importantly, the service also benefits from two park-and-ride sites, with 1,200 parking spaces available at M3 Parkway and 300 at Dunboyne. These park-and-ride sites broaden the reach of the service and allow for people who might not live in the immediate vicinity of either station to make use of the service. In 2016, the NTA published its statutory transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, in which the issue of a rail link to Navan was considered. The strategy states that based on current population and employment forecasts, the level of travel demand between Navan, Dunshaughlin and various stations to the city centre is insufficient to justify the development of a high-capacity rail link at the current time. Instead, the strategy proposes an enhanced bus service along the corridor and the development of a bus hub in Navan. In addition, the strategy also proposes enhanced bus services on the N2 corridor. Late last year, Bus Éireann announced new services along the M3 corridor, known as the NX service, which starts in Navan and is scheduled to operate every 20 minutes during the day. While I acknowledge that the introduction of the new service has not been without problems, I believe the provision of an all-day service every 20 minutes operated by double decker coaches does represent a step forward in terms of public transport capacity on the route. Meath County Council, in collaboration with the NTA, is currently progressing the development of a bus hub as provided for by the transport strategy. Importantly, the transport strategy clearly states that the issue of a rail link to Navan should be kept under review, taking into account the scale of new and planned development along the route. The strategy also clearly states that the corridor previously identified for a Navan rail link should be protected from development.

Anybody using the M3 or roads such as the M50 will know they are chock-a-block from 7 a.m. If an accident occurs on those roads, the whole system becomes snarled up. This is a massive difficulty for commuters. Over the past ten years, we have had one of the lowest levels of expenditure on infrastructure in the European Union, and that has had its effect. Many are living in commuter hell. Many businesses are pouring millions of euro down the drain owing to commuters getting stuck in traffic jams.This is also hurting people financially. People living in the west of my county are spending approximately €2,500 per year on tolls in addition to what it costs to run a car in the first instance. The Minister stated that the demand is not there for the service. Ten years ago, however, Fine Gael had a plan to build a rail line to Meath. It took that plan off the table and stated that there was not enough money in the Exchequer to build the line. Exchequer spending is back to 2008 levels so the money is there and the demand exists. I ask the Minister to ensure that this key infrastructure is built soon.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	111	Brexit will be damaging to the Irish economy, the British economy and Europe in general. Therefore, we must do everything possible to limit the damage through thorough preparations in order to make the country infrastructure-ready, particularly at ports and airports. We must also make interventions to assist companies to deal with fluctuations in sterling and to diversify and reduce their dependence on the UK market. Yesterday, I raised here a number of questions with the Taoiseach on our state of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit or even an orderly Brexit, which is what we hope for. According to the Government's data and that of its agencies, however, too many companies with the potential to suffer the greatest impact remain without Brexit plans or have not engaged sufficiently with the various Brexit-preparedness initiatives. The AIB Brexit sentiment survey of 1 November indicates that a substantial number of companies have simply not engaged and do not have any Brexit plan. In fact, the proportion of exporting companies with plans for Brexit is as low as 30%, which must be of huge concern. I note the 3,000 applications for positions with Customs and Excise. Can the Taoiseach say how many customs officials will be in place on 29 March and working at their desks? The Dutch Government has already hired 1,000 customs officials. Can the Taoiseach outline the work required on infrastructure at our ports and airports? I draw his attention to an article published in the Irish Examiner on 28 November 2018 and setting out the content of a leaked memorandum which had been brought to Government by the Tánaiste. The memorandum warned that a variety of challenges had arisen with the potential to impact on the country's capacity to be Brexit-ready. The memorandum sets out risks associated with site acquisition, potential lease-break rental options, statutory planning, procurement and construction issues at the ports and airports which will be most affected by Brexit. Ministers were warned that the scale of the problem facing the State is exceptional. The memorandum states, "In the case of Brexit, the scale and likely cost of infrastructure required, and the short time frame required to gear up for Brexit are exceptional and fall well beyond the routine demands of the State, especially in the case of our ports." The memorandum further warns Ministers of detailed plans on the upgrading of Rosslare Harbour, Dublin Airport and Dublin Port. Significant issues were identified regarding the capacity of Rosslare to be ready by 29 March 2019. The memorandum also details specific site issues at Rosslare. A number of issues arise. I will make the same point I made yesterday. There has been a general tendency on the part of the Government to be coy and to withhold information from the public on contingency planning for Brexit, specifically a no-deal Brexit, on the apparent basis that it would cause undue panic. I disagree with that view and believe the public should be made fully aware of all the implications of Brexit, irrespective of the scenario that ultimately emerges. The challenges and lack of preparation for Brexit should be shared with the public in full. We should not have to rely on the high standard of investigative journalism so evident in the Irish Examiner to make this basic information available. I ask the Taoiseach to commit to the publication of a detailed plan, including timelines, costs and challenges at our ports and airports, and to publish it without delay.

He is correct to say Brexit, particularly a no-deal Brexit, will be damaging for our economy. However, it is worth noting the ESRI projections released this morning. The ESRI states:The Irish economy looks set to register another exceptional performance in 2018; employment is growing at 3 per cent with taxation receipts across most headings also experiencing better than expected returns. The ESRI’s latest Quarterly Economic Commentary states that GDP is expected to grow by 8.2 per cent in 2018, followed by 4.2 per cent growth in 2019 [...] Our forecasts for 2019 are subject to the technical assumption that the UK's continued membership in the EU will effectively remain in place after March 2019. However, the economy faces an unprecedented degree of uncertainty in 2019; the outcome of the Brexit process, combined with the possibility of increased international trade tensions, could have significant implications for the economy’s performance in the new year. In the Commentary, we illustrate how a Brexit scenario, where WTO tariffs would apply, could almost halve the growth outlook in 2019.As such, the analysis of the ESRI is that even in the event of a hard Brexit in which World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs apply, the economy would still grow next year, although the rate of that growth would be slower. The economy would not go into recession. It is a very reassuring analysis and projection from the ESRI, but it is something we cannot take for granted. The ESRI projection that the Irish economy will grow, albeit at a slower rate, is because our economy is so strong that it will continue to grow and not go into recession even in the event of a hard Brexit next year. Even so, we cannot take anything for granted or assume that the ESRI projections are necessarily correct. This morning, I had the privilege to open the new European headquarters of Barclays Bank on the site where the Passport Office used to be located. the road, the new headquarters of Barclays Bank. This means that every branch in Europe will now be a branch of Barclays Bank Ireland on Molesworth Street. The bank is going to employ 400 people when fully staffed and will have a balance sheet of €250 billion based here in Dublin. This is an example of what is happening in the wider economy. While there are huge downsides to Brexit, particularly for SMEs and the agrifood sector, money and jobs are also coming into the country because people know Ireland is a good place to do business. That is because our economy is strong, we have a good education system, a favourable tax regime for companies, pro-enterprise policies and a political consensus in that regard across the House and because we know our position is at the heart of Europe no matter what happens anywhere else.

I have read the ESRI report and am fully aware of our open, foreign direct investment-based economy, which has been successful and effective for 40 years. Our decision to join the European Union is one about which I have always been enthusiastic as one of the great game-changers historically for Irish society. Certainly, I would not be complacent about a WTO-type Brexit and I consider that the impact for the agrifood section in particular will be very difficult. There is no point pretending. It will be very difficult for the Border counties. The Government's own economic analysis from the Department of Finance and the Copenhagen report point to severe difficulties for the agrifood sector and the Border counties. My basic question to the Taoiseach related to the number of customs officials who will be in place by 29 March 2019. I asked if he would publish a detailed plan outlining the challenges, work to be done, timelines for doing it and the cost of works at Dublin Port, Rosslare Harbour and our airports.Will the Taoiseach confirm that the detail and content of the Government memo that was brought by the Tánaiste and revealed in the Irish Examiner on 28 November truly reflects the case?

Generally speaking, IDA firms know what they are doing. They are the multinationals which invest here in Ireland. We need to improve preparedness, however, particularly among small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that export to the United Kingdom. Seminars are available. They are happening all over the country and assist businesses to become Brexit-ready. The Deputy will have heard some of the advertisements on the radio prompting people in business to do exactly that. Customs training is available and we have also made low-cost loans available to business. On the Deputy's question about customs officials, we have a panel of 3,000 people who have applied to be customs officials. A minimum of 200 will be in place in March but that can be increased to a much greater number should we find ourselves in a hard Brexit, no deal scenario. The comparisons with Holland, and with Rotterdam in particular, are not valid. Rotterdam is a massive port which handles ten times as much trade as our Irish ports, so obviously the numbers in Rotterdam are going to be much greater than those required in Dublin and Rosslare. In terms of making information public, we are very happy to give the Deputy full briefings and information through the Brexit stakeholders' group. We will publish plans, but it must be borne in mind that this situation is still evolving. Brexit planning happens on two levels. Most of it is led at a European level from Brussels. Some 70 notices have been issued already. The final seminar at European level will only happen on 10 January. Our domestic preparedness comes in under that. Any plans we produced now would have changed again by the middle of January. We will do that.

I spelled out to her the need to ensure that the commitments agreed in last December's joint report by British and EU negotiators are honoured. That means no hardening of the Border on the island of Ireland, that citizens' rights are protected, and that the Good Friday Agreement is upheld in its entirety. In December the Taoiseach said that he had a cast-iron guarantee. He said that he had "achieved what we sought to achieve" in respect of avoiding a hard border. He said what we had was "rock solid" and "politically bulletproof". In the midst of the deepening crisis at Westminster I am afraid to say that those words no longer hold. On Monday Mrs. May shelved her plan to hold a vote on the withdrawal agreement at Westminster and today she faces a vote of no confidence in her leadership. That is a matter for herself. What we need to be concerned with and what is our business is ploughing our furrow.  On the concerns around our ports and around investment in them, I am glad that the needs of Rosslare have finally dawned on the Taoiseach. The need for sectoral planning is unanswerable. We also now need to look at any prospect of a no deal scenario or crash come March. I will emphasise that this is not something anybody here, including Sinn Féin in particular, wants to see. When I and others asked the Taoiseach yesterday about contingency planning for a crash scenario, he said "preparations involve a number of elements including the hiring of staff such as customs' staff, veterinary inspectors [and] environmental health inspectors". That is all very well and good but, as we all know, a crash-out Brexit would be catastrophic for our island. It would rupture our economy, our social fabric, and our peace accords. The contingency planning required therefore goes well beyond the recruitment of additional officials.  I reminded Mrs. May last night that, in the event of a no deal situation arising, it is the strong view of Sinn Féin that a referendum on unity must be advanced as a matter of urgency and priority. Of course she disagrees with that because she is a unionist. That is fair enough, but the Taoiseach is Head of Government here. He should accept that Irish unity is the logical, sensible option to avoid the calamity of a crash or no deal scenario and everything that would entail for our island in the short and long term. I put it to the Taoiseach that in a situation in which the Good Friday Agreement is to be disregarded, a crash situation, we need to go back to the agreement and its provisions for a referendum on Irish unity. Giving the people their say would be the ultimate contingency plan.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	122	The Deputy correctly quoted what I said in December on the joint report and on the agreement we struck between the EU and the UK last December. I also said that we had to be vigilant and that we would be. We have been. I also said that the next step was to turn that joint report we agreed last December into a legally binding withdrawal agreement. For months and months I heard critics in this House tell me and the Government I lead that we oversold the deal that was made in December. We did not. It, including the Irish protocol, was translated faithfully into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement as we promised would happen. The next step is to secure ratification by Westminster and the European Parliament. That is still possible. That is what we are working on now. We will have a meeting of the European Council on Thursday and Friday. It will be an opportunity to engage with Prime Minister May and for me to speak to my colleagues. Indeed I will be taking a call from President Juncker later today to see what assurances we can give the United Kingdom Parliament that might assist it in ratifying the withdrawal agreement. That cannot mean a change in the substance of that agreement, including the substance of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, however. That is what we are going to work towards. I do not believe that now is the time for us to start talking about Border polls. I understand the perspective of the Deputy's party, which is committed to the territorial unity of this island. That is an aspiration that most of us in this House share but this is not the time to go about it. There are people in Northern Ireland who know that the backstop is a good deal for them. That is why it is being supported by business, farmers and many civil society organisations in Northern Ireland. To now inject a constitutional dimension into this debate would be destructive and disruptive because there are people who are arguing against this agreement precisely because they believe that having special arrangements around regulations for goods somehow weakens the union between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We know that is not the case. There are many special arrangements for Northern Ireland already. In so many areas, from social policy through to agricultural regulations, Northern Ireland is already different from Great Britain. Another example is that, before the institutions were brought down, they were seeking autonomy over corporation tax. Northern Ireland can have differences and still be part of the United Kingdom just as there are differences between all the countries in the European Union. I really do not believe that stirring up tensions in Northern Ireland or turning this issue into one of orange versus green is at all helpful at this time.

As he well knows, that is something which we have not done. In fact, considerable and very fruitful efforts have been made to ensure cross-community and cross-party support for a consensus against Brexit in the North. Brexit is a British Tory invention. All this disruption and tension is not of our making or of the making of anyone in this House. It is of the making of the Tories across the water. The Taoiseach talks about relying on a vote at Westminster and the safe passage of the withdrawal agreement. That may or may not occur. Let me emphasise again that I do not want want to see a crash, no more than the Taoiseach does. However, I also want to say to the Taoiseach, as Head of Government with the responsibility to advance Irish national interests and to protect everyone on this island, North and South, east and west, that he now has to plan and prepare for such an unfortunate scenario with eyes wide open. Rather than evading his responsibilities by talking up disruption or disruptive forces, he needs to look this dilemma squarely in the eye.If there is a no-deal Brexit, all bets are off as regards the Good Friday Agreement. All bets are off in terms of economic prosperity, social cohesion and solidarity. Rather than advancing this plan as something that is hostile to any of our people, the Taoiseach needs to understand it as an absolute necessity. In the event of a crash, we need a strong, robust plan B. The only viable plan B is the removal of the Border – the removal of the gash across our island. Has the Taoiseach planned for this contingency? Are plans under way? People need to hear reassuring words from him that he is planning in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement to allow people the opportunity to make a call, ultimately, perhaps between the union with Britain and membership of the European Union?

The best thing the Deputy can do to avoid that scenario occurring, and to avoid disruption to businesses and the loss of jobs, particularly in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, is for Sinn Féin to take up its seats in Westminster and vote for that withdrawal agreement.

Many young children are living there, looking forward to Santa coming, but before Christmas all those families have been issued with notices to quit. The landlord is not a small accidental landlord but a businessman with multiple properties. Yesterday, he told the tenants they were great tenants but said the market dictates the rent. The ground for eviction is the supposed need for substantial refurbishment. In reality, the tenants and the landlord know - I presume everyone here knows this and has seen it happen time and again - that this is yet another renoviction, something that deserves a word for itself now because it is so widespread, with the need for refurbishment used as a pretext to kick out tenants and hike up rents. If these tenants are evicted, they will mostly be evicted into homelessness. The Dublin Renters' Union and Solidarity have been assisting them in preparing to oppose any evictions. The Anti-Evictions Bill, which we will debate tonight and vote on tomorrow, would stop evictions like this taking place. Every Deputy will have a choice to take the side of landlords like that or take the side of the tenants. The vast majority of homelessness is being caused by evictions from the private rented sector and that is just the sharpest end of the conditions that face tenants.  Since the Government took office, rents in cities have increased by more than 30%. Average rent nationally is more than €1,300 a month and when combined with low pay and precarity, one in seven tenants now faces consistent poverty. The picture, unfortunately, was similar two years ago in January 2017 when we moved our previous Anti-Evictions Bill. That Bill was defeated by the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. It would have been passed were it not for the votes of the many landlords in this Dáil who voted against it. If it had been implemented then, 2,000 families who faced eviction in 2017 on the grounds of sale of property would have been protected. The Taoiseach's Government voted against that Bill. Two years on, with landlords continuing to use grounds of sale and renovation to evict tenants, will the Government vote against an anti-evictions Bill again? Will Fianna Fáil sit on the fence and abstain again? At the very least, does the Taoiseach agree that the one in four Deputies who are landlords should recuse themselves from voting on this Bill because of a clear conflict of interest? That conflict of interest goes much deeper, of course, than their personal status as landlords. It is related to the commitment of the establishment parties to the capitalist system and the free market in housing, which allows landlords to profit massively from a crisis facing tenants and others. It means that tenants such as those on the North Circular Road and all those affected by the housing crisis have no choice but to organise for a ban on evictions, proper rent controls and the building of public and genuinely affordable housing.

Members are able to make the distinction between what is a personal interest and what is a public interest and we all act in the public interest. I am not familiar with the particular building about which the Deputy spoke but I acknowledge we need to act once again to strengthen tenants' rights. Hundreds of thousands of people in Ireland rent the properties in which they live and we have strengthened their rights in recent years, but we need to take further actions, particularly to deal with landlords who abuse the renovation provisions to empty properties and jack-up rents.  The rent Bill, providing additional rights to renters and tenants, was approved by Cabinet yesterday. It has four major provisions: first, the introduction of a rent register so that people can see what rents are being charged in the area in which they live; second, extending the notice-to-quit period so that people who are asked to leave the house that they are renting get much more time to find a new place to rent; third, a legal definition of "substantial renovation" to end renovictions and bogus renovations such as the ones the Deputy described; and, fourth, additional powers for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to enforce existing laws and these new laws. This is legislation the Government is bringing forward and I sincerely hope the Deputy’s party will vote for it. I would welcome an indication from him as to whether he will do so.

Perhaps we could get that first and when the Government publishes its Bill, we will respond to it. Our Bill proposes to ban evictions on the grounds of sale which would mean, as is the case in many European countries, that sale would have to take place with tenants in situ. It would ban evictions on the grounds of renovations. In the case of a landlord saying he or she has to evict because he or she or a family member is moving in, six months' rent would have to be paid in compensation. Those are the kind of measures needed to guarantee the rights and circumstances of tenants. On the question of personal interest versus public interest, does the Taoiseach not see it as significant that 4% of people in society as a whole are landlords? In this House, and within the Cabinet, 25% are landlords. Landlords are massively over-represented here. That is not just a question of personal interest and motivation, although one would be blind to believe those factors do not affect people, but it is a question of ideology. This Government is a landlords’ Government. It is the reason it passed a landlords’ budget, and the reason it pays lipservice to the idea of tenants and the reason I suspect, despite the Taoiseach saying he has not seen the Bill yet, that it will oppose it.The Taoiseach will allow families such as those on North Circular Road to continue to face homelessness and he will turn a blind eye to it while the profits of landlords shoot through the roof.

In those two years, 8,340 people gained employment, a success rate of 25%. Those who gained full-time employment amounted to 6,111 people or 18% of the total figure, while those who gained part-time employment made up 4% of the total. When one looks closely and measures the chances of someone gaining full-time employment under JobPath as opposed to of their own accord, the numbers are very interesting. The most recent figures for 2016 show that JobPath only helped a further 2% of individuals to gain full-time employment. Figures for people who gain part-time work improve. Part-time work is often seasonal, precarious and has low wages. The State often helps to subsidise income through the family income supplement, part-time jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance. Why do we continue to pay a private company which has only served to continue the situation of income insecurity for people who the State must subsidise anyway? I would like to read an excerpt from a letter I was given in Donegal about a person's experience with a company, People 1st. He is so intimidated by the service that he wishes to remain anonymous. It reads:I am a client of People 1st and I have found my time there to be a very difficult one. The advisors put a lot of pressure on me. I feel extremely stressed, and made feel worthless. I try very hard to find employment but I can’t seem to get any work. I find my advisor to be very disrespectful, discouraging and not understanding of my circumstances. Although I have a third level qualification my advisor seems to put across that I am lazy. I have approached the Manager on a few occasions, regarding my complaints however it is not dealt with. The letter aptly describes the direct consequences privatisation of our State services is having on vulnerable people across the country. The profit-driven model of these private companies applies unnecessary pressure to people. This should be treated as a State service, yet the Government paid these companies €58.5 million last year. That is money which could be spent on 500 houses in Donegal, five or six schools, or indeed reinstating social welfare income supports for part-time and seasonal workers to the 2012 levels across the State. The Government is blinded by the notion of private services being more efficient when the figures clearly show that this is not the case. Will the Taoiseach shut down JobPath and instead reinvest the money into State services, moving away from the encroaching privatisation of social service provision in this country?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	172	We have gone from a situation in Ireland where, only five or six years ago, we were in the middle of an economic and unemployment crisis. Some 15% of people were unemployed and people were being forced to emigrate again. We have net migration now, with more Irish citizens coming home than are leaving, and unemployment at approximately 5%. We will soon reach full employment, the point at which there is a job in Ireland for everyone who genuinely wants one. We are almost there. That is enormous progress in only a few years. That did not happen by accident. A remarkable thing about Ireland's economic recovery is that we had jobs growth and a fall in unemployment almost from the start of the recovery. Most countries would see the economy recover first with jobs coming later and unemployment falling thereafter. That happened because a decision was taken by the last Government, of which I was a member, with Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to adopt an activist approach to getting people back to work. That is why the Intreo model was set up and why JobPath was contracted by my constituency colleague, Deputy Burton. That is why we continue to support the local employment schemes. Some people will just find a job on their own but others need help, support, encouragement and training. That is done through different mechanisms. Intreo is the in-house service provided by the excellent staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection around the country. JobPath is outsourced because the Department did not have the capacity at the time of mass unemployment to do all the work. There are also the local employment schemes around the country. These mechanisms have been successful. The JobPath model is a payment by results model. Companies get a registration fee but beyond that they are only paid if the person they are working with enters gainful employment and stays in it for more than three months. There is a contract. Terminating any contract with any company involves significant costs and penalties for the taxpayer. We are certainly not going to cancel any such contracts. We are entering a different phase in our economy where we are heading towards full employment so obviously services such as JobPath may not be needed in the future but that is an assessment that the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, will have to make. In future, the focus will be less on people who are unemployed because unemployment is down so far, and more on activating and encouraging into the labour market people who are not on jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance. I encourage anyone who has a complaint to make that complaint to the provider and if he or she is not satisfied with the response, he or she can complain to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which will investigate it. When one looks at the tens or hundreds of thousands of people who have been involved in the various programmes that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection runs, the percentage of complaints is reassuringly low.

That is welcome. Despite the Government spending €58.5 million on JobPath last year, it is not creating any significant extra jobs beyond what people are getting themselves. The data from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection show that. Those are the figures the Government has. We spent €58.5 million to have 4% more jobs created. That is not good value for money to me, and even the Government, having seen how the private sector works, would surely think that is not good value for money and that it does not work. This system is not working, it has not worked and the Taoiseach should accept that it has not worked. It will not work in the future either. People will find jobs if they get the support and the staff are already in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to help and support those people. The Government does not need to privatise it so why does it continue to do so?

There are many staff in our Intreo offices around the country. When unemployment was three times what it is now, the Department and Government did not have the staff. That is why JobPath was brought in as an additional provider to provide these services to assist people to get into employment. The context is now changing and we need to use those models in other areas. We used a similar model with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to reduce waiting lists significantly in areas in the public health service where we do not have capacity.Waiting lists for hospital procedures on hips, eyes, knees and cataracts and for angiograms have fallen every month for almost a year and half. They are now lower than they were when the Government came to office because we used the private sector to augment our public services. It makes sense to do that on occasion.

So too, is Monica's daughter Sarah and her granddaughter Ailbhe. You are all very welcome. This is a sad day for you all but I hope that the support and memories that are shared here in Leinster House will serve to support you as we pay tribute to two much respected and distinguished former Members. Paddy Harte often tilled a lonely piece of rugged Donegal furrow in his search for dialogue and lasting peace on our island. He was a generous public representative and a man of political courage and determination, often going against the political grain to extend the hand of friendship across a divided land. We often forget how many sacrifices, ideological, philosophical and political had to made in the long barb-strewn path to peace on this troubled land. Paddy Harte walked a step ahead of history and we owe him a debt of thanks for the courageous use of his role as a legislator to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of Irish men and Irish women. It is particularly good to see Paddy's son, Jimmy, with us here today. Monica Barnes represented Dún Laoghaire for many years, but also typified a long and distinguished tradition within Fine Gael of social activism and progressive practical steps to better the lives of men, women and children both in her south Dublin constituency and nationally. I have spoken on a number of occasions this year at events marking 100 years since women's suffrage. This right was won a mere four generations ago, which is shocking to remember. The right to place a democratic mark on the ballot paper was won with a struggle not given generously by the men of 1918. With dignity and tenacity, Monica carried on that struggle to see a fairer, more equal society, not only for women but for all Irish citizens. Like Paddy, she often argued causes which did not have full or popular support at the time that she served in this Chamber but the strength of her conviction, coupled with the warmth of her personality and willingness to engage with all sides of the House, ensured that she was respected for her views and listened to by all, even those who differed radically with her. It is a real strength of character to be able to disagree agreeably. She was a skilled parliamentarian, fighting for many causes. Personally, I think her greatest testament will be to continue the fight begun in 1918 when Countess Markievicz was elected to the House of Commons in Westminster and took her seat instead in the first Dáil. That work continues but we remember today Monica's crucial role in the fight for a better Ireland. Both Paddy and Monica served this House with distinction and fortitude. As Ceann Comhairle, I offer my renewed condolences to their families, who should take great comfort in the patriotism shown by both Paddy and Monica.

They both helped us as a country to come to terms with our history and in doing so enabled us to build a better future. Paddy Harte was an architect of peace and reconciliation on our island, building bridges across communities. His lasting achievement is the Island of Ireland Peace Park at Messines, made possible by working with people from different backgrounds, different perspectives and different traditions for a greater good. It is a reminder of the shared history on our island and a symbol of hope for the future. Paddy Harte helped us to decommission sectarian views about our history and educated us about how we can remember and commemorate the sacrifices of the past with honour. It is remarkable that in a political career which spanned 36 years in this House and a short but successful stint as a Minister of State that nobody ever had a bad word to say about him. He was a gentleman who always saw the good in others, an approach that helped dismantle barriers on both sides of the Border. If things turned out differently, Paddy Harte might have spent his life as a successful butcher in Donegal but instead he served the people of Donegal north east a different way, by turning his own home into a railway station and always welcoming people who needed help. Paddy Harte will be remembered as a patriot who reminded us that love of country does not require us to hate anyone else. It is a lasting legacy. Today, we remember his wife, Rosaleen, their children, Mary, Paddy, Anne, Jimmy, Róisín, Eithne, Johnny, Garrett and Emmett and their 24 grandchildren and many friends. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam. Ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís. In recent months, we have also paid tributes in this House to whistleblowers who stood up for the truth at great personal cost. In many ways, Monica Barnes was a political whistleblower. She was someone I knew personally and someone who called time on a culture that was, in her words, "bleak, guilt ridden, repressed". Often she was criticised and sometimes she was harassed but she never wavered. Monica Barnes led the way with courage and good humour, always polite, always seeking a better way. She was a fearless campaigner for change in the way she championed women's rights and the way she demanded that care and compassion be shown to people in difficult situations. She was a pioneer of social liberalism in my own party, a founding member of the Council for the Status of Women, a Senator, a Deputy faithfully representing the people of Dún Laoghaire and she was an inspiration for many people around the country, in particular young people and young women in Fine Gael and beyond.  I feel though that if she were with us here today she would not let us get away with nice tributes without acknowledging that we have still so much more to do. We have much more to do before we realise her vision for Ireland and we will do that and remember that her courage and determination helped point the way for us. Today, our sympathies are with her husband Bob, their daughters Sarah and Joanne, her sister Angela and brother Colm, as well as their grandchildren, extended family and friends. We also remember her beloved son Paul, who sadly predeceased her.  Monica's family and friends can be proud of a true political pioneer who helped to make our country a much kinder, more modern and overall better place.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis.

Fear lách, láidir, agus neamhspleách a bhí ann. Thuig sé tábhacht gach traidisiún ar an oileán seo. D'oibrigh sé go dian dícheallach Domhnach is dálach ar son mhuintir Dhún na nGall, ar son mhuintir na tíre seo, agus chun síocháin a chur ar bun ar an oileán. Paddy Harte has left a lasting mark on Irish politics not only through his work as a Deputy representing the people of Donegal north east but as a builder of bridges. As Fine Gael spokesperson on Northern Ireland he was a politician who engaged meaningfully with all traditions and people from all backgrounds. In that respect, he was ahead of his time. He dedicated much of his life to public service and he was a member of Dáil Éireann from 1961 to 1997, a span that encompassed the worst of the death and destruction in Northern Ireland.He was Minister of State in the 1981 to 1982 Government in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but he was not the type of politician who felt he needed ministerial status to make a contribution. Paddy made a major contribution through his involvement with the former UDA chief, Mr. Glenn Barr, in promoting the recognition of Irish people who died during World War I, and I believe he will be best remembered for that. He did this long before it was popular, and for the courage he showed in that regard he deserves our collective acclamation. His resolve to progress this issue not only recognised the sacrifice that Irish soldiers made in the Great War but also led to the building of the Island of Ireland Peace Park and round tower in Belgium. The work saw him awarded numerous accolades, including an honorary OBE and an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the National University of Ireland, as well as being named European of the Year in 1998. While he was a stalwart and steadfast member of Fine Gael, he was very much his own man. Indeed, when violence broke out in Northern Ireland in 1969 he crossed the floor of the House and met the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, to give him his advice and ideas on the unfolding crisis. It was this type of approach that won Paddy so many admirers on all sides of the House. A proud Donegal man, an Ulster man and an Irish man, I again extend my condolences to Paddy's wife Rosaleen and his nine children. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis. Bean agus polaiteoir faoi leith ab ea Monica Barnes. Bá dhuine le prionsabail í a bhí chun tosaigh maidir le cearta sibhialta ginearálta agus cearta sibhialta mná na tíre seo ach go háirithe. Bhí sí tuisceanach, ceanúil, agus gníomhach in an-chuid feachtas le glúinte anuas. Monica Barnes was a courageous and outspoken voice in Irish politics at a time when progressive voices were few and far between. She was, in many respects, ahead of her time and always thought outside the box. She was a very proud feminist and was admired by many. A co-founder of the Council for the Status of Women in 1973, now the National Women's Council of Ireland, she and Mary Robinson, Gemma Hussey and Nuala Fennell were among the trailblazers for advancing women's rights in the 1970s. The liberal leadership of Garrett FitzGerald attracted her to Fine Gael and she was elected to Dáil Éireann in November 1982. The following year she was one of two Fine Gael Deputies to oppose the wording of the legislation and the insertion of the eighth amendment in the Constitution. Monica agreed with the advice of the then Attorney General, the late Peter Sutherland. She was also a committed supporter of the 1986 referendum to remove the ban on divorce. While the causes dear to her heart did not have much success in the 1980s she was never disheartened and she retained her open and optimistic outlook on life. Although she advocated with passion for her beliefs she was never dismissive or intolerant of those with whom she disagreed. I echo the words of the Ceann Comhairle, that she was most agreeable in disagreeing with people. She was approachable, a very warm person and had a great sense of humour. Fearless yet courteous, she made friends across the political spectrum and the loss of her seat in 1992 was greeted with disappointment by many outside Fine Gael. She never held ministerial office, although had she been a Deputy in 1994 when the rainbow Government took office it would have been hard to overlook her. She returned for a final term to represent Dún Laoghaire in 1997 before retiring in 2002. Sadly, she lost her son Paul to cancer the following year. She never lost her commitment to the causes for which she was passionate and was all set to campaign to repeal the eighth amendment earlier this year. It was not to be, however, and she passed away quietly and suddenly at home three weeks before the day of the referendum. I have no doubt that she inspired many other women to enter political life. This year we mark the centenary of women voting for the first time and Monica Barnes's life was a powerful example of what women can achieve in national life. Monica's family's grief can be tempered with pride in her great achievements in public life. I offer my sincere sympathy and that of my party to her husband Bob, daughters Sarah and Joanne and her wider family, the Fine Gael Party.

On my own behalf and on behalf of Sinn Féin I extend sincere sympathies to the family and friends of former Teachta Paddy Harte, who passed away last January. As has been said, Paddy had a lengthy career in the Dáil, serving the people of his beloved Donegal for no less than 36 years from 1961 to 1997. It is an incredible record. During that time he served briefly as a Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1981 to 1982. However, quite correctly, it is for his work on peace and reconciliation that Paddy will be best remembered, particularly his work in delivering the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Flanders which opened in 1998 and which commemorates all Irishmen who died during the First World War. It is a place I was pleased and moved to visit. It is a tribute to him. There is much on which Paddy and I would have disagreed, but I have no doubt that there are also many things on which we would have seen eye to eye. In any event, his contribution to public life was immense. I join others in extending sympathy and condolences to his loved ones, his wife Rosaleen, his nine children Mary, Paddy, Anne, Jimmy, Róisín, Eithne, Johnny, Garrett and Emmett - a formidable clan - his other relatives and friends and his wider family and colleagues in Fine Gael. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. Arís ar mo shon féin agus ar son Sinn Féin, ba mhaith liom comhbhrón a dhéanamh le clann agus cairde iarTheachta Monica Barnes, a fuair bás i mí Bealtaine. I also extend deep sympathy and condolences to the family and friends of former Teachta, Monica Barnes, who passed away in May. On the occasion of her passing I remarked in the House that she had always struck me as a very untypical member of Fine Gael, which was received as one might expect by her fellow members of Fine Gael. She served in the House for a lengthy period from 1982 to 1992 and again from 1997 to 2002. She was also briefly a Member of the Seanad in 1982. She was undoubtedly one of the most courageous feminist voices of her time and in Irish political history. She was one of a small number of people who had the foresight, compassion and vision to stand against the eighth amendment when it was first proposed. I never met Monica Barnes. I wish I had as I really liked her. I had great admiration for her, and her record of public service speaks for itself. I recall as a young woman listening to her, watching her and being moved and inspired by her. I join with others in extending sympathy and condolences to her husband Bob, her daughters Sarah and Joanne, her siblings, grandchildren, other relatives and friends, as well as her colleagues in Fine Gael. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis.

At first glance, the two might have appeared to be very different people, and they were, but they shared extraordinary values, passionate views on what was right and passionate voices to articulate those views regardless of the opinion of their political party or the consensus. They stood by what was right. Those characteristics are truly important in public representatives. Paddy Harte could be described as a peacemaker, as the Ceann Comhairle said. If one were to accord an attribute to any of us, to be called a peacemaker is among the highest accolades one could bestow.Paddy was involved in making peace at a very human level. It was not in broad structural terms; it was in building bridges and reconciling differences. At his funeral it was said that his greatest legacy was the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines, Belgium, which was formally opened on 11 November 1998 by President Mary McAleese, Prince Albert of Belgium and Queen Elizabeth. This was seen then as a turning point, not only in history but in the relationships between the peoples of these islands. It was one of the many important steps on the road to real reconciliation. I am truly delighted to see the members of the Harte family in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery today. I may be forgiven for welcoming Jimmy especially. I know that the Harte family is a hub of community and the open door connection with the surrounding community is an important aspect of the family's very existence. On behalf of the Labour Party and all my colleagues, I send my condolences, but also my congratulations, to the Harte family for the incredible service that Paddy gave to his community and to his country. I knew Monica Barnes very well. Again, she was someone who often shared more views with me than with many other Members or with the majority of her own party, certainly in the early days. I remember one trip I made with two remarkable women. Monica Barnes, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and I went on a trip to Russia. I am not sure I can actually tell all-----

Maybe there is a transcript worth reading in some liberated archive in Moscow. On that trip one of the people we met was Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space. I remember that Monica was truly delighted to meet a woman who had been in space. As others said, Monica was a true feminist who would advance the cause of women always and forever, in every circumstance without fear or favour and, if anybody had a different view, without taking any hostages. Monica Barnes and I often shared political platforms and I recall that once in my early political career I very reluctantly gave up my Saturday clinic to do a meeting with women's groups in Dublin. My co-speaker at this meeting was Monica. I asked her if she found it difficult to give up her clinic on a Saturday. I learned then of politics in Dún Laoghaire. Monica said: "Clinics on a Saturday? I meet with my constituents by appointment on a Tuesday." Politics can be very different but we are certainly the poorer of personalities like Paddy and Monica. It was a terrible blow to Monica to lose her son, Paul, but she made a remarkable and indelible impression on everybody she met and on the cause of the advancement of women and social progress generally in the State. On behalf of the Labour Party, I join with others in extending my condolences but also my congratulations to Bob and the family for the remarkable life and achievements of Monica Barnes. May Monica Barnes and Paddy Harte both be looking down on us and enjoying the few words of celebratory acknowledgement that we give to them today.

Both of the deceased were a bit before my time and I would not have been that familiar with Paddy's record but it has been very impressive to listen to it recounted here. I congratulate the Harte family and pay tribute to them for putting up with the travel Paddy would have done up and down from Donegal to here for 30 years. If I stayed in here for 30 years, my young fellas would absolutely kill me. The family must be very proud of such a record. To stick at it for that long shows extraordinary stamina if nothing else. The Island of Ireland Peace Park in Belgium is an extraordinary achievement for which the family should be very proud. I know that Deputy Seán Barrett will have a lot more to say about Monica Barnes. I am not sure if I ever met her. It is quite possible I did because my aunt Janet Kinsella, who was a stalwart of the Fine Gael Dún Laoghaire branch certainly would have known her and known Deputy Barrett also. It is very possible I met Monica at family occasions. As a young fella, up to no good on the streets of Dún Laoghaire and before I took any great interest in politics, I would have certainly been more than familiar with the names of Barnes, Barrett and Cosgrave as they were emblazoned across the lamp posts of Dún Laoghaire. Although I would not have shared the Fine Gael affiliation, and I had many robust debates with my aunt Janet on politics, I was aware of Monica's central role in the fight for women's rights in this country, her opposition to the 1983 wording of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, her support for the right to divorce and her historic role in a broader social movement to achieve rights and equality for women. With the tremendous changes that have happened with the recent vote to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution, we cannot say anything other than we owe a debt of gratitude to trailblazers like Monica Barnes, and many others who are not still with us and who fought against the tide in those early days when it was neither profitable nor popular to do so. Her family deserve to be very proud of that. It is sad that she is not here to see the great victory that has been the long-term impact of a struggle that people like Monica Barnes started many years ago. My sympathy and condolences go to her family.

As a Donegal man it is an honour for me to talk about Paddy Harte. I met Paddy only once or twice, very briefly, over the years but I served on Donegal County Council with Paddy's son, Jimmy, and we had a good collegial relationship at council level. While they may not have known him personally everybody who grew up in Donegal knew who Paddy Harte was, and the Harte family name is, synonymous with Fine Gael and with peace building right across the county. It is a great honour for me to pay tribute, to pass on my condolences to Rosaleen and the family and to have said these few words. On behalf of Independents4Change, I would also like to express sympathy to Bob Barnes and his family on the passing of Monica. I did not know Monica but I have heard of her honourable and very distinguished record through tributes paid in the media and in this House.This year's repeal of the eighth amendment is a great tribute to her work and her foresight in opposing the amendment when it came in first. That has to be noted. On behalf of our group, I wish to express our condolences to her family.

We offer our sympathies to their families and indeed to the Fine Gael Party, to Monica's daughters and her husband, Bob, and others. The former Senator and Deputy was described by her daughter, Sarah, as an open and optimistic person and that she most definitely was. Although she and I had many differing views, I salute her courage and her integrity in standing up for what she believed in with passion and conviction. To her husband and family I offer our sincere sympathies for their loss. I worked with Paddy Harte in television and on radio and listened to his debates. To the Harte family, his wife Rosaleen, and, of course, the former Senator, Jimmy Harte, with whom I served on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I offer our sympathies. Paddy Harte came in here in 1961 and successfully contested 11 further general elections. That was no mean achievement. He was a colourful character and very passionate. His son, Jimmy, also distinguished himself when he was here and we miss him. I certainly miss Jimmy's company and his kind advice. Paddy was involved in many projects after he retired. The biggest one of all was the Island of Ireland Peace Park, which was opened by no less than the President of the day, Mary McAleese, Prince Albert of Belgium and Queen Elizabeth. He always pursued peace, long before it was fashionable, in the peace process and in tough and challenging times. Ar dheis Dé go raibh anamacha dílse an bheirt iarTheachtaí.

Ba mhaith liom ómós a thabhairt do Mhonica Barnes, laoch pearsanta domsa agus bean a bhí ar an scoil chéanna liomsa. Mar Sheanadóir agus mar Theachta, las sí soilse do mhná sa pholaitíocht nuair a bhí sé an-deacair dúinn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh. Sa seacht mí ó cailleadh í tá cácas na mban ag dul ó neart go neart, agus tá rian agus oidhreacht Mhonica le braith iontu siúd. Monica was a towering figure, a woman who made a difference and left a lasting impression, a fearless advocate. It is crucial that we remember that she was a fearless advocate in a very different time, in a less kind Ireland, in what was at the time a judgmental Ireland. It was a completely different place. But it never deterred her pioneering voice from articulating in a most persuasive way what she believed in. On a personal note, I have lost a fellow past pupil from our shared alma mater in the Barony of Farney, namely, St. Louis secondary school in Carrickmacross. Monica travelled to school from the neighbouring town of Kingscourt, as did many of my school friends when I was a student in St. Louis. As a young pupil there, I found her inspirational and we were very proud that she was the first past pupil from our school to be elected to Dáil Éireann. The last time I spoke to Monica was in Áras an Uachtaráin on International Women’s Day this year, when we took a photo together to mark the fact that we were the two past pupils of St. Louis who were elected to the Dáil. When I established the Oireachtas women’s parliamentary caucus last year, Monica’s campaigning voice was ever present. More importantly, her belief and support were invaluable and unwavering in reminding us in the caucus that although we may have come far since her days in Leinster House and have increased our representation in the Oireachtas, there is a long way to go. While we have all lost a dear friend, the greatest tribute we can make to Monica is to continue her pioneering work for women. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Paddy Harte. I concur with the comments made by others. The President recently spoke of the State's at times selective amnesia but Paddy Harte was never in that category. In respect of true reconciliation, he was ahead of his time.

The main purpose of my few words, however, is to speak about my ex-colleague from Dún Laoghaire, Monica Barnes. Monica was just unique in that there was no tradition in how she went about doing things. We stood together in 1981 and twice in 1982 - three elections in 18 months. She was eventually elected in November 1982 and served here for that term, until 1987, and served another term up to 1992. Then she retired. However, an election came along in 1997 and I decided I would call over to her. We each had the unique pleasure of living side by side in Arnold Park in a five-seat constituency. Arnold Park consists of approximately 80 or 90 houses and the residents had two sitting Deputies.

In any event, I called over to her, even though she had retired at that stage, and asked her if she would be interested in standing again. She said "Okay, I will." We set about it and she went off on her merry rounds. I never knew where she was and did not care where she was going because that is the type of candidate she was. We did not divide up the territory. She had her own people and, sure enough, she was re-elected. It was a unique experience to serve with somebody like that, especially in this day and age of cutthroat politics. People are always asking each other if they were at this public meeting or if they are attending that funeral. Monica went her way and I went mine. There were times, of course, when she would not agree with some of my views on some issues. However, most of the time I could fully agree with her way of thinking. It was a unique experience to serve with somebody like that in politics. It is a lesson to those who are thinking of coming into politics. They do not have to wear a banner around their necks. They can enter politics and say what they truly believe. If a candidate truly believes in something, he or she does not need a manifesto to knock on a door. People should say what they believe in. That is what Monica did. The best tribute I can pay to her is that she is the best example of somebody who stood up and said what she believed. Sometimes I did not agree with her but most of the time she had a way that I had to agree with her. I have to admit that as - at that time - a youngish, conservative-type candidate, I learned an awful lot from her. I learned that I had to be a bit liberal in this country and in this day and age. I extended my liberalism way beyond where I thought I would. Monica made a huge contribution to Irish public life.We need people like that, people who can change opinion by truly believing in a way of life. She is a great loss even though she had retired. The time I went over to her and asked her if she would come out of retirement, she thought about it and said she would. Lo and behold she stood and got re-elected. She was just unique. Very few people could do that. She had retired and she said she would stand again. She went her way and I went my way and she got elected. People often ask if there is a formula to get elected. The formula I learned from Monica was to be oneself and say what one truly believes in. May she rest in peace.

Is mór an trua dom freisin comhbhrón ó chroí a dhéanamh le teaghlach, le cairde agus le comhghleacaithe Monica Barnes. Táim an-bhródúil as a bheith ag leanúint i gcoiscéim Mhonica; mar Teachta do dháilcheantar Dhún Laoghaire agus mar bhean. Monica Barnes was a great friend and mentor. She was a formidable politician, who fought for women's rights throughout her life. She was elected to this House in November 1982. It is easy now, 18 years into the 21st century to forget the Ireland of 1982, 36 years ago, when Monica first entered the Dáil. Then, she was a shining light within a small group of progressives in a conservative party. Monica Barnes became politicised leaving Mass one Sunday in the 1960s. She bought a copy of Chains of Change a pamphlet published by the Women's Liberation Movement. She became active in the second wave feminist movement in the late 1960s and 1970s. She was involved with the Council for the Status of Women and merged feminist politics with party politics when she joined Fine Gael in the early 1970s. She was one of a number of feminist women who joined the party because of its vision for a just society. She was one of two Fine Gael Deputies to vote against inserting the eighth amendment into the Constitution in 1983. She was quoted in the Sunday Tribune in 1983:I decided I could only compromise myself up to a certain point. Women were the reason I was involved at all. If I kept quiet, as far as I was concerned, I was redundant as a politician.She received hate mail and verbal and physical abuse for her stance.  She supported divorce in 1985. She regularly spoke on women's rights in the Dáil and was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights from 1989 to 1992. In 1992, she famously wanted to put on the Dáil record her opposition to the fact that only party leaders and thus only men were able to make statements on the X case. On 18 February 1992 the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, stood in Dáil Éireann to outline details on Ireland’s injunction of a 14 year old girl. He was followed by a brief statement from each Opposition leader. As the Chair called time two Deputies from the backbenches rose to their feet - two of the 13 women who made up a Parliament of 166. Before both were ruled out of order, Monica Barnes remarked:May I comment on behalf of the women of Ireland and the women in this forum who have been excluded from making statements on this issue, that this is a reflection of the exclusion of women in all structures of our society.When the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stated it was not a point of order, Madeleine Taylor-Quinn said that it was a protest, but the House moved on. In an interview earlier this year Monica cheerfully admitted that Fine Gael’s old guard considered her a pain in the behind - I have slightly changed the quote. She also said: I did not get elected to the Dáil after all those years of working for women to sell them out. I had to stand up for women, and for the health and the future of women, that’s where I was in 1983.In that year she voted against the eighth amendment. It is appropriate that we recognise her in the year when we repealed it. She was an outspoken advocate for women's rights and on occasion expressed disappointment and anger over issues dealing with women. Speaking in a Dáil committee in November 2001, Monica succinctly summarised her own outlook and role in public life: I cannot emphasise enough that this country undermines and denies women's rights and status. This is not polemic and I am not making a political point. It is a personal, female perspective. I speak on behalf of half the population.Monica spoke for the marginalised and excluded, often at a time when it was easier to stay silent. She always spoke her mind. Her life was dedicated to campaigning and fighting for the rights of those who did not have a voice in the Ireland of the time. As was mentioned, she was a member of the Women's Parliamentary Caucus right up to her death. She had attended and contributed wholeheartedly to the latest meeting held here in the House.The Irish Times once captured her with a headline that read "Propelled by principle".

Déanaim comhbhrón le teaghlach uilig Harte agus le teaghlach uilig Barnes as a gcailleadh ollmhór. I acknowledge both families who are present. I do not want to go over ground that has already been commented on. My former colleague Paddy Harte was the standard-bearer for Fine Gael in my constituency for over three decades. I want to talk about the legacy he has left and impact he had on County Donegal. I contacted a number of former party stalwarts in the past week to pick up snippets of the extent of his impact and a measure of his contribution over those years. It came back to his major legacy which was one as a grassroots politician who was very much in touch with his local organisation in the constituency and very much hands on. His door was always open and was often opened by Rosaleen and his sons and daughters. The door was open not just from Monday to Friday, but was also open on Saturday and Sunday. I believe the door even opened to a constituent one Christmas Day. While it was a different time that access as a politician shows the type of politics we need to embrace because a politician who is not rubbing shoulder to shoulder with people or being with them is not in tune with their needs.I want to acknowledge his contribution and his commitment to the preliminary work done in advance of the signing of the peace agreement in 1998. He was very hands-on in relation to the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was very much involved in Sunningdale as well. He took risks as a politician, was ahead of his time and had a major impact. We are reaping the rewards of his work through the peace dividend we enjoy today.  I also wish to refer to Paddy's oidhreacht, meaning his legacy and heritage, and his wonderful appreciation of all things related to Donegal, Raphoe and the north west. In later years he spoke in very strong terms about his connections and his upbringing. His legacy in taking risks is something that we, as politicians, cannot forget. We must embrace the lessons learned from politicians like him. He was willing to put the politics of ambition and risk to the fore on behalf of the next generation and worked extraordinarily hard to ensure that people had better opportunities. He had a deep understanding of difference. When I was involved in peace and reconciliation work, I saw at first hand his efforts to try to understand both traditions and to bring people with him at a time many were entrenched in their views and positions.  I am also reminded of the insightful old Irish seanfhocal that I came across in Connemara - castar na daoine ar a chéile, ach ní chastar na cnoic ná na sléibhte - it is the people who meet together, not the hills and the mountains. The hills and mountains always drew Paddy Harte back but his overarching ambition was to bring people together through a deeper understanding of one another. He did that in a way that has left an enormous and rich legacy for the people and politicians who followed him.  I also wish to acknowledge Ms Monica Barnes through the words of my party colleague, former Deputy, Olivia Mitchell. I did not serve in this House with Ms Barnes but my colleague summed her up for me in three words: passionate, inspirational and generous. She was generous with her time and displayed an immense generosity of spirit. As Deputy Mitchell O'Connor said earlier, her passion for social change was unwavering and it was great for her, in her later years, to see the social change for which she fought for so long come to pass. Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas agus m'aitheantas a chur chuig an dá theaghlach as an tiomantas agus an gealltanas thar na blianta atá imithe thart, go háirithe an tiomantas chuig an chéad ghlúin eile.

Chaith mé tréimhse fhada anseo i gcomhar le Paddy Harte agus Monica Barnes. Bhí mé sa Dáil le Paddy ar feadh 16 bliain agus ar Chomhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall leis ar feadh 12 bliain. Ní raibh focal searbh idir an bheirt againn thar an tréimhse sin. Bhí Paddy ar taobh amháin agus mise ar an taobh eile, ach bhí caidreamh iontach eadrainn. Nuair a tháinig muid isteach anseo, bhíomar anseo mar Chonallaigh - seachas mar bhaill d'Fhianna Fáil nó Fine Gael - chun ár gcuid oibre a dhéanamh thar ceann na ndaoine i nDún na nGall a chuir muid anseo. Bhí ainm Paddy Harte fite fuaite le síocháin agus athmhuintearas, i bhfad sular cuireadh a leithéid ar bun go foirmeálta. Bhí Monica Barnes ag plé le cearta na mban ag an am céanna. Paddy Harte was a great friend and a great Donegal representative for many years. I am delighted to acknowledge the presence of his wife, Rosaleen and his children, Paddy Jnr, Mary, Anne, Róisín, Garrett, Emmet, Eithne, and Johnny and not forgetting the former Senator, Jimmy Harte. I am sure I speak for everyone when I wish Jimmy continued progress and good health.  Paddy Harte was first elected in 1961 and held his seat until 1997. Therefore, for a short period in his later years here, he was father of the House. He took over from the late Neil Blaney, who died in 1995 and was highly respected. Not alone did he represent north-east Donegal, he also had the distinction of representing all of Donegal. Those of us who are old enough will remember that he was elected to represent the great constituency of Donegal in 1977. I was youngish at the time and not yet a member of the council. I remember meeting him at the Butt Hall at that famous count in 1977. I served with him on the council from 1979 until 1991. As I said in Irish earlier, there was never a sharp word between us through all of those years, which is the way it should be. I came with one party flag and Paddy Harte came with another but when we came to Dublin, we wore the Donegal jersey with pride and carried the Donegal flag. Of course, working together as Deputies makes us stronger. Paddy Harte can be described as a committed politician, an advocate of justice and fairness and a true Donegal man. He never missed an opportunity to put issues affecting Donegal forward over the years and to make the case for further investment in our native county. I do not know what he would have to say now if he had to abide by the two-minute, seven-minute or ten-minute rule. One did not have to respect it in those days-----

He was always known in this House for his good counsel and advice. He was one for reaching out to others to advance different causes, not only in Leinster House but in practical ways and on many different occasions. Paddy Harte, in both politics and private life, will be remembered for highlighting the importance of co-existence. He grew up and lived by the Border during the difficult years but he reached out. He was reaching out to unionists in Northern Ireland long before it became popular to do so. He took many risks over the years and promoted peace on the island of Ireland. As many have said, this was demonstrated by the opening of Island of Ireland Peace Park at Messines. He did not just turn up on the famous day when it was opened by the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, the Queen of England and the King of Belgium. He had been working on that project for years prior to the opening day. He initiated FÁS schemes through which people went out to Messines to build that monument. I was very honoured to be there as well on that famous day.  I must acknowledge Paddy Harte on a personal level, on my own behalf and that of my wife and her sister, whom he visited on many occasions over the years. That may not have been popular either. No one can say a bad word about the Harte family or Paddy Harte in my house or my wife's house. We will never, ever forget him. He went on radio one day and defended us when others thought it would be difficult to defend us. He said that he was not defending the indefensible, but defending the defensible. I was ever so grateful to him for that.  Paddy Harte leaves behind him a legacy that will stand the test of time and that will be favourably recorded when history is written. He always believed in sharing and had a great understanding of our joint heritage and history, which is as it should be.He leaves a legacy of which Rosaleen, his family, his extended family and his grandchildren will be proud in the years to come. Ó thaobh Monica Barnes d'oibrigh mé anseo léi chomh maith agus is cuimhin liom bean a d'oibrigh go dian agus go dícheallach do chearta ban. Gúim gach rath Dé ar an mbeirt acu agus ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha uaisle, dílse.

In regard to the Barnes family, I had never met their mother, Monica, but I know from the tributes that have been presented that she was somebody her constituents were proud to call a local representative and whom her children were proud to call their mother. I am sure the pride they have in her is enhanced by what they have heard from her former colleagues and political representatives. From my county, I welcome the family of the late Paddy Harte: his dear wife, Rosaleen and his nine children, Jimmy, Paddy, Garrett, Mary, Anne, Róisín, Eithne, Johnny and Emmet. There is no doubt that Paddy gave tremendous service to the constituency of Donegal North-East, serving from 1961 to 1997. It is clear from his family taking up that baton that Paddy's strong ethos of public service is carried on in his family, whether through politics, involvement in the media or a commitment to local community. When I was growing up in Donegal and becoming politically conscious, Paddy Harte was one of the big names in the county, along with former Deputies Hugh Conaghan, Neil Blaney, the Coughlans, Jim McDaid and, of course, Deputy Gallagher. My grandfather, Willie Bradley from Dunree, an active party canvasser, knew him and canvassed for him. I am not sure how he would feel about his grandson, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, paying tribute to Paddy Harte. On my first occasion in the Dáil, as a sixth-class primary school student on a school tour from Donegal, Paddy was the Deputy who hosted us, and I remember well meeting him at the front of Leinster House and being introduced by my principal, Sarah McDermott. The event was set up by a local councillor, Bernard McGuinness, who was working alongside him that day. I am not sure whether they always worked as hand in glove as they did on that occasion, but there is no doubt they did at that time. I remember it well and it was a tremendous experience which awakened and developed my interest in politics from that time on. Having survived so many years in politics, particularly in Donegal politics, which is not easy, Paddy was not without craft. I remember one winter's night when I was still in school, a knock came to our front door, and it was Paddy Harte, who was apparently lost although I am not sure where he was going. We had a small, old-style country pub and shop that has since closed, and the next house over the road was another McConalogues', which happened to be a pub also. It was linked to Fine Gael and Paddy used to go there but he managed to get himself lost that night and rocked up to the door wondering where the other McConalogue pub was. The conclusion in the McConalogue household that night was that it was a cute move by Paddy to see whether my mother still held any links to her father's Fine Gael allegiances. He was innocently given directions to the pub down the road and was none the wiser as to the main mission we had concluded he was on. Paddy served at a time when politics was quite different, before social media. The commitment level was just as high but in a different way from now. Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the trip up and down to Donegal and, although the road is difficult now, when Paddy was doing it, prior to all the bypasses that were built in the past number of years, whether in Carrickmacross, Castleblayney or Ardee, it was certainly a much more arduous journey. His great contribution was the development of the Island of Ireland Peace Park in West Flanders, and its opening a year after Paddy finished working as a politician in 1998 was a strong commitment of his which displayed the type of politician he was, working closely with Glen Barr in achieving it. He was very much ahead of his time in his acknowledging the role and memory of the many Irish people who had died in the First World War. For a man who spent 35 years in politics, he very much enjoyed his retirement and did not give any outward display of missing politics. On the occasions I met him, he seemed interested in history and his pastimes, and heavily involved with his family. He continued to be outgoing and happy, and I know it was important to him and his family that his last days were spent in Lifford hospital, to which he had a strong affinity and commitment over the years. Notwithstanding his great legacy of 35 years as a politicians and his strong work on behalf of the people of Donegal, it was clear at his funeral that his greatest legacy was that of his nine children and 24 grandchildren. The pride which they all showed in him that day was representative of the pride he in turn had in all of them, and it is great to have them in attendance today. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

I share in the expressions of sympathy for the late, great Paddy Harte. It is my misfortune that I did not get to know him properly but, given the words that have been expressed, it is clear he was a great son, husband, father, grandfather and a tremendous asset to the country and politics. I share in the expressions of sympathy to his family, who are present. As a Dún Laoghaire Deputy who has done clinics every Saturday for the past decade, for which I hope I am not taking a retrograde step, it is with great pride that I pay tribute to the late Monica Barnes, who was a real trailblazer. When I consider what a privilege it is for me to be sitting as a Member of the House, I know I am here because of the great work and courage of women like Monica Barnes who came before me and laid down the strong foundations for us to be here today. Monica was always admired in the house in which I grew up, which was also full of strong, liberal women who outnumbered my father on many occasions. Owing to her party and the woman she was in principle, she was greatly respected and honoured not only in my house but in Dún Laoghaire. When Monica was first elected to the House in 1982 to represent the people of Dún Laoghaire, she also represented women the length and breadth of the island. She represented us all with fire, dignity and grace. She was committed to the idea of a fair and just society, and used her time in this House and the Seanad to advance women's rights in Ireland in all forms. She was the forerunner of the wonderful, strong, articulate, capable women who sit in the Oireachtas today. The women of Ireland have a duty and onus to keep that flag flying, whether in equal pay, healthcare, childcare or many other areas where Monica started the journey. Monica did the work she did in the House and outside of it because she believed it was the right thing to do. She stood her ground and fought for what she believed to be right. It may not have been the easy route to take many a time, but she made no apology for it, and her strong legacy lives on. My hope, which I hope is shared by all of us, is that history will never forget the great courage, compassion and wisdom of this great lady, and that we in the House can be inspired by her strong determination to do justice to those who elect us. I express my strong sympathy to Monica's family, who are in attendance.

The committee's report was published last week and contains two options. The first option would replace Article 41.2 with the following wording:The State recognises that home and family life gives to society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved. The State shall endeavour to support persons caring for others within the home as may be determined by law.This wording is in line with the previous recommendation of the task force set up in the Taoiseach's Department in 2016. The second option recommended postponing any referendum on the matter until the Government formally consulted with the public perhaps through the Citizens' Assembly. Given the deliberations of the joint committee, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will bring forward legislation seeking to amend the Constitution in line with the recommendations contained within the first option of the committee’s report?

If we can have that consensus, or if the consensus is secured, and provided the Attorney General's advice is favourable on the implications and interpretations of any new wording we put into our Constitution, that would enable us to legislate in the first quarter of next year before a referendum using the wording the Deputy quoted. It requires consideration by the Attorney General and by Cabinet first.

I understand the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has sought Cabinet approval for measures to strengthen the powers of the Residential Tenancy Board. We welcome the proposed extension of notice to quit periods but the Taoiseach needs to understand that this measure will prove fruitless unless the legislation contains the Focus Ireland anti-homeless amendment to end evictions of tenants in buy-to-let properties being sold or repossessed. Time and again the Taoiseach has shied away from delivering the solutions needed to end the ever-increasing number of families experiencing homelessness. Despite the tea and sympathy approach the Taoiseach takes these are real people, including children who will carry the scar of homelessness for the rest of their lives. Today we learn that homeless families living in hotels are to be unceremoniously kicked out for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. I have raised this issue before with the Taoiseach and he told me it would not happen, and not to panic. He cited, I think, the papal visit and other occasions. It is happening and today Elaine Wall bravely spoke up for her three children. I hope the Taoiseach heard her. How many families will be affected by the closure of hotels over Christmas and what measures have he and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government put in place to make sure these children have somewhere to sleep at Christmas time?

He stated:All departments have already examined the legislation that will be required for no deal. Priority will be attached in the new year to giving this legislation Dáil and Seanad time. Political support across the Dáil will be necessary to do this. Some measures have to be kept confidential at this stage in the national interest.It is apparent that the current withdrawal deal is facing real difficulties. Most commentators in Britain believe that it has no prospect of passing in the House of Commons. Will the Government publish the list of legislation that will be passed in the event of there being no deal and a disorderly exit at the end of March? We have a window over the Christmas recess for those of us in opposition to scrutinise and give detailed consideration to those sets of Bills if they are to come before us early in the new year, as the Tánaiste has indicated. Will the Taoiseach commit to giving party leaders a briefing on the secret Bills as the Tánaiste refers to them and the detail of the administrative preparations going on now to avoid a hard border and maintain the supply chains needed in this economy?

John White is prohibited from leaving Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, UAE. I have raised this matter on previous occasions with the Taoiseach and with Deputy Flanagan when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. John has been working in the Middle East for almost 30 years as a building contractor and because of debts owed to him, he was unable to meet financial commitments, was brought to court and sentenced to five years. On appeal that was reduced to 18 months. He served 18 months and was due to be released on 15 August 2014 but when he went to the courts to collect his passport he was informed that one of the companies had taken a civil case against him and he got another sentence of three years. He is now out of prison but has no passport and is unable to return to his young family. He is in poor physical health, although he has improved somewhat. Will the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade investigate the possibility of issuing a temporary passport to John so that he can return to his family for Christmas? Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to provide an immediate update to John's deeply distressed and devastated family?

Unfortunately, issuing a temporary or full passport would not solve the problem. He would not be allowed to leave the UAE. It is not a question of having a passport or not, it is a question of whether the UAE authorities would allow him to leave and at present they will not. I have written to Sheikh Khalifa about it and may have the opportunity to raise it personally with him at the EU-Arab summit in February.

That was in response to a question I put on cystic fibrosis. It applies now in respect of pembrolizumab. What progress has been made since Vicky Phelan came in here with Áine Morgan and Tracey Brennan who are in their 30s and 40s and told Deputies and Senators that they feel they are too young to die and they want equal access to pembrolizumab which has played a huge part in shrinking the tumours of other women? Women whose tests were messed up by the State are getting access but unfortunately the women who did not have their tests messed up cannot get access.We are talking about a small number. Could the Taoiseach now tell us that these women will be able to access the drug and that doctors should be allowed to prescribe whatever they feel is effective, and has proven to be effective, for other patients without waiting two years for a licence to be made available for its use for cervical cancer? Is it not time this country looked at bringing drug companies under public control so that they do not profiteer at people's expense?

An uair dheireanach a d'ardaigh mé é ná ar 5 Samhain. Tháinig freagra ar ais ag rá go mbeidh sé foilsithe le linn na seisiún seo. On the previous occasion that I raised it, the Taoiseach said it would be published within this session. Ta sé thar a bheith tábhachtach. Bliain na Gaeilge atá ann agus táimid ag caint faoi chearta búnusacha.

#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	225	It is nearly a year since the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published the Safe as Houses report, which recommended that the Government set up a scheme to remediate legacy defects in residential buildings. The Dáil called for same when it passed a Green Party motion in June 2017. Some affected homeowners from my constituency in Dublin Rathdown are currently outside Leinster House, marking another year with no movement from the Government on this issue. When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in October, he said that the Minister of State, Deputy English, was examining proposals and he admitted that there must be an understanding of the extent of the defects across the country so that such proposals could be drawn up. Has the Government made any moves towards investigating the extent of the latent defects in residential housing, with a view to drawing up a plan for practical State reliefs along the lines recommended in the Safe as Houses report and the Green Party motion on building standards or are the homeowners to remain abandoned by the Government?

The primary difficulty in all of this is that if the State, in effect the taxpayer, were to take on the liability for repairing defects in private homes and buildings, the costs could run into many billions of euro, which would then have to be taken out of other budgets, whether for social housing, health or through massive tax increases or action on climate change. That is the reality of the situation.

It is incredible that I have to again raise the Rosalie unit in Castlerea, County Roscommon. I want the Taoiseach to respond this time if he can because the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, cannot provide any more information. Elected members and the families of the patients were given assurances that there would be no interference or movement of patients from the unit. Incredibly, as we speak, every attempt is being made to move a lady from the unit. She has mild mental health issues and she was getting all the care she needed there but she is being moved to a private nursing home where she will not have the same level of care. I appeal to the Taoiseach to call off the proposed move. Could he stick to his promise that the review will go ahead in January and at least leave matters as they stand until that is done? It is not fair to those people or their families. I will not accept the same old answer again. I would like the Taoiseach to respond on the basis that when he was Minister for Health, a letter issued from his Department, as I pointed out previously, saying that the unit would not be closed.

For example, 135,000 people in Ireland are currently in receipt of British State pensions and approximately 70,000 are in receipt of private pensions from the UK. There are also reciprocal arrangements for State assistance such as child benefit. Many of those people are very concerned, and they need reassurance. Could the Taoiseach offer them that?

I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the Minister's proposal to apply a fine and penalty points to motorists who do not have their licence on them. There has been an outcry among farmers, fishermen and people working in construction, who have tractors and jeeps fully insured, taxed and with an NCT but given the nature of their jobs, they must use different vehicles daily and would find it impossible to carry a licence.

There has been very significant progress in the past 12 months, as the Deputy is aware. Since the programme for Government commitment was made, the budget has literally ballooned and has gone from €700 million five years ago to well in excess of €1 billion. Part of that is the rolling out of 7-7 care and then 24-7 care, on which there has been significant progress.

As the Taoiseach will know, given his profession, it is an acute illness of the lungs which causes breathing problems and leads to other ailments. To get through daily life, sufferers incur enormous costs due to the need for oxygen machines and medical prescriptions which do not qualify under the medical card. Will the Government recognise this illness as a long-term illness and, in so doing, allow people to get medical cards? I believe it can be done without imposing extra costs on the Department of Health.

The difficulty with the long-term illness scheme is that it does not have a statutory basis and, for that reason, it is not possible to add new illnesses to it without primary legislation, which would reopen the whole question of whether any of the illnesses on it should stay on it.

I want to raise the issue of JobPath and its privatisation through the two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec. After years of requests, we have finally got damning statistics relating to the privatisation of that service. The figures were given to the Committee of Public Accounts in recent weeks and they show that 190,000 citizens have been referred to those two companies at a staggering cost of €149 million. The most damning statistic is that of the 190,000 people referred, only 17,100 have been in sustained employment for over 12 months. Does the Taoiseach view it as value for money that €149 million has been spent and 17,100 jobs sustained? Given those damning statistics, will he immediately stop the referral of people to Seetec and Turas Nua?

If one examines the statistics, and I have not done so, although I will take a look at them, what one has to compare with is the counterfactual - that is, with those who were not referred to JobPath or Intreo - to see if there is a difference as to whether they were able to hold onto sustained employment or not.

All of them were coming with a deep concern, particularly in the context of Brexit. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to continue to fund these agencies and to make sure the Border corridor is not adversely affected by Brexit. These groups are extremely concerned about how they are going to survive into the future. Basically, they ask that we put a plan in place. Both Governments need to come together and come up with a short-term plan, not a long-term plan, with funding and resources to ensure this area of the island, which will be most adversely affected by Brexit, and these agencies have an assurance they will get the kind of funding and resources they need so they can work into the future. I would like a commitment from the Taoiseach that he will work with counterparts in the British Government to come up with a solution so a project can be put forward and funding delivered for these communities.

In fact, if anything, it will become more important than ever after Brexit. The Deputy has that commitment on my behalf.

In order to achieve that objective, repairs or alterations have to be done to a house in many cases. There is a scheme of State grants for alterations in those circumstances and there has been increased provision for this lately, which I welcome. Unfortunately, there are serious defects in the administration of this scheme and how it is operated by various local authorities. It is extremely slow and tedious and it operates unevenly between one local authority and another. What we are proposing is a system which would bring uniformity to this area and would enable these grants to be processed much more speedily and efficiently. It is a humane measure. It would enable people who are ill or elderly and who wish to live with their own family, or their family members, to get the grant so the patient or elderly person could move into the accommodation as quickly as possible, certainly much more quickly than at present. I urge the Government to adopt the Bill. Deputy O'Rourke will explain how it will operate.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	280	I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Bill with my colleague, Deputy O'Dea. The thinking behind this, as Deputy O'Dea outlined, is to make the system more efficient and effective and to have it operate evenly across all counties with a universal approach. At the moment people are unnecessarily delayed in nursing homes and hospitals due to the amount of time needed to process and approve grants, which take approximately six months on average across all local authorities. We know people who are elderly or ill are more comfortable and independent when living in their own home, and this is about making the process more efficient. Our proposal, which we hope is accepted by other parties, is that when an application is made, it is put forward to the local authority with an occupational therapist's report, whether from the community or the hospital, with a proposal from a registered builder or architect, and accompanied by two quotations. When all that is furnished to the local authority with proof of the person's income and proof they have paid the local property tax, all of which are part of the current process, a decision would be made on the application within a month in order to give some continuity and efficiency to the system. This is very important for the applicant, who will know they are being approved for the grant and what level of funding is approved. In addition, it obviously helps the process by preventing unnecessary delays in regard to bed-blocking in hospitals and nursing homes. It also gives some certainty to people making the application as to when they will get back into their own home.This is hugely important for those involved. They need to have this work done on their homes. It can be a difficult and traumatic time for them and it is very sensitive for families. This is an important Bill. The funding is in place in local authorities so no additional cost will be imposed. It is about making the system more transparent, efficient and effective and helping those in need to get meaningful and timely access to the funding. We do not propose any major changes to the current process, we propose only to make it more efficient and pragmatic. I hope we get the support of the House for the Bill. It is end-user driven and that is who it seeks to help. It seeks to provide easier access to decisions and outcomes. No additional cost will be imposed on applicants who are already engaging with the occupational therapist in the community or hospital setting. As such, applicants get the recommendations from professionals who are registered and tax compliant. The proposed legislation is therefore above board and in keeping with the current system and seeks simply to create efficiencies.

The origins of the Bill lie in the concerns of the cancer care community. There is growing concern among clinicians who see the effects of false claims due to a lack of regulation in the area. There are no adequate safeguards in place to address unproven and, at times, dangerous suggested cures or treatments which are pushed on those who receive cancer diagnoses. The Bill proposes provisions to prosecute those who are making large sums of money by peddling things they claim can cure cancer when there is no evidence to support those claims. These people are selling treatments which, at best, have no effect whatsoever but which at their worst increase pain and suffering and often hasten death. It is not the patient who will be found at fault under the proposals in the Bill, rather it will be those who profit from promoting products of dubious or dangerous composition or efficacy. Anyone who advertises a treatment or therapy that has been proven to be effective will be exempt from prosecution under the Bill. Likewise, doctors, nurses and others working in the field of oncology or cancer care will be exempt also. Similarly, patient access to clinical trials will not be affected, nor will emerging research and study in the fields of cancer research, clinical care or treatment. Many medical professionals have been calling for this legislation for some time as they have watched patients pursue pathways that can seriously interfere with their medical treatment. There is no end to the sad and frightening stories oncologists, nurses, families, patients and dieticians working in this area have to tell. RTÉ's "Prime Time" with Conor Wilson did great work to expose some of these practices in a special programme which aired some weeks ago. It was an excellent example of public service broadcasting in the truest sense, notwithstanding the deeply upsetting narrative. It is for the people we may know who are going through cancer treatment and the people we have lost that this Bill is presented to the House. I urge the Opposition to support the Bill and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to introduce it.

We have seen enormous improvements in cancer care in Ireland over the past few decades with the result that more people with cancer now survive than die. We will continue to see improvements in that regard as screening and prevention improve and as we make improvements to our cancer care centres. However, I share the real concern about the exploitation of many people who are sick with cancer by those offering cures and treatments which do not work along with various other false health claims. They do so for profit and abuse immensely vulnerable people. As such, the legislation is timely and I welcome the fact that it is on First Stage today.

On Thursday afternoon, we will focus on the multi-annual financial framework and follow that work with a discussion on external relations in the evening. On Friday, the meeting will begin with a discussion of citizen consultation on the future of Europe followed by an exchange on the Single Market. The euro summit will take place at lunchtime. Other issues to be discussed include migration, the challenge posed by large-scale disinformation, the fight against racism, xenophobia and climate change. I will focus my remarks today on the Single Market, migration, disinformation and external relations as well as on the euro summit. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will speak about the other European Council issues in greater detail in her statement. However, I will turn first to Brexit, which we will also discuss in Brussels on Thursday in Article 50 format. The UK Government has postponed the planned vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons and there have been further developments this morning within the Conservative Party. As I said before, the withdrawal agreement, of which the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop, is an integral part, has been endorsed by the European Union and agreed with the UK Government. Therefore, it carries the support of 28 Governments. It is the result of over 20 months of complicated technical negotiations and represents a carefully balanced compromise among 28 states. It is the best possible deal to protect the European Union's interests and those of the United Kingdom to ensure an orderly withdrawal and it cannot be renegotiated. The European Union and the 27 member states are united on this. We should not forget that the backstop is not just an Irish issue. It is there to prevent the emergency of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but it is also there to protect the Single Market and ensure that an open Irish border does not become a back door to the European Union. As such, it is a European issue too. We should recall that a UK-wide backstop rather than a Northern Ireland specific one was included at the request of the UK Government. It is important to bear in mind that the United Kingdom took the decision to leave the European Union and thereafter the UK Government set out a number of red lines, including no customs union, no Single Market, no free movement of people and no recognition of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The agreement we reached was achieved, working around the constraints, by drawing around the UK's red lines. The European Union has always stated that if the United Kingdom's approach to the future relationship evolves and the red lines are erased, we will be willing to take that into account in the negotiations on the future relationship treaty in accordance, of course, with our guidelines and based on the balance between rights and obligations. I hope that the withdrawal agreement will be ratified by the UK Parliament and the European Parliament in due course, but the Government, in close co-operation with the EU, is continuing its work to prepare for all possible outcomes including the central case scenario and the no-deal scenario. We are accelerating the recruitment of customs officers and veterinary health inspectors and we are developing infrastructure in ports and enabling legislation. We will be as ready as we can be for all eventualities. Whatever happens, Ireland will remain at the heart of the European Union, the eurozone and the Single Market in the common European home we helped to build. Four times in our nation's history we have travelled a different path from that of Britain: when we became independent and founded the Free State; when we declared a republic; when we floated the punt; and when we joined the euro without the United Kingdom. On each occasion there were risks, challenges, opportunities and a transition period, but on each occasion we emerged stronger and wealthier. That will be the case again.  My final remark on Brexit is to recognise the noteworthy contrast between the political situation here in Dublin and that in London. Both the United Kingdom and Ireland are faced with existential threats because of Brexit. However, we have a degree of political stability and a degree of consensus across the House. That makes our country a much better place and puts it in a much stronger position as these negotiations continue. The Single Market, which marks its 25th anniversary this year, is one of the great achievements of the Union. It has brought about increased employment, increased trade and greater competition and higher living standards for our citizens. It has also given us, as European citizens, the freedom to work or study anywhere in the Union. Its further development is essential to ensure Europe's continued competitiveness on the world stage. This is a priority for Ireland as a trading country. We have been working closely with like-minded partners to ensure a high level of political ambition with a particular focus on unlocking the Single Market's full potential in the areas of digitalisation and trade in services. Our approach is informed by the work led by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, in conjunction with her counterparts in Finland, Denmark and the Czech Republic. Last month, they launched a report commissioned from Copenhagen Economics entitled Making EU Trade in Services Work for All. This meeting of the European Council also provides a timely opportunity to reflect on the implementation of the comprehensive approach to migration agreed at the June Council meeting. Europe can only respond effectively to large migratory flows by working together and I support the three-pronged approach we agreed in June. These three prongs are: securing our external borders, strengthening co-operation with countries of transit and origin, and dealing with the management of migrants within the EU on the basis of solidarity. The European Union needs an asylum system that can respond effectively to large-scale migratory movements, both legal and illegal. We are engaged in efforts to reform the common European asylum system. Discussions on controlled centres and disembarkation platforms have taken place in recent months. As I have stated previously, we would only seek to progress these initiatives if we were satisfied that they would be fully compliant with our obligations under international law. We continue to co-operate closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and the International Organization for Migration to this end. Collaboration with these organisations is also an important part of our efforts to support our African partners both through Irish Aid and the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. We have pledged €15 million for this purpose. This is the third highest contribution per capita in the European Union. The global compact on migration, which was signed at Marrakesh earlier this week - with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, representing the Irish Government - reflects the need for co-operation at a global level without dictating how states should determine their own policies. It is regrettable that some EU member states did not participate in the compact. I hope they will revisit this decision in the future. Following our discussions at the June Council meeting, the Commission will present its action plan against disinformation. I fully support the efforts to see off this evolving threat. It is important that we work together to counter disinformation activities that threaten our shared democracy. The plan sets out four things we must do, namely: improve detection, analysis and exposure of disinformation; strengthen co-operation to enable a more cohesive response; engage with industry; and raise public awareness and support quality media and journalism. It is essential that the electoral process is safeguarded from inappropriate online interference and manipulation and that we respect international law and fundamental rights. The open policy forum held in Dublin Castle on 6 December examined some of the issues related to this including the regulation of transparency of online political advertising. The EU must act in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way and I look forward to discussing this further with EU partners. On external relations, we will discuss preparations for the summit between the European Union and the Arab League, which is scheduled to take place in Cairo in February. Recent developments in Russia and Ukraine are also likely to be discussed. The Government is gravely concerned about the increasing militarisation of Crimea and the Sea of Azov. We support calls for all sides to de-escalate the situation. Ireland is unwavering in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and we do not recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea. As part of our efforts to develop relations with Ukraine, we will open an embassy there as part of the Global Ireland 2025 initiative. I firmly believe that unity at EU level must continue to be the cornerstone of our approach to Russia. The EU is at its strongest when it speaks with one voice and I will emphasise this in my engagement with European partners. We will also have an exchange on the fight against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. Ireland fully supports the ongoing efforts in this area, including the Council's declaration on 6 December on the fight against anti-Semitism. All states share a duty to work towards achieving societies that are free of inequality, repression and discrimination in accordance with their international obligations. The focus of our discussions at the euro summit will be on strengthening and deepening economic and monetary union. The summit is expected to endorse the positive outcome of negotiations among Finance Ministers in recent months. These negotiations recently saw agreement reached on the reform of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which will now have additional responsibilities in the areas of crisis prevention and resolution in the eurozone and in advancing banking union. I welcome these positive developments which mark a further step in the development of economic and monetary union and which will serve to strengthen the resilience of our banking system and the overall stability of the eurozone. I expect that some will also want to discuss the possibility of a budgetary instrument for the eurozone as part of the multi-annual financial framework. This is a proposal which we are open to considering. I look forward to reporting back to the House next week on 19 December on the outcome of these meetings.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	293	According to current legislation, Brexit will take effect in 107 days. The deal on the table was reached after two years of tortuous and repetitive negotiations. It is a deal which reflects the commitments made by both the United Kingdom and the European Union to Ireland from late 2016 onwards. It is a good deal for all involved. It would allow for an orderly transition period, reduce the short-term economic damage and allow time to develop a long-term model for co-operation. Regardless of how good it is, a deal which will not or cannot be ratified ultimately becomes inoperable and worthless. In the nearly three weeks since the deal was agreed we have all witnessed an escalating political crisis in London. It was the intention of the UK Government to hold a vote last night. There is no prospect of another vote being scheduled for some time. There are many scenarios but unfortunately there is no clarity. While Prime Minister May works to salvage the current deal she is confronted with a political class which has descended into open warfare between angry factions. Today’s no confidence motion is only the latest outbreak from members of a fundamentalist group in her own party who seem to be determined to destroy all around them rather than ever compromise. Their extreme Europhobia has developed over 40 years and it will not respond to evidence or reason. It would be wonderful to be able to dismiss what is happening in London as a sideshow but we cannot do so. Ireland and Europe are directly affected. Regardless of whether Prime Minister May survives today, the core blockage to any deal remains. There is an overwhelming majority of MPs standing against the withdrawal agreement but there is no route to a majority for any alternative course of action.The only thing which is clear is that no one has the faintest idea what the course of Brexit will be in the coming weeks and months and potentially for much longer than that. With the exception of the fundamentalist fringe of the Conservative Party and, unfortunately, the DUP, all accept the idea of a guaranteed open Border in Ireland but they do not agree on the wider issue of the UK's relationship with the European Union. The fact is that this is at its core. It is not about negotiations with the European Union; it is about a debate within British politics and society over which we have little or no influence. This period of growing chaos and uncertainty is not one we can assume will come to a halt by 29 March. Regardless of whether the deal is ratified, and there is still hope that this may happen because of the damage which any alternative will cause, the risk of a no deal outcome has risen dramatically. Circumstances have changed and we must respond accordingly. Ireland is now in a period of heightened danger for our economy and for a political settlement which has been a beacon of light in our modern history. This is not a crisis of our making but it is a crisis which we all have an urgent duty to respond to. Let nobody be in any doubt, every single piece of evidence suggests that the impact of Brexit is under way and may escalate significantly. Far more worryingly, the evidence also shows that Ireland is nowhere near ready for many of the outcomes which have become far more likely in recent days. While past research has shown the medium-term and long-term impact of different Brexit scenarios this morning’s quarterly economic review includes a study of the impact in 2019. Using a very conservative approach, it states that a no deal outcome will reduce GNP growth by roughly 1.4%. That is a loss of €3.5 billion in only the eight months following Brexit. The shock will initially be concentrated in the trading sector but will, according to the report, be transmitted through that sector to the wider economy. This carries with it an immediate knock-on impact on public finances. While we have requested that the Minister for Finance publish details of the impact of a no deal scenario, a rough estimate shows that a hole of at least €1 billion will open in the budget figures for next year and this will escalate in subsequent years. The Government’s budget assumes an orderly Brexit, with a lengthy withdrawal period and no sudden shifts in policy. Two months after the budget his assumption is simply no longer valid. In fact, things could get much worse than this forecast suggests because it does not factor in a major devaluation of sterling or administrative chaos in the move to new systems. According to the Central Bank and others, the impact of Brexit is already here. The bank’s latest report has identified evidence of trade with the United Kingdom being hit and causing a slowdown in expectations. My colleagues from Border constituencies, in particular, are reporting that companies are already struggling from lost competitiveness and heightened uncertainty. Consumer confidence has been hit and there is a growing sense of unease and even fear about what lies ahead. Analysis by State agencies suggests that sterling devaluation is the biggest threat to many exporters, especially Irish-owned companies. Some 47% say they face serious difficulties as a result of the exchange rate reached this week, with most of the remaining firms facing serious difficulties if the exchange rate falls a further 10%. The hit to Irish business from Brexit-related devaluation is deep. Since David Cameron announced the date for the referendum in 2016, sterling has fallen by 25% against the euro. It really does not matter how efficient or dynamic one's business is, a 25% loss of competitiveness is enormous and is an existential threat. Yesterday, the Government announced that it will ramp-up preparations for a no deal scenario. This is the third time this year that the Government has announced such a ramping-up, yet the available evidence is that Ireland is nowhere near ready for a no deal scenario. This morning the Tánaiste detailed some preparations in the hope that they would impress us all. In fact, his article leaves a very worrying impression. He stated that the Government "does not take ratification of the deal as a given", however, it has taken this as a given in the budget and in the fact that no Ireland-specific no deal guidance has been issued. Brexit has been a core political issue for my party since before the referendum was held. In the past two years I, as well as our spokespeople, Deputies Donnelly and Chambers, have regularly pushed the Government on levels of preparation. The only response has been to claim that everything is fine. Unfortunately, the evidence suggests preparations which are incomplete and some of which are really only starting at the very last minute. With little more than 100 days to go, it is no achievement to be citing the numbers of companies seeking basic information or the number of applications received for jobs. We cannot afford a repeat of what we have seen from the Government in so many other policy areas where spin about activity levels is used to cover up the lack of action on the ground. The facts published by Government show that only a minority of impacted companies have preparations in place. Few have currency hedging strategies. Few have begun procedures for essential freight travel registrations. Minor grant schemes are helping a minority of companies in small but important ways. However, significant funding for cashflow disruption, tackling loss of competitiveness and diversification has not been distributed. The short-term loan scheme has allocated only 5% of its funding while the long-term loan scheme will not have distributed a single euro by next March. The Government itself does not appear to be anywhere near the needed level of preparedness.  The Taoiseach yesterday mentioned a series of actions which are required for a no deal scenario, none of which has had funding allocated or legislation published. The situation is that Ireland is facing a major threat and great uncertainty. This poses a direct challenge to everyone in this House as to how we react. Business as usual is not acceptable. Can we show our ability to put the national interest ahead of party interests? As things stand, the first period of the agreement, which allowed the formation of this Government, is ending. My party entered this agreement in 2016 because it was the only way of being true to what we had promised our voters while also fulfilling the basic democratic responsibility on any parliament to form a government. In spite of many provocations and difficulties, we have honoured our commitments. This has included refusing to respond to the Taoiseach’s attempts over recent months to find an excuse to increase instability and undermine his own Government. There has been no talk from us about oiling printers or careless talk about elections in the middle of sensitive negotiations. This is why in October we took the unprecedented decision to state that we would not support an election until some certainty on Brexit had been reached at earliest. No one can now seriously question that our decision then was the right one for Ireland. This has ensured that we have been able to proceed with a detailed review of the implementation of the confidence and supply agreement. We refused to move straight to a negotiation and insisted on a deep review in critical areas, including health, housing, education, Brexit and public finances. Fianna Fáil’s participants in this review have detailed the outcomes for me and these have been reported to our parliamentary party. The review has unfortunately confirmed a complacency and lack of urgency in government. There is no understanding that the public has a right to be concerned at near-systematic failures to deliver on housing, health and many other issues. Equally there has been an attempt to stonewall us regarding basic information about fiscal reserves. While the Taoiseach has announced that there is no problem with an unfunded €3 billion tax give-away, his Minister for Finance will not justify this claim. The chronic deficit in delivery, the failure to understand public concerns, and the increased politicisation of public funding points to the need for a new Government. In normal times, there would be no issue. An election now would be the right thing for our country. However, these are not normal times and Ireland is immediately confronted with one of the biggest threats for many decades. It is a threat which is not just of a short-term nature; it impacts on the core economic, social and political future of this island. To replace this Government would require a lengthy election campaign and most likely a lengthy period of Government formation. In 2016, this entire process took four months to complete. Fianna Fáil is determined that the political chaos we see in London will not be allowed to spread to Ireland. We simply do not believe that the national interest could in any way be served by taking up to four months during next year to schedule and hold an election campaign and then form a government. With business and communities already fearful about the impact of Brexit and with Ireland manifestly not ready for many of the potential outcomes, how could it possibly be in the national interest to have extended political uncertainty next year?This is why Fianna Fáil will extend a guarantee that Government will be able to operate throughout 2019. This will allow the introduction of any emergency legislation and budgets, as well as the full end of year budget and associated legislation. This will in turn allow the holding of an election early in the following year. Free of Brexit uncertainty, there can be an election about the need for a new approach to housing, ending systematic political failures in health and addressing the needs of people who want a Government that understands their concerns. This decision has been reached reluctantly but it is unavoidable. We have all seen in Northern Ireland what happens when political parties undermine the functioning of government at a moment of critical risk. Northern Ireland's position has suffered dramatically from political game-playing and the absence of a democratic voice. The majority in Northern Ireland and in the Northern Ireland Assembly want to remain and also support the current deal. The absence of the Assembly and Executive has empowered people who believe the opposite. In the next few weeks we will seek to finalise as much as possible critical concerns which have been the focus of the review. Specifically, these are actions required to minimise the impact of a no-deal Brexit; the chronic under-delivery of commitments in health, housing and supports for children; the likely and potential state of public finances in 2019 and 2020; and the unacceptable politicisation of public spending through the sidelining of expert agencies in funding decisions in areas such as culture, rural affairs, local development and research. If the Government shows good faith, this can be completed quickly. Of course, we cannot guarantee that the Government will not undermine itself and stumble out of office, but it is receiving a guarantee of stability unprecedented for a minority government in its situation. If we could have a new Government in days then we would be able to act differently but it will take a process of months and Ireland does not have months in which it can indulge in putting politics before the people's interests. Tomorrow morning, I will meet colleagues from throughout the European Union, including eight members of the European Council. I will tell them that Ireland will be a stable and reliable partner for them in the months ahead. The contagion of political chaos will not spread here from London. There is a clear majority in Dáil Éireann which will ensure stability and the national interest will be put first.

Bravo, Deputy Micheál Martin. Well done. That is some kind of stability, as described by the soldiers of destiny. However, I will go on to more prosaic matters, which might be less provocative and upsetting to the delicate souls on the Fianna Fáil benches. The European Council will meet to discuss the shambles that is Brexit. Once again, the Council must remain resolute in its view that the withdrawal agreement that has been negotiated in good faith between Britain and the EU, including the Irish protocol in particular, cannot be renegotiated, diluted and picked apart in any way, shape or form. I made the point previously that any type of Brexit will represent a very bad day for Ireland, North and South. The withdrawal agreement cannot, and will not, change that. Even it is ultimately agreed, as the least worst option, it will still be a bad day for our country. It is by no means perfect and the political declaration relating to the future relationship remains aspirational. However, it must be acknowledged that the withdrawal agreement on offer mitigates against some of the worst aspects of Brexit. The so-called backstop is a mechanism to reduce the damage caused by Brexit and nothing more. It is not a panacea for all of Brexit's ills. It is an insurance policy that ensures there will be no hardening of the Border on our island and that the interests of citizens in the north, the majority of whom voted against Brexit, will be protected. It is a means of recognising in some small way the democratic will of the majority of the people of the North who voted to remain in the European Union. The four pro-remain parties in the North - Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Alliance party and the Green Party - which represent the majority, believe there is no such thing as a good Brexit. We accept that the majority of ordinary people across the island and those in business and in civic society do not want Brexit, and that we have a shared responsibility to protect jobs, our economic stability and people's livelihoods. That is essential. In contrast, the DUP does not speak for the people of the North on Brexit; we do.

We have been clear in stating that the Government’s approach to negotiations had to be guided by the fact that citizens in the North voted to remain and that democratic verdict had to be respected. We are glad that has been the case, for the most part, and I have acknowledged the work of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and, more importantly, Irish officials on that, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee. I am happy to do that again. We are now at the end of the negotiating process and the outcome is far from clear. On Monday, the British Prime Minister shelved her plan for a "meaningful vote" because it was clear that it was going to be defeated by a substantial margin. That and the overnight machinations in London heightened the prospect of a no-deal scenario or crash scenario. No one here wants that but it is now a distinct possibility which needs to be faced up to, not accepted as an inevitability or fait accompli but a prospect that needs to be met. In the absence of the withdrawal agreement and the backstop contained therein, there is no way of guaranteeing no return to a hard border. On the contrary, there will be an automatic hardening of the Border. Citizens' rights will automatically be undermined and the Good Friday Agreement automatically sabotaged. I have repeatedly made it clear to Theresa May - and I put this to the Taoiseach here yesterday and again today - that in the event of a crash-out Brexit, or a no-deal scenario, we in Sinn Féin believe it will be necessary to put the constitutional future of the North to the people in a unity referendum. I firmly believe it is time for the Taoiseach to take up that position. If the people of the North are to be disregarded in this process, then they must have their say. This is a reasonable position which I believe all parties here should support. Uniting our country would end the need for a backstop definitively and permanently. As the Taoiseach rightly pointed out earlier, the Border in Ireland is no longer simply a problem for us but a European problem, not least, as he said, because it presents a real and present danger to the integrity of the beloved Single Market. The debate about Irish unity is well under way regardless of what position the Taoiseach might adopt but it is time to accept that Irish unity is now the logical and sensible option to put an end to this messing once and for all.Deputy Pearse Doherty and I spoke to Ms Theresa May last night and reminded her again that in the absence of an agreement, a unity referendum must be called as a matter of urgency. I also told her that the basic protections contained in the backstop are non-negotiable and cannot be unpicked or diluted. The British Government signed up to an agreement last December to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to avoid a hard border and to put in place a legally enforceable backstop. That agreement must be honoured, even in the midst of the madness at Westminster. The current position of some in the Conservative Party and the DUP is reckless and irresponsible. We need a deal that recognises the unique circumstances that present for our island. This is critical to safeguard investment and to protect jobs, trade, the integrity of the peace process and our citizens' rights. This is what is required. Nothing short of this is acceptable. The Taoiseach and the Government must stand firm on that point and the EU must remain true to its word that without an agreed, legally enforceable backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement. I hope the Taoiseach will bring that message to Brussels tomorrow and I hope he will consider, perhaps quietly away from this Chamber, the necessity to look to the prospect of a crash and all of the long-term damage that presents and begin planning the pathway for constitutional transition because it is surely upon us.

Regardless of what happens today in Westminster, we have to make a number of observations about Brexit, the obvious one being that there is a withdrawal agreement on the table which provides basic protections for the North in the event of a no-deal Brexit. These include maintaining cross-Border co-operation, supporting the all-island economy and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. It will do this by ensuring that the North essentially remains in the customs union and large elements of the Single Market. This is not ideal and the Taoiseach will accept that the best solution for Ireland is no Brexit and the entire island remaining in the EU. The issue for Westminster is that large elements of the backstop would apply to Britain as well. It would also mean more checks between Britain and the North and this would essentially mean Britain effectively remaining in elements of the customs union. This is the reason the hard right in the Tory Party wants the backstop dropped. We have all heard the clamour from some on the hard right of the Tory Party, and the DUP, for the backstop to be dropped. Can the Taoiseach assure this House, the people of this State and the remaining people on the island of Ireland that the terms of the backstop are non-negotiable? The EU Council will be under pressure to give some leeway to Prime Minister, Theresa May. While she is seeking clarifications, the message that must go out from the European Union and the Irish Government is that there cannot be any renegotiation on the terms of the backstop or the agreement that has been reached, which was voted on and passed by this House. A backstop that is temporary cannot be a backstop. The best way for those in Britain who are concerned about the backstop to ensure it is not temporary is for Britain to remain in the customs union and elements of the Single Market. This is a matter for them and they have to face up to that reality. Last weekend, one Tory MP threatened to starve Ireland unless the backstop is changed. Yesterday, an unnamed Tory MP said that the Irish need to know their place. We know our place. Ireland's place, North and South, is in the European Union. As stated by Teachta McDonald, in the event of a hard crash by Britain from the European Union - Sinn Féin does not want to countenance a hard crash but it is somewhat outside of the control of politicians in Ireland - we will have to plan for every eventuality. In my view, and as indicated by the opinion polls, an increasing number of people in the North want a united Ireland in that scenario, such that there will be a responsibility on the Government to prepare for such an eventuality. No amount of hand wringing and statements that this cannot happen can take away from that reality. Nobody wants a hard crash. We all want a deal passed by the House of Commons and put in place but if that does not happen, then every eventuality has to be examined.  The people of this State cannot have confidence in what we heard from the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach in respect of a no-deal Brexit or a hard crash. We are not hearing of any preparation and people, farmers and businesses are concerned. For example, companies in the south east that export to Britain, employ large numbers of people, and are affected by the currency fluctuations, and that would be affected disastrously if there was a hard Brexit, are also concerned. It is not only people in the North but people across the island of Ireland who will be affected. There can be no negotiation downwards on what has been agreed. A hard Brexit will result in a drop of between 4% and 7% in GDP for the South and potentially the loss of thousands of jobs.  Collectively, we have all got behind getting a solution for Ireland. We all want a deal that protects Ireland from the worst effects of Brexit. We all accept that Brexit is not good, that there is no good outcome and no good Brexit. We all want a deal to be put in place that will avoid a hardening of the Border and protect the Good Friday Agreement but some in Britain do not want this to happen, will attack the backstop and have no difficulty using Ireland as collateral to get their Brexit through. On behalf of the people we represent, that cannot happen. The people of the North, and this island, need these basic protections fully protected. My message for the Taoiseach is that there can be no renegotiation of those basic protections that collectively we have secured for the people of our island.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	319	Technology is advancing relentlessly. Every year, workers, businesses and consumers have to adjust to new ways of working. Some jobs decline and new occupations emerge. Businesses and workers have to adapt. The downside is that technology is voracious in its appetite for energy and too reliant on fossil fuels which have caused climate change and the destruction of the natural world. All of these challenges mean that the work of Government is never done. Government is needed to provide leadership on climate action, job security and the just transition that the planet now requires. Governments cannot stand still. The same applies to the EU Council. When the Council meets on Thursday, one member state, the United Kingdom, will project its turmoil onto the other 27 members, as it has done periodically throughout its membership. Sometimes, the UK's disruptive influence has been beneficial in shaking up or confronting bureaucracy and giving the EU more urgency on trade with the wider world. On other occasions, such as now, the UK's influence is just disruptive. In her statement this morning, the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, said:The people want us to focus on the other vital issues that matter to them, including building a stronger economy, delivering first class public services and the homes that families need. These are the public's priorities.Mrs. May was speaking about the British people but the same is true of the Irish people and people of every nation across the EU. There is no doubt that future generations in the UK will look back at the lost years when Brexit caused a lack of progress on so many important fronts. As the Taoiseach said, the EU Council agenda is wide. To what extent has dealing with Brexit slowed down, distracted or impeded the progress of the EU on the pressing issues I have mentioned? On the substantive issues of the Council meeting, this will be the first discussion of the 2021-27 multi-annual financial framework, MFF, for the EU. I recall the detailed discussions at the conclusion of the last MFF. First, are all background papers and projections being prepared on the basis that the UK will definitely be out of the Union by 2021 or are separate scenarios being drawn up that would include either a UK contribution to the EU budget or even a scenario based on UK full membership should a second referendum be held in the United Kingdom? Second, to what extent does this seven-year framework involve a stronger social pillar? Throughout Europe we have witnessed the rise of far right, nationalists and populists feeding on people’s insecurities. Many of those insecurities relate to precarious work, unaffordable housing and weakened public services. The far right has scapegoated migrants and asylum seekers, but European socialist and labour parties know that the problem is largely to do with inequalities created and maintained by the economy. What will change in the next seven-year EU spending framework to address these issues and support jobs and people's living conditions in a way that is genuinely fairer? The Council will discuss the Single Market. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has said we have only 12 years left to take decisive action to prevent the worst climate change scenarios becoming a reality. To what extent is the EU Council deliberating on Single Market reforms that will make our economies more ecologically sustainable, with the radical reduction in emissions and fossil fuel use which is now manifestly required? It is amazing to think that this will be the last full seven-year spending cycle in which we will be able to do the heavy lifting on climate action. Within 12 years it will be too late. What changes are planned for the Single Market in that context? The Council will also discuss migration. In that regard, the Labour Party supports the UN's global migration pact as the foundation of a humane and principled approach to dealing with global migration. Does the Government support the UN migration pact? Regarding Ireland's specific concerns under this topic, can the Taoiseach guarantee that every EU Head of Government has received or will receive tomorrow a written briefing on the common travel area so they are all clear about the free movement of people and workers between Ireland and the UK, which will continue regardless of the Brexit outcome and in parallel with EU migration policy? The Council will discuss external relations. In preparation for the summit with the League of Arab States scheduled for 25 February 2019 what consideration has been given to the idea, which I have mentioned more than once in this House, of a Marshall plan for Europe's neighbourhood? There is instability and conflict in many Arab states, including Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Yemen. This instability is driving migration to Europe, as well as promoting radicalisation. Investment and stability are needed in all these countries. Will the Council discuss meaningful European assistance and investment in Arab countries in Europe’s neighbourhood on its border? We now have evidence of Russian involvement in online disinformation, seeking to manipulate elections and referenda. What concrete actions will be discussed by the Council to safeguard our democracies? I welcome the Taoiseach referring to these issues in his statement. What will be changed before the May European elections to mitigate any such interference? EU leaders will also discuss the reform of the Economic and Monetary Union, EMU. Based on the papers made available, this appears to be tinkering with the euro currency rather than making any significant progress. I note in particular that while a stabilisation function was discussed including, most importantly, an unemployment insurance scheme, there has not been agreement on this. Why not? It was clear ten years ago that the euro monetary union was radically incomplete. Do we have to wait for yet another ten years and another economic crisis before measures are taken to ensure greater social protections are built into monetary union? It could act to automatically counterbalance unemployment during periods of recession. Will the Taoiseach commit to supporting an EU-wide unemployment insurance scheme? Finally, the EU 27 leaders will meet on Thursday to discuss Brexit, in the absence of Prime Minister May. Mr. Donald Tusk and President Jean-Claude Juncker have made it clear that the legal text of the withdrawal agreement, including the Irish border backstop, will not be reopened. This is vital. When I met my colleagues from the Party of European Socialists last weekend, I was reassured by the detailed information available to them and by the level of understanding and solidarity for Ireland shown by socialist Prime Ministers and leaders from across the EU. Will the Taoiseach guarantee that no legal changes will be made that weakens the backstop, including in any legal text contained in side letters, annexes or letters of understanding? The Council of 27 will also discuss the possibility of a no-deal scenario. The Northern Ireland energy regulator has acknowledged that there is insufficient capacity in Northern Ireland to generate electricity to meet its needs. Northern Ireland needs the all-island energy market. It is no exaggeration to say that the lights could go out in Northern Ireland if there is a no-deal scenario. I listened to the absolute bunkum of the some of the Tories when they spoke about floating barges with batteries. What they are saying about the reality facing people on this island and in Britain is mind-boggling and beyond imagination. The all-island energy issue is included in the withdrawal agreement but, without that agreement, what provision is being made for a rapid redeployment of energy into Northern Ireland in a hard Brexit scenario? Ireland cannot make bilateral agreements with the UK to restore it. I discussed this with Maroš Šefovi, the EU energy Commissioner. This is an EU competence. Even if we wanted to, we could not agree a detailed arrangement with the UK so we need to be making those preparations now. Can the Taoiseach assure us that plans are being made to put in place quickly a single issue agreement between the UK and the EU to mitigate the worst harm from a no-deal scenario, which could come about in a little over 100 days?Similarly, it is in our vital interest that the all-island agriculture and food safety zone is preserved, but this is much more complicated. What specific preparations are being made to preserve this in the event of no deal? I asked these questions of the Taoiseach earlier today and he undertook to give Members a briefing in the context of the stakeholders' meeting. That is not good enough right now. Parties in the House that supported a united position over the last two years and who have argued along with our colleagues across Europe need to be fully involved in understanding what is being done in the event of a scenario coming to pass that none of us want, which is a hard exit by Britain from the EU. British politics is in a state of flux. In my judgment it is likely that Theresa May will survive the challenge to her leadership tonight, who knows, but it is unlikely that the withdrawal agreement will survive a vote in Parliament. I hear the Taoiseach being optimistic again. Right now he is in a minority of one in that optimism, but who knows. There is a real risk that a no-deal scenario will come to pass. I have said to the Taoiseach before that there is now a real risk that must be prepared for. A no-deal scenario would be a disaster for us. The Government must resist that pressure, which will inevitably grow as we reach the cliff edge. It is a real possibility that the UK will, in the end, hold a second referendum to choose between the withdrawal agreement on the table, and the status quo. According to several surveys, the UK public's desire for a second vote has grown and public appetite for Brexit has declined as it has become unclear what replacement is to be voted on. I hope the EU is ready to support the remain argument. Ireland received real concessions when we needed them after a rejected treaty vote in the State. There is every reason for the EU to show understanding, flexibility and responsiveness to the concerns of the UK right now. Without any compromise on the fundamental principles around issues such as the free movement of people and workers within the Single Market, there is room for clearer, better regulation to be spelled out. What was offered to the previous Prime Minister, David Cameron, needs to be offered again and better explained. If those real concerns were addressed there is a real prospect of a second people's vote not only taking place but also-----

Its members have played with the fires of xenophobic nationalism, of anti-immigrant sentiment, of nostalgia for some imagined historical imperial glory and whatever else motivates these rather strange people in the Tory Party. They are tearing themselves apart currently. Frankly I am not sorry to see them do so given the dangerous politics they play with and the damage that successive Tory governments have done to working class people in the United Kingdom. One hopeful sign from this mess is when Theresa May starts talking about the real possibility of a united Ireland. Even though she desperately wishes to avert it and while others speak of "my precious union" one has to acknowledge the possibility of a united Ireland. It is time for us to take it very seriously. While all of us would prefer some sort of resolution to prevail in the situation, if it does not prevail and Britain crashing out of the EU is on the agenda, then it seems that the issue of a united Ireland also comes very seriously onto the agenda. It has to be completely unthinkable for us to consider for even one moment the possibility of a border being erected for any reason by anybody in that context. This is not just the possibility that the Tories or the DUP might wish to erect a border in the circumstances of a hard Brexit: the European Union might insist on it to protect its precious Single Market. The Tories want to protect the precious union and the EU leaders want to protect their precious market. Ireland's position has to be to insist that from no direction and for no reason are we willing to accept or co-operate with the installation of a border between the North and the South. We should argue publicly that in the circumstance where that might become a possibility or threatened from any direction the people north and south of this island should have the right to express their will democratically in a referendum on Irish unity. Democracy and a commitment to the unity of the island should require that. Another interesting aspect of the currently unfolding debacle in the Tory Party, members of which are quite happy to tear each other part, is that the one thing the Tories are capable of uniting on is their fear of a Corbyn government and their fear of a left wing government. This is the reason Theresa May will survive politically, if she does. As much as they are taking lumps out of each other they want to stop at any costs the possibility of a left wing Government. It is worth considering the significance of that, especially given the events unfolding in France at the moment. Among other considerations that would have been discussed at the European Council, the upheaval and elemental social explosion taking place in France is a welcome counter blast to the rotten politics that have been played out in the Brexit debate and it has been a very welcome counterblast to the terrifying development of the rotten rise of extreme forms of nationalism and the far right taking place all over Europe. Although the yellow vest movement is somewhat incoherent, and while there are certainly some dodgy elements operating in certain places, overwhelmingly this is a mass movement of the poor, the dispossessed and the working people who are angry at social and economic inequality and the misguided, unfair and unjust priorities of the Macron government. These priorities were best characterised by the attempt by the Macron government to on the one hand get rid of a wealth tax and reduce taxes on the rich, and at the same time unload the cost of that measure onto the poor in the form of regressive taxes under an apparently environmental guise that would hit the less well-off. This is at the base of the yellow vest explosion. As I said earlier, there are some far right elements in certain places trying to take advantage of this and turn it in a nasty right wing direction but overwhelmingly one can see in the pictures of the protesters that faces are black, white, north African men and women. The demands they make are for economic and social justice, for an end to precarious work and for fairness in how the tax system works.The anger over those issues runs right across Europe and into this country and elsewhere. In respect of the revolt that is taking place, there are now protestors in Iraq wearing the yellow vests. In Egypt, where I note this conference referred to in the Council is taking place and where the al-Sisi dictatorship is digging the grave of the Arab Spring, they have banned the sale of yellow vests out of fear that on the anniversary of the Arab Spring, the Arab masses might take to the streets wearing them. There is an internationalism - the internationalism of the poor, the downtrodden, the vulnerable taking to the streets and demanding economic and social justice. That is something we should consider strongly for this country, the world and Europe, as the counterblast to the rotten Tories and the far right.

This is one of the largest countries in Europe and a massive tide of protest is taking place. The yellow vest movement is an inspirational revolt by working people and the poor against the President of the rich, Emmanuel Macron, and his policies. The protests show that these policies can be challenged. Austerity has wreaked havoc in French society. The struggle to make ends meet is now an epidemic. The Socialist Party and our sister organisation, Gauche Révolutionnaire, support these movements against anti-working class policies. I refer to some quotes from people taking part in the protests. A young restaurant worker on the minimum wage said, "I did not eat yesterday or at last night's dinner." Another said, "We yellow vests represent the poor of France, those with modest or low incomes who are being crushed." Another said, "I am here for all those people left crying by the 15th of each month because they have gone into the red." That is what has happened because of austerity policies in France and across the EU. The movements have seen blockades, militant occupations and weekly protests in every major town and city. There has been important industrial action as well. Protests involving young people, school students, university students have been met with vicious and brutal state repression, exemplified by the shocking images on social media of more than 140 young people forced to kneel in front of the police with their arms behind their backs, their only crime protesting outside their school. That is children and that is what is being done by Macron and his police force. This protest movement has also linked with environmental protests and movements against violence against women, which we witnessed the weekend before last. The policies of Macron's terror regime are being imposed across Europe and the globe. As has been mentioned, the sale of yellow vests has been banned in Egypt in case there is contagion. The mood that exists in France exists in many other countries in Europe, including Ireland. When elected in May 2017, Macron was the shiny new face of neoliberalism. The Taoiseach went out of his way to emulate him and fell head over heels to bask in his radiance - Trudeau, Macron, Varadkar, etc. There is a warning here for the Taoiseach. Support for Macron has plummeted and he is now one of the most hated presidents in French history. This is a millionaire former banker who represents a system built on maintaining inequality and undermining living standards of working class people in the interests of profit. One yellow vest protestor correctly characterised the concessions Macron was forced to make, when he came out of hiding after a week, as putting plasters on a third-degree burn. They know much more can be won. The idea of tous ensemble, everyone together, has become the sentiment in French society and there is great willingness to fight and to get organised. We need action committees to be brought together from workplaces, schools and the yellow vest protests to discuss and to organise this struggle and campaign. As we saw in May 50 years ago, due to its economic power and its traditions, the organised working class and trade union movement in France has a crucial role to play. The day of action on 14 December called by the General Confederation of Labour, CGT, is a step forward. A 24-hour general strike is needed to put a stop to the Macron government and to force him to go much further. A system run for private profit means the further squeezing of living standards. It is essential that this movement unites all working class people of all colours, regardless of background. Any racist or anti-immigrant sentiment needs to be stood against. To make these demands a reality, a government of the working class that ends the rule of the CAC 40, major banks and industries that dominate the French economy, the parasites whom Macron represents, is needed. They should be taken out of the private ownership of profiteers and placed in public ownership under democratic control of working people in an economy planned for the needs of the majority, not run for economic elites. A struggle for a socialist France can open a struggle for a socialist Europe, uniting working class people in opposition to the rule of the bosses and the EU that represents them. I want to take up the situation with regard to Brexit. We should remind ourselves that the 2016 referendum for withdrawal from Europe was another manifestation of the widespread alienation from political parties that have pushed neoliberal policies for three decades. The majority of those who voted for Brexit were angry at years of austerity that resulted in falling living standards and cuts in public services. They were fed up of being told that the pain must be shared when their pockets were being picked to bail out the banks. Now Theresa May has pulled back on a vote for the draft Brexit agreement at the eleventh hour and faces the sack herself. Solidarity-PBP and the Socialist Party understand and share the anger of ordinary people across Europe. France is in turmoil. The Brexit deal is stuck for related reasons. The system simply cannot deliver for working people and it cannot deliver democratic rights either. Anger and alienation are widespread and unexpected referendum results and burning barricades in Paris are simply a manifestation of this. During the referendum campaign, the RMT rail workers union in Britain and the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance, NIPSA, the public sector union in the North, both took principled positions of opposition to the EU in favour of a left alternative. These unions have shown the way and if the trade unions were now to bring their combined weight behind a movement for a new Europe organised in the interests of the 99%, millions of people could be mobilised across these islands and across Europe. It is not just a question of the trade unions organising to protect jobs and terms and conditions of working people. The union movement in Ireland has a proud record of uniting working class people, Catholic and Protestant, and has a historic responsibility to act now with resolution in the interests of working people across the island. The unions must mobilise to counter any measures that result in an increase in sectarian division in the North and there must be no hardening of borders North, South, east or west.

Migration is to be discussed at the Council under the heading of implementation of the comprehensive approach to migration. Does that comprehensive approach include the increasing securitisation agenda when it comes to migration? It is undermining and certainly threatening the EU aid budget. There is a fear of considerable funding going to the securitisation agenda. The "fortress Europe" image is damaging to the founding principles of the EU. There is undeniable hypocrisy in President Tusk's recent statement following the Salzburg summit, when he said that we may not agree on everything but we agree that the main goal is stemming illegal migration to Europe. EU policies and the actions of certain countries created the reasons people are migrating. I refer to issues such as arms sales, tax measures and unfair trade treaties. They are the factors keeping those countries impoverished, which leads to migration. Europe will talk about tackling the root causes of migration but it is much easier to put up barriers. That also loses sight of the fact that there is far more internal migration within Africa than there is outward migration from Africa. President Tusk also spoke about co-operation with third countries. If we look at some of them, however, Libya is a failed state, while Turkey has a questionable human rights agenda. Preparation for the upcoming summit with the League of Arab States is also on the Council agenda. Yemen has to be the main item of that summit. The conflict going on since 2011 is a seven-year conflict in a country that had so many challenges even without a war. This war is not about Yemen. It is a power struggle between Saudi Arabia, backed by the US, and what they see as Iranian influence and support for the Houthi rebels.While the peace talks are happening, there has been very little condemnation of the war, the attacks on civilians, the starvation and the malnutrition. We know about the lucrative arms deals. French contractors delivered €2 billion worth of equipment to Saudi Arabia. In the first half of 2017 arms sales from the UK to Saudi Arabia came to €1.25 billion. While Germany has stopped selling arms to that conflict, there are questions over its motives, as the arms industry is not as vital to Germany's GDP as it is to that of France and the UK. It appears that the EU's economic relationship with Saudi Arabia is more important. Given the wealth among the Arab countries, surely they have a moral obligation to stop fuelling a conflict that has such consequences for the population and to step up humanitarian aid. It is reckoned that more than 60% of deaths in Yemen were caused by Saudi airstrikes. South Sudan has experienced nearly five years of civil war with 50% of the population in need of humanitarian aid and millions of people displaced. It is now on its 12th peace deal which is very fragile. There is a role for the international community, including the EU, to ensure that this peace deal lasts. The EU can play a role with those who are genuinely committed to reconciliation and sustainable peace. Ireland has been very forthcoming in giving vital aid. More challenging and equally vital is Ireland working through the EU to ensure the peace holds. Regardless of the views and our relationship with the Spanish Government, there is support for Catalan independence. Two Catalan civil society leaders, seven Catalan politicians, including a former speaker of the parliament, and others are in exile across Europe. Although it is an internal matter the EU could be more proactive in trying to prevent an escalation of unrest in one of its member countries.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	329	There is a certain irony that Time magazine's person of the year announced yesterday are journalists when there has not been a single mention of the increasingly precarious situation facing Julian Assange. The Government has a responsibility to raise this case in the upcoming European Council. In a fortnight Assange will have spent his seventh Christmas trapped in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. For six and a half years he has been corralled there by the British Government and refused safe passage to asylum to Ecuador. He is now an Ecuadorian citizen and still the British Government refuses to let him leave in safety. The threats to his life and health grow bigger every day. Since the election of President Moreno in Ecuador last year, Julian Assange's presence in the Ecuadorian embassy has grown increasingly precarious. President Moreno has described Assange as a stone in his shoe. The former president, Mr. Correa, has said that President Moreno would throw Assange out following the first pressure from the United States, which is exactly what we are seeing. In November the US Department of Justice accidentally revealed the existence of sealed criminal charges against Assange in a document filed in a New York court. That document read:The complaint...and arrest warrant...would need to remain sealed until Assange is arrested in connection with the charges in the criminal complaint and can therefore no longer evade or avoid arrest and extradition in this matter.We must remember that this threat of extradition to the US and a lifetime of solitary confinement or worse hang over Julian Assange because he had the audacity to commit acts of actual journalism. He had the audacity to refuse to become just another stenographer of the powerful like so many of his colleagues because he made available information that threatened the United States' imperial project, information that upset the liberal consensus of Western good guys and the big bad others that we hear about so much, information that was raw, genuine and direct from the source and not spoon-fed by spokespersons or laundered by PR. He is now facing criminal charges in the United States because in 2010 he published the collateral murder video which showed US forces gunning down 12 civilians, including two journalists, in an airstrike and laughing about it. He is facing criminal charges and a lifetime in solitary confinement in a supermax prison because a few months later WikiLeaks published the Afghan war logs, followed by the Iraq war logs, the biggest leak in the history of the United States military. The Iraq war logs proved that the US Government had covered up 15,000 civilian deaths in Iraq and the US authorities had failed to investigate hundreds of cases of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers who killed hundreds of unarmed civilians some of them pregnant women for the crime of approaching checkpoints. In light of Assange's contribution to journalism, it is grim and shocking how easily the United States along with its allies in the UK have manipulated both left and right wing mainstream opinion in regard to his character and his work. We have had a relentless propaganda campaign over the years resulting in the apparently universally recognised idea in the mainstream that his detention is really not something to worry about. It is regarded as not being that important because it is suggested he is unstable, irresponsible, creepy etc. which is exactly why I am raising it today. Human rights do not depend on character references. The world's media were rightly up in arms over the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi on the basis that state-backed attacks on dissident journalists represent a red line that should never be crossed. I agree with that. However, if Assange is ever talked about in these days it is never in the context of his arbitrary detention and rather in the context of the smears against his character, which is absolute hypocrisy when we see the outcry at the treatment of Jamal Khashoggi and so on. A journalist has been arbitrarily detained for six and a half years with no apparent discomfort from any section of the establishment anywhere. I again ask the Government to raise this case before this man dies inside that embassy. If they get him out he faces a lifetime in solitary confinement in America. In the context of journalists, there is hypocrisy between how we raise the case of Jamal Khashoggi while at the same time refusing to countenance arms boycotts on Saudi Arabia as it slaughters and starves innocent Yemeni civilians. That has gone on for three years and suddenly now following that murder everybody in Europe wants to talk about it. They did not care about it when thousands of Yemeni people were being killed - yesterday the media quoted a figure of 60,000. I appeal to the Government to speak up before it is too late for Julian Assange.

Before we could even start debating it, we were told the Government would not provide a money message for it. I am concerned that the Government would take such an approach. Migration is on the agenda for this week's European Council meeting. The background notes strike a celebratory tone. The main infographic has a caption which boasts that EU support for Libyan coastguards is paying off. It has trained 237 coastguard officers and has rescued 13,185 people up to 30 August, a 190% increase over 2017. Operation Sophia is a military blockade of the Mediterranean which is forcing people who are fleeing wars, famine and economic conditions to remain trapped in brutal and inhumane conditions in Libya. The root causes of the flight of these people are the economic and foreign policies of the global north. Only two weeks ago in the Dáil the Minister of State at the Department of Defence confirmed that it was a military mission. The root causes will not be addressed by the €2.5 billion in aid funding, the Common Security and Defence Policy missions or by partnering with authorities in already destabilised countries to stop people crossing their borders. The global north needs to recognise that the aid narrative is based on the falsehood that EU countries become rich because of their own brilliance, hard work and good institutions, and now reach out across the chasm to give generously of its surplus to poor countries, helping them up the development ladder. The anthropologist Jason Hickel has just written a wonderful book, The Divide. I suggest people read it for Christmas. He has written:This story presupposes a fundamental disjuncture between the wealth of rich nations and the poverty of poor ones, as if the two have nothing at all to do with one another, either historically or today.Nothing could be further from the truth.In reality, the aid that the North gives to the South is vastly outstripped by financial resources that flow the other direction, in the form of interest on external debt, profit repatriation, illicit financial flows and so on. In fact, for every dollar of aid that the North gives to the South, the South loses up to $24 in net outflows because of how the global economy is structured. The South is a net creditor to the North. Poor countries are effectively developing rich countries, not the other way around.Hickel's remarks are based on research published in 2017 by the US-based Global Financial Integrity and the centre for applied research at the Norwegian School of Economics. It is the most comprehensive assessment of resource transfers ever undertaken and it puts Ireland at the centre of the crisis in the global south. If we look at all the years since 1980, net outflows add up to a mad total of $16.3 trillion. That is how much money has been drained out of the global south over the past few decades. One of the central ways in which this transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich has been executed is through illicit tax flows through tax havens, of which Ireland is one. It is not Common Security and Defence Policy missions but stopping the flow of arms into the global south that will address one of the root causes of people fleeing war and instability. In South Sudan, for instance, English, Ukrainian, Israeli and Emirates firms are on record as having sold arms to both sides in the dreadful war there. The annual report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute finds that global arms sales have increased by 2.5% since 2016 and the top 100 arms manufacturers sold $398 billion worth of arms in 2017. Of these sales, 57% were made by US companies while western European companies accounted for 23.8%. This effectively means that 81% of weapons sales by the biggest 100 global companies were based in NATO countries. The West produces the armaments that heighten conflicts from northern Africa to central Asia. America, France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Norway, Switzerland, Finland and Greece have all profited by fuelling the war on the people of Yemen, where up to 14 million are at risk of starvation. The situation in Yemen is horrific and we have stayed silent on it. We do not send peacekeeping missions to Yemen. We send our politicians to shake hands and do business with men who are using famine as a weapon of war.  Neither will the root causes be addressed by sending the Naval Service on a military mission to the Mediterranean to help Libyan militias to capture refugees and bring them back to sites of torture and rape. The stories coming out of the detention centres there are nothing short of shocking. Most of the detained are in Tripoli and the fighting has kicked off again with opposition militias, many of which are being backed by the UN. They are fighting for control of the north west of the country. Médecins Sans Frontières and its partner SOS Méditerranée have been forced by the Italian state and other European governments to terminate operation by its search and rescue vessel, the Aquarius. The EU wants the people who are trying to escape the mayhem we have created for them to rot in detention or drown in the ocean. The EU describes this as a plan that is paying off. We should raise our voice and challenge this because it is terrible.

As the singer Johnny Logan would say, "What's another year?" What is five minutes in the context of another year? It is nothing. The Taoiseach is imithe now but almost every time that a meeting of the European Council has taken place in the last year, it has been preceded by one crisis or another. It has been a very rocky and bumpy road. However, the crisis engulfing the politics and Parliament of the United Kingdom now appears to be genuinely chaotic and looks set to confirm our worst fears in terms of the negative impact of a hard Brexit. It is astonishing. Management of the crisis, if it was ever real, is now slipping out of all control and that is quite apparent to one and all. Despite her determination and resilience, Mrs. May is, to all intents and purposes, a lame duck Prime Minister who appears likely to become yet another victim of Tory party infighting over Europe. It is a sad spectacle to watch as the uncertainty around the effects on our economy and many other economies grows.  Mrs. May postponed the vote on the withdrawal agreement in Westminster because she simply could not generate the support required for what almost everyone agrees is a deeply problematic arrangement. It is unfair to members of the UK Parliament to expect them to sign up to and support an agreement that locks them into a backstop arrangement from which they cannot extract themselves. As we know, our nearest neighbours are a very proud people whose ancestors conquered the world and developed the British Empire. Pride, which is one of the seven deadly sins, is a big part of the problem here. The British want to be proud and, to borrow a phrase, they want to make England great again. It seems that the backstop issue is one where politics, as the art of the possible and of compromise, is destined to fail. Is mór an trua an rud sin. It is very sad.  The British Prime Minister said that she would go back to the EU and seek further clarification on the legal nature of the backstop protocol but before she even landed in Brussels, the door was slammed in her face by Mr. Juncker which is a real pity. While I must recognise and acknowledge the support we have received from our EU colleagues, I am suspicious of it at the same time. The support is certainly there and the agreement, on which I was briefed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, when it was finalised, is very good for Northern Ireland. Indeed, it is quite a good agreement for the Republic of Ireland too. While we must acknowledge that, we must also ask, at what price? What will we be expected to deliver afterwards, when and if there is a crash-out Brexit? There is serious uncertainty about the impact of a crash-out Brexit on our lives and our economy. This is especially true with regard to rural Ireland and the agricultural sector which exports so much of its produce to the United Kingdom.  The EU's approach is giving fuel to those elements of the UK political class who have their faces set against any constructive deal. Closing the door in Mrs. May's face before she had even gotten off the plane was not constructive; she should have been embraced. This has been going on from the very start. There has been no empathy for or understanding of the British position. Neither has there been any examination or in-depth analysis of the reasons for the Brexit vote. We all know that there were many reasons for that vote, with immigration being only one. Other reasons include a lack of autonomy and a sense of being governed from afar by big brother, as well as of being neglected. Neglect by the EU was demonstrated during our financial crisis with the so-called bail out, which I described as a clean out. I voted against it because the EU charged us 6% while the IMF loaned us money at less than 3%. In the meantime, we face unimaginable consequences if a hard Brexit or no deal scenario comes to pass. People are so fearful, especially those who have invested heavily in businesses. There are many fears with regard to job security too.  Added to this crisis, the European Council must also deal with the continuing difficulties with Italy and the ongoing rows about budgetary oversight. The Italian people and their leaders are simply not prepared to take threats about punitive financial penalties lying down and nor should they. They have seen what happened to us and to other member states like Greece in the past. Youth unemployment in Italy is over 30%, which is staggering. The population is expected to face declining living standards, lowered prospects for upward mobility and high unemployment. This is the next crisis. The hard men in Brussels might not get away with their tough talk so easily when it comes to the Italians. Yet again, the EU leadership is adopting a hardline approach to this issue which is astonishing the Italian people. It is also antagonising them. They are starting to look over their shoulders and to understand why the British voted for Brexit. As I said, the Italian people and their leaders are not prepared to take threats about punitive financial penalties lying down. These issues point to massive levels of disruption up ahead.We know that if the UK economy is hit, we will suffer badly. As I always say, if England catches a cold, we get the flu. The UK is our nearest trading partner. Many Irish people live there and many of our businesses are intertwined. If Italy enters a severe debt crisis, the entire European economy will suffer major damage. That these two scenarios look more likely than ever is deeply concerning to my constituents throughout Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel and Cashel to Thurles, Roscrea, Templemore and Nenagh, including the farming community. There is already an astonishing crisis in the beef industry and many other farming sectors. It is shocking. I could not finish without saying something about the uncaring attitude at EU level towards the persecution of Christians, as well as Muslim and other minorities, in the Middle East. Yemen was mentioned, where there is an atrocious war. I recently visited the Middle East and the situation there is shocking. Countries such as France and England export massive amounts of weapons to countries in the region, thereby helping to heap destruction on men, women and children. The war in Yemen is savage war. I have tried on several occasions - since I first went there in 2011 - to have a meaningful debate in the House about the persecution of Christians and other minorities in Middle Eastern countries such as Yemen. I have received no support and there is no appetite across all the parties. They are able to unify for everything else. They unified for months to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution and to rush legislation through the House, but there has been no debate on this issue. They have turned a blind eye to it because we might offend someone in Europe. It is outrageous but I thank the Ceann Comhairle who allowed four of us, Deputies O'Keeffe, Grealish, me and one other, to engage in a Topical Issue debate on Holy Thursday evening a couple of years ago. That is all we got. Were it not for the Ceann Comhairle, we would have got nothing. The parties have turned a blind eye to this issue in order to be the good boys and girls of Europe and to salute the EU. When it says "Jump", the parties ask "How high?" The Minister of State has done all the jumping, the box-ticking and the tours of European capitals, and she has received support for the country, which must be recognised, but at what price was it? Cén costas a bhí leis sin? That is my worry. What is going on behind closed doors and to what are we signed up? We signed up to the UN declaration on migrants this week. What else have we signed up to or exposed ourselves to without any debate in Parliament? The media also have a role to play, and I extol them to be more investigative and energetic in talking about these issues and the lack of debate on them in Parliament. Last week, the decks were able to be cleared of any business to ensure a horrific abortion Bill could be rushed over the line. There was co-operation from all the parties. Even expressions of sympathy for Fine Gael's former Taoiseach, the late Liam Cosgrave, were pulled from the agenda to accommodate the unified parties in ensuring the Bill's passage. The Fianna Fáil Party propped up Fine Gael on that issue more than anything else, against the wishes of its members as voted for at its Ard-Fheis, and now it seems there will be another year of the confidence and supply agreement. Most people want rid of Theresa May because of the appalling way that housing, agriculture, children etc. have been neglected.

I hope, therefore, that I am allowed some latitude. People want rid of the Government, more than it knows, because it is anti-democratic and, above all, uncaring. It has turned a blind eye to Yemen and the rest of the Middle East. We have a proud reputation for neutral peacekeeping but it is fast disappearing and I am worried about that to which the Government has signed up.

It is hard to believe what is going on in British politics. After 45 years of membership of the EU, the UK is leaving on 29 March next, after which it will have third-country status. That is the current position although things may change. The UK electorate was not told the truth during the referendum campaign. The debate was ugly and nasty, at times, and centred around immigration, which is now one of the major global issues. A false scenario was presented to the electorate, and the UK public and Members of Parliament have only recently become aware of the reality that exists. The British Prime Minister recently explained the hard facts of the situation, which has led to her difficulties in getting approval in Parliament for the withdrawal agreement. If nothing else, Theresa May is resilient and tenacious, and we await developments in that regard in London this evening. I note the comments made by the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, earlier. Providing political stability to the country at this dangerous time is welcome. Irish businesses are doubtless becoming exercised about Brexit, as are the wider public. It was a difficult decision for Deputy Micheál Martin to embark on the road he outlined for us earlier, and it will cause difficulties within our party, but it is in the national interest. When one compares what is happening in UK politics with what is happening here, there is a significant contrast. In general, people will welcome the political stability he has offered. I listened to a great speech by a former British Prime Minister, John Major, in Dublin yesterday. He is such a sensible, pragmatic man and politician. One of the main concerns in his address was the future of Anglo-Irish relations. If the UK is no longer in the European Union, it is clear there will be less opportunity for interaction with Ministers from both jurisdictions to discuss the major issues of the day. He outlined many other concerns but that was one of which we must be conscious. The major issue is to prepare for a hard Brexit. We need to be prepared for Britain crashing out of the European Union, that is, a disorderly Brexit. I note that the Cabinet mandated all Departments yesterday to give full priority to activating their plans for a no-deal or disorderly Brexit. We need to prepare for the no-deal scenario. There was some discussion in the House earlier on the legislation which the Oireachtas will have to pass in preparation. It needs to be addressed quickly and considered over the Christmas recess with a view to dealing with the situation in the new year. It will be necessary to hire customs officers, vets and food and safety inspectors for our ports and airports, a matter which I assume the Government is dealing with as we speak. Businesses need to be fully aware of the situation. Many other issues will be discussed at the European Council meeting, including the multi-annual financial framework. I hope that cap can be protected, as I have previously told the Minister of State. Migration is also an important issue, and it is probably one of the reasons that Brexit is happening. I hope that practical measures can be taken to deal with the major issue of migration, which affects Europe and the rest of the world.

It indirectly relates to the European Council because it seems the Council will concern nothing but the nature of politics in France, Italy and, most of all, Britain. How we engage in politics, however, is part of the discussion. Before I entered the Chamber, I was working in the bowels of the Joint Committee on Climate Action and, therefore, I did not hear Deputy Micheál Martin's speech, but he had the good courtesy to approach me to inform me of his decision. It is only good courtesy of me to contribute with honesty because I had also spoken to him in private about the issue last week.We happened to have a Green Party office party upstairs in a pub while the Fine Gael national executive moved in downstairs. The two met briefly and we chatted about our political situation. I did not expect this Dáil to run through the next budget. I thought it would go after Brexit had been done. As I said yesterday at a public meeting on the 100th anniversary of the First Dáil, we have done a good job in this Dáil over the past two and a half to three years. It seems like only yesterday the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, was a mere slip of a new backbencher. I did not think we would last this long or that she would last this long. Collectively, it has been better that we did this. If there is another year, and there may not be, there is a lot-----

We have been strong in our approach to the Brexit process. We worked for consensus and were strong not because there was a confidence and supply agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but because there was widespread agreement here on the broad strategy and tactics applied. On the fundamental issue of whether there is a backstop agreement, there has not been a dissenting voice in this House. The chaos in the UK political system, in both the Labour and the Conservative Parties, on this issue has given us strength in a way that is unimaginable in our historic relationship with the neighbouring isle. We should be very careful not to antagonise what must be a sense of absolute dismay within the UK at how its system is not coping with this real challenge. We should stand up for, and insist on, a certain honesty over there that the Irish backstop is not the key dividing issue. It was used by various sides, particularly the UK Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer, to get a soft economic Brexit, a customs arrangement of some sort to assist British business in what was always going to be a difficult situation. The political situation in Northern Ireland somewhat set up that opportunity but to then turn it around and say it is all about the backstop is a slightly dishonest approach. Without any disrespect to the people over there, who do not need to be lectured to, we should hold that line and demand that the Labour and the Conservative Parties do not distort the reality of what is happening. Somebody used a metaphor during the week for the role of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, saying he has to be careful not to be like Colonel Nicholson in "The Bridge On the River Kwai". People may remember the film about the British officers imprisoned by the Japanese and building the Burma rail line, and the bridge across the river. It was fraught and there were all sorts of difficulties and tensions. When eventually the bridge is built the British officer leading the prisoners feels great pride but when he realises that his allies are about to blow it up he has a sense that he does not want them to do that. If we feel this deal or withdrawal agreement that we have constructed, like a two year bridge construction job, is the be all and end all, our protecting it would be a bit like Colonel Nicholson in not wanting it to be blown up. If it has to go, it has to go. We work very closely with our party in the UK and it wants a second vote, as do our colleagues in the North. We should not stand in the way of that through pride in the construction of the withdrawal agreement. We do not play a role because it is a golden rule of referendums to leave other countries to hold their debate. This issue, however, might be slightly different and break that rule because we are being dragged into it in a way that is not quite honest or true. That gives us a certain licence to clarify the truth should it come to a second vote and I hope it will because I hope Britain does not leave. It fundamentally weakens our union, our relationship with the neighbouring island and if there is a possibility of that being reconsidered by the British people I hope that arrives.  I have friends on the Brexit side and I have quizzed them to try to understand why. They would not be Deputy Boyd Barrett's friends on the socialist side, they are from the business side although there was socialist support for Brexit two or three years ago. The business argument is strange because it is saying that Europe and the West in general are in decline and it asks why it would hitch itself to a declining global institution when development is occurring in India and China and elsewhere. Fintan O'Toole wrote a brilliant article last week on the historical mythology behind some of this thinking. I think it almost goes back to the Elizabethan era when Francis Drake and others were out on the high seas. They had to have this ability to do trade deals and to act in that way on the global stage. That is where their thinking comes from. It is deeply flawed because global trade and the globalised model will not work on a privateer basis. We need to reconstruct globalisation towards sustainability in every way and towards sustainability in social and environmental policy.  It was interesting that in his contribution today the Taoiseach referred to another issue for discussion at the Council, the implementation of the services directive, the radical scaling up of that project to deliver greater competitiveness and economic growth. He referred to the Copenhagen Economics report, Making EU Trade in Services Work for All. I briefly availed of the chance to try to read some of that document before speaking. To my mind, it did not address this issue. I do not get a strong sense from it or in anything I have heard from the Taoiseach that the economic model has to change, that it has to be for all. The rise in right wing, nationalist and populist sentiment in Europe is because we do not have that collective care for how an ultra-competitive, ultra-productive and ultra-growth-orientated globalised economy can look after all. It does not look after all. That has to change. Further on in his speech the Taoiseach referred to disinformation and the role of political operators or Facebook and others as being on the agenda for discussion. Deputy Naughton and I happened to be in the House of Commons the week before last attending a committee hearing on disinformation and the regulation of Facebook. I asked Facebook whether it would apply the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, in all its global operations and it said it would, that it is the new standard. That connects with the Brexit issue. No matter what Britain does, in this critical area of digital services and in every aspect of the digital revolution, Facebook will apply GDPR standards, and effectively the European Court of Justice will remain the arbiter of disputes in that area, as will EU legislation because that is increasingly the one global standard. We have to be careful. Where do we stand on the regulation of Facebook and the new digital services economy? We have to stand for workers' rights and better pay. We do not stand for the American growth-at-all-costs and greed-is-good model. That old economic model is dead and gone. We need a new and different one.  To come full circle, we should apply that thinking in the year ahead of us, start thinking and doing things differently and try to achieve the same consensus on some issues that we achieved consensus on the Brexit negotiations so that we have strength in the development of our economy in every way.I will give some examples of where we should apply that. We can refer to it in our discussions on the European Council. First, in our budget approach we should heed what Seamus Coffey said last week, which we all know has validity to it and is worth attention. Before having another budget we should make sure that it is not just the usual election budget where we buy votes either with tax cuts or with spending as that is not the key priority for us. Could we achieve consensus on that in the future? Could we also take what we are doing in the Joint Committee on Climate Action, which we know is central to where the economy has to go? We know that by the end of next year under European Union governance rules we must have a national energy and climate action plan that is fit for the following ten and 20 years. Could we work in consensus on a revised national development plan that delivers some of the objectives of decarbonisation that we seek? One could broaden it out as there is a range of different areas where people might seek consensus. When Pope Francis was here the Taoiseach mentioned a new covenant between church and State. Could we in a safe space, in a synodal way, without the understandable confrontation we have seen in the past six months in terms of the abortion issue, bring people from all churches and none together to work collaboratively in a broader way, much as we did recently with the Citizens' Assembly and other debates, to consider issues such as the role of religion in the education system or in the health system? I say that having attended my own local parish meeting the other night which asked the exact same question. It is happening from the ground up so why would we not try to do it from the top down at the same time? That would make this country a very interesting place because some of the values in such a forum might inform a more social, caring and environmentally sustainable economy. We have not answered those hard questions in the past three years. We have not said how we will fund third level education. Neither have we said how we will fund the media. There are so many different areas where we are failing and where what we are doing is not working. To return to my central point, we should go to Brussels this week somewhat proud, first of the solidarity our European colleagues have shown to us. I was at a meeting yesterday and I mind an image which came to me. It would be akin to Wolfe Tone sailing to Bantry Bay and instead of facing a storm him reaching it on a sunny day. Europe came to our aid in this time in a way that was real. It came home to us that solidarity with our European colleagues can deliver real strength. We should thank them for that. We should not antagonise, look down on, demean or get into a slagging war with the UK no matter what the 50 Tory MPs on the nationalist side say, which is very antagonistic towards us. We should not rise to that. We should retain our close relationships and good friendships with the likes of John Major and so many others in that party and in the Labour Party, despite the lack of leadership we are seeing in that quarter and the blame it puts on the Irish backstop, which beggars belief as a political analysis of the political issues they face. We are established 100 years and we need to think about what we will do in the next year in an innovative way. Deputy Boyd Barrett and I were part of the debate yesterday. I thought it was a useful discussion. We should bring that thinking into this Chamber and for however long next year as we would do the State some service.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	339	I thank Deputies for their statements in advance of the December European Council. The Taoiseach already spoke in some detail about expectations for the Article 50 meeting on Brexit, the euro summit, and several items for discussion tomorrow and Friday. That includes the multi-annual financial framework, which I will go into in more detail in due course, the Single Market, migration, security and defence, and external relations, as well as the fight against racism and xenophobia, disinformation, and climate change. As the Taoiseach mentioned, I will speak about the other issues on the agenda of the European Council, in particular the multi-annual financial framework, and preparations for the next strategic agenda, including the outcome of the citizens' dialogues and consultations on the future of Europe. We will have a chance for further questions next week. I have taken many of the suggestions and statements that were made on board ahead of the meeting. On the next multi-annual financial framework, which is to cover the period from 2021 to 2027, the House will recall that the June European Council invited the Council and the European Parliament to examine the Commission proposals in a comprehensive manner and as soon as possible. At the European Council this week, leaders will review the progress that has been made on this by the Austrian Presidency in the negotiations over the past six months. While this is the first time the leaders will meet and have a detailed discussion, this has been ongoing within the General Affairs Council, which I attend, and also the finance committee, the agriculture committee and all of the other various bodies for almost two years. I expect that leaders will call on the incoming Romanian Presidency to advance the next phase of the negotiations with a view to reaching agreement at the European Council in autumn 2019. The European project has helped to transform Ireland from one of the least developed member states when we joined, to one of the more prosperous today. We all recognise how we have benefitted from membership of the EU and it is important to use that experience to help shape the debate on the future of Europe and what our priorities should be. The post-2020 MFF comes at a time of change and adjustment for the EU. Long-term challenges such as economic competitiveness and climate change, emerging challenges to international trade and access to the Single Market, as well as international challenges, such as migration, security and terrorism have become more pronounced. The departure of the UK will also cause short and longer-term practical challenges for the MFF, the most obvious being a smaller budget that might entail member states paying more. With Ireland's growing prosperity, we have moved from being a net beneficiary to a net contributor to the EU budget. Recognising how we have benefitted in the past, we are open to contributing more, provided that it meets European added value objectives. From Ireland's perspective, as Deputies have already outlined, it is important that current policies with demonstrated value continue to be properly supported. The CAP remains a particular priority for Ireland. Expenditure in the area of agriculture helps support 44 million jobs across the EU, while contributing to food security and safety, rural sustainability and environmental standards. Cohesion is a traditional policy that is also important in helping member states to unlock their economic potential, which will benefit all of us in the long run. As a country that has benefitted from cohesion in the past we see that other newer or smaller member states which join should benefit in the same way. In particular, I welcome the emphasis on other policies which function well, such as ERASMUS+, the Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon, which supports research and development, and the PEACE+ and INTERREG programmes which are part of the cross-Border community initiatives. I believe that budgets for such fundamental areas should be protected and we hope that they will be. We also acknowledge the concerns of our partners and support investment in evolving priorities including migration, climate change, digital transformation and security and defence, which again must bring added European value. In terms of the strategic agenda, a meeting will take place in Sibiu next May where leaders will also discuss the main outcomes of the citizens' consultations that have been taking place across the Union. This initiative has encouraged people in all member states to have their say on the future shape and direction of the European Union. I was joined by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste last November when we launched our own citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe in Trinity College Dublin. I then hosted a series of regional dialogues in Galway, Cork, Donegal, Meath, and Dublin, culminating in an event in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on Europe Day. A future of Europe website was also set up to raise public awareness and to help people to engage in the overall debate. We also travelled to various universities. Many of the institutions such as the European Movement Ireland, the Institute of International and European Affairs, IIEA, the Commission and the Parliament have all hosted their own series of events, including ones for industry and sector representative groups. Our citizens' dialogues were characterised by strong positivity about the EU and Ireland's role within it. For the future, our citizens want to see the EU continue to do what it does well, by supporting programmes that deliver concrete benefits for all, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and ERASMUS+. In Ireland, Horizon 2020 has been especially beneficial. It was clear that we should continue to focus on implementing practical measures that improve the lives of our citizens, such as the completion of the Single Market, especially in services, and the full implementation of the digital Single Market. As Mark Rutte said recently, if we implemented fully the Single Market in the area of goods and services we could add €1 trillion to the overall budget of the European Union, which would have a positive impact on the economy of all member states. Our citizens also want the EU to focus on current challenges including climate change, migration, terrorism, cybersecurity and cross-border crime; and to maintain the principle of subsidiarity by ensuring that decisions are taken at the appropriate level. Yesterday at the General Affairs Council we had a discussion over lunch on subsidiarity. At the outset the Commissioner said not to ask him to explain what subsidiarity means, because it means different things to different people.Throughout the dialogues, what was very interesting was that some people felt Europe interfered too much, particularly in the context of legislation in areas such as agriculture, the environment and small and medium enterprises, whereas others felt it did not interfere enough, and still others felt it should be more involved in social issues. The question is how we make it work and how we ensure the Union is strong while, at the same time, ensuring that people feel it is democratic. A number of proposals have been put forward in the context of ensuring further scrutiny of legislation and building on the REFIT programme, which is ongoing. There are proposals to ensure more transparency with regard to legislation and to make sure it is fit for purpose. There is also the question of ensuring that people are connected from the ground up, particularly by means of proposals whereby local authorities within each member state would have greater connectivity and access to the European Parliament and the Commission. This gets to the heart of some of the issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett in that people would feel that their issues and concerns at local level are also being raised at European level. An overarching theme in the citizens' dialogues was the need to ensure fairness in an increasingly competitive world, that is, fairness between member states, fairness in education and employment opportunities and fairness between generations. Citizens want to tackle social exclusion and they want stronger interventions at European level in combating discrimination, integrating migrants and improving access to services. They also want more investment in young people in the context of education, training and innovation. I welcome the Commission's proposal to double the amount spent on young people. Citizens want the EU to be a global leader in tackling climate change, with incentives for the transition to renewable energies, along with more protection for rural landscapes and a concerted effort to close the rural-urban divide. On external relations, citizens believe that the EU has a moral imperative to do more for countries to the south and east and to promote education and empowerment in Africa. They also believe globalisation should not be allowed to proceed at the expense of human rights. It is clear that citizens want the EU to engage better and to explain and communicate its policies and overall objectives. We learned that the Union needs to reaffirm its relevance in the daily lives of its citizens and that this needs to be constant, not just at a time of crisis or change. During the dialogues, I announced €100,000 worth of funding to support individuals, groups and organisations in projects aiming to communicate European issues. Similar funding was given out last year and it will be announced again early next year to allow community groups and organisations to apply. The citizens' dialogue process in Ireland has been of invaluable assistance in creating the vision of an attractive EU that citizens can trust and support. I am grateful to everyone who responded to our call to get involved. I was pleased to launch the report on the process in October. It is available for anybody to read. Along with other member states, we have provided a report to the Commission, which has compiled a composite report for presentation to the European Council this week. The intention is that this will guide leaders as they work to identify key priorities in advance of the informal summit that will take place in Sibiu next May. At that meeting, leaders will prepare the strategic agenda for the EU from 2019 to 2024, with a view to agreeing it at the European Council in June 2019. The European Council is expected to take note of the Commission proposal for a long-term climate strategy for the EU and to invite the Council to prepare for discussions early next year. This is, of course, a very important issue and we will participate actively in discussions. The agenda for the December European Council covers a wide range of issues. As the Taoiseach made clear, Brexit remains very much a priority for the Government and we will use every opportunity at this critical time to ensure that our interests are protected. At the same time, we will continue to play a constructive role on the issues which are of significant concern to our partners and the EU as a whole. I thank Deputies for their attention and for their remarks. I look forward to the discussion we will have during questions next week.

The legislation was enacted in July and families are waiting anxiously due to the dilemma they face regarding the registration of their children at birth. They have been waiting now for six months. I have put down questions on the matter regularly only to receive a standard reply from the Minister for Health to the effect that it is going through a process having regard to Parts 2, 3 and 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. The Minister says he intends to have Parts 2 and 3 of the Act commenced as soon as possible. We are waiting for issues relating to Part 9 to be sorted out also. Just last week, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection said the provisions will not be implemented now until some time in 2019. A lot of people are very frustrated by this as they feel it is being put on the long finger and that there is no real will or urgency to bring the legislation over the line. I have received an email from LGBT Ireland to say its representatives had met a senior civil servant from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss the outstanding matter of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and that the outcome of the said meeting had been disappointing and unexpected with officials advising there were technical errors in the provisions as drafted. It is now proposed to correct these errors by way of amendments on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017. This lengthy process will push the commencement date into 2019. I have been a Member of the Dáil for seven years and I have seen how there is no problem for the Government when it wants to bring in Bills dealing with technical issues. Given that the errors referred to here are technical, there should be no problem introducing without debate amendments to deal with them by agreement with all parties. That is what I want to hear this evening. Why is there no urgency about this? I ask the Minister of State to explain how technical these issues are and how difficult it will be to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017. Many people are interested to know what the status of the legislation is and how quickly the Government wants to proceed with it.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	343	I thank Deputy Joan Collins for raising the matter and acknowledge her special interest in the subject on behalf of her constituents. It is important that she raises these issues. I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, who is attending the Seanad and cannot take the issue herself. This is a complex issue. Certain sections of Part 9 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provide for the registration and re-registration the birth of a donor-conceived child and, in particular, make possible the registration of details of "parent" as well as of "mother" and "father" where required, which is something all Members agree with. The current position is that these sections need to be amended to correct technical errors and have yet to be commenced. It is the Minister's intention to make the necessary amendments on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017. Commencement of the provisions is also dependent on commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Health. The Children and Family Relationships (Amendment) Act 2018 was enacted on 24 July 2018. It was introduced to correct typographical and technical errors in and facilitate the subsequent commencement of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. As such, this is a complex matter with issues overlapping where one Act must move with the other. There are important administrative and operational arrangements to be put in place to facilitate the implementation of Parts 2 and 3, including the establishment of a national donor-conceived persons register and the appointment of authorised persons under the Act. The Minister understands it is the intention of the Minister for Health that Parts 2 and 3 of the 2015 Act will be commenced as soon as possible. While I do not have a date to hand, I will be meeting the Minister for Health later and will ask him to communicate directly with Deputy Joan Collins in this regard. In order to progress the commencement of the relevant Parts, officials from the General Register Office, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Health are working together to ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory, and operational mechanisms are in put place to allow for the earliest possible commencement of all relevant legislation to facilitate birth registration of donor-conceived children. Collaboration is ongoing between the three bodies. The Minister is aware of the impact this issue is having on affected families. The Deputy outlined those on behalf of her constituents in Dublin. The Minister acknowledges in particular the position of same-sex female couples wishing to have the second partner registered as "parent" and the pressing need to proceed with commencement as soon as possible. The Deputy has been working on this for some time and I understand where she is coming from on it. I will ensure that both line Ministers are aware of the matters she has raised in the House this evening.

This parent says that she and her wife have been together since 2003. They married in 2009 under UK legislation. They both made the decision to have their first child in 2013. They both attended appointments. She was there when their daughter was born and through the sleepless nights and first steps. However, per the State, only her wife is a parent. In 2015, she was pregnant during the marriage equality referendum and endured all of the horrible comments about LGBTQ families but she was hopeful that the Children and Families Relationship (Amendment) Act would be progressed. For all that it seemed to be rushed through, in September when her son was born, there was still no movement on the commencement of the Act and once again she and her wife had to deal with the inconvenience, expense and annoyance of swearing an affidavit that he had only one parent to get a birth certificate or passport. She says that problems arise when they have to travel to England. They are going over to England to see her grandparents. There is a lot of hassle. All of these families have the same experience. I understand that commencing this Act is complex and involves amending legislation but it could be moved along much more quickly with the parts put in place. Even if a date could be set, we could tell people that this is going to happen by this date or as close as possible to it. People feel a bit lost in the legislative process.

As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, there are stories of parents in similar situations and this needs to be dealt with. This is complex and there are technical issues involved. It is important to get this right to ensure that there are no problems afterwards, that it is good legislation, and that the technical difficulties, including both parents being recognised not only when they are a father and mother, are dealt with. These are harrowing stories. We know that other couples all over the country have similar stories. By raising this issue in the Chamber this afternoon, the Deputy has highlighted the issue again and has put it on the record of the Dáil. Through my work as Minister of State at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I will certainly ensure that the officials from the General Register Office, GRO, my Department, and the Department of Health will ensure that the appropriate legislative, regulatory and operational mechanisms are put into place as quickly as possible. We are at the end of the year now, but I hope this will be done in 2019. I cannot give the Deputy a date but I can emphasise the urgency of the issue raised by her both to Ministers and the GRO. I know where she is coming from.

It is my hope that we can discuss this issue without accusations regarding motivation coming into the debate. My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, and I have raised this issue because there is anxiety about the implications for Ireland of becoming a signatory, as I understand we have done, to the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which was adopted this week at the UN intergovernmental conference which took place in Morocco. In response to a recent parliamentary question, I was told that the compact is "non-binding and respectful of national sovereignty". I was also told that this is happening "against a background where individual States cannot address challenges relating to migration alone. For example, cross-border efforts are essential if human smuggling and trafficking is to be reduced."However, on foot of a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, last July, we know that there has not been a single conviction for human trafficking under the provisions of our own Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, despite the fact that there were two prosecutions under the relevant section of the Act in 2016 and four prosecutions in 2017. If we cannot get our own house in order with respect to trafficking and people smuggling, what hope do we have of addressing the world's people trafficking problems? As I said, there are great concerns about this. I am raising this issue in a non-adversarial way because we are concerned. Since 2012, a total of 101 prosecutions have been issued under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008. The vast majority of these prosecutions relate to offences under the section of the Act covering child trafficking and pornography, which we also have to cover. While on the one hand it is very encouraging, I cannot fail to be concerned about the fact that only 48 convictions have emerged from the process since 2012.

Public representatives across the country have been inundated with emails and phone calls from people who are concerned about the compact. There was a ferocious debate between two candidates for the leadership of Angela Merkel's party in Germany. There is concern in other countries. Some of the stuff out there may not be accurate. I do not know. I would have thought, however, that there would have been statements or a debate in the Dáil on such an issue before the Government would sign this compact with other countries. Perhaps I am wrong on the procedure but I would have expected a debate in the Dáil. I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on the matter.

He sends his apologies. I sincerely thank the Deputies for raising this important topical matter. I am happy to provide some background and context to the global compact on safe, orderly and regular migration. As has been said, the Minister has just returned from the intergovernmental signing conference for the compact in Marrakesh, where more than 140 UN member states were represented, most by senior ministers or Heads of State. This debate is an opportunity to clear up some misconceptions about the compact being pushed by some politicians - though thankfully none here - for obvious political ends and, in particular, by users of social media. Ireland has been closely involved in the development of the global compact on migration and, alongside Jordan, Ireland co-facilitated the 2016 New York declaration on refugees and migrants, a direct precursor to the compact. It is clear that mass migration across the world cannot be managed by one country alone. Migration is a global issue, which requires global co-operation. The global compact on migration, agreed this week by a significant majority of UN member states in Marrakesh, is a legally non-binding document that looks at migration from a global perspective. While non-binding, it provides a framework for co-operation between states. The compact is grounded in values of state sovereignty, responsibility sharing, non-discrimination and human rights, and recognises that a co-operative approach is needed to optimise the overall benefits of migration, while addressing its risks and challenges for individuals and communities in countries of origin, transit and destination. The global compact places state sovereignty at its heart, meaning that it respects the rights of all countries to control their borders and retain control of their migration policy. Despite the narrative being put forward by opponents of the compact in recent days, agreeing it will not negatively influence Ireland or our migration policy. I will clear up some misconceptions on this issue. The compact will not grant the same rights to migrants as Irish nationals. It will not remove the distinction between legal and illegal migrants; rather it reinforces this distinction. The compact will not make criticising migration a crime, as some have claimed. It simply places an importance on combatting xenophobia and racism. I believe we all agree on the importance of that. The compact will not infringe on Ireland's ability to operate its own migration policy. While it is regrettable that some countries have decided to not participate at this time, and that the compact has become a kind of cause célèbre for far right parties in some countries, Ireland supports the objective of the compact. It provides a framework for co-operation through which Ireland can work with other countries on ensuring that legal migration, when it does occur, is as safe as possible and beneficial to all.

I have spoken to him about this. As I said, while on the one hand what the Minister of State said is encouraging, I cannot fail to be concerned about the fact that only 48 convictions have emerged from the process since 2012. I do not want to be alarmist about this and I hope that what I say will not be taken out of context.It is now clear that the Governments of the United States, Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia have all pulled out of the UN migration pact process. While I have listened to the Minister of State's reassurances, I must ask why those countries have pulled out. I want answers. What do those states see or know that we do not see or know? The most important issue, however, is the total lack of engagement with the people or with this House. Surely such a decision should be debated here. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to raise this matter. I thank the Minister of State for the clarity. I look forward to engaging in this process that is ongoing and ensuring that it does what it says on the tin. I am concerned about why those countries pulled out of the process if they were supposed to be happy with it.

The CDU had a heated and protracted debate on this issue even though Angela Merkel is very much in favour of supporting migrants. There is a fear about why Austria and many other countries have pulled out of the process. Many politicians, as outlined by the Minister of State, have probably supported this for political gain. The issue of migration would not account for massive political gains for Germany or the CDU, even though many members would be in favour of supporting migrants. There is a concern among journalists, which has been expressed, and among the ordinary people about the impact of what is happening. No one is saying that every country would not play its part in helping migrants but there is a fear particularly among the media that they will be shut down. I welcome the Minister of State's comments.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	351	On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Deputies for this opportunity to discuss the global migration pact and to set out exactly what the compact involves. I hope I was clear on that. We cannot be responsible for what other countries have decided to do or not to do. That is their business but we have been engaged in this process for quite some time. It does not infringe on our sovereignty in any way. It clarifies certain issues and helps us to work with other countries on this massive global issue. No country can deal with this problem on its own. We know that countries in Africa, the Middle East and Europe are still recovering from the effects of the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016. The lessons we learned then should serve us as a reminder of the need to address migration in a co-operative and comprehensive manner and the dangers we face when we do not. Ireland has a long history of migration. More than 17% of Irish nationals live abroad. In recent years, Ireland has become a country of inward migration and the contribution of migrants from all parts of the world helped drive our economy from our health sector to our growing tech sector and everything in between. The compact recognises the contribution of these people and works to optimise the benefits of migration for countries of origin, countries of destination, for migrants and their families and for the receiving communities. I stress again the non-legally binding nature of the compact and its valuable role as a framework through which we can better co-operate globally on migration. Migration is an issue that is not going away. It is up to us to define how we respond to and manage it. I would welcome further debate on this issue in the House and at the various committees. I have taken note of Deputy Mattie McGrath's concern about trafficking, an issue on which I would welcome a debate. I would also welcome Deputies' views on it. I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and I hope I have brought some clarity to the matter. We are available at any time if they have further queries on the issue.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	355	I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is taking it. Unfortunately, existing respite services across Cavan and Monaghan for persons with disabilities - both children and adults - are totally inadequate. Not enough resources are being devoted to this critical area, which is extremely important for many individuals and their families. There are not enough centres or enough personnel working in the existing centres. The services are underfunded, under-resourced and the personnel in them are working under great pressure. I know many people who have family members accessing those services. Even though they would be disappointed with the limited time they get the opportunity to leave a son, a daughter or a sibling in those centres, the message I have heard at all times emphasises the respect the families have for the facilities and the personnel working in the centres. One gentleman told me today that he and his wife have wonderful respect for the services and the personnel who deliver the services, when they are available. The gentleman in question is of pension age. He and his wife have an adult child with a disability. On a number of occasions, their proposed respite was cancelled. The same person had hospital appointments to coincide with the respite period that was proposed for their child. It is very difficult for families when respite care that is promised for a certain number of weeks or for a few days is cancelled. The family member, who is the carer at home 99% of the time, may have a hospital appointment away from Cavan or Monaghan, usually in Dublin. This creates serious problems and literally a crisis for such families when proposed respite is cancelled. There are only three centres across Cavan and Monaghan delivering these services. One of those is the Annalee View respite care centre in Cootehill, County Cavan. Families who have loved ones who have gone there for respite have told me they very much appreciate the commitment, hard work and professionalism of the staff at the centre, but they are not able to access it as they should be able to do so. There have been cancellations. There is no provision in Cavan-Monaghan for managing a crisis. If a crisis arises for some families, that entails cancellations of services and respite for other people. A gentleman read a letter to me earlier. He stated that, in 2005, I had been given a reply by the HSE in respect of a question on the need to improve services. He reminded me that the level of services available in 2005 was much better than at present. Even at that time, the Department of Health and the HSE recognised that there was an immediate need to improve and extend the level of services available. There is an urgent need to ensure that adequate resources are provided to ensure that there is an increase in personnel delivering those critical services and that there are also extensions to the existing centres or new centres developed. I referred to the Annalee View respite care centre in Cootehill, which offers services for both adults and children. Some people have suggested that children and adult services should be separate. However, regardless of the architecture in the delivery of services, we need a proper levels of services to ensure that those people are given that respite when they need it.

I thank the Deputy for raising it and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the provision of respite services in counties Cavan and Monaghan. The Government’s ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service. We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives. The need for increased respite services is acknowledged and the HSE continues to work with all service providers to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available. As part of its ongoing service provision, this year the HSE will provide more than 182,000 respite nights and 42,500 day respite sessions to families in need right across the country. There has been a significant improvement in respite services this year.An additional €10 million was provided this year to fund 12 new respite houses. That is one in each HSE CHO area and an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite from this area. These additional houses are providing additional respite for families who need it. Ten houses have opened to date, with the remaining two opening shortly. When fully operational, this will provide 19,000 extra overnights and 2,520 home sharing nights annually. Some €2 million of that extra money is being targeted at alternative respite services. These are practical and important solutions, extended day services, summer camps and Saturday clubs. They are making a difference to families right across the country. In the context of respite services within Cavan-Monaghan disability services, I am informed by the HSE that Steadfast House has the capacity to provide 1,008 adult respite beds per year. Annalee View Respite Centre, which the Deputy mentioned, has the capacity to provide 910 adult respite beds per year, while St. Christopher’s Disability Centre provides, on average, 730 adult respite beds per year. Annalee View Respite Centre, Cootehill, County Cavan, can accommodate five service users at a time. Respite services in Annalee were recently restricted due to the needs of one person. However, the restriction is now lifted and the service has returned to normal capacity. The number of adult service users continually increases as service users transfer from child to adult services. This impacts on the level of respite existing service users receive. A number of service users have associated mobility needs which mean they can only access downstairs bedrooms. This affects the level of respite they receive. We are acutely aware that families need support to care for their loved ones and, therefore, Government is committed to providing a range of accessible respite care supports for people with a disability and their families.

I am glad that the restriction due to the particular needs of the one person he refers to has been lifted and that the service has now returned to normal capacity. Normal capacity is under capacity and that is the bottom line. When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met a delegation, along with me, he conceded that there is currently a deficit for respite services for persons with a disability in the Cavan-Monaghan area. Many of those parents across the area, as well as siblings, are very undemanding people. They are understanding that there may, at times, be a cancellation due to a crisis arising for some other family. Far too often, in the past few years, cancellations have been a regular feature in the delivery of the service. It is not acceptable and the people who speak to me understand that services will not be as good as we would all like them to be. They only demand a very basic level of service. The Minister of State quite rightly refers, as the HSE indicated in written correspondence too, to the growing demand. As people leave the children's services and become young adults, an increasing number of people need these services. Parents, by definition, get older. Many parents ring me or come to see me at the weekend who are really worried about the long-term facilities and services that will be available for their loved one. There is no reason, as a society or a country, we should not provide a basic, decent level of service, which is critical for many vulnerable people. I ask the Minister of State to bring back to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, the urgent need to ensure that additional investment is put in place in the Cavan-Monaghan disability services and that we have a reasonable service. Nobody is looking for an extravagant service. We are looking for a very basic service. The hard-working, decent people I speak to, who give so much love, care and attention to their family on a 24-hour basis, demand very little. The least we could do as a society and an Oireachtas is provide a decent level of respite services for those people.

I acknowledge that it is not just his right to raise this issue but his duty as a public representative. Our duty as a collective is to be there to be the voice of these families who do not have the time for the kind of advocacy they wish to do because they are caring full time. Respite is a basic fundamental service that any society should be in a position to provide, never mind a modern, progressive society such as we in Ireland thankfully are. The challenge is to continue to keep that focus on that vulnerable cohort and to ensure that we provide the necessary supports to families who need that respite. While we provide 182,000 respite nights a year, that is all well and good and it is to be acknowledged - I do not think anybody disputes how welcome it is - it clearly it is not enough because of the growing demand across both child and adult services, especially adult, with children moving into them. I will take what the Deputy said back. I welcome the airing that he has given to this issue. I, as a public representative, share his concern and wish to see the service greatly enhanced by all of us working together for the year ahead. I will take on board everything the Deputy has said and be sure to add my voice to that. I will speak with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to continue with the development of this service and its provision for those who need it.

The availability of orphan drugs has come to my attention and has been mentioned many times in this House recently. Orphan drugs are drugs specifically designed to diagnose or prevent life-threatening or chronically debilitating rare diseases. An increasingly common issue in Ireland is that drugs fail to secure reimbursement from the HSE. Many of these drugs are available around Europe. In most cases, Ireland is the only country that does not have these drugs available. While not every orphan drug proposed to the State would represent a workable agreement, there are growing discrepancies in availability and barriers to providing the latest medicines available to cure these rare diseases. While there has been a rare disease plan in place in Ireland since 2014, and the Joint Committee on Health has been dealing with this regularly, there appears to be a breakdown in communications. It is caught between two stools. The HSE has statutory responsibility for the pricing of medicines. However, the HSE is governed by a policy set by the Government through the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. The drugs seem to be falling through these two cracks and one does not seem to know how to handle the other. A framework exists whereby the State and industry agree a timeframe but unfortunately we are left with a slow, cumbersome situation. The child who may have a difficult diagnosis or who has a disease who is waiting to be cured could unfortunately have passed away by the time the medicine is made available, which is difficult for the family, especially if it is a child. Will the Minister of State look at this again and whether the process of making these drugs available could be more streamlined if they are suitable? They should not go through this protracted and drawn-out process whereby the child or person might be diagnosed today and the drug may not be made available for a couple of years. The only way to deal with a particular diagnosis is to give care and attention efficiently and quickly. It is important that we have a fast-track approach to this issue. A number of issues have been debated over a period in this House. Different drugs have become available around Europe but not here in Ireland. That must be addressed. We should be on the same playing field as everybody else. If somebody gets sick in Ireland and the drug has to be available here, that person should not have to go elsewhere to avail of it or to cure the illness he or she may have. Could the system be changed to make it more user-friendly so that the process of this drug being approved and reimbursed by the HSE and Government can be fast-tracked to make sure that the person who requires this medicine can get it when he or she wants it?

I appreciate that a rare disease diagnosis places enormous stress on patients and their families and, as Deputy Deering is aware, access to potentially beneficial medicines for the treatment of rare diseases is extremely important for patients and their families.I want to assure Deputy Deering that the Minister for Health works tirelessly to address issues around access for patients to new and innovative medicines. The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion, as appropriate. The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions, to include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE. While the 2013 Health Act does not include provision for a specific rule set when assessing orphan drugs, the HSE and the NCPE seek to take into account issues such as patient numbers and the nature of the condition to be treated when evaluating these medicines. The criteria that apply to the evaluation process allow sufficient scope for the HSE to take on board the particular circumstances that pertain to orphan drugs. In reaching its decision, the HSE will examine all the relevant evidence and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations that are appropriate, including from the NCPE. The Deputy rightly identifies that increasingly drugs are being developed to target rare conditions and that these drugs often come with very high list prices. In that respect, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to the funding challenges that these drugs represent. It does this by drawing on the criteria contained in the Health Act, including the potential or actual budget impact of the drug in question and the cost effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying a particular item rather than providing other health services. These are difficult decisions but recognise the core challenges of the availability of finite resources in the face of ever competing demands. Since the signing of the four year framework agreement on the supply and pricing of medicines in 2016, a significant number of orphan drugs have been reimbursed by the State. Notwithstanding the challenges which orphan drugs present and the fact that the HSE and NCPE are mindful of these issues when assessing orphan medicinal products, a number of changes have been introduced to address those challenges. In June 2018, a technology review committee for rare diseases was established. This committee is now operational and has already completed work in relation to orphan products. As well as examining the methodologies for assessing orphan drugs, it will also consider the views of patients, caregivers and examine the wider issues surrounding health technology assessments. In addition, the composition of the HSE drugs group is being expanded to include two representatives from the National Patients Forum and more clinical expertise in the area of rare disease. Both of these measures are intended to provide greater balance and transparency to the assessment process as a whole.  The challenge of accessing innovative medicines at affordable prices is one shared by most, if not all, developed countries. It is estimated that in the region of 45 new molecules are due to receive market authorisation in Europe each year over the next five years. It is in this high-tech space, including orphan drugs, that the greatest challenges will arise in the years ahead. A significant development in Ireland’s international agenda was joining the BeNeLuxA initiative on pharmaceutical policy in June 2018. This collaboration will support the Government's objective of co-operating with other European countries to identify workable solutions in an increasingly challenging environment to secure timely access for patients to new medicines, including orphan medicines, in an affordable and sustainable way.

I welcome the initiatives commenced this year, in particular the review committee established in June but it is important a timeline is put in place for completion and publication of that review. It is also important that these drugs are affordable and that the State is not in hock to, or taken advantage of by, the large pharmaceutical companies. Crucially, the people who need these drugs need them now because they may not be around in two years' time when they become available.  As I said, it is important the initiative announced earlier in the year is progressed more quickly such that if a new disease is identified and an adult or child needs drugs that will be of huge benefit to them, they can access them. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a timeframe is set for completion of that initiative such that the process can be more efficient going forward.

There always will be tension between the State as the purchaser of important drugs and the giant pharmaceutical companies producing and supplying them, often for lottery type amounts of money. The State has to ensure affordability not only in terms of fiscal governance but to ensure they are available to everybody who needs them. If we pay over the odds for any particular drug we would limit the number of people who can avail of them. Notwithstanding those challenges, the Deputy has asked that we be more prescient in our timelines and I will pass on his request to the Minister.

The report revealed that 32% of the 75,000 calls it received last year were in regard to eviction notices. The previous year, 2016, eviction notices accounted for 14% of calls to Threshold. Calls regarding eviction notices have more than doubled in one year. According to Threshold in Ireland, and in Europe generally, the private rental sector is the leading source of homelessness through evictions, legal and illegal. According to Focus Ireland, 69% of homeless people report that their last stable home was in the private rental sector. It is sheer insanity in the midst of the greatest housing crisis in the history of this State to allow the flow of evictions from the private rental sector to continue without a serious attempt to stem the flow. This Bill represents a serious attempt to stem the flow. The 2017 report also reveals that the most common type of eviction notice references sale of property as the grounds for eviction and that there has been an increase in the number of eviction notices reported to Threshold in 2017 which reference renovation of property as the grounds for eviction. Half of all eviction notices dealt with by Threshold in 2017 were evictions on the grounds of renovation or sale of property. If this Bill were passed it would prevent all of these evictions. During Leaders' Question today the Taoiseach said the Bill we are discussing tonight is too extreme.However, a ban on the sale of property as grounds for eviction is not uncommon in continental Europe. It is legal in Germany, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. I do not see landlords doing a runner out of Sweden or the Netherlands because a ban on evictions on the grounds of sale of property is the law of the land. There is a great deal of scaremongering on that issue. It is not these governments that are extreme on this issue but the Government of which the Minister is a part and which is presided over by the Taoiseach. It is extreme in allowing evictions to continue at this rate at a time of record homelessness. Last night, I visited tenants at 539 North Circular Road. As explained by my colleague, Deputy Paul Murphy, on Leaders' Questions earlier, tenants in this 16-apartment building were issued with notices to quit at the end of October and face eviction at the beginning of January. The landlord, a Mr. James Anderson, has been a director or shareholder of no less than seven current or former companies with share capital of up to €1 million in one case.

This landlord is trying to evict families with children at Christmas on the grounds of renovation. Who is extreme? Is it the parties in the Dáil that would ban this practice or the parties that allow it to happen under the law? I will list some of the key changes provided for in the Bill and comment briefly on some of them, aside from the two changes I have already outlined. The Bill would, first, ban the sale of property as a ground for eviction and, second, ban renovation as a ground for eviction. Third, in the case of a landlord wishing to evict to move a family member into the property, the Bill requires the landlord to compensate the tenant by way of six months back rent. Fourth, the Bill unambiguously extends tenant rights to students and affords them full tenant rights under the law. Fifth, in the event of a bank or receiver taking over a property with a tenant in situ the bank or receiver shall have full landlord responsibilities and the tenant will retain full tenant rights. Sixth, the Bill affords tenants full tenant rights after two months, as opposed to the current requirement of six months. Seventh, the Bill would remove the danger zone for tenants which allows evictions when a tenancy expires by rolling over Part 4 tenancies into a new tenancy arrangement. With regard to the family member issue, 52% of such cases appealed to the RTB last year were found to be invalid. The provision in the Bill is an attempt to weed out bogus and illegal evictions of this type. The provision relating to banks and receivers will be of particular interest to tenants in the 12,732 buy-to-let properties identified by the Central Bank as being in long-term mortgage arrears of two years or more. As regards students being accorded tenant rights, this will apply to both privately-owned and publicly-owned student accommodation and will end the situation where public authorities such as State funded universities have been excluded under the legislation. Earlier, the Taoiseach took issue with Solidarity's call for landlords to recuse themselves from voting on this issue. Some 15 Fianna Fáil Deputies, 14 Fine Gael Deputies, four members of the Cabinet and five Ministers of State are declared landlords. In society in general, 5% of the population are landlords. The proportion of landlords in the Dáil is far greater, particularly among the ranks of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties. The Taoiseach stated that those Deputies would not be guided by their vested interests in how they vote. I will not comment on that. The commitment of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to the capitalist market is probably a greater factor than the individual property interests of their Deputies. However, two years ago, in January 2017, the Dáil voted on Solidarity's anti-eviction Bill of 2016. The vote was tied - I believe it was 51 for and 51 against - and the Bill was defeated with the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. It is a fact that if Deputies who are landlords had recused themselves from that division the Bill would have passed Second Stage. It is also a fact that if the Bill had passed all five Stages in 2017 a large number of the evictions carried out in the interim would have been illegal, most of them would have been prevented and the number of homeless people would be far lower than it is today. We make no apology for repeating our call for Deputies who are landlords not to vote on this Bill on Thursday. The Taoiseach stated on "The Late Late Show" that the housing crisis keeps him awake at night, and the Government tells us it plans to bring forward legislation on these issues. It will introduce a rent register, extend eviction notice periods, provide a legal definition of substantial refurbishment and give increased powers to the RTB. I welcome any change the Government makes that improves the lot of tenants by one iota, whether it is under pressure from the emerging housing protest movement or from public opinion. However, these changes do not ban evictions or strike at the root of evictions. They will not stop many of them either. If Members wish to stop evictions, they will vote to ban them. As a result, they must vote for this Bill.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	368	I will start by referring to what the Taoiseach stated earlier and the use of the term "extreme". This has become a familiar trope of the Taoiseach when referring to the socialist left and our policies. It is part of a wider, quite worrying, narrative that is taking hold in the mainstream political establishment across Europe, which says there are extremists on the right and extremists on the left and then the nice, sensible, pragmatic centre. An issue such as this tests that narrative in a concrete way and refutes it in the strongest terms. For Elaine, who I have mentioned here previously but whose case is still on my desk, the situation is extreme. It is now past the date when she must leave her house. The landlord is evicting her and her four children on the ground of sale. She is now overholding. Although she did not have legal grounds to appeal she appealed just to delay the process because she had nowhere to go. Now, days before Christmas, she is faced with having to overhold or put herself and her four children into homelessness. It is worth pointing out what homelessness will mean for Elaine. She has been pleading with the local authority and the various agencies and bodies to try to find a solution. She does not want to overhold or to be in a confrontation with her landlord, who has told her he is going to the District Court to take out a summons to evict her.She went to the council and she was told the place finder service could not find anywhere for her. There is no emergency hub accommodation available for her and she tries every day to look for housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies but cannot find them. Most of the time she does not even get a response. The only response she received, after checking with multiple landlords, was one who asked her to send a landlord reference and a work reference. She had a good landlord reference, which she sent on but as a mother of four kids she was not in a position to work and did not have a work reference. She has not heard back from that landlord, who was the only one who even bothered to reply. It is because she is a HAP applicant. She literally has nowhere to go. She was asked if she could find bed and breakfast accommodation or hotel and self accommodate. She is looking every day and cannot find one. The place finder service cannot find one. There is none. That is extreme. In the past few days, she has found herself in another dilemma. As we are approaching Christmas, her young children pleaded with her to put up a Christmas tree. She debated on whether or not to put up a tree because she did not know if she was going to be in her current place with her kids for Christmas. Eventually she submitted to please her children and the Christmas tree was put up, but she does not know if she will be in the place in a few days' time. The question for the Minister is, "What is Elaine to do?" If she has to get out of her current place, that is extreme. Everything about Elaine's circumstances is just about as extreme as one could get. How can the Minister claim that a Bill that prevents that from happening is extreme? The Bill would provide the ability to say to the landlord, "Sorry, it may be inconvenient and a bit of a problem for you, but given that Elaine has nowhere to go, we are not allowing you to evict her." What is extreme about that? It is a very reasonable thing for the law to say in the teeth of a crisis such as the one we currently face. As Deputy Barry pointed out, the provisions in the Bill are quite common in other jurisdictions in Europe. One would hardly accuse those countries in Europe, which have already been detailed, of having extremist regimes. We are just trying to stop the flow into homelessness. That is the point. Unless the Minister can provide an answer for Elaine, then morally he has not got a leg to stand on, and neither has any Deputy in this Dáil, in opposing this Bill. The Minister must respond to Elaine's situation, and there are many more people like Elaine who are facing that same dilemma coming into Christmas. I want to make another point about the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the contribution the State's social housing policy is making to the extreme situations people are facing. At this morning's Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, attended by the Minister, I asked about HAP tenancies, or what the Minister calls social housing solutions. I asked how many people have had to leave those social housing solutions because the landlord has pulled out. The Minister sent the figures to us after the meeting, which in fairness he promised he would. The number is 2,624. This are 2,624 Elaine-type situations. What the Minister described as a social housing solution has actually turned out not to be a solution but has resulted in people being plunged back into the extremity of Elaine-type situations. It is not a housing solution and the Minister should stop calling it a housing solution. The Minister should certainly not massage the housing waiting lists by taking people who get HAP tenancies off the housing list. Until HAP was invented if a person was housed while on the waiting list he or she would not face an Elaine-type situation. A person was housed for life, unless he or she failed to pay the rent or did something terrible. That is the difference between a council house and a HAP tenancy, and I put it to the Minister that it is all the difference in the world. Some 90% of the Minister's social housing plan, Rebuilding Ireland, depends on those kinds of tenancies. The Minister can say 17,000 HAP tenancies work, but if 2,624 have unravelled, how many more will unravel? The answer is that thousands will unravel. We just have to look at the figures. For years to come - well beyond 2021 and Rebuilding Ireland - the State will be responsible for plunging thousands of people, including children, into Elaine-type situations. It is not right. The Bill seeks to address this so that the State will not allow that to happen and people cannot be put into that sort of extreme situation. Add to this the absolutely shocking and extortionate rents currently being charged in the private rental sector. Some weeks ago I held up a newspaper property supplement to the Taoiseach showing the unbelievable rents such as €2,000 and €2,200. IRES Reit has tried to charge €2,800 for three bedroom apartments. Who can afford that? Everyone in those places is literally one pay cheque away from an Elaine-type housing emergency. We are not in control of the private rental sector and we are not building the social and affordable housing that is genuinely secure and which will not lead into those Elaine-type extreme situations. I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to support this measure, even on a temporary basis while we are faced with this emergency. If we get out of this emergency in five or ten years, we can look at it again. As of now there is simply no moral justification for people like Elaine and her children, and thousands of others like them, being put into that sort of extreme situation. It is not right and it is not just. It is shameful and the Bill seeks to address it.

Before I call the Minister to respond, I wish to make one point. Deputy Barry quite correctly pointed out that a very high proportion of the Members of this House are landlords. The Deputy did so in the course of referring to the defeat of the Anti-Evictions Bill 2016 on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle. I should declare that I, too, am a landlord, albeit a reluctant one. My vote on that day was based on the precedent and tradition that the Ceann Comhairle of the day votes for the status quo.

I put it to Deputy Barry that to say that they cannot is to say that he cannot. The Deputy would have to recuse himself from voting on any law that might pass through this House that may impact on the Deputy. Every law that is passed in this House has an impact on the Deputy as a citizen of the State. It is a nonsense argument to make and it does not stand up.

On Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments, all Members deal with cases such as Elaine's, in every constituency in the State. We have a homelessness crisis and a shortage of housing. We are not massaging the social housing waiting lists. It is the law of the land that the housing assistance payment meets the social housing need. It is doing so for more than 40,000 families and individuals. The Deputy is aware - the numbers attest to it - that sometimes there are cases where the accommodation does not work out in a particular case for whatever reason, be it on the landlord's side or the tenant's side. This is why we have HAP place finder units and why the HAP continues with the person who qualifies for it. It is also important to state that 90% of our plans for increasing social housing supports do not depend on the private rental sector. Rebuilding Ireland has quite a clear commitment, as does the national development plan and Project Ireland 2040. Next year between one in five and one in four new homes built in the State will be built for social housing. There will be 10,000 homes in all to be added to the stock of social housing.In 2021, we will move away from an over-reliance on HAP - I accept there is an over-reliance - to having people accommodated in the stock of social housing. That is right and it is part of our Rebuilding Ireland plan. The Government opposes the Bill. We support a number of measures in it and are progressing them. Other measures go too far and the Taoiseach was right to say that they are too extreme. Our rental market is not like that of other European countries yet. It is true that we do not have a mature rental sector. We are trying to reform it to make it into one, but we are doing so in a time of under-supply, which makes it more challenging. We do not have a cost rental market. In other countries, it is at 20% to 25%, but we are trying to build one. We do not have an independent regulator for tenants and landlords but we are trying to turn the RTB into one at the moment. We do not have enough supply and we do not have the professional landlord sector that they have in other European countries because they are more mature. We are losing landlords. It is a fact we cannot run away from. The majority of our landlords, 85%, own only one or two properties. I refer to an elderly couple making a small investment, someone perhaps inheriting a property that they did not think they would inherit, or people who never intended to own a second property. Some became accidental landlords through the crash because their family became larger and they wanted to move on. It is wrong to demonise these people, because they are providing homes to others whether they meant to or not. Buy-to-lets are being sold today and they are not being bought by other landlords. We are losing landlords and rental homes. We have to take that very seriously. Any new measure that comes into this House needs to be weighed against the risk of losing landlords and making things worse for people who are in the rental sector. Unfortunately, there are always going to be grounds for evictions. Even people in the voluntary sector will tell us that. Evictions are not the main source for people entering into emergency accommodation and language here does matter. Deputy Boyd Barrett held up a newspaper advertisement recently of loans that had been owned by NAMA and that have now been sold. He called it public housing but it is not public housing. Language matters.

We have to make a distinction between evictions and notices of termination. Even when we look at notices of termination, given the make-up of the rental sector that we have today we have to be careful in interfering more than we are at the moment. We have to make sure we are not placing extra burdens on small landlords and we have to make sure that we are not prohibiting someone from selling a property that they own; they might need to sell it for perfectly legitimate reasons in their own lives and may not have the money to compensate the person who is living in the property at that point in time. This Bill risks further undermining the rental sector. We need a strong, mature rental sector. We need landlords to be a part of that. I know the intentions might be noble here in trying to protect and help people like Elaine; I understand that. However, we have to think of the unintended consequences. We have to make sure we do not risk doing more harm than good. As a Government, we believe we can bring about greater protections for renters without undermining the supply of homes for rent. The new residential tenancies Bill does that. It does not do everything but I believe it brings forward priority areas that I hope we all can agree on. I hope we can get that Bill through the House quickly in January and that we will have it as our first cause when we come back after the recess. It is going to do some good. I understand the Threshold report because I was at the launch of the report. We all believe it is right to support organisations such as Threshold that support people who find themselves in these difficulties. In the Bill we are bringing forward, we meet a number of the concerns that organisations such as Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, whose representatives I met earlier, believe we should progress as reforms. It is important to spell out the main provisions of that forthcoming Government Bill in order that people understand what we are talking about. If someone breaches the rent caps that are in place at the moment, we will make it a criminal offence. We will have new RTB data tomorrow on what has happened in quarter 3 in the rental sector and that will underline the need to bring this through quickly in terms of making it a criminal offence to contravene the RPZs. The Bill will bring in new powers for the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords for non-compliance with RPZs. It will allow the RTB to act independently, which is important because the burden at the moment falls on tenants. That puts them in an unfair position because they do not want to risk losing their tenancy and do not want to kick up a fuss. It needs to be possible for the RTB to act independently. We are providing power to the board to do that in law as well as the resources that are provided in the budget for next year. We will extend the notice period for tenancy terminations, which is important. We are doubling it, in effect, beyond six months, which will give people more time when notice is served to find a new property. We are also making other amendments, for example, establishing a rent register and having rent transparency so people can see what is fair and can see automatically whether someone is trying to gouge them on the rent. Our Bill also provides to extend rent protections to student accommodation where we can. In the future, we need to make sure we are protecting tenants' rights in receiverships and we will do that in a second Bill but it is more complex. We can allow for tenancies of indefinite duration, which are necessary for having a mature rental sector with long-term leases, and also for helping those landlords who have been providing below-market rents for so many years for their tenants and who got caught in the RPZs and find themselves in a position where they cannot increase the rent to cover the cost of maintaining the property. These areas are more complex and they will be addressed in future legislation. The priority legislation that was published this week and that we can debate in the Dáil in January on the first day the Business Committee allows us will enable us to bring in important protections. As for the sanctions regime, we will put in place new resources for the RTB so we can have these inspections. A landlord could be found to be in breach in a number of ways, including not co-operating with an inspection in the first instance; not adhering to rent caps; not registering a tenancy; where they are making a substantial change, not doing so within the new law which we are defining; not notifying the RTB when they have invoked that exemption because they are doing a substantial renovation; or giving false information. All of these new measures are going to allow the RTB to protect tenants more, to have a more robust approach and to have its own independent inspections. Then, depending on the gravity of the situation, the RTB will be able to go down the criminal path or go down the new administrative path whereby it can levy a significant fine on a landlord of up to €15,000 and additionally another €15,000 to cover the RTB's own costs. It is very important that we give the RTB those powers and that administrative and criminal sanctions are available to it. Student accommodation is an important area which we have debated as well. Currently student accommodation that is let under a tenancy agreement is covered by rent caps while purpose-built student accommodation under a licence or public authorities that license student accommodation are not. A piece of work is being done between myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to try to bring that rental accommodation into the RPZs and into the definition of rent caps without doing other things that would adversely impact upon the supply of new student accommodation. We will bring that forward on Committee Stage and I hope to have everyone's support. We need to make sure we can do it in law so that it is not challenged because of having sufficient evidence and that piece of work is ongoing. If this Bill were passed, it might result in a number of landlords moving to serve notices immediately. While the Deputies think it would move to help the situation, it could make it far worse, far more quickly, by making homelessness worse, putting more pressure on people, and creating greater insecurity of tenancies, resulting in more people entering into emergency accommodation. That is not what any of us want to achieve. We believe our Bill moves forward in the right way in terms of bringing greater protections to tenants and bringing greater balance as we try to make a more mature rental sector. We have to think of the risks in everything we do and of the unintended consequences. That is important in the approach we are taking. That is why the Government is not supporting this Bill. We are progressing some measures in it. We have other measures of our own which are a priority for us. We think that some of the fundamental measures in the Bill would make the situation worse and that is not what any of us want.

I am not a landlord but even if I were, as a Deputy I would be able to look at a Bill or proposal that comes forward on its merits. The idea that other colleagues cannot do so is somewhat unfortunate. It might grab a few headlines but it is an unfair charge. I am not a landlord. I was previously an accidental landlord, if Deputy Barry wishes to know, as many other people are. I was left with a property that I lived in, which my wife and I purchased at the height of the market and sold at a substantial loss and which I am still paying off. There are lots of people like me who are in that boat. If Deputies want to demonise the 90% of landlords who own one or two properties, many of whom were left in that position, that is fine.I am interested in solutions. I read the Bill and I agree wholeheartedly, as we did previously, with how receivers and lenders who have taken possession of properties should be dealt with. They should be included in the definition of a landlord. Fianna Fáil tabled an amendment to the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 to allow that to happen. We discussed it with Government at the time and we are still committed to doing it. I hope we will see this happen in the Government's proposed residential tenancies (amendment) Bill. I want to pass legislation that makes a difference. We can be very simplistic about it if we wish and I believe Deputy Barry knows he is being simplistic with elements of the Bill. Every day unfortunately I deal with people who are homeless or under threat of homelessness. If I thought for one minute that passing this Bill and particularly the element of completely disallowing the reason of sale for the issuing of an eviction notice would be of benefit, I would vote for it. However, Deputy Barry and his colleagues need to convince us that it is constitutional and would stand up to challenge. Unfortunately, having looked at it we do not believe it would. There may be an unintended consequence. If this is something they really wanted to do and they did not to just want to grab headlines and try to sell a simplistic solution that they know will not work, they should point out how this could actually be done in law. I do not believe that could be done. Do they not accept that bringing in this blunt measure would result in a flight of many other individual landlords, many of whom are good people and have had tenants for years? I want to see increase in supply and stable housing. As the Minister knows, I have been highly critical of the overdependence on housing assistance payments. We need to work towards the implementation of cost-rental models. I say this with all due respect to Deputy Boyd Barrett because many of us are dealing with cases such as that of Elaine, Seamus and Michael all over the country. If we pass this Bill now it will not stop future evictions or solve this crisis. Even on a temporary basis I do not see how it would. While elements of it are well meaning, it is simplistic in the extreme. I absolutely agree with the receivership amendment. Where homes are handed over and sold, tenants should not be affected. I do not see the reason for it. When the Minister responds he should outline the status of that. We have said Fianna Fáil will introduce legislation in this regard if that is not done. My party and I have been very disappointed with the delay in publishing the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill. I hope that when it is finally published that we can move on with the elements of it that we agree on. I have worked with Deputy Ó Broin and Sinn Féin, and have worked with the Minister in trying to strengthen tenants' rights, and look at purpose-built student accommodation and other elements. The legality around tenancies, licence to reside and this whole market is not simple. It is incumbent on the elected Members of this House to ensure that anything we pass is constitutional, stands up to legal challenge and can actually be done, as opposed to just publishing an anti-evictions Bill and claiming it is the panacea for all our ills. It is not and everyone knows it. The proposers of the Bill know it contains elements that are deeply flawed. With all due respect to Deputy Coppinger I do not see much difference between this Bill and the one presented previously. I absolutely agree with the inclusion of receivers and lenders. The blanket prohibition of sale of property as grounds for terminating a tenancy may lead to more people leaving the market and actually exacerbating the problem and driving up rents. That is not what my party wants to do and we could not support legislation that does that. However, we would absolutely support the receivership element of the Bill.

Bills put before this House should not just be ideological statements of principle. Our housing crisis is far too serious for that. Our national housing crisis deserves solutions that have a chance of being implemented and would provide help to those experiencing homelessness due to unaffordable rents and the sale of rental properties. Unfortunately, this Bill does not do that. While it is titled as an anti-eviction Bill and I accept the genuine intentions of those behind it, the reality is that the Bill if enacted would certainly be contested in the courts. Between now and the judgment on the constitutionality of the Bill, there would be a massive market reaction. Owners of rental properties would immediately leave the market in large numbers. An anti-eviction Bill would in the real world outside this Chamber become an eviction Bill. Thousands of families would find themselves being issued notice to quit because of this Bill. However, I have great sympathy for the intentions behind this Bill. There is abuse of the sale-of-property reason to get rid of tenants. This is contributing to homelessness and we need to be resolute in ensuring that rental properties are affordable and available for those who need them. The introduction of six months’ rent in compensation is an unprecedented burden on all landlords, 86% of whom have two properties or less and many of whom are working their way out of negative equity. This proposal, therefore, would in many cases be unjustified and unaffordable. In reality it would substantially reduce the number of rental homes available just when we need every single rental home we can get. We in Fianna Fáil are working on a solution to reduce the use of the sale-of-property reason to end viable tenancies. We need to be smart in our solutions. We need to introduce radical measures, but they need to be capable of working in the real world where property owners have rights enshrined in law. Earlier my party leader outlined his responsible role in these crisis-ridden times to ensure the stability of Government for the coming year because of Brexit. Earlier the politics-as-usual brigade began its negative spinning about this principled decision that puts our nation before short-term political gain. The people are rightly angered at the Government's tardy response to the housing crisis. Everyone in this Chamber is committed to ensuring that we act as opposed to just commenting on the housing crisis. Having an election and the reality of coalition or minority Government talks would only serve to delay the introduction of solutions to our housing and rental crisis. All the Members of this House were elected in the full knowledge that we have a national housing crisis. I ask them to act accordingly and in the spirit of our times to act collectively in the national interest with practical and radical measures to address our housing crisis. That would be public service worthy of the name. Unfortunately, this Bill, while worthy, is simply not a public service that will work.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	395	On behalf of Sinn Féin, I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to discuss these very important topics. A number of the measures are similar to measures Sinn Féin and others have proposed, but unfortunately have not been passed over the past two and a half years. I disagree with the Minister and Taoiseach, who have described the Bill as too radical. While this is no criticism of the authors of the Bill, in fact it contains nothing radical at all. These are eminently sensible and reasonable proposals in the main, many of which would have a very significant benefit, not just for the individual families they would protect, but also for the stability of our rental market. I listened to the Minister talk about the risks of introducing the Bill. Those same arguments will be used against the Minister's Bill by sections of the landlord representative organisation, which in my view often very poorly represents landlords in arguing why we should not support Government legislation when it is published and we come to debate it early next year.I concur with Deputy Barry's point that vacant possession notices to quit are the single biggest cause of family homelessness at present. The Residential Tenancies Board and Focus Ireland have confirmed that. Most of us do not understand why the Government has not taken some action to stop the flow of families into homelessness as a result of vacant possession notices to quit. The loss of landlords is not necessarily a problem, depending on what happens to the properties involved. The Minister is correct in saying that we have lost 9,000 properties from our rental stock in the last year and a half, the first time this has happened in over two decades. The Government presents its policies as stabilising the rental sector when, in fact, it is in free fall. This has nothing to with protections, either existing or proposed, for tenants but is because of the financial situation of many of the owners of rental properties. Large numbers of people bought second homes, incentivised by the Government at the height of the boom with buy-to-let mortgage tax breaks. Subsequently, they got into significant mortgage distress and now that the property market has turned, they are under enormous pressure from their lenders to voluntarily sell. Nothing in this Bill, if it is passed, will change that. Furthermore, nothing in the Minister's forthcoming Bill, which I hope to be in a position to support early next year, will change it either. We must accept that we have a much bigger problem in our rental market in terms of landlords and properties exiting the rental sector and take some action.  What is lacking in Rebuilding Ireland is a long-term strategy for the stabilisation and professionalisation of our rental market. I am a rental tenant. I choose to live in the rental sector but it is still a very precarious and uncertain place to be in the context of security of tenure, rent levels and so on. While many improvements have been made in recent years with the Residential Tenancies Act and the Residential Tenancies Board, we still have a long way to go. Sinn Féin strongly believes that we need a well regulated, professional private rental sector that meets the needs of tenants and gives people who provide accommodation a reasonable rate of return, with security and affordability at its heart. We must find a way to stop the flow of properties from the rental sector into primary residences, as is currently the case. On the Bill itself, the provision to include receivers and financial institutions in the definition of landlord is eminently sensible. Despite the fact that the Minister cannot support this Bill now, I ask that he includes such a provision in his own legislation. This is something that should be done as a matter of urgency. A reduction of the probation period from six to two months is also eminently sensible. Most landlords will know what a tenant is like after a couple of months and there is no reason not to do this. Regarding tenancies of indefinite duration, Sinn Féin is already on record as having proposed and strongly advocated same. The abolition of sale as grounds for notice to quit has real merit although it would need to be teased out on Committee Stage in terms of its full application. It is certainly a worthwhile proposal.  There is one part of the Bill about which I am less sure. I am not against it and am open to discussing further the section relating to compensation for termination. If we had, for example, new tenancies of indefinite duration and for some reason people were seeking to exit those, a case could be made for compensation. Whether that would work now in the context of some of the current rental scenarios is unclear but I am more than open to being convinced of it on Committee Stage and would certainly not object to the Bill on that basis.  The Bill provides for a significant tightening of the definition of refurbishment which, again, is eminently sensible. I would fully support all of the provisions relating to extensions of the notice to quit period with the exception of the last. I am not saying that I am against the last one which refers to 365 but I would need to be convinced of that particular length. Certainly, it is something that should be discussed.  The key issue is that the Government is not taking enough action to tackle the issue of evictions and vacant possession notices to quit. Until the Minister comes up with better proposals, my party is more than happy to support the Bill put forward by People Before Profit and Solidarity tonight. 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	396	I am glad to speak on this Bill tonight and to support it. The key focus is on notices to quit and the sale of properties. There are numerous instances all over the country of people who have been renting properties for a lengthy period who are receiving notices to quit in the post because the property is being sold, often to a vulture fund. They are given one month's notice but cannot find anywhere else to go. That is happening all over the place and we are all aware of it. We are meeting people every day who are in such situations and this Bill is a clear attempt to deal with the issue in the absence of any Government attempt to address it. I would have some reservations about the provisions around compensation but they can be teased out further. Renovation as a grounds for termination is being used by many landlords as a means of getting rid of tenants who are paying rent at levels that were acceptable four or five years ago. I came across a case recently involving a couple in Dublin who were renting a one bedroom apartment for just over €1,200 per month. They were told that the apartment was being renovated and that they would have to move out. Within a week the apartment was back on the market for €1,650 per month. That is happening all over the country and is having a very negative effect on so many peoples' lives.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, has also been mentioned here. The rates under the HAP scheme are highly problematic. In County Leitrim, for example, a couple with two children or a couple with six children seeking to rent a home will get no more than €500 per month but in Carrick-on-Shannon one will not rent a three or four bedroom house for less than €700 per month. This must be addressed. Many landlords are evicting people because they have the opportunity to get much higher rents from tenants who are not in receipt of HAP payments.  A lot of the housing stock that is being built and provided, particularly in Dublin city, is for high flyers who can afford high rents. Properties are being provided for the people who are working in Google, Facebook and Apple and not for those who need housing at an affordable price. I commend the Bill and recommend it to the House.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	397	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, parts of which are a no-brainer. Many people in this country are receiving notice to quit letters from banks which are moving to sell buy-to-let properties. We need to introduce a law in this country so that this does not continue to happen. In my opinion, many of the banks involved are scum. Yesterday in County Roscommon a group of 20 or 30 men with dogs came from the North, aided and abetted by An Garda Síochána who blocked off two roads. The group of men pegged three people, two of whom were elderly, out of a house and left them on the side of the road. They were aided and abetted by An Garda Síochána, which is disgraceful. Irish people need to wake up, especially if people are coming from the North. We must take them on and stop what is happening. Regarding the mortgage to rent scheme, I have previously highlighted the fact that county councils are refusing applications because the properties involved are "too rural". Housing agencies are writing to local authorities seeking approval for mortgage to rent applications and being refused. The Department needs to tidy this up because it suggests that people in rural Ireland do not deserve to have a house or to qualify for the mortgage to rent scheme. That is the message from councils and the Department to people who are in mortgage distress at the moment. Certainly there are elements of this Bill about which I would have concerns. However, as with all other legislation, the Bill can proceed to Committee Stage and be amended and improved. No Bill is perfect on day one and all legislation must be teased out in committee. Deputies will be concerned with different elements of the Bill but everyone in the House agrees that problems arise when the banks move in on buy-to-let properties. We must make it tough on the banks in particular because they are getting ruthless at this stage. What will happen when the next set of statistics is published? We will see that more and more people are without a home and more properties are vacant. These issues have been aired in this House for two or more years but the Government has done nothing about them.

However, it is a pity that we must hold the debate again because the Bill was defeated last year as a result of Fianna Fáil abstaining and the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle going with the Government. We have a chance to correct that wrong. Those who voted against the Bill or who abstained last year have had 12 months to reflect on the continuing crisis that is homelessness and on the stress caused to those in insecure private tenancies. I hope they will now be prepared to support the Bill. If it had been passed in 2017, many families who find themselves in the position of being homeless would still have a roof over their heads. People and families are struggling to keep a roof over their heads in a housing market that is not fit for purpose. People are being forced into a private rented sector that denies them basic protections. The Bill will give tenants greater protection and greater security of tenure by preventing landlords from evicting tenants on grounds of selling properties. In addition, tenants will be compensated if a landlord moves a family friend or member into the house or flat. Tenants will also be unable to be evicted on the grounds of renovating a building. These are sensible and reasonable protections. The defeat of the Bill last year meant that an opportunity was missed. A year later, and with more people and families becoming homeless or at risk of doing so, I hope the House will not make the same mistake. I urge the Minister and Fianna Fáil to allow the Bill proceed to Committee Stage, at which point, I am sure, any changes they see fit can be considered. It is a reasonable request.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	399	We, too, will support the Bill on Second Stage, although we would change some elements of it. Having published and presented the Residential Tenancies (Greater Security of Tenure and Rent Certainty) Bill, I note that elements of it are similar to the Bill before us. There are slightly different solutions to some of the issues but, in general, the legislation before the House is positive. We included a measure in our Bill regarding receivers and agents. It is long overdue and I agree with the proposals earlier that the Minister introduce that measure in his Bill. It has been proposed for a number of years but it has not happened. Many people in the rental sector must pay rent to agents or receivers. Such individuals need to be protected as much as others who rent. As a result, we support that proposal. I also support the approach to the issue of eviction for sale, which is probably the most important element of the Bill. Other countries seem to have no problem maintaining the security of tenants when properties are sold. This is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed. In some cases, it is good for landlords also when they can pass on a properties in which there are secure tenants in place who have been paying rent. The Minister should consider that aspect also. In the context of evictions on the grounds of renovation, the solution in this regard was to provide that the only circumstances in which a landlord could ask a tenant to vacate a property would be in order to make it fit for human habitation. People should not have to live in properties that are unfit for habitation. On evictions of families, the solution put forward in the Bill is to require compensation be paid. I have some doubts about that. Our proposal was a tightening of the definition of "family" because that definition is currently quite broad. However, these are just differences in approach. There are many Bills - including two that I brought forward - due to go before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. We have debated a number of Bills relating to housing in the Chamber. Judging by the tone of what I have heard from the Government party and Fianna Fáil thus far, I fear that this Bill will have the same fate as many other Opposition Bills, namely, the Government will vote against it and Fianna Fáil will abstain. The Minister is bringing forward his own Bill. In that context, those of us on this side of the House should table amendments in respect of it in order that we might achieve what we have all been trying to achieve. I certainly intend to do so. I welcome elements of the Minister's Bill, although we have seen only the press statement relating to it rather than the Bill itself. He stated that he will publish it this week. I hope he will accept amendments from the Opposition and incorporate many of our proposals. Substantial proposals have been made by the Opposition parties. Every day of the week we all deal with people who are faced with eviction and rents they cannot pay or who have no security in the private rented sector. In bringing forward his Bill, the Minister should take the opportunity to listen to what we have to say and incorporate it. Although I welcome the Minister's comment to the effect that he will provide a definition of "substantial change" and the nature of accommodation provided under the tenancy, and that he will publish a rent register, he also stated that the register is the subject of due diligence in the Office of the Attorney General. I worry, therefore, that it might not be the kind of rent register we need, namely, publishing rents as they are in order that a new tenant will know exactly what the rent was in a specific property, which I hope is what happens. I am also cautious about the student accommodation measure. The Minister stated that he may possibly extend the application of certain provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act following consultation with, again, the Office of the Attorney General and so on. I wait in hope that both of those measures will materialise. We have heard much talk about regulating short-term lets, an issue which my colleague, Senator Kevin Humphreys, has raised on multiple occasions. We have not seen the specific proposals, however, and they are not ready to be implemented. Other issues include deposit protection, for which there is an enabling measure already in legislation to provide for a deposit protection scheme, but that has not been progressed by the Minister. Another matter we have raised relates to some landlords requesting deposits of more than one month's rent. That should be addressed in the Minister's Bill along with many other matters. I hope he will take the opportunity to do so. I know the Minister intends to tighten up the rent pressure zone regulations to prevent evasion, which is not the intention of the Bill before us. I speak as a representative for the city of Limerick, which is excluded from those regulations. I have raised this point on many previous occasions and I raise it again now. There has been an increase of more than 20% in rents in Limerick city in the past year, while Waterford city has seen an increase of nearly 20%. However, those two cities are excluded from rent pressure zones. There are other areas in neighbouring counties around Dublin that are in a similar situation. It has been two years since that legislation was passed after much late-night debate and consultation. It is deeply unfair that the Government is constantly chasing the tight regulation for being included in the rent pressure zones, such as by including above-average rents in the particular local electoral area, or whatever the term is for the areas in question. In some instances, both urban and rural areas are included, leading to an unfair situation for people in the city areas who pay high rents. This matter needs to be reviewed because it is grossly unfair for the people who are excluded and who constantly chase increases in rent that they cannot afford. It is a crucial issue. I also attended the launch of Threshold's annual report. Threshold has pleaded for many of these issues to be addressed and, being at the coalface, it knows exactly the kind of issues that are faced by tenants in the private rented sector, as do we from our work as public representatives.We need meaningful responses that will deal with the issues people are facing. The most realistic opportunity to address these issues is in the Bill that the Minister will bring forward because he has the power to drive it forward whereas, unfortunately, Opposition Bills tend to sit and not to be enacted. That said, we welcome this Bill and will support it. 
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	400	I have listened to the debate and do not accept many of the arguments put forward by the two Government parties. I welcome the Bill from Solidarity_PBP and agree with enhancing the rights of tenants. Currently, if a tenant is in situ in a property for six months or longer, they automatically receive security of tenure for six years in what is known as a Part 4 tenancy. This Bill seeks to automatically create a Part 4 tenancy after a tenant has been in the property for two months or more, the idea being that this will ensure more renters receive security of tenure more quickly. The problem with this, however, is that there is no minimum limit set in law for how long a lease or tenancy agreement can last and there has been an increase in landlords creating leases of five months and 29 days to ensure that tenants do not automatically receive Part 4 rights. The two best friends of Chris, the guy in my office, have been caught by that lately. They could only get leases of five months and 29 days. I am concerned that allowing a tenant to receive Part 4 rights after two months might lead to even shorter leases. That would need to be blocked or landlords would draw up leases for one month and 29 days, which would not be illegal at the moment but should be made so. One would not need to be a rocket scientist to know that it is a landlord's market at the moment and they will get their way unless we legislate for it. An overhaul of tenancy agreements and leases is not needed. A better way to resolve this problem would be to follow the German model, which ensures that a lease is always for an indefinite period and if landlords want to deviate from this and create a fixed period lease, they must fulfil one of the following three conditions for the tenancy: the landlord wishes to use the premises as a dwelling for himself, members of his family or his household; the landlord wishes to eliminate the premises or change or repair them so substantially that the measures would be significantly more difficult as a result of a continuation of the lease; or the landlord wishes to rent the premises to a person obliged to perform services, for an example, an employee of the landlord. The proof of indefinite leases is in the pudding as evidenced by the most recent German census in 2011, which showed that of the 41.3 million dwellings in Germany, 52% are used for rental purposes. The EU average is 29% and the Irish figure is 19%. I heard the Minister complaining earlier about the fact that we are losing landlords. If we are losing them, we know why. I was glad to hear Deputy Ó Broin make the point that many people had no choice but to sell because they bought when property was too dear and had to sell. If the Government wanted to keep them as landlords, it could have helped them in some way keep their houses. The main reason the number of landlords has gone down is that the Government brought in the real estate investment trusts, REITS, which is nuts, allowing people to buy so many of these properties en bloc. I agree with increasing the extension of notice periods and with removing the sale or renovation of property as a ground for terminating a Part 4 tenancy. A new problem that has emerged in the past two years and that has contributed to rent increases is the fact that large-scale apartment blocks are being sold in bulk by developers or NAMA to institutional landlords such as REITs. It was presented to us a great idea because it was going to bring in professional landlords but it is a pity people cannot afford to pay them.

On 18 January last year, a similar Bill was almost passed by the House, when sadly and unfortunately, the Fianna Fáil Party abstained from the vote which was tied 51:51. I warmly commend Solidarity-PBP for updating and reintroducing this vitally important Bill. I note that student-specific accommodation is mentioned along with several other changes. This Bill will provide much greater security of tenure. It will significantly extend notice periods and force landlords to pay compensation to tenants who have been evicted because family members have moved back into the accommodation and other improvements. The out of control property and rental sector has been the major contributory factor in our homelessness crisis, along with the total inaction of Government. It is laughable to hear people talking about introducing Bills when they were in government for many long years and had opportunity after opportunity to bring in this type of Bill and failed to do so.  All the important agencies in the housing area working on the ground with individuals and families confirm that a stream of people, week in week out, are entering homelessness because of eviction notices, increased and unaffordable rents, and excuses about selling or refurbishing property just for it to be re-advertised at a higher rent leading to renovictions. That is the nub of the situation in my experience every week meeting families and individuals in homelessness or facing homelessness.  I welcome many sections of the Bill, particularly section 5, which provides for the abolition of the sale of property as grounds for terminating rental of a property by amending sections 34 and 35 of the 2004 Act. Section 6 is also important regarding the termination of a tenancy on the grounds of needing the dwelling for occupation by the landlord or a member of the family and section 7 abolishes refurbishment or renovation as grounds for terminating a tenancy. The extension of the notice periods to a year for people with a tenancy of five years or more is crucial and valuable and should be approved by the House We are a few days from Christmas and almost 4,000 of our children are still in desperate, homeless accommodation, in family hubs or hotels or they are the hidden homeless in grossly overcrowded households. The Minister of State, Deputy English and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Taoiseach are totally responsible for that. I note that the excellent Mick Caul and the #mynameis campaign will bring their hashtag-Twitter tree to the Dáil on 19 December. We will be able to read the tweets regarding what the public thinks of child homelessness this Christmas. They are infuriated by it. That is why they would have liked a general election in the next couple of weeks. Today Fianna Fáil has decided again to prop up this Government which has been so incompetent in the housing and health areas, and which has failed to achieve anything. Under the curtain of Brexit fears, Fianna Fáil is prepared to prop up the Government-----

Many Private Member's Bills have been brought in and this is an effort to try to deal with the savage fact that there are more than 10,000 people homeless, including 4,000 children, which is shocking. While I might not agree with aspects of the Bill because I do not believe that all landlords are bad, I acknowledge it is an effort to get the Government to move some way. There has been a lot of piecemeal work and there have been almost more Ministers in the past five or six years than houses built. Deputy Kelly promised the world and all when he was the Minister. Ed Honohan brought forward a Bill and, while I do not want to take away from this Bill, he has the expertise as a Master of the High Court. This Bill was sponsored by Deputy McGuinness, Senator Norris and me. It had the backing of Fr. Peter McVerry and the Right2Homes organisation.It was brought forward because the time for piecemeal and clearly ineffective solutions to the mortgage crisis had passed. As stated, the original Bill was sponsored by Deputy McGuinness, Senator Norris and myself. It has been significantly revamped in line with the Standing Orders of the Dáil. The problem is that it was a money Bill, but, in fairness, we looked at it again with Fr. McVerry and many others and tried to organise something. I hope the version of the Bill before the House will pass Second Stage. We have tabled endless Private Members' Bills and motions. One of our motions on An Post was passed unanimously by the Dáil. The wording was agreed by the Minister and accepted but nothing was done about it, while post offices continue to close. The same is happening in the context of housing. We are wasting a lot of time in here. If words could build houses, we would build many of them and fewer people would be homeless. Will the Minister of State try to engage with the Opposition? The various groups have ideas and come at matters from different angles. They want to help resolve the housing crisis. Deputy Healy also introduced a Bill recently. We are all trying to do our best but there is a savage inertia in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. County and city councils have completely lost their way in terms of building houses. They built them in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and the noughties but then everything crashed and we cannot get the process restarted. We have announcements of modular schemes and other approaches but nothing is happening. The Minister of State, Deputy English, keeps making announcements and then regurgitates them a year or two later. We turned a sod recently at Glenconnor in Clonmel. That was the second time a sod was turned in two and a half years. I do not think the work there has commenced yet. The project is welcome, although it only involves a small number of houses, perhaps up to 16. We must get small builders and others involved in construction. We must deal with evictions, which are horrific. There is no place for them in modern Ireland. There was one yesterday in Roscommon where, again, thugs from outside the jurisdiction arrived on behalf of a bank. They terrorised an old woman and threw her out on the road. That is disgraceful. I call them a third force militia. They have no place on this island. We must have protections for people. That is why I support the Bill. I fundamentally disagree with some of what has been said about landlords. We cannot demonise all landlords and state that they are bad. However, we must deal with the situation whereby people are being forced out of their homes. Let us look what has happened with Permanent TSB. A very sick man who is a soldier and whose wife is on sick leave due to stress discovered this week that their loan has been sold on. They were in an arrangement at the request of the bank and were honouring it. I heard some murmurings today that such arrangements will be honoured by the vulture funds. That will not be the case because there is no compulsion on such funds to honour them. We tried to get legislation passed to compel vulture funds to honour agreements but the Government did not accept it. When Deputy Noonan was Minister for Finance, he stated that he would bring in the vulture funds to pick over the dead carcasses. What an awful thing to say. I had respect for the then Minister but that is unbelievable. The Government is allowing vulture funds to evict people and to terrorise them. That is traumatic, even in the absence of violence. Sheriffs are another group who must be reined in. The laws setting out the powers and functions of the sheriffs are outdated. They have been in place since the previous century. A lot of money goes to service agents and costs are added to those of already hard-pressed homeowners. People want a break. Many of the people who are in trouble tried to find homes for themselves. They did not look for homes from the State. They got loans, found sites and built houses. Now the roof over their heads is being threatened in the run-up to Christmas. While there are celebrations everywhere, people are being threatened with evictions. The thuggery that went on in Roscommon yesterday is going on in every county. It shows vulture funds and banks can do what they like and the Garda often stand idly by. I do not blame local gardaí; I blame the authorities that allow those third force people to operate. They were allowed to park in Balbriggan station one day while they threw a family out on the road. It is totally unheard of. There is no place for that in a modern democracy. I appeal to the Minister of State to cut out all the talks, meetings, engagements and announcements. He should introduce some real legislative change and adopt Ed Honohan's Bill. However, he will not do that because he does not want to do it. He should try to engage with the Bill introduced by Solidarity-People Before Profit, but he will not do that because he does not want to do it. The Government has all the answers, yet it has no answer as we have 10,000 people on a housing list, including 4,000 children. The Government should be ashamed. I agree with what Deputy Broughan stated about my erstwhile colleagues. We had a big announcement today when we were talking about Brexit. I understand that Brexit is very important but I do not approve of Fianna Fáil keeping the Government in power-----

The people want rid of Fianna Fáil because it has failed them. What will happen is that they will get rid of Fianna Fáil altogether because they are so disgusted. Fianna Fáil is a fake Opposition. Fianna Fáil was united last week when it came to abortion. Fianna Fáil can be as united as it likes. It can unite on this issue but it cannot unite and build houses for people or listen to the people who want to build houses. The way people are being treated is downright blackguarding and treachery. To think we will have to put up with Fianna Fáil for another year is an abomination to the public, to me and to many others. I agree that Brexit is most serious but it beats Banagher to give the Government another year. Confidence and supply is based on having a fake Opposition. It is totally farcical. Fianna Fáil is not delivering the goods for anybody, whether it is in housing, health, in providing decent jobs for people or supporting communities. Ní neart go chur le chéile. I do not know what is going on or what has got into the main Opposition party, as it was supposed to be, to spend so long talking about it – five or six months – and to announce today that it would keep the members of the Government in their State cars for another year, and then it will see. I heard Deputy Micheál Martin state that the agreement will continue unless something interrupts it. The Government could drop the ball. Fianna Fáil could drop the ball at any time because it is afraid of the ball. They are afraid of the people and they will not face them. My parting word to the Minister of State is to get some houses built, keep people in their homes, change the legislation on evictions and give people some bit of respect.

I commend Solidarity-People Before Profit on bringing it forward and confirm my support for it. This is one of a number of Bills and numerous Private Members' motions that have been before the House in recent years. Hardly a week has gone by in the past two and a half years without some housing issue being on the agenda. The Government is completely out of touch with the situation on the ground. It is supported by Fianna Fáil, which is also completely out of touch. Both the Government and Fianna Fáil are effectively supporting an emergency housing crisis. We all know that is the case. The Government policy and that of Fianna Fáil has been a disastrous failure. The policy has been to privatise local authority housing in the first instance. That started back in the early 2000s with Fianna Fáil. I remember well when it was announced at a housing meeting when I was a member of South Tipperary County Council. Since then, many of us said that it would be a disaster, that it would not work and that the private sector would never deliver the houses that were needed. Sadly, we have the proof of the pudding now that more than 10,000 people, including 4,000 children, are homeless. The situation is disastrous for thousands of families. Fr. McVerry has said this crisis is affecting 500,000 people. This Government and previous Administrations have produced a housing policy that is, in effect, relying on the private sector. It is relying on vulture funds, developers and landlords. That policy has failed and it has created the current emergency. The Government should listen to independent academics and to organisations involved in the housing area. Each and every one of them has said that the private rented sector is a complete and absolute disaster and that it is driving homelessness. We know that more than 50% of families who become homeless do so directly from the private rented sector. Only recently, Professor Tony Fahey from the school of social policy at UCD said exactly that.In fact, he said that, 100 years after the Land League, when fair rent and fixity of tenure was the big issue, this issue is now back on the agenda today in the private rental sector for thousands of families who are forced to rent privately and either pay landlords directly or through the HAP scheme. Professor Fahey said 30% of families are going to suffer a lifetime of substantial rents as tenants. Professor Eoin O'Sullivan said more than 50% of families becoming homeless come from the private rented sector. He also said that unless the right to terminate tenancies, that is, the right to evict people, is stopped, the flow into homelessness will continue. Niamh Randall of Simon said there can be no effective rent control while evictions from private rented dwellings continue. I welcome this Bill. I raised many of these issues on another Bill some weeks ago. There is no doubt this Bill is essential if anything is to be done. It will not solve the housing problem, and its movers do not suggest it will. What it will do is stop the situation getting worse. The situation is getting worse, irrespective of what the Minister of State will tell us. We know exactly what he will tell us because he told us the same thing a fortnight ago, a fortnight before that and a month before that, and for the past two and a half years, namely, Government policy is working. However, Government policy is not working. Anybody who has any bit of common sense or any bit of grey matter between their ears, or anybody who is affected by the housing crisis, knows the policy is not working and that it has to change. The issues raised in this Bill regarding evictions and the sale of properties with vacant possession are essential matters to deal with if the situation is not to worsen. This Bill will only deal with those areas and it will mean the situation will not get worse. We need a major emergency programme of building of public housing on public land by local authorities if the housing crisis is to be tackled successfully. However, the Government has turned its face against this. It continues to rely on landlords, vulture funds and developers, rather than looking towards the local authorities and the building of large numbers of public houses on public land. I support the Bill and I commend those who moved it.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	410	I want to start by paying tribute to the hundreds of volunteers who will spend tonight and many nights between now and Christmas in the towns and cities across this country helping homeless people, those in poverty and those living in temporary accommodation by giving them food, toys and clothes and by entertaining them. They do so because there is a void in the services being provided by the State. There is a void because the State has allowed thousands of people to live in homelessness but it has also created a void for people who are in a poverty trap and who are desperate. Let us take our hats off to those volunteers who do this work for nothing. It indicates that we have a population that cares much more about each other than the Government cares about them. I spoke on this issue last year when this Bill was before the House in a different guise. At that time I quoted the story of Selina Hogan from Ballyfermot who was about to be evicted from private accommodation with her two children, one with special needs and a teenage daughter who was suffering from depression because of what they were facing. I was guaranteed that she would be looked after, that she would probably spend a little time in temporary accommodation and then go into a family hub for about six months, and that she would then be able to access HAP. More than a year later, having spent almost a year in a family hub and in hotel accommodation before that, Selina is still in the Ballyfermot family hub with no sign of her getting a home, her children are no better and her mental health is no better. This evening, I spoke to Darren Cuffe from lower Ballyfermot, a 44-year old man who is a diabetic on dialysis and who is going blind. The landlord has given him notice to quit. He took a case to the RTB and the landlord gave him further notice to quit, and that notice has now run out. I told Darren what Eileen Gleeson, the head of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, told me to tell people, namely, to overstay because there was nowhere for them to go. Darren would not survive ten minutes in a hostel, and that is all he would be given because he is a single man. There is also the case of Amina, her brother and her mother. The mother is in her 70s and her daughter and son are in their 40s, and they are to lose their home before Christmas. I am telling them the same thing: overstay because they have nowhere to go, their mother is not well and she will not survive in a hostel or a hotel room. That is the situation we are faced with on a daily basis. Nothing has changed in the past year, except it has gotten worse. The Minister's predecessor argued against the Bill at the time, when he said: "the issues involved are being addressed comprehensively through the Rental Strategy ... and the associated legislative changes introduced under the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 ... which is already delivering positive outcomes for tenants.” He went on to claim the Anti-Evictions Bill 2016: “pre-empts any assessment of the positive impacts on tenants’ security that will arise from the implementation of the Strategy’s Rent Predictability measure in those areas already designated as Rent Pressures Zones”. His colleagues in Fianna Fáil at the time raised the catch-all spectre that always bothers the rhetoric of great parliamentarians in this House - that of unintended consequences. What has happened since? What have been the intended consequences of the Government’s opposition to this Bill and the intended consequences of its housing policy? We know from Threshold's reports that it has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of calls received from tenants in danger of losing their homes because their landlords claimed they were about to sell the property. Some 32% of calls to Threshold in 2017 were from renters who were about to lose their homes, which is up 18% from 2016. Threshold received 73,500 calls from the public last year. There is an increased vulnerability in this sector. The private rented sector is the leading source of homelessness in this country through evictions, both legal and illegal. I heard the contribution from Deputy Fitzmaurice and one could only think of the recent film "Black '47" when he talked about the eviction he witnessed in Longford. The consequences of the Minister's opposition to this Bill last year have been to increase evictions and to exacerbate the crisis and the misery facing many people. In the meantime, he continues to rely on the private market to deliver the housing. He has failed, as his predecessors, the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Coveney, and Deputy Alan Kelly did. They failed because of their subservience to the market and to profits, and their hostility to building public houses on public land. The Government has enriched a cohort of REITs, private landlords, vulture funds, estate agents, speculators, developers and builders, and it continues to do so. It has failed to limit rent increases. Average rents across the Republic reached another peak of €1,304 a month, €560 higher than they were at the trough in 2011, and more than 26% higher than their high point during the Celtic tiger. According to the quarterly rental reports from the property websites, prices across the State are €274 per month higher than they were in the 2008 peak. The capital has seen the highest average rent rises in the country at €1,936.That is 13.4% higher than the rate in June. So much for the Government's rent pressure zones and controlling rents. This is not a mistake or an unforeseen consequence of Government policy. It is a planned result of the Government's incompetence and its class instincts. It is the instinct to weigh in with the landlord class, the very wealthy, investors, builders and developers rather than with ordinary people, as the volunteers working across the country tonight are doing. There is a war against the poor and the average working man and woman. The Minister of State has directed his energies only towards the creation of new methods of counting the homeless which he can use to pretend his policy is working. He is the great pretender. He pretends that housing output is greater than it is and that social housing builds are greater than they are. The Minister of State is pretending that homelessness and rough sleeping rates are falling and that rents are stabilising. His policies are working in one sense. They work for landlords, investors, hedge funds, REITs and, in the Minister of State's world of pretend, the Government. Incentives and funds have been thrown at builders and developers. The Government has moved heaven and earth to attract vulture funds and investment REITs. However, it has not done the one thing that might help to end the misery for thousands of people. It has failed to change the law to redress the imbalance of power between landlord and tenant. It has not tried to ensure citizens and tenants have security of tenure and fair rents and it has not even considered doing what the country managed to do when it was vastly poorer and had far fewer resources, namely, build public houses on public lands at the scale required. The Government does not appear to be capable of doing the same and it certainly does not appear to have the political will to try. My penultimate word is directed to those landlords who occupy seats in the House, of whom there are at least 40 but probably more if one counts Independents. I do not begrudge them having an extra earner on the side, but I do begrudge the conflict of interest where landlords vote on a Bill like this. This is a Bill which proposes to prohibit landlords from evicting tenants for the purposes of the sale or renovation of the property. Darren Cuffe was told his property needed to be renovated and Amina was told her property was to be sold. There is a conflict of interest for any Member who votes on this Bill and who is also a landlord. I call on Members to use their consciences and do the decent thing. Even if it minimises the voting power in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to a large degree, it is the decent thing to do. If it is not done, Members are being utterly indecent in their approach to the Bill. My final word is directed to Fianna Fáil. The last time around, it abstained from voting on the Bill. However, I am hearing more utterances of opposition tonight for some reason than I did on the previous occasion. Fianna Fáil Deputies must also do the decent thing and abstain this time around. If they do, we may have a chance to prick the conscience of the Ceann Comhairle who, unfortunately and almost tragically for many families, used his casting vote to throw out this Bill.

There is €6 billion on the table to fund it and more as well. Under Rebuilding Ireland 2040, money has been set aside to deliver up to 12,000 social houses every year to 2027 and 2028. What happens after that will be for another Government to decide but this one has put in place a process to deliver over 10,000 social houses next year and 12,000 every year thereafter. The money is behind it. As such, I ask Members not to come to the House week after week to state that there is no commitment. It is not true.

That is fine. We can all agree with that, but I ask them not to continue to say it is not happening. We have to be very clear about that. The accusation is also made that the Government is relying solely on the private sector but that is not true either. What is true is that in the early stages of Rebuilding Ireland, the Government was the first to accept we had to work with the private sector because we wanted houses last year, this year and next year. While we build our new houses, we are working with the private sector and will buy houses from it under turn-key and build-to-order and we will rent houses through HAP because people need homes now. If we had the philosophy of the Members opposite, people in need of houses today would not be allowed to have a housing assistance payment and would be left sitting on the side of the road waiting for them to build all of the houses. No matter who builds them, it is not possible to build 50,000 or 60,000 in one week or one year. It takes a couple of years to do it. If we did not work with the private sector, people would not have homes.

Nobody - not the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Department or me - wants that. No one wants to see people living in emergency accommodation, whether it is a hotel, bed and breakfast or family hub. Those are not places to be. However, if we failed to engage with the private sector in some form, there would be thousands more in emergency accommodation, which none of us wants. We are committed to social housing and have a greater vision in that regard than any other party here. Most people call for just 10,000 houses but we are going beyond that to 12,000 social houses a year, and rightly so given that we are behind where it should be.

We are committed to correcting that and I hope future Governments continue the work we started in the building of social houses. I agree with everyone that we should have a proper supply of social housing and do not but that is being addressed. We will address the matter as quickly as we can and do more as we go along. Deputy Bríd Smith mentioned a family who were in a hub for a year but she did not say whether they were offered a housing solution. I gather from her that they were not offered a permanent social housing solution but I do not know if they were offered a HAP house.

I have asked whether the family was offered a housing solution and I get the impression they might have been, albeit not the permanent housing solution but perhaps a HAP solution. I have been to a lot of family hubs and I note that a lot of people move through them quite quickly and rightly so. It is not the intention that people will spend a year or two in a family hub. The hope is that they will be in and out in under six months, as happens in the majority, although not all, cases. We are trying to address that. The Deputy mentioned a family's case and we will check it out to see where matters stand.Again I want to get back to this Bill. The residential sector is an essential component of the housing sector. Its vital role needs to be recognised and planned for. The sector has gone through considerable change in the past ten to 15 years. It has doubled in size and provides long-term homes for many more than it used to. Growth in the sector has been driven by a range of factors including a reducing reliance on home ownership as a tenure of choice in some cases. People's employment has changed. Very often they are on different types of contracts which bring them around the country and into different jobs so they are no longer tied to a base for their whole life. Other factors include demographic factors, including inward migration from the EU, decreasing household size, and increasing rates of new household information. Some people are also unable to buy their own houses because of the issues of supply and affordability or because of their chances of raising finance. There is a range of reasons for the growth in the rental sector. The rental sector in Ireland still needs to develop and mature in order to provide a viable, sustainable, and attractive alternative to home ownership rather than serving as a temporary refuge or staging post on the route to home ownership. Someone backed up the Bill's proposals by saying they happen in other European countries, but some of the European countries used as examples have very mature rental sectors which we envy and would like to have ourselves. We are on a journey to that. We have a rental strategy and we had a rental plan, which was set aside, and it is to be hoped we will get to have a rental sector such as those common in other European countries through these. People will be able to have that choice and rents will be in a proper price range, but that is a journey we are on. Again it cannot happen overnight. It is down to supply.  We want to have a professional rental sector because we do not have one in this country. Some 86% of our landlords are not professional landlords. They are people who have a second home. Some are reluctant, some are not-----

That is something we want to change. We will change it over time if we can. From what I have heard in this evening's contributions, it is safe to say there is a clear need to ensure the residential sector is both an attractive option for tenants and a secure and viable investment choice for investors. The State cannot be the only landlord. There has to be other landlords as well. Ireland has to be a place in which it is viable to invest. I am not talking about people making exorbitant profits, but about investment being viable and it being possible to make a business case for it. Without a doubt tenants have to feel comfortable and safe in that environment. They have to feel they have security of tenure, quality service and a quality home. That is what we want to achieve through our rental sector plans. Tenants need security of tenure. As long as they have paid their rent and met their obligations they need to be as sure as possible that they will be able to stay in their homes. The flip side of this is that landlords have constitutionally protected property rights that can be delimited only in a proportionate manner to achieve a legally justifiable social common good. In recent years we have improved security of tenure for tenants while maintaining the property rights of landlords as much as possible. I spoke before about trying to get that balance. We are trying to balance the rights of tenants with the property rights of landlords in all legislation. It is not easy to achieve. We would say the Deputies' Bill is a little extreme and goes too far but we do want to achieve the same things, though perhaps in different ways. The Minister, Deputy Murphy, is bringing forward the Bill which was published this week and another in the new year which we think will help to achieve this balance and give tenants more security and durability of tenure. Turning to the specifics of the Deputies' Bill tonight, it is clear to me that there can be no consideration of the issues relating to security of tenure without an acknowledgement of the problems that can be caused by the appointment of receivers to rented dwellings. However, the interplay between receivership law and the Residential Tenancies Act is complex. It is imperative that we do not make any amendments which either make matters worse or lead to legal uncertainty. Nevertheless, there is no question that action needs to be taken in this area, but any action taken must be well informed, considered and legally sound. The Minister, Deputy Murphy, has again flagged that this is something he will address and bring more clarity to in the Bill coming forward in the new year. Under section 5 of the strategy for the rental sector, my Department established a working group with representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality, Finance, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation to examine the scope for amending legislation to provide for greater protection of tenants' rights during the receivership process. The objective was to protect the rights of tenants during the receivership process by ensuring that persons appointed as receivers would be required to fulfil the key obligations of a landlord. To inform its work, the working group sought legal opinion on the feasibility of amending legislation to provide greater protection of tenants' rights during the receivership process. We will deal with that in the Bill ahead. The application of any landlord obligations onto a receiver is legally complex and needs to be carefully considered. Arising from consideration of the working group's report by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, legislative change will likely form part of the considerations in framing further amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act in 2019.  The Government recognises that rent increases in certain student-specific accommodation are also giving rise to significant concern and that it is important that the Government actively addresses barriers to educations and any limit to the choice of educational course pursued. I am conscious that my time is up but I was interrupted slightly so I might take a few more seconds to finish this point. My Department is working with the Department of Education and Skills and with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to examine the wide range of student accommodation types and auxiliary services available with a view to considering the issue of pricing including, if appropriate, new regulatory or legislative proposals. There is a commitment to do that in the Bill coming forward. The Department is engaged with the Office of the Attorney General to scope out, with the benefit of information provided by the Department of Education and Skills and the purpose-built student accommodation sector, the legal feasibility of introducing some related amendments in the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill 2018 as it passes through the legislative process in the House. That probably will be also dealt with on Committee Stage of the next Bill. There is more I want to say but I will say it at a later stage.

It was very revealing how, in the debate and at Leader's Questions earlier, the conflict of interest facing landlords in the Dáil exercised the establishment parties so much. Why is that? It is because it exposes not only the naked personal interest, but the class interest, which lies behind the Government's policies on the housing crisis, which are supported by Fianna Fáil. The answers of those who say it is ridiculous that we would call on landlord Deputies not to vote on this Bill are extremely revealing. They say it is the same as us voting on taxation as we are taxpayers. The defence behind which they hide is section 5(ii) of the code of conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann other than office holders. It states, "A conflict of interest does not exist where the Member or other person benefits only as a member of the general public or a broad class of persons." Therefore, the defence of those who say there is no conflict of interest which would exclude them from voting is that they are part of a broad class of persons, that is the landlord class. We agree. They are part of the landlord class. They represent the landlord class. Even those among the establishment parties who do not own properties represent the landlord class through the policies they pursue and the neoliberal ideology they defend. It was exposed extremely well in the statement by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, earlier when he spoke about not interfering too much. He did not say exactly in what we were not meant to interfere too much but it was clear he was talking about not interfering with the capitalist market, the free market which allows wealth to flood upwards to the landlords, the bosses and the bankers rather than trickling down to ordinary people, as it is supposedly meant to. This free market has allowed rents in the property market to increase by 30% since this Government came to power and has allowed the amount of wealth going to landlords in this country annually to double in the past six or seven years.  This was added to a new idea, which I believe is also something to do with the free market. This is the idea that we are a young rental market and that we would like to be a mature rental market in which we can have all of these kinds of decent tenancy protections and rights but that we are on a journey to that mature rental sector, which will take a while, and that we cannot pre-empt it with any legislation which would give tenants significant rights. The Minister of State should tell the children living in 539 North Circular Road about the journey to a mature rental sector. He has a choice tomorrow to defend those children and to defend others facing eviction or to allow the market, the landlords and big corporate landlords in particular to continue to ride roughshod over their rights. I have a termination notice here which sums up just how bad the crisis has got. It is a termination notice for 21 December, four days before Christmas, addressed to some people who are currently in transitional housing from homelessness in Tallaght Cross. Their 18 months of transitional housing is up and they are not able to find alternative accommodation. They have therefore formally been given notice to quit. It is a sign of how horrific the crisis is when homeless people are being evicted or threatened with eviction back into homelessness. The Minister has said that the notice will not be carried out and that they will not be evicted, but they are awaiting written confirmation from Túath and from the Government that this is the case and that they will not be evicted. They are organised and are prepared to resist any attempt at eviction. I met a number of them on Monday. That is exactly what we need. We have to face the reality. There is no convincing the Government. One quarter of its members are landlords and they all represent the landlord class. They are not going to pass legislation which significantly interferes with landlords' right to profit. The only conclusion, therefore, is that we need a movement.The Minister of State can see what is happening with the yellow vest protest in France, a revolt from below of the oppressed against the president of the rich, Macron, forcing him back and forcing concessions, some of them which have been given but which are inadequate and which are rightly seen by people as being crumbs. The movement continues and has the potential to force him out of office. We need a movement like the yellow vests here on the issue of housing, with young people and students to the fore. We have raised the idea of a national students' strike, occupations of campuses, and raising the struggle nationally on a higher plain. There is also the question of regional and national demonstrations in the new year and, crucially, the role of the trade unions and ICTU in putting their full weight behind those demonstrations, not only in mobilising people but in building for industrial action, perhaps starting with the idea of lunchtime action or half-day action and moving to a one-day general strike on the issue of housing to show the Government the power of working class people who want action on the housing crisis.

There has been a 75% increase in the number of landlords in this country since 2008 and a 1.5% decrease in their number in recent years mainly because of obsolescence and the fact that nothing is being built. As for the idea that we are short of landlords, where would these landlords go? Would they leave the country carrying the houses on their backs? No, they would either leave them vacant and thereby not get any income from them or they would sell them in which case the house would be an addition to the market in dealing with the shortage of supply. I do not understand that argument. The other argument is that this is unconstitutional. The Government would not let us insert the right to housing in the Constitution when we introduced a Bill only a short time ago. It would not accept any threat to private property rights. The case of the Tyrrelstown tenants was said to be unconstitutional but suddenly it was constitutional and the Government came around to the introduction of RPZs. The point is that enough pressure needs to put on the Government to bring in the type of legislation that is necessary. This proposal has been put forward by Focus Ireland, which is hardly a revolutionary socialist organisation, and many others. This is the brutal logic of capitalism now. Landlords must retain their divine right to evict families over any other consideration, despite a housing emergency. Profit is the only law that matters. This is ideological on the Minister of State's part. We have the public land. Mel Reynolds told us that NAMA and the councils have enough land to build 114,000 public houses. We certainly have the resources and the money. I can give countless examples to support that. The richest 18 people in this country have €60 billion net worth. We could build 400,000 houses with that alone. We know the Government found €1 billion in the corporate tax take that it did not know it was going to get. There is a great deal of money for this.  The Minister has talked about undersupply. He is bringing in two big investment companies to Cherrywood to build 3,000 housing units for rent. They will be unaffordable for families and tenants who need them. The State will end up putting people in them and paying HAP, RAS, and a rake of other corporate welfare payments. Why would the State not build those? That is what the State used to do.

The idea that that is a programme is a joke. What is at the root of this? Public lands should be 100% public housing to rent or to buy. If the construction industry was taken under State control and we set up a State building agency, we could build affordable housing. Deputy Barry wrote a pamphlet on housing and capitalism. For example, the CSI survey in 2015 indicates the following increases, namely, in the price of land, 17%; developer profit, 11%; bank profit, 6%, and tax, 16%. Some 50% of the cost involved could be cut out immediately if the State was building on its own lands. A €330,000 house could be €165,000. That is the reality if we knocked out the profit interests. We could build thousands of houses each year for the next five years on public lands and end this crisis for once and for all. We could also acquire vacant properties and renovate them if needed, take over buy-to-let properties from reluctant landlords and take them out of their misery. The State could take those over. We could build student accommodation, Traveller-specific accommodation and elderly independent living-type accommodation. We need a housing movement, as has been said, to force the Government on a path that it does not want to go, which is down the public housing route. As we did in the case of water charges and the repeal of the eighth amendment, we need students' unions, trade unions and organisations of working class people and middle income people who are now being affected by this to become involved in, for example, a national stoppage protest to force the Government to build public homes on public land because that is the only solution to this housing emergency. Clearly, the Government is not interested in taking any measures right now. It would seem Fianna Fáil is not interested either in this issue..

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	462	I thank the House for the opportunity to introduce the Bill, the main purpose of which is to implement EU Regulation 598/2014, which came into effect in June 2016. This regulation sets out the rules and procedures for managing and monitoring the impact of aircraft at all major European Union airports. The approach set out in the regulation is in line with the so-called "balanced approach" to aircraft noise mitigation, which has been developed by the United Nation's International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO. This Bill follows the regulation in its entirety and, therefore, represents best international practice in aircraft noise management at airports, as endorsed by the UN and the EU. It may seem unusual that I am implementing this regulation through primary legislation, even though an EU regulation has direct effect in member states. Typically, I would implement such a regulation by way of secondary legislation, through a statutory instrument. However, the circumstances surrounding this regulation are atypical. There has been extensive policy and legal examination of how best to put in place a noise regulation regime which, on the one hand, fully accords with EU Regulation 598/2014 and, on the other hand, is wholly aligned with our existing planning and development and environmental frameworks. The outcome of these deliberations was the conclusion that the only certain way to achieve this was by primary legislation. I have taken much criticism for delaying or not moving fast enough on this issue. While I understand and share the frustration underlying some of this criticism, some of it also betrays an under-appreciation of the complexity of the issues that had to be worked through. I am glad to be before this House to present this Bill, and I am glad that the Oireachtas will have the opportunity to examine, discuss, come to understand and, ultimately, I am sure, support it as the best available option which serves the national interest. I propose to bring the House through the key elements of the Bill and explain the policy rationale underpinning it. As a first step, EU Regulation 598/2014 requires all member states with a major airport to designate a competent authority as the independent noise regulator. The competent authority is responsible under the regulation for monitoring the noise situation at a designated airport. The competent authority also decides on the appropriate noise mitigation measures that must be put in place by airport operators, up to and including operating restrictions to mitigate an identified noise problem. Under the Bill, Fingal County Council is designated as the independent noise regulator for the purposes of EU Regulation No. 598/2014. I believe, given the complex issues we are dealing with, that the council is best placed to undertake the role as noise regulator for Dublin Airport. The extensive policy and legal examination of the regulation which I mentioned earlier made it clear that there is a significant overlap between the EU regulation, the planning process and environmental protection requirements. In that respect, the council, with its extensive experience in planning and development, land use planning and management, appropriate assessment, environmental impact assessment and managing large public consultations, is well suited for the job. That is why I have defended the council in the House when others have questioned its suitability for the job. I have also defended it against what I consider baseless accusations of conflict of interest. Fingal is not conflicted. I believe in the effectiveness of local government by local authorities. I believe that giving Fingal County Council additional legal powers to regulate noise at Dublin Airport makes perfect sense, building on its functions relating to noise under the environmental noise directive and the planning code generally. It is joined-up public administration. It is empowering local government, allowing a local authority to make local decisions. It is in the best interest of providing a readily accessible, fully transparent and locally accountable process for managing and monitoring noise at the airport. Fingal County Council is one of the largest local authorities in the country. It has a highly skilled staff complement. It has existing relevant expertise and it has the wherewithal to develop and bring in more expertise as necessary. I reject the notion that it is not a good fit and I reject the idea that local authorities can be conflicted in overseeing and providing local services and acting in a regulatory role. All local authorities have a wide range of statutory-based regulatory functions, including environmental quality control, planning permissions, development planning, public lighting, road building and road maintenance. They have enforcement roles as well, and they have powers to charge taxes and fees, including property tax, commercial rates and planning related fees. The fee raising and charging powers are to ensure that the statutory and other public services provided by local authorities are funded. It is not a commercial enterprise and this is not about turning a profit. Local authorities charge what is needed to cover service costs, and in the context of its new noise regulation functions, Fingal will do the same. Fingal County Council has a track record of performing the role of competent authority in areas such as planning and environment and does so in an independent manner. Its decisions are open and transparent and are subject to appeal and judicial review. This Bill is not breaking any new ground in this respect. It is clear that the proposal relating to the implementation of EU Regulation No. 598/2014 is wholly aligned with the long-established multi-functional role played by local authorities. Moreover, any decision will be subject to an independent appeals process. I am confident when the Bill is examined more closely, it will become clear to all that given the close interrelationship with the Planning and Development Act and the current responsibilities held by Fingal County Council under the environmental noise directive, that the council is the most suitable body to take on the role as noise regulator for Dublin Airport. I will be clear about the resourcing of this new function, which is a legitimate concern that has been expressed by a number of colleagues. It is true that Fingal County Council will have to build up capacity to fully undertake the role as noise regulator. It will have to procure noise expertise to assist in the application of the balanced approach and the decision-making process. It is building from a solid base with the existing in-house expertise and capacity to run a process, including the public consultation as prescribed in the Bill. Funding will be made available to allow it to do this. It is intended that any costs will be met by a levy that the competent authority will impose on the DAA. The DAA will be liable to pay this levy on a monthly, biannual or annual basis, as determined by the competent authority. It will be based on costs incurred by the council, or reasonably expected to occur, in the performance of its functions as the competent authority. With regard to how the process set out in the Bill is intended to work, Fingal County Council has responsibility for noise assessments under the 2002 environmental noise directive. This Bill, in accordance with EU Regulation No. 598/2014, is an extension of that process. The Bill sets out the procedure to be followed where a noise problem is identified at the airport following a noise assessment undertaken in line with the directive. This entails undertaking an analysis of the various measures available to reduce noise. There are four high level options: noise reduction at source; land use planning and management; noise abatement operational procedures; and operating restrictions, as a last resort. The goal is to address any noise problem in the most effective manner. This analytical framework is called the balanced approach and it is set out in regulation No. 598. It has been developed at the UN's ICAO as the best way forward to ensure that airports can develop in a more sustainable way and that air connectivity can continue to be improved as a key enabler of international trade and in the general interest of global access. What is proposed in this Bill, therefore, is an airport noise regulatory regime that has been developed as international best practice and adopted as EU law. Having completed its analysis under the balanced approach, the noise regulator will come to a draft regulatory decision regarding the noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, if any, to be introduced at Dublin Airport. The regulator will publish this draft decision and invite submissions and observations to be made within a period of 14 weeks. This open consultation is an important aspect of the Bill. The draft decision will be accompanied by a report detailing how the decision was reached which will include a non-technical summary. This will ensure any individual will be in a position to input into the process and that the consultation will not be limited to those with technical expertise. Once the public consultation process is complete, and having considered any submissions or observations received, the noise regulator will make a final decision. The regulator will specify a timeframe for the introduction of such measures and in the case of operating restrictions, will provide at least six months notice. The Bill also inserts new sections into the Planning and Development Act, to put in place a framework for the application of regulation No. 598 requirements within the planning process. The purpose of this is twofold. Provision is made for the noise regulator to input into decisions of the planning authority in respect of planning applications for proposed development that may impact on noise at the airport. The Bill also provides for the ability of the airport authority to apply to the planning authority to review and amend any current operating restrictions in place at the airport as conditioned under a previous planning consent. In both these circumstances, the planning authority is not permitted to make a final decision on the planning application until the noise regulator has completed its work. This work will involve assessing the planning application using the balanced approach framework and consulting with the planning authority and any other party it deems necessary. In line with normal Regulation No. 598 procedures, the noise regulator will also have to undertake a 14-week public consultation on proposed measures. Once the noise regulator notifies the planning authority of its regulatory decision, the planning authority will incorporate that regulatory decision, by way of planning conditions, into its final decision on the planning application. It is well documented that DAA views the operating restrictions attached to the permission for the second runway as overly restrictive. On completion of construction of the second runway, those restrictions will immediately impact and reduce current operations at the airport. The restrictions were decided upon in advance of EU Regulation No. 598/2014 coming into force, and, therefore, it makes sense that they are now reviewed in light of the balanced approach process, in advance of their introduction. The Bill does not pre-empt any decision that may be made by the noise regulator on the appropriateness of these restrictions. However, it allows the noise regulator to examine all noise mitigation measures available, in line with the balanced approach, to mitigate any noise problem that may arise from the operation of the second runway. Once it examines any application to review the operating restrictions attached to the second runway project, the noise regulator will come to a determination. It may decide that no change is needed to the current operating restrictions. It may decide that more onerous restrictions are required, or it may determine that a new set of noise abatement measures entirely are more appropriate. That will be a matter for the new regulator to decide, based on expert technical analysis, reference to best international practice, emerging technology and extensive public consultation. The Bill sets out, in a detailed way, how the noise regulation is to dovetail with the planning process. This is important because it means that airport use and airport development will be subject to a more robust, interconnected regulatory regime that tests development proposals against planning and development benchmarks and now noise impact and noise management benchmarks.To that end, the Bill provides that the planning authority must first consult with the noise regulator in regard to development at the airport that may have a noise dimension. This will facilitate the regulator in applying the balanced approach before reaching a decision on the application of any operating restrictions, as may be needed, to be incorporated into the final planning decision. Likewise, where there is a planning application to review current operating restrictions, the regulator will decide upon the most appropriate measures in line with EU Regulation No. 598/2014. A further requirement of EU Regulation No. 598/2014 is the designation of an appeals body to provide for an appeals mechanism to a decision of the noise regulator. To provide for alignment with the Planning and Development Act, the Bill designates An Bord Pleanála as the independent appeals body. This decision will ensure cohesion in any future planning decisions on development at Dublin Airport. All regulatory decisions of the noise regulator are subject to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. Where an appeal to a regulatory decision of the noise regulator is made to the board, it will have 18 weeks to make a decision, with provision to extend this timeline if required. Provision has also been made for the board to, at its discretion, undertake a 14-week public consultation process. This may happen where the board is of the view that there are alternative noise mitigation measures or operating restrictions, other than those proposed by the noise regulator, which may be implemented at the airport and were not consulted on previously. In assessing any such appeal, the board will gain all of the powers of the noise regulator and must adopt the balanced approach in consideration of the measures to be imposed. Where a noise regulatory decision is made as part of an overall planning decision, that can also be appealed to An Bord Pleanála as part of an appeal of the planning decision. Where a planning decision into which the noise regulator has had input is appealed to the board, the board will again assume all the powers of the noise regulator. It will have the power to decide on the most appropriate noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions, if any, that are to be introduced at Dublin Airport and set out the timelines for their implementation.  Another aspect of the Bill relates to monitoring and enforcement powers. There will be an onus on the airport authority to ensure that it adheres to any decision of the noise regulator and that any measures are implemented effectively. The airport authority will be required to produce an annual compliance report, to include a non-technical summary. This report will be published by the regulator. The regulator will monitor compliance and has the power to direct the airport authority and airport users, as necessary, to comply with any noise mitigation measures and operating restrictions with recourse to the High Court for non-compliance.  The Bill also outlines other consequential amendments to the Planning and Development Act. One such amendment is the declassification of airport development as strategic infrastructure development for the purposes of planning applications. This measure means that an application for planning permission for development at airports will be made to the local authority in the first instance, with provision for appeal to An Bord Pleanála. This amendment is necessary, as it would not be possible for An Bord Pleanála to be both the deciding body and the appeals body for development at the airport, which will have a significant noise impact.  Ultimately, EU Regulation No. 598/2014 is intended to ensure that major European airports are developed in a sustainable manner and that they are subject to oversight and scrutiny not just in terms of planning and environmental laws but, in the case of airports specifically, noise levels. This Bill provides for this. It sets out a robust, rigorous and transparent noise regulation regime that will ensure that Dublin Airport can grow, but only in a way that is responsive to the impact of noise caused by aircraft. This means it will have to comply with regulatory decisions on how aircraft approach and depart the airport, for example, on how and when they can move around the airport, on the type of aircraft and engines preferred. All of these factors now form part of the decision-making regarding the long-term development of Dublin Airport. It is a much more comprehensive management and monitoring framework than currently exists.  While I fully understand that there are local concerns, I am equally confident that this new regime will come to be seen as a positive step forward. The Bill, therefore, sets out a noise regulation regime that has not been in place before, allowing for full stakeholder engagement. It also sets out an independent appeals process which will provide certainty to stakeholders and a framework for managing the process in a fair and balanced way. In essence, the legislation provides for a structured approach to assessing and addressing aircraft noise at Dublin Airport with the objective of facilitating airport development and expansion in a way that minimises, as far as practicable, the noise impact of that expansion.  I commend the Bill to the House. 
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	463	I will share time with Deputy Darragh O'Brien. For the past four years, the Government has been aware of the requirement for an independent noise regulator for Dublin Airport following the passage of EU Regulation 598/2014, which sets out a noise mitigation and abatement framework for all European airports above a particular size. Ireland is one of two countries yet to fulfil this requirement, which is vital to the functioning of Dublin Airport. Given the manner in which the Government has approached the establishment of an independent noise regulator, which has been characterised by lengthy delays interspersed by gross missteps on the part of the Minister, the end result has not been pretty. We are faced with the choice of appointing a body about which serious concerns have been raised regarding its capabilities and independence or to further delay this vital infrastructure and thus jeopardise Ireland's economic future. The Minister has left us between a rock and a hard place. Reluctantly, Fianna Fáil will support this Bill but we propose to table amendments to it. I acknowledge that the Minister has agreed to hold Committee Stage in the new year, thereby giving all Members an opportunity to work on robust amendments. Fianna Fáil will support this Bill in recognition of the implications that opposing it would have for Dublin Airport's proposed second runway, which was first granted planning permission in 2007 by Fingal County Council. Work has commenced on this runway with a view to it being operational in 2021. This is imperative in light of the economic uncertainty presented by Brexit, which requires Ireland to strengthen its links with existing trading partners and to develop trade with new partners. Our airports not only connect us with large trading partners such as the United Kingdom and the United States, they also foster connections with new and growing markets. In the past year, Dublin Airport announced new direct services to Beijing and Hong Kong. Amidst the growing uncertainty of Brexit, the capacity of our airports to offer new direct services and increase the country's connectivity is of great comfort to businesses and citizens concerned about their economic futures. The funding is in place and construction has commenced on the vital infrastructure but an independent noise regulator has yet to be appointed. The delay in bringing forth this legislation lies with the Minister. The holdup relates to conditions attached to the planning permission for the second runway following an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which resulted in 31 restrictions being added to the planning permission, two of which would limit flight arrivals and departures at Dublin Airport to 65 between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. and permit no night time flights on the new runway. To put this into perspective, currently at night time, 99 flights arrive and depart from Dublin Airport, which means night time flight movement would be reduced by approximately one third. It is estimated by the DAA that these restrictions, if applied, would result in the loss of more than 14,000 jobs. It is the view of Dublin Airport that these restrictions are not fit for purpose and that the DAA needs to appeal them before the second runway is scheduled to be completed. However, for this appeal to proceed, there must be an independent noise regulator in place because the noise regulator will serve as the sole competent authority under EU Regulation No. 598/2014, essentially serving as the independent expert body responsible for monitoring existing levels of noise and evaluation the possible impacts of proposed changes. On the face of it, this sounds logical.Monitoring noise levels and developing mitigating measures are a precise and exact science and it makes sense to develop an evidence driven regime that will be administered by experts. If this is done correctly, the new regime can carve a fair and effective path that does not compromise the well-being and rights of the citizens in pursuit of the goal of providing additional flights and connectivity. I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery tonight of people who are affected by movement in the airport and the work they have done in engaging with Members of the Oireachtas and putting their case forward. They have been reasonable and sensible in their approach over the past number of years, but they have been left in limbo because of the Minister's inaction. I take issue with the appointment of Fingal County Council as the competent authority under this legislation. Any discussion of this appointment would be incomplete without reference to how we arrived here. Following the passing of the EU regulation, it took more than two years for the Minister and his predecessor to identify a suitable body to take on the role of regulator for this regime. We believed that was finally over when the current Minister appointed the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, in September 2016, more than 28 months ago. Following that announcement, which was welcomed by many of the residents and the DAA, the IAA duly commenced preparation to take up the role, diligently building the expertise it would need to do it. The Department set about drafting a statutory instrument that it maintained would be necessary to give effect to the noise regulator. We waited for the statutory instrument to materialise. We were then informed that primary legislation would be required. We waited again. Since 2016, I have raised this issue 25 times with the Minister and on each occasion he confirmed that work was well under way to make the IAA the statutory competent independent body. The rug was pulled from under us when the Minister announced that his legal advice stated that the IAA was not an appropriate body to be appointed and that he would appoint Fingal County Council. The Minister outlined in his contribution why the council was the right and best choice. If it was the right and best choice, why was it not his first choice? Why did he waste so many years examining every other option before ultimately deciding on Fingal County Council? His decision has provoked widespread anguish among the local community, which has genuine concerns about the ability of the council to be an independent adjudicator of an airport that is its single largest rate payer and that generates 8% of its income. We have been waiting 12 months to reach this position today. In fact, it is more than 12 months. The Minister is not meeting the targets he set last February, which is regrettable. The Minister is at fault for spending so much of his time during the year pursuing legislation that is under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality when he should have been pursuing the legislation under the remit of his Department. On foot of a freedom of information request, I received a reply that Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary in the Department, sent on 16 February 2018 to an official in Fingal County Council. He said that a lot of work had to be done of the draft heads of the legislation. He said the Department had an internal issue around resourcing to resolve which was complicating things but which he hoped to unblock soon. Was the Minister aware there were resource issues in his Department in respect of drafting the necessary legislation? If so, what did he do to ensure they were resolved? Furthermore, there are concerns about the level of competence Fingal County Council has with regard to monitoring noise levels and developing a meaningful noise abatement regime. In the European context, it is highly unusual for a county council to be the competent authority in the operation of this regulation. In almost every other country, the Minister with responsibility for transport or the local aviation agency plays this role. Ireland will be one of only three countries in Europe where a local authority does it. Without seeking to cast aspersions on the integrity of Fingal County Council, I share the concerns of the residents. EU Regulation No. 598/2014 clearly states that the body appointed as the competent authority shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action. Given the significant reliance of Fingal County Council on Dublin Airport for rates and broader revenue, there are questions about whether the county council meets this requirement. If one follows the logic the Minister used against the appointment of the IAA, which he said was unsuitable by virtue of the financial benefit it derived from aircraft used in Irish airspace, the appointment of Fingal County Council is quite strange. This potential conflict of interest is a matter of great concern for me and my party. I call on the Minister to ensure that the new noise regulator is functionally totally separate from Fingal County Council. That is the least the Minister owes the residents of Fingal. At a minimum, the Minister should examine the possibility of placing the new regulator in a separate building from that of the county council as well as allowing the new body to operate under a different name. It is also incumbent on him to provide greater detail about how citizens with noise complaints can raise them with the noise regulator and the process through which the complaints will be handled. Furthermore, when one considers the magnitude of this role, it is vital that the council be equipped to perform it well. This will mean hiring a significant number of additional staff with expertise in the field. Among other areas, it will be necessary to have experts in runway operation, runway techniques, aircraft noise and performance, methods of noise abatement and airlines operation. Perhaps the Minister will outline how this will be achieved, particularly given the tight timelines under which he is operating. Will there be a formal mechanism in place for the noise regulator to collaborate with other experts in the field, such as the IAA or the European Aviation Agency? Ultimately, these are questions that will define how well the independent noise regulator will be able to do its job. I have queries on a number of strategic observations. The Bill does not direct the competent authority to take account of the worldwide ICAO regulations concerning airport development known as the balanced approach. The EU regulation on noise is entirely based on this. The balanced approach is central and critical as it ensures that all stakeholders have an input. This is the normal approach worldwide. The Bill uses the term "balanced approach" but it should direct Fingal County Council to implement the approach and not just refer to it. It is interesting that there is far more emphasis on the habitats directive than on the EU regulation on noise with regard to the balanced approach. Will Fingal County Council's development plan be amended to ensure dual and independent runway operations? Will that plan foresee an increase in aircraft movements, especially when new technology becomes available that enables different types of aircraft approaches such as satellite guided approaches, the ground-based augmentation system, GBAS? Does Fingal County Council have expertise in the runway operations, runway techniques, aircraft noise monitoring, aircraft and engine performance, aircraft noise abatement and other areas I mentioned, which is essential for performing the function of the competent authority for aircraft noise? If not, how will it secure this expertise, from whom and what is the estimated cost?Exclusive competence does not apply to the operating restrictions relating to safety imposed by the Irish Aviation Authority. Will the Minister please clarify this? What control costs are placed on the competent authority and how is it controlled? It appears to be a blank cheque. Is there an appeal on costs or can this be controlled by some other process? I have a number of other questions but I must give way to my colleague Deputy O'Brien. I acknowledge that the Minister will facilitate what I hope will be robust further scrutiny of the Bill on Committee Stage and that he will take on board the concerns of the Members on this side of the House when we reach Committee Stage in the new year.

I have attended briefings with the Minister's officials and I have attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. I have also spoken to the Minister directly on this issue. I have lived beside the airport my whole life and I am aware of the importance of the airport, not only for our local economic development but also for the national economic development: some 20,000 direct jobs, more than 117,000 indirect jobs and €8.3 billion of value to the economy. It is a really important piece of infrastructure. As my colleague has outlined, it beggars belief that we have waited this long for this Bill. I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of many residents from communities like my own that will be affected, and who have lived beside the airport for all this time near the existing runway. All of these communities have acted responsibly and have been reasonable. Nobody is saying that the second parallel runway should not be built. It is nothing like that. If one positive thing comes from this legislation it is that at last it should deal with some of the outstanding issues, namely the voluntary sales scheme operated by the Dublin Airport Authority, which leaves a lot to be desired especially in the St. Margaret's and the Cloghran areas. Another outstanding issue is the insufficient noise insulation scheme that does not cover enough houses and does not look at the flight path near the new runway. As my party spokesman has said, it is very important to note that the Bill requires major amendment. I am still not convinced at all that we cannot use the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, or the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, as the regulator. I still have grave concerns about the competency within Fingal County Council to do this. This is in no way to besmirch that council. I know that it is an excellent local authority, as the Minister has said. I work with the council every day of the week, but the Minister reasoned in his statement that: "It is empowering local government, allowing a local authority to make local decisions." This issue is not just about local decisions and that assertion is absolutely incorrect. This is about the establishment of a new noise regulator for an international airport through which 30 million passengers will travel this year. It is a busy airport that will grow further. Since my days in Fingal County Council in 2004 I have consistently supported the development of the airport, but a responsible development that makes sure the airport operates a good neighbour policy. This is all that people want. The residents want to be listened to but they and I also want to ensure that when the DAA moves forward and looks to set aside or amend the current planning conditions, especially around the night flights, that we have someone who is independent to look at that. It is important that people's quality of life in Dublin Fingal, where I live and where I have spent my whole life, is protected and is balanced with the future economic growth of the airport. We know how important it is for jobs. Thousands of us who live in the community, including my friends and neighbours, work in the airport or derive their income from the airport. This is a good thing. Nobody in any of the communities is saying stop and do no more. That is not what this is about. It is about a fair, open and transparent process. It is not about setting up a regulator simply to look at the planning conditions. This must be a noise regulator into the future, for the future development. Whatever we do now has to stand the test of time. This is why I welcome the fact that my party colleague and Deputy Clare Daly are ensuring that we are not rushing into Committee Stage. This is not what I want to do. Through my own party spokesman I intend that we would table a series of significant amendments to what has been produced here. It is gravely disappointing that we have waited this long, over two years, for this. I believe that there are better authorities and organisations in the State that could be beefed up, such as the CAR and the IAA. I am also aware of the need to allow future economic growth, but it has to be balanced with a good neighbour policy with our communities in north Dublin. They need to be listened to and they need to be absolutely clear that whatever process is used into the future is independent and transparent.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	465	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Dublin Airport is experiencing something of a boom currently, with record passenger numbers year on year. A second runway is due to be in operation by the end of 2021. While a second runway is needed at this stage, it is important that the needs of local people are respected and that flight and noise limits are imposed to ensure that their quality of life is maintained. The Minister is also looking for a third, privately run terminal to be built. He seems, however, to be on his own on that one with near universal agreement that such a development is not required at this time. We find ourselves in a frankly ridiculous situation, thanks to the Minister. In order to give effect to EU Regulation 598/2014, a noise regulator must be appointed to Dublin Airport. Because the Minister and the Department assumed that the Irish Aviation Authority would be the competent authority it seems that no arrangements were made in case the IAA did not work out. Given that the IAA is currently being split into two entities because of serious concerns around conflicts of interest in respect of its regulatory role the Minister and his Department should at the very least have been aware of this possibility. Now we have missed the EU deadline and we are currently in breach of EU law. We have a contract awarded to build a new runway and no noise regulator is in place. The Government is, therefore, trying to hammer through this important legislation in a couple of weeks. Earlier this week an idea was floated to have a deadline for Committee Stage amendments before Second Stage had even begun. Thanks to objections from me and others at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport the Committee Stage will now be put back until after Christmas to allow offices adequate time to prepare amendments. The Government has decided that Fingal County Council is the best option for a noise regulator. It appears that this decision has been taken because the council would be in a position to take up this new role faster than the other options open to the Department. This is not a good way to do business. We have to end the practice in aviation of having regulators who are financially dependent on the entities they regulate. I propose that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is a more appropriate competent authority for noise regulation at the airport. The commission satisfies the independence requirements of Regulation 598 and has existing regulatory roles in respect of Dublin Airport. It is expected to have further regulatory roles around civil aviation in the near future when the functions of the IAA are changed due to the current conflict of interest. The IAA currently regulates civil aviation safety while simultaneously making revenue from these airlines. This is a desperately poor practice, which does not happen in other jurisdictions. It does not promote confidence in the ability of the Minister to address issues of conflict of interest in the aviation sector, or to remedy issues when they are identified. The Irish Aviation Authority (Amendment) Bill 2017 was at the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny and has not been seen or heard of since. Will the Minister say when we might see that Bill? Will we see it in this Dáil term? The Department objects to the commission taking on the role of noise regulator as it does not have the expertise currently, but the same argument could be made for Fingal County Council taking the role. The real issue is that bestowing the function upon the commission will probably be a lengthier process, but that is the Department’s own fault for delaying, and it is not an excuse for poor decision-making.It is very poor form to try to hammer this legislation through the Dáil; we need to do this properly. Fingal County Council has been identified for reasons of convenience - that is exactly what it is - as the most suitable authority to regulate aircraft noise, not because it is the most suitable authority. I would like it noted that I am not criticising Fingal County Council. This was the Minister’s decision. The council has no expertise in this area, and I am sure it never expected to be put in this position. It is very unfair. Given the total lack of expertise in the council, can the Minister outline exactly what arrangements must be made by the council to take on this new role? What additional funding will be at its disposal? What sort of expertise will it need to bring on board? We have an obvious issue with the conflict of interest at the council. The council collects rates from the airport and will now be responsible for noise regulation and decision-making around flight numbers. The Government is at pains to emphasise that only 8% of the council’s revenue comes from the airport. That is a shocking attitude to take as 8% is a significant funding stream and the fact that any funding for the council comes from the airport authority is reason enough, surely, for the council not to be appointed as regulator. The fact of the matter is that a public body will be collecting money from an entity over which it has regulatory powers. This is a conflict of interest and raises serious concerns about the decision to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority. Clearly, there is an issue around timing, in particular with the runway, but the poor governance at the Department is not a legitimate excuse for poor policy. Some 85% of air traffic in this State comes through Dublin Airport. It is essential that the airport not be subject to regulatory uncertainty. However, the solution is not to implement an inappropriate regulator or just any regulator at all. It is absolutely outrageous that we are in this position. The sheer incompetence demonstrated by the Minister is out of this world. He has displayed incompetence in many parts of his portfolio but this latest escapade is something else. The main thing here is independence. We need a completely independent entity to take on the function of the noise regulator. This could be the commission or it could be a new entity, if that was judged to be more appropriate. This is the direction we are taking regarding the funding of civil aviation safety regulation. It makes sense and removes questions of bias or conflict of interest. The Bill has serious issues that need to be amended. I intend to address those issues on Committee Stage in the new year.

I welcome the people in the Gallery and must say I admire the restraint and patience of those who live beside Dublin Airport because they have been living with a lot of uncertainty for the past few years since planning permission was granted for the additional runway. They are practical people. They know that the airport is there. It comes as no surprise to them. They and we believe that the good neighbour policy Dublin Airport is keen to foster needs fostering and protecting. They know they live beside the airport; it does not come as a shock to them. They know it is going to be noisy but, equally, they have a right to a decent quality of life. It does not seem much to ask that the night flight restrictions be retained for the sake of the health and safety of those who live in the environs of the airport or under the flight paths. Sinn Féin will not oppose this legislation progressing to Committee Stage but we do so only to facilitate the putting forward of amendments, as my colleague, Teachta Munster, has indicated. If these amendments are not accepted and if the concerns are not addressed then we will not be in a position to support this legislation. As has been said already, there has been substantial delay in progressing the legislation. Now, at the very last minute, we see attempts being made to rush it through. Of course that sets off alarm bells for the residents because they have seen years of inaction and delay, yet all of a sudden, at ten minutes to Christmas, everything has to be done. I commend Teachta Munster and others on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on ensuring that we have adequate time to prepare amendments for Committee Stage. The deferral of Committee Stage is extremely important. It means we have time to engage within our own offices and parties, to talk to the people who are impacted and to formulate those amendments. Notwithstanding that there was a delay, the legislation seems very hastily written. One particular omission is the mention of health. This is contained in the EU regulation but there is only one mention of it in the legislation. The regulation states:The importance of health aspects needs to be recognised in relation to noise problems, and it is therefore important that those aspects be taken into consideration in a consistent manner at all airports when a decision is taken on noise abatement objectives, taking into account the existence of common Union rules in this area. Therefore, health aspects should be assessed in accordance with Union legislation on the evaluation of noise effects. The regulation further states "The objectives of this Regulation are ... to facilitate the achievement of specific noise abatement objectives, including health aspects, at the level of individual airports, while respecting relevant Union rules, in particular those laid down in Directive 2002/49/EC, and the legislation within each Member State". This legislation, however, only mentions health at section 38(3)(a), which only refers to special areas of conservation and special protection areas, as was mentioned earlier. This is not acceptable; there are of course areas of special conservation around the airport but those areas and the airport exist beside real people in real communities whose health and well-being is not mentioned in the Bill. This omission gives those people cause to be very worried. They do not believe that their health and well-being is in any way a priority for this legislation and when they read the Bill they see that there is nothing there to contradict that view. The EU regulation is very clear on what it seeks to do. It states:Sustainable development of air transport requires the introduction of measures aimed at reducing the noise impact from aircraft at Union airports. Those measures should improve the noise environment around Union airports in order to maintain or increase the quality of life of neighbouring citizens and foster compatibility between aviation activities and residential areas, in particular where night flights are concerned. Where in this proposed legislation is the provision for maintaining, much less increasing, the quality of life for the citizens who are neighbours to the airport? The proposal by the Government to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority is also a very curious one. This issue has been rehearsed and the arguments have been made. I cannot understand why the Minister would believe that it is a good idea - it might be a convenient idea - to appoint Fingal County Council to this role. I simply cannot fathom that. It is convenient but apart from that, I do not see a reason. The regulation provides that the competent authority shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action. It suggests that this independence may be achieved through a functional separation. How can there be a functional separation where the chief executive of the competent authority is also the chief executive of the entity that receives significant rates from the airport? I just do not understand how that functional separation can exist when there will be one unit in charge. That is not in any way to cast aspersions on Fingal County Council or the people who work in it because I know that they work hard. They themselves will say they do not have the expertise to be able to do this work. When we talk about functional separation, how is it going to be achieved? There is nothing in this Bill that gives us any indication. It seems to me that it is not possible. The experience and expertise are simply not there. I did attend briefings with the Minister's officials, who were of the view that Fingal County Council would have to buy in the expertise because the expertise does not exist.If Fingal County Council has to buy in the expertise, that brings us back to the original question of how Fingal County Council was chosen. The answer, of course, is that it is convenient. The convenient solution is not necessarily the best. As an Teachta Munster outlined, we will be proposing that the Commission for Aviation Regulation be appointed to be the competent authority. We could not support this legislation as it is currently written. We will resist attempts to appoint Fingal County Council as the competent authority and I know that others will be doing the same. I urge the Minister to listen to the concerns of the residents and their representatives. Is it really a good idea for the regulator to be responsible for regulating its single biggest ratepayer? Is it really the best way to safeguard the health and safety of those living in the neighbourhood of the airport? We do not oppose the new runway but we will oppose the Bill if it does not fulfil the requirements of the EU regulation. We simply cannot support the appointment of Fingal County Council as the competent authority. Fingal County Council is a very good, hard working, competent and capable local authority, but it is not a regulator in that sense and it will need to buy in the expertise. It makes no sense when the expertise does not exist. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport officials also indicated that temporary expertise might have to be brought in or that the council might be able to bring people in from time to time. I do not think that is any way to provide what the regulation requires which is that health and safety should be part of it. I do not believe it can be done in that piecemeal way. This evening's discussion gives us a good opportunity to highlight concerns residents have, such as the concerns about insulation mentioned already. I am sure these people would very much welcome the opportunity to meet the Minister and discuss those in full. Nobody disputes that the airport is very important locally and nationally. Future developments must be balanced along with the needs of the people who will be impacted by this. Because Committee Stage will not be taken until the new year, there is time to consider alternative options such as the Commission for Aviation Regulation. There is time to engage with the residents and their representatives to ensure this legislation goes through, and that we comply with the regulation in full.

The Bill, which has been repeatedly delayed, is finally here and yet it still seems hurried. The attempt to take Committee Stage next week was totally unacceptable and I congratulate the members of the committee who, I believe, unanimously rejected that request. This Bill, which gives effect to an EU regulation on noise monitoring, is technical. Some might say it is too technical and some might even say it is dull. However, this is vital legislation and one which is causing huge alarm to many communities and residents in Fingal. EU Regulation 598/2014 aims to improve the noise environment around EU airports to ensure greater compatibility between aviation activities and residential areas, in particular in the case of night flights. The rules are based on the principles of the balanced approach to noise management agreed by the ICAO, the United Nations body dealing with international civil aviation. The EU formulated the rules on the principles of the balanced approach to noise management agreed by this body, which seek to make airplanes quieter by setting noise standards, manage the land around airports in a sustainable way, adapt operational procedures to reduce the noise impact on the ground and introduce operating restrictions, usually as a last resort. The purpose of the operating restrictions is that decisions regarding airports and their aviation are evidence based and offer the best solutions for noise problems with regards to safety, capacity and cost. EU Regulation 598/2014 states that this only applies to airports with more than 50,000 civil aircraft movements per year, meaning that Dublin Airport is the only airport in Ireland to which this applies. An operating restriction can take various forms, such as setting a noise or a movement limit, introducing a non-addition rule or adopting a curfew for a period of night. That is the context and includes the need for a balanced approach, something which is lacking in this Bill. Any regulation which aims to improve the noise environment around EU airports should be welcomed with open arms. However, unfortunately we cannot welcome the legislation as it is currently drafted. Chiefly, Labour has a problem with the Minister's choice of Fingal County Council as the so-called competent authority for noise monitoring. We share that view with others who have already spoken. The regulation states that this authority must be independent of any party that might have a conflict of interest. The Bill proposes to designate Fingal County Council as the competent authority and as such, we instantly have fears over potential conflicts of interest. Under the Bill the functions of the competent authority are to be performed by the CEO of the county council. Those functions are to be treated as executive functions and the chief executive is to be independent in the performance of them. Specifically, the chief executive is not to be subject to the direction of the elected council acting by resolution under section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001. However, the chief executive may, to the extent that he or she is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, have regard to any plan adopted by the elected council pursuant to its functions. That said, the members of the elected council are barred from influencing or seeking to influence the chief executive in his or her performance of a function of the competent authority. It is beyond me how this can be construed as giving power to local government. This shall not be construed to prevent the members of the elected council from discussing noise at the airport where relevant to the performance of their functions as the elected council. The question is whether these elaborate safeguards satisfy the requirements of the airport noise regulation 598/2014. I believe they do not. Recital No. 13 of the regulation states that:The competent authority responsible for adopting noise-related operating restrictions should be independent of any organisation involved in the airport’s operation, air transport or air navigation service provision, or representing the interests thereof and of the residents living in the vicinity of the airport. This should not be understood as requiring Member States to modify their administrative structures or decision-making procedures.Article 3.2 provides that:The competent authorities shall be independent of any organisation which could be affected by noise-related action. That independence may be achieved through a functional separation.What is functional separation? That is key to this. Functional separation is EU jargon that is more familiar in the field of competition law as applied to monopoly utilities and service providers. It is a remedy that falls short of splitting up a monopoly and spinning off the component parts into separate ownership. Instead, the remedy is to impose an obligation on an undertaking to place certain of its activities into an independently operating business entity. The best-known example in Ireland is the ESB. EirGrid and Electric Ireland are functionally separate entities within the ESB, with separate and independent boards. However, there remains a common ownership which is important, because the ESB can continue to borrow against the assets of the national grid. However, I believe functional separation must require that each independent entity is confined to performing its own functions. Functional separation means a separation of function. For example, EirGrid is only concerned with the grid, Electric Ireland with sales and the ESB with generation. None of the three functionally separate entities has mixed or overlapping functions. That is not what is proposed in this Bill. The CEO of the council is to be given certain functions, which he or she is to perform without direction from the council. However, he or she is to remain as CEO of the council: that will continue to be his day job.If the CEO of the ESB was vested with direct responsibility for managing the national grid independent of the board of the ESB while continuing to perform the functions of CEO, anyone would think that grid management was functionally separate from the ESB. While the CEO of Fingal County Council will be independent of the elected members of the council under the Bill, he or she is not independent of the local authority itself, which is, in law, a separate concept. As such, he or she will remain as CEO of a body whose principal statutory function under section 63 of the Local Government Act 2001 is to provide a forum for the democratic representation of the local community and to provide civic leadership for that community. While providing a forum for democratic representation is primarily the responsibility of the elected members, it is the statutory duty of the CEO to advise and assist the elected members generally as regards the performance of their functions under section 132 (3) of the aforementioned Act. The relationship between Fingal County Council and the DAA is very strong and close and needs to be thus. The airport is a key economic driver of the country and a vital source of employment for people all over Fingal. The rates are just one testament to the intertwined relationship of the DAA and council. The financial success of the DAA has a direct correlation with revenue generation for Fingal County Council. Coupled with this is the fact that the DAA is the largest ratepayer in Fingal County Council, with the authority accounting for 22% of the rateable income of the local authority. The existence of this financial relationship does not in and of itself indicate any party acting in a conflicted manner but it raises valid questions about the potential for a conflict of interest.  This Bill has to be read in the context of the building of the second runway at Dublin Airport. We are told that the delivery of the north runway will enable a 30% increase in connectivity which will support an additional 31,200 jobs and a further €2.2 billion of economic activity. This Bill, if passed, will pave the way for the second runway and for the DAA to apply to change the planning conditions which limit night-time flights on the new runway and across the entire airport. In recent years, the DAA has been making strong arguments through consecutive CEOs that the planning conditions need to be set aside to make the new runway economically viable. However, this argument can be disputed because there is a difference between viability and maximising profitability, which is the real concern of the DAA. The runway will be viable and profitable under the existing planning conditions but these conditions will restrict the DAA from wringing every last drop of revenue out of the runway. Allowing it to do so through night-time flights would be to the detriment of local residents in Fingal affected by flight noise, many of whom are in the Public Gallery this evening.  A balanced approach, as provided for in the EU's noise regulation - Regulation No. 598/2014 - must be applied but the constant references by the DAA to economic viability, which should be read as profitability, highlight what is really behind this project and provide context to this Bill. The economic relationship between the DAA and Fingal County Council leaves the council open to charges of a potential conflict of interest. Therefore, the Minister must choose a different body to be the competent authority. The need for functional separation required by Regulation No. 598/2014 is not being met, as I outlined previously in the context of the ESB example. Fingal residents are also concerned about the council acting as both a decision maker for any planning applications regarding construction work and as an independent noise regulator. Dublin Airport will be forever building, expanding and growing and there have also been discussions in the Department on the building of a third terminal. In these instances, Fingal County Council would be both the independent noise regulator and the planning authority. The council should not hold both positions simultaneously. Surely the Minister can see this.  Another concern of citizens relates to the general aviation expertise of Fingal County Council. Is specific expertise currently at the disposal of Fingal County Council? If not, the council will have to hire in this expertise. Will its wage structure allow this? These are very real questions. This cannot be another responsibility added to an existing department or one given to an individual who already has other responsibilities. This is a highly specialised skill and, as such, needs the expertise of bodies such as the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR. In 2016, a ministerial press release claimed that the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, was the best option to be the competent authority since it oversees aviation safety and air traffic control. Since then, the Minister has announced that he intends to split the IAA such that the CAR, which currently protects airport consumers and sets the level of airport charges, adopts the safety oversight feature of the IAA. Post-split, the IAA would only provide the for-profit, commercial air traffic control service while the CAR would be the independent regulatory body. Thus, the Commission for Aviation Regulation is a good option as it would fit the requirements of Regulation No. 598/2014, particularly in the post-reorganisation scenario outlined. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is another option that would also be acceptable to the Labour Party.  There is no mention in the Bill of the importance of health, as referred to by other Deputies. This must be recognised as health is clearly referenced in Regulation No. 598/2014. I will not read the reference now but this must be included in the Bill. The regulation calls for an improvement in the quality of life of neighbouring citizens of airports, particularly where night flights are concerned. This is also not included in the Bill. What is the basis of the Minister's approach here? The suspicion of affected residents is that he is pursuing the bottom line and not taking a balanced approach to include the well-being of residents who live beside the airport and under flight paths. In fact, reference is made to animal habitats but there is no mention of the health of local residents. This is not a balanced approach.  If this Bill is enacted as proposed, there is a real risk of it being challenged before the European Court of Justice on the grounds that the current proposals do not achieve true functional separation as between the competent authority, namely, the CEO of the local authority, and the local residents via elected members on the council, which the competent authority will continue to serve, as CEO.  It is clear the Minister wishes to rush this Bill through the Houses. While the legislation has been delayed continuously, it still has an air of being rushed and hurried. This causes those of us on this side of the House to have concerns and suspicions. We are not happy with the Bill as drafted. We want the economy to grow and flourish. I want to see more jobs created at the airport. I also want to see more good jobs that are long term and will support families and local communities. Nobody wants to stand in the way of progress, including the local residents. As the Minister knows well, many of the residents objecting to the Bill have relatives or friends who work in the airport or work there themselves.  Nobody wants to see this done in the way the Minister is proposing. It will only lead to problems further down the line. It is fair to say that the relationship between the DAA and local people is not as good as it could be and faith in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is not as good as it should be. This Bill, with Fingal County Council as the designated noise monitor, does nothing to meet the concerns of local residents. To be honest, it looks like the closer alignment of two powerful local forces, both of which can be forces for great work and delivery in Fingal. However, based on what I have already outlined and on what others have said and will say later, there should not be another bridge in their relationship carried through with this Bill because there is no need.  I ask the Minister to listen and to change this Bill. I urge him to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to replace Fingal County Council as the competent authority. He could choose the CAR or the EPA as the alternative. He should not leave it to those of us on this side of the House to choose an alternative for him by way of amendment.

It has been six and a half years since I brought the Bill before the House. Is it not telling what the then Minister of State with responsibility, the former Deputy Brian Hayes of Fine Gael, told me? He said:[T]his issue must be examined carefully to ensure the solution proposed does not adversely affect the most vulnerable members of society. This will be the Government's main aim in considering the findings of the examination to be carried out by the Central Bank and by the officials of the Department of Finance.What has changed except the name of the Minister of State? This Fine Gael Government continues to look for time to examine this issue, but the answer is that it has had enough time and it is time to act. Let me provide some examples of why we must act. At that time, in 2012, we had the support of Fianna Fáil, Independents and, obviously, the Bill's sponsors, Sinn Féin. Unfortunately, however, Fine Gael and the Labour Party blocked the Bill. Licensed moneylenders continue to charge interest rates of 187% annual percentage rate, APR, such as Colm Keegan, Rossbro Financial, a company called Stalwart Investments or Provident Personal Credit, which is involved in an aggressive campaign targeting low-income and vulnerable individuals. These rates are despicable. They have no place in 2018 and they had no place in 2012, when I originally introduced the legislation. The Government has tabled an amendment but it is not about protecting the vulnerable or those low-income families. Rather, it is about protecting the moneylenders. I urge all parties to reject it. The Government knows well this law will not pass into being tonight if the Bill is allowed to pass Second Stage. We know it must undergo scrutiny and pass Committee and Report Stages, as well as all the Stages of the Seanad. It is time for us to do that scrutiny and preparation and begin this process of ensuring these astronomical rates are no longer charged by licensed moneylenders preying on vulnerable individuals. I pay tribute to the Social Finance Foundation and the Centre for Co-operative Studies at University College Cork, UCC, for putting this back on our agenda. Unfortunately, as Christmas approaches, this is a live issue for many every day. The report by the UCC academics cut to the chase of why we must act, when it leaves no doubt as to the economic reality of moneylending. The report said that it facilitates a considerable transfer of resources and potential assets from poor communities to the directors and shareholders of loan companies. Ireland is one of the few countries that still does not have a cap on high-cost lending. Germany's courts, for example, have struck down rates that were twice the market rent, in Finland a rate of 118% was deemed unconscionable, while in Spain a rate of 24% was deemed excessive. We do not have to look so far afield, however, because until 1933, our own legislation deemed a rate of 39% excessive, and allowed the courts to strike it down. Moneylending at these rates simply takes money from poor families and makes them poorer. We cannot allow another Christmas to come and go without action. I fully understand that there must be alternatives, but the credit union movement serves this country well, having done so for many years. It is prepared to expand its It Makes Sense loan scheme. As evidence of where people can save money by availing of these loans, a loan of €500 from It Makes Sense would cost an additional €15 to repay. In the case of these moneylenders, on the other hand, it will cost nearly €150 more. It Makes Sense is provided by a large number of credit unions. While the official number may appear to be dropping, that is only as a result of a number of mergers of credit unions. I urge all credit unions to take up the scheme. It was suggested by the Centre for Co-operative Studies and the Credit Union Advisory Committee, whose job is to review the Credit Union Act, that allowing a 2% cap instead of the current 1% monthly rate would encourage those credit unions which are reluctant to take up the scheme, which is an idea that could be considered. It is not a demand of the credit union movement but is worth examining. I would be happy to consider using this legislation to facilitate such a change if it was deemed helpful. It would be a choice for each credit union whether to utilise the extra space as it saw fit. The Bill is short but it has a profound effect on the 330,000 people who borrow from moneylenders. That is 7% of the entire population in the Twenty-six Counties. Section 1 relates to the APR chargeable on loans issued by moneylenders, and it provides that it shall not exceed 36%. That rate was chosen because it is three times the level that the credit union movement can charge and it keeps broadly in line with what existed in legislation passed by the House many years ago which deemed that 39% was excessive and which allowed the courts to find as such. Section 2 is simply the citation. It is straightforward legislation but it will help the 330,000 people who borrow from moneylenders. The amount of outstanding consumer loans is large, namely, €153 million, which is why we need to act. The borrowers caught in this trap are our neighbours, and predominantly women and people from low-income families. They are our family and friends. This year, the Irish League of Credit Unions found that more than a quarter, or 27%, of parents in debt said they have turned to a moneylender at back-to-school time in an effort to cope with the costs, which is a 20% increase from last year. All the research is clear that many people who use moneylenders do not look for other sources of credit. Some 70% of parents in debt have availed of other types of credit. They are attracted by the availability of this credit and many do not consider the APR rates that are being charged. For many people, this situation is getting worse and worse. The Central Bank has carried out a consultation and done valuable work considering regulations including restricting advertising, forcing moneylenders to provide more information and warnings and improving the professionalism of the people employed in the sector. That is all good work, but the Bill is complementary to it. The Central Bank's idea of adopting the Australian model of a cap based on the level of income misses the whole point. A cap needs to be applied to the interest rates that can be charged by the moneylenders. The Bill is the option before us, as it was in 2012. The Government proposes a 12-month wait, but what it means is that it has no intention of implementing a cap. It has had six and a half years to consider the issue, having blocked that Bill, but it is now trying to block it again with this manoeuvre.I am not sure whether Fianna Fáil is supporting the legislation. I do not know if Deputy Michael McGrath was here when I acknowledged that it supported this identical legislation in 2012 and I assume it will do so again tonight. There are things that need to be done as we progress with this Bill. Let us get on with it. I will not be accepting any further delay. We have waited long enough. The poorest families in the State have waited long enough. They are living week by week and many of them fear the knock on the door. Let us take action and ensure that this is the last Christmas that moneylenders will be licensed to charge these outrageous rates of 187% which, coupled with collection charges, increases to 287%.

At the time the Government turned down the legislation. I remember contributing to that debate at the time. One of the reasons the Government gave was the need to get more information on the consequences of bringing in an interest rate cap. We were told that there would be several unintended consequences which could flow from that. It would have to be examined more carefully and there was a commitment to do so. We are back six years later debating the legislation again and we are now being asked by the Government to postpone the reading of the legislation on Second Stage for a further 12 months. The Government has had six years to examine all of this. It is now looking for another 12 months. In its amendment to the motion the Government states that it needs time to examine "University College Cork's report, Interest Rate Restrictions on Credit for Low-income Borrowers, which was launched by the Social Finance Foundation (SFF)". That report was launched 12 months ago. It has been sitting in the Department of Finance for 12 months. If the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, has not studied it by now I do not have any confidence that he will study it within the next 12 months. I agree with my colleague that this is nothing but a fob. The Government has no interest in addressing this. It has not done it in six years and is not going to do it in another 12 months. It is a comprehensive report which I read this afternoon. It is not a very long report. It does not take 12 months to read and act upon. It refers to the issues which the Government highlighted six years ago that needed to be addressed, for instance, the unintended impacts of an interest rate regulation. It goes into detail in the report on that. It says there are eight unintended consequences which could flow from an interest rate cap. It even ranks them for the Minister of State: two are ranked as high impact, four are medium and two are low. It goes further. It tells the Minister of State how to address those unintended consequences to mitigate them or to eradicate them totally. It also makes eight recommendations. The report goes beyond that. It considers the reasons people engage with legal moneylenders, why they do not consider other credit sources, such as the credit union and various other low income borrowing sources, and it goes into great detail on that around the convenience of these moneylenders and the doorstepping – they arrive at the door and collect the money weekly and that is convenient. It even asks if they did not exist what would those individuals who currently access legal moneylenders do in substitution. It states 75% of them would go to their credit union or other similar credit providers. The report has been there for the past 12 months. I suggest that somebody in the Department reads it, takes on board the recommendations and gets on with this legislation. For the Government to sit on its hands for the next 12 months is not acceptable. I have no doubt but that in 12 months' time the Government will not act on this. I hope that Fianna Fáil and other parties reject the Government amendment and that the Bill is read a Second Time. If it is read a Second Time it should not engage in the carry on about money messages and try to hold it up on Committee Stage because that is not in the interests of the people that this Bill is trying to address. It is time for the Minister of State to get the finger out and take action. Six years have passed. We are not waiting another 12 months.

As we approach Christmas time, many families across the State are turning to these moneylending companies in order to ensure that their families, and in particular their children, have a special Christmas. This, however, is not something that is unique to the Christmas period. If the car breaks down or the washing machine needs to be replaced many are turning to moneylenders because the high cost of living means many families are living from pay cheque to pay cheque. Unfortunately, the huge interest rates charged by these organisations are driving people further and further into debt. I note that one moneylender based in south Dublin was given a moneylender's licence by the Central Bank in July that allows it to charge 287.72% interest, including collection charges. That is, quite frankly, disgusting. These companies, charging these disgraceful interest rates, are leeches. They are preying on the most vulnerable in society to line their own pockets. Who are the ones who get stuck in this cycle of debt? The research shows that it is mainly women from low income households and lone parents. Once again, working class women are bearing the brunt of this Government's inaction. There are plenty of other countries in the EU which have placed caps on moneylenders' rates. In fact, we are out of step when it comes to protecting the consumer here. We are one of only seven EU states that have allowed moneylenders to charge whatever they want with no cap. I hope Deputies from across this House will support this Bill and ensure that some controls are placed on these organisations which make profits from people in desperate situations.

They have resorted to legal and illegal moneylenders and have then, because there is somebody calling at the door, availed of another loan and another and they have ended up in a cycle of debt which they do not seem to be able to get out of. This happens in working class communities in particular but anybody who is dependent either on very low pay or social welfare ends up forgoing food and heating and their kids do not have proper clothes and the like. That is the background to this and the type of people in the main who avail of the scandal that is supposedly consumer credit. These are people who provide loans at an exorbitant rate.They are profiting from the misery of others and tying them in to an endless cycle of debt. Even with the cap suggested by my colleague, there is a viable business model for consumer credit companies which can still make a profit. In other countries where a cap has been imposed, such companies have succeeded. The Minister of State should think about how much profit they are making in the Irish market. I first asked this question back in the 1990s and have continued to ask it since. I praise my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, for being persistent and raising the issue again. It is an absolute disgrace that the Minister is seeking to delay the Bill. It will be delayed enough in going through the processes in this House and even if it is passed, it will probably not take effect until next Christmas. Rather than delay it until then, the Minister of State should withdraw his amendment and allow the Bill to proceed. There have been changes in the credit union movement in recent years, some of which are good, while others are atrocious. Many of those who availed of credit union loans in the past are now finding it more difficult to get them. Some minor measures have been introduced such as the It Makes Sense loan that are offered by credit unions, but not enough has been done to promote the credit union system. The Government should have invested a lot more in that aspect of the credit and banking system. I hope the Minister of State will not only take the Bill on board but that he will also deal with the credit union movement and encourage and support it in a more robust way than has been the case to date.

Moneylending is defined in and governed by the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended. The definition of moneylending contains two key elements, the first of which is that various activities are carried out away from the premises of the moneylender. These activities include the negotiation and conclusion of an agreement and the collection of payments. The second is that the total cost of credit is more than 23% annual percentage rate, APR. Earlier this year the Central Bank engaged in a public consultation process on a review of the consumer protection code for licensed moneylenders. I draw the attention of Deputies to this as it contains a lot of useful information that can inform our consideration of the issue. The paper shows that there are 350,000 customers of moneylending firms. It helpfully describes three types of moneylending firm. The first is home collection firms, where loans are issued and repayments collected at the consumer's home. The majority of moneylenders fall into this category. The second is firms operating a catalogue business model, where goods are sold by the moneylender on credit, which is operated on the basis of a consumer having a running account, while the third category is other firms. It is fair to say it is the first category that gives rise to the most concern. These are the firms we think of as traditional moneylenders and the paper states approximately 150,000 people are customers of home collection firms. Deputies will also be aware that the register of moneylenders which is available to the public on the Central Bank's website sets out details such as the maximum APR, the maximum cost of credit and the collection charge, if any, on the loans that can be offered by individual moneylenders. The register shows the maximum APR each firm is permitted to charge and the APR including the collection charge. It has been the subject of comment that the highest APR rates are 188.45% and 287.72%, including the collection charge. Less noticed is that the lowest APR rate is 24.3%. It is important to be aware that the Central Bank has licensed moneylenders for a range of APRs, rather than focusing only on the highest rates. The bank also points out that since assuming responsibility for the regulation of the sector in 2003, it has not permitted the maximum APR charged by each moneylender within the sector to increase, nor has it allowed practices such as pay-day lending to enter the Irish licensed moneylender market. It is important to bear in mind that the consumer protection code for licensed moneylenders provides several important protections for customers of licensed moneylenders. There are requirements in relation to advertising, warning consumers that the loans are high cost, issuing statements to consumers, knowing the customer and product suitability, rules for cold-calling and error resolution, complaint handling and record keeping, arrears handling and debt collection. In addition, the Consumer Credit Act 1995 also provides:A moneylending agreement shall be unenforceable against the borrower if it provides that the rate of charge for the credit may be increased or that any additional charge, other than legal costs, may apply in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement.As Deputy Pearse Doherty observed when introducing the Bill, the Central Bank did not go into the issue of a cap on the rates which may be charged. However, it did state one of the challenges we faced in considering rates charged by moneylenders was finding a balance between the availability of credit for consumers who did not have access to legitimate credit elsewhere or who did not use other regulated credit providers and the provision of short-term unsecured loans at what could be a high cost. It observed that for small amounts of credit and those consumers with an impaired credit history, there might be limited alternative credit options available to them. It made it clear in the consultation paper:Lower interest rate ceilings could therefore be ineffective and counterproductive and could result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity from regulated lending, even at the high APRs charged by licensed moneylenders. Consequently, were lower interest rate ceilings introduced, there could be a risk that consumers would not view other regulated lenders as an alternative form of finance, but instead seek to avail of credit from unlicensed moneylenders.I understand that in 2019 the bank expects to finalise and publish regulations under section 48 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to replace the existing code. That sets the regulatory framework in which moneylenders operate. Let us look at the report prepared by UCC on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation on interest rate restrictions. The purpose of the research was to examine the extent and variety of interest rate restrictions within the European Union and beyond, with a view to assessing the appropriateness of introducing restrictions in the Irish market, given its specific circumstances and financial environment. The report acknowledged that a restriction on interest rates would force existing moneylending firms to re-examine their business models and that this was likely to result in some people no longer being able to access credit from moneylenders. The report states the personal micro credit scheme offered by some credit unions is emerging as a credible and affordable alternative for social welfare recipients. It includes three key recommendations, the first of which is that the Government introduce restrictions on interest rates for moneylenders. The second, which is crucial in the context of the proposed Bill, is that the restrictions be conditional on the credit union movement committing to and being enabled to serve the community currently serviced by the moneylending firms, subject to adherence to prudent credit guidelines. The third is that, in consultation with the credit union sector, the Department of Finance consider increasing the 1% monthly cap on interest rates for credit unions for this type of lending to cater for its significantly greater cost. Looking at the credit union charge, section 38(1)(a) of the Credit Union Act 1997 prescribes that the interest rate on a credit union loan shall not at any time exceed 1% per month. Any change to this primary legislation is a matter for the Minister for Finance, the Government and the Oireachtas. As the Deputy may be aware, the interest rate ceiling on credit union loans has been subject to recent discussion in a number of fora. The Credit Union Advisory Committee, CUAC, the statutory committee, the function of which is to advise the Minister for Finance on matters related to credit unions, published a policy paper on this issue in December 2017 following a survey of credit unions. In its policy paper on the loan interest rate cap the CUAC recommended that credit unions be permitted to charge an interest rate on loans greater than the current ceiling of 1% per month and proposed that the cap be raised to 2% per month. This change would provide credit unions with greater flexibility to risk-price loan products and in so doing might create an opportunity for new product offerings.It is important to note that CUAC's recommendation to increase the loan interest rate ceiling would not mean that credit unions are required to raise their loan interest rates; rather, they could apply their own interest rates within the parameters allowed. The policy paper is available on my Department's website. Second, the CUAC report implementation group, a group established to oversee and monitor the implementation of recommendations from the CUAC report, has also considered the issue of increasing the interest rate cap, as recommended in the CUAC policy paper. This group is chaired by the Department of Finance and is made up of one member from each of the credit union representative bodies - the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association, the Credit Union Managers Association and the National Supervisors Forum, as well as a member from the Central Bank. The implementation group is currently in the process of finalising its final report, which will be published shortly. Following publication of the final report, I will review the implementation group's recommendation on the loan interest cap, along with the CUAC recommendation already received, and consider if any legislative changes are required while bearing in mind the recommendation of the UCC report. It would be wrong not to consider the other two recommendations together since one is dependent on the other. The report is very clear that interest rate restrictions should be conditional on the credit union movement being able to serve the community currently serviced by the moneylending sector. As the report acknowledges, the personal micro credit, PMC, scheme and the It Makes Sense loan are steps in the right direction. However, only 50% of the credit unions in the country currently participate in the scheme, and the percentage varies from county to country. From discussions with the Social Finance Foundation subsequent to the publication of this Bill, it is clear that an APR of 36% for home credit customers would likely make the home credit business model unprofitable, resulting in the probable exit of many, if not all, moneylenders from this market. The interest rate restrictions report and Social Finance Foundation are explicit that this must only be considered when there is confidence that an alternative mechanism exists. As we have seen, the credit union option is not yet sufficiently widespread to be a viable nationwide alternative. Based on the information in the Central Bank consultation paper, approximately 75,000 customers of the 150,000 customers of home collection moneylenders could be left without access to credit. It would probably be even higher if people on low incomes who cannot access the PMC scheme are taken into account. Would this mean they turn to illegal moneylenders or would they just do without? We do not know the answer to this question but it should be a serious concern to everyone. Even if the numbers turning to illegal moneylenders is a small proportion, let us say 10%, this legislation would result in forcing 7,500 people into the clutches of these criminals.

I consider it worthwhile to detail some of the work that needs to be undertaken before we take this option. We need to consider how to persuade the other approximately 50% of credit unions to take part in the PMC scheme, given it is crucial we have a truly nationwide scheme available and we currently do not. We also need to consider how to cater for individuals on low incomes who are not social welfare customers since the PMC scheme only works for social welfare recipients. We need to analyse the sector in more detail to see the impact that setting interest rate restrictions is likely to have on the various types of moneylenders. We need to examine illegal moneylending as far as we can. I was not in this position six years ago. The Deputy's criticism is fair and it is a valid point that this should have been dealt with a lot sooner. The Deputy knows if I give a commitment, I will stand by it. I will look at this to try to improve the sector. While I cannot promise we will be able to do it in the timeframe suggested by the Deputy, nonetheless, I give that commitment.

As has been said, however, licensed moneylenders and the services they offer are used throughout the year. We need to do far better in this area. The Minister of State needs to accelerate the reforms and all of the steps he believes need to happen before he would consider the type of change proposed in this legislation. I have thought about this issue carefully. I have read the report and I acknowledge what it says in regard to the other measures the Minister of State needs to bring forward before bringing in such a cap. On balance, it is our view that this Bill should proceed to the finance committee and it should pass Second Stage today. The Bill would benefit from the normal scrutiny. We should take the opportunity, as a committee, to bring in some of these moneylenders, such as Provident, as well as MABS and the Social Finance Foundation, and to hear the different perspectives. We believe that, in principle, there should be a cap. The rates being charged are exorbitant and the reality is people are using these services for a number of reasons, in particular convenience. Given somebody is calling to the door with the cash, it is easy and straightforward, but it is horrendously expensive. People are also using licensed moneylenders because of the lack of an alternative. The Minister of State spoke about the credit unions and the personal micro credit scheme. The figure of 47% for the percentage of credit unions participating in the scheme is not good enough. The Minister of State needs to ask and very quickly answer the question as to why that is the case. I know from talking to credit unions directly that the issue is the cost of administration. These are small loans. Because of the burden of regulation, the amount of staff time involved and the small amounts being repaid, we cannot expect them to do this at a loss. The Minister of State needs to sit down very soon with the credit union movement, the Central Bank and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in regard to the personal micro credit scheme. It has to be a priority to get full coverage across the country. If it means accepting the recommendations from the Credit Union Advisory Committee about increasing the monthly cap to 2%, perhaps that is what needs to be done. It is something we are seriously prepared to consider supporting if it results in this scheme reaching full coverage throughout the country, with the result that we can direct a lot of the business currently being done with licensed moneylenders into the credit union movement. Credit unions are the answer. However, the reality is that because of the one-size-fits-all approach to regulation which is being applied to them, many are struggling to adapt to the new reality and to the burden of regulation. The movement is making great strides to modernise, bring in new services, invest in technology and improve governance, but it needs help. A strong message to the Minister of State is that the personal micro credit scheme is not good enough when fewer than half the credit unions are rolling it out at present. The Minister of State quoted from the report which has been highlighted a number of times in the debate. I join with others in complimenting the work of the centre for co-operative studies in UCC, and in particular Mary Faherty, Olive McCarthy and Noreen Byrne, who completed this report on behalf of the Social Finance Foundation. It examines interest rate restrictions on credit for low-income borrowers and is a very comprehensive report of 114 pages. The Minister of State is correct when he says the report states:The introduction of any interest rate restriction regime requires an accompanying infrastructure that will serve as the mainstream alternative to the moneylending sources of credit. The overall remit of policy, legislation and regulation should be to encourage and support existing alternatives, such as credit unions, including their PMC loan scheme, which are currently the only and practical alternative. Any interest rate restriction regime should be coupled with a limit on other fees and charges and a limit on the total cost of credit, with the rules carefully designed to avoid circumvention through the introduction of other ‘innovative’ fees and charges. That is one example of where the Bill can benefit from scrutiny. Just introducing an interest rate cap and leaving the door open to these moneylenders to increase dramatically the collection charges will not have the desired effect.It is an issue which needs to be examined. I note the collection charges some moneylenders impose. Marlboro Trust DAC imposes a maximum collection charge of 14 cent in the euro and Jordan Estates imposes a charge of ten cent in the euro. While some are lower, Provident has no collection charge but its APR is 187.2%, which is remarkable. In reality, those who are stuck and need money for Christmas, a holy communion or other special family occasion or to deal with an emergency in the family are desperate and will avail of credit at these rates. The difference might be an extra fiver or tenner a week, which people do not see as a huge extra when they are faced with desperate circumstances. However, over the course of 26 or 52 weeks, it adds up to a very substantial interest burden. I highlight a few other issues. When one considers what licensed and illegal moneylenders are doing, one notes the security risk imposed by the amount of cash people are going around with. There is no limit whatsoever on the quantum of cash staff working for moneylenders can have in their vehicles or on their persons as they go from house to house. That creates an obvious risk for the staff but when I have raised the matter by way of parliamentary question, the Government's response has been that it is a health and safety issue for the company whose duty it is to protect employees by putting security measures in place. That is not good enough. Further, there is currently no limit to the number of loans any individual can have out with moneylenders at any point in time. A person could have multiple loans at the same time either with the same moneylender or different ones. It exposes that person to an unacceptable scenario and an unacceptable level of dependence. While the code states that moneylenders may not offer unsolicited pre-approved credit facilities, I have spoken to people who have worked in the area and say the provision is being flouted left, right and centre. It is done in person when staff are collecting repayments on a loan which is coming to an end. They offer a further pre-approved and unsolicited facility. There is no doubt that is happening and it would be useful to know what level of enforcement of the rules the Central Bank undertakes. We did not have the advantage of having the Minister of State's script circulated but I tried to listen closely to what he was saying about the initiatives and review under way. To be frank, they are not enough and I do not have confidence they will be speedy enough. For that reason, Fianna Fáil will support the Bill tomorrow and will not agree to defer Second Stage for 12 months. None of us wants to see a situation in which people are forced into the hands of illegal moneylenders. The Minister of State highlighted that concern and it is a genuine one. People who need money will get it from somewhere. If they are completely desperate, they may well turn to illegal moneylenders in the absence of licensed moneylenders or credit unions being in a position to lend. It is a danger we must examine by way of pre-legislative scrutiny in circumstances in which the illegal sector is without control and unregulated. We have no handle on the scale or extent of it but we know it is prevalent, in particular in disadvantaged communities and especially in the cities. As a party, Fianna Fáil takes the view that urgent reforms are necessary. The Bill forms a very good basis on which to examine the issue closely and effect change. That is what we want to see. It is unacceptable that no cap is in place. The Minister of State gave a reply which has been provided in reply to parliamentary questions previously. He said the licence issued to the moneylender sets out the maximum the moneylender is permitted to charge and includes details of duration, maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and the collection charge, if any, which can be imposed. However, there is nothing in legislation and there is no cap in the Consumer Credit Act as things stand. That is why the amendment has been tabled. There is a cap on credit union lending, yet we have no cap for moneylenders who are charging interest rates at APRs, including the collection charge, of well over 200%. In fact, I see from the list on the register that rates of close to 300% have been imposed. It is outrageous. We must try to establish why so much business is being done in this sector. When one looks at the figures, it is hard to believe so much business is being done with licensed moneylenders. It is big business and it is very profitable. While the credit risk and overheads are high in what is a labour intensive business, we must do more to bring about greater choice and improve and make more accessible the available alternatives. It is simply not on that our citizens are paying up to 300% APR in respect of loans they take out at what, in very many cases, are points of crisis. They are being exploited and taken advantage of. The State, the regulator, the Government and the House must act. That is my message to the Minister of State. We will support the Bill proceeding to the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and look forward to engaging fully in pre-legislative scrutiny and the making of changes in this area.

I spoke earlier this evening to Deputy Pearse Doherty and am glad Fianna Fáil is supporting the legislation as a party. It is extremely sad that in the run-up to Christmas, there are people in every small and large town who tonight and in the coming days will take out small loans to cover certain expenses. They will pay very dearly for those loans. I have come across a number of situations over the years which have involved these moneylenders. Moneylenders do not give out money for the good of their health. They are out to make money. We must look after people who are in very difficult circumstances and who are sometimes afraid to speak out. They may quietly make contact with an illegal moneylender and take out a loan for family reasons. In recent months, I came across a person who borrowed €600 with an APR of 187%. It is extraordinary. I have the facts of the case. In other cases, I have seen people paying out 80% or 90% interest on those loans. We must get back to ensuring credit unions can look after those people. In some areas, credit unions which could once have looked after people locally face increasingly complicated circumstances. The administrative burden imposed on them by the State and the Central Bank is definitely causing difficulties and people are suffering. It is unacceptable that we cannot bring this issue under control as legislators. This type of lending is widespread, in particular at this time of year. It is a type of predatory lending. It is illegal and the people involved are predators. I recall speaking to someone a few months ago about the experience she had some years ago when she encountered family difficulties. She had four children. She had to get a loan from one of the loan sharks but ran into difficulty even though the repayment was only £10 a week.It might seem a small sum but it was enormous for that lady. While those moneylenders did not threaten the woman with violence, they turned up every single evening, day after day, week after week, month after month. It was mainly her kids who answered the door. The moneylenders would ask repeatedly whether their mother was in. The kids witnessed all of this on the doorstep. That is appalling intimidation. That woman was afraid to go into her credit union or her bank. We were able to get something done for that particular person. We put her on the right track and on the right road. We got her out of a very difficult situation. There is example after example of similar cases all over the place. Loan sharks use blackmail constantly to frighten people. Some loan sharks threaten violence on people if they fall into difficulty with a loan. We cannot have that happening to any of our citizens. I could give the Minister of State many more examples of cases I have come across both since I became a Deputy and when I was a member of the local authority. It is really important that we support Bills being brought forward such as this one this evening. I hope the Government will co-operate with it. We should pursue this vigorously because this type of situation should not have to go on month after month and year after year before being solved. It should be solved in a matter of months at most because, as I said, people are constantly suffering out there. Coming into January and February there will be people unknown to us scurrying around the place trying to pay off those moneylenders. They will be paying exorbitant rates of interest. These are usually the type of loan sharks who call to one's door offering credit or who offer credit over the telephone. If people were to think about that they would realise it is not really the normal way in which credit is offered. People should be really wary of individuals who call to their doorsteps. Of course if they get a person in once they will keep coming back. There are poor families in this country who have been caught in this web year after year and who have suffered a lot of financial hardship because of that.  Sometimes we do not think of the little things but I know of a woman who, in the very recent past, had to borrow in excess of €3,000 to pay for the cost of a funeral. We abolished the funeral grant because people in authority did not think people used it any more. She did not get help off the welfare officer. As I said, the funeral grant, as it was known, was withdrawn. That put enormous stress and strain on that family. Unfortunately, there were issues within that family and there was no money. That happens. That is the reality of life. Not everyone on this earth is as lucky as some. Those situations exist and they are very real and very challenging. Most people who use those types of moneylenders are afraid and ashamed to talk about their situation. They are even ashamed to talk to their politicians about it. I believe it is getting harder for credit unions to give loans to some of those people. From what I know and from what I would have been involved in, in the past credit unions were the saviours for many of those people.  I know the Minister of State means well. I urge him to withdraw the amendment, to support the Bill, and to let this go forward as quickly as possible.

We are having this debate at 10.30 p.m. and it is supposed to finish at 11.30 p.m. It is almost like a dirty secret. I do not know about the rest of the Deputies but I think it is embarrassing that this practice is still going on in 21st century Ireland and that people are being forced to go to moneylenders and, in some cases, illegal moneylenders to try and get a loan. Like other speakers tonight, I also spoke on Deputy Doherty's Bill back in 2012. I pointed out the urgency of the Bill and yet here we are, six years later. I am sitting here tonight thinking about the number of families that have been destroyed in that six-year period. I do not know about the Ministers of State, but I know of many families that have been caught up in this situation. Strangely enough, some of them probably would not thank us for putting forward this legislation because they see these moneylenders as a last resort and do not see an alternative. However, six years later the exorbitant rates moneylenders are allowed charge still go unchecked. Under the current arrangement moneylenders are allowed to charge up to 287% APR. We know the people who go to these lenders. It is the desperate, the poor and credit-starved individuals who are out of their minds with money worries who are forced to use moneylenders. I do not think anyone who has an alternative goes to them. Many of these people are out of work. They are the low-paid, the marginalised, the disadvantaged, and those who have little or really bad credit. As we heard earlier, most of them are women. Despite the recovery, the so-called moneylenders are booming. Their exorbitant interest rates need to be regulated and targeted now. I welcome the fact that Fianna Fáil is supporting the Bill's progress. Moneylenders' interest rates need to be capped as soon as possible to stop the misery they are causing people. That is what this Bill is about. These loans keep people in a cycle of poverty. For many it is a way of life. That is the sad thing. The people who are pushed into using these moneylenders are cash-poor. They have to borrow for joyous occasions as well as for sad occasions. We know of the weddings, births and communions but, as we have heard, they also have to borrow for deaths or for crises in the family such as a family member getting sick. In some cases they even borrow for simple things like medication. Many take out loans because their children are under pressure in their communities. We all know about this. Some children cannot afford the trainers or the clothes and get slagged in the school. All parents want the very best for their children. Second-best hand-me-downs, particularly coming up to special times such as Christmas, are not an option for many. They do not want to tell the kids they cannot afford a pair of shoes or football boots. The common denominator in many of these families is guilt. They feel guilty that they have not been able to provide on a more regular basis for their children. People spoke about the credit union. Its school survey revealed that one third of those surveyed were getting into debt to meet rising back-to-school costs. The survey suggested that the average cost of sending a single child back to school is now €999 for a primary school pupil and €1,379 for a child in secondary school. How are parents on the average industrial wage, a low wage, or less than the living wage supposed to pay for this? The alternative they see is going to these moneylenders. We are straight after September when kids go back to school and now we are into Christmas and the pressure it puts on families. This time of the year is filled with worry and stress for the poor and the vulnerable. We cannot just hope that people will not use these moneylenders. We need to act and to regulate them. That is only part of the solution; we have to have alternative routes.Some of them were mentioned tonight. One of them is the credit union movement, which has 255 branches across the State. They are in a perfect position to provide small loans for people. That needs to be publicised. There is the micro credit loan or the new "It Makes Sense Loan" from the credit union which offers small loans and much lower interest rates to borrowers. There is a wide coverage for these loans but it is not available across all credit unions. These loans have a maximum interest rate of 12%, and the loans offered are under €2,000. They are specifically aimed at those in receipt of social welfare. Householders need to know that they will be protected against unscrupulous moneylenders and that fairer alternatives are in place. We must also address the issue of illegal moneylenders from whom the poor and vulnerable seek to borrow, which may not been touched on. When was the last time we read of an illegal moneylender being charged and convicted before the courts? I could bring the Minister of State to many a post office in my constituency, and he would probably find them in his own area, where moneylenders operate. They are not outside the post office but have their agents outside them. Some of them are also drug dealers and they collect money. They hand out cards and books to people on their way into the post office to collect their welfare payments and collect money from them on their way out. It should not be too difficult for the Garda to follow up on that activity. I know of people who have been violently attacked because they have not been able to make the massive repayments due. People who have information about illegal moneylenders should make it available to the Garda so that a conviction can be pursued, but it is difficult for people to give evidence in those cases. Cameras are installed outside post offices and perhaps there should be further monitoring. We should be proactive in closing down such activity. We need to act on foot of this Bill. It not good enough to be acting on it six years after it was originally introduced. There is a responsibility on us to act. This is an embarrassment. We do not talk about this issue when we go abroad. It is not something of which we as legislators should be proud. Nobody in this State should be proud of the fact that people are paying up to 287% in interest rates to illegal moneylenders. It is wrong and it must stop, and it should stop from tonight.

It is clear where and the way in which this issue has the most impact in our society. The main people who will deal with these moneylenders are women because they are the ones who sort out the household budget. Often it is around the managing of that budget that much of this borrowing takes place. Women borrow to purchase a new washing machine when the old one breaks down or the car breaks down or a child is going to college or they need to get a deposit for a house. The moneylender steps in to cover those expenses. We have been commemorating suffrage and the fact women got their rights one hundred years ago. Economic independence for women is something Countess Markievicz and those people at that time wanted to establish. That is what missing in all of this. What we are talking about here is a debt trap but really it is a poverty trap. It is people in poverty who end up in these situations. They may not even think they are in poverty. They are people who have decent jobs but cannot make ends meet because of the high cost of living in our society. We debated a Bill on the high cost of rents and evictions earlier. All of these elements are interconnected. Many people who have work are in precarious employment but have very low incomes. All of that is incurring a cost for our society. There is a cost to poverty. There is interest on poverty. There is almost a compounding of poverty. That is what happens in these situations. If a family is short of money, the parents, for example, will not be able to send their child to a dental practice for dental hygiene. The child will then develop a problem with their teeth and will have to go to a hygienist and then to an orthodontist, but where will the family get the money to cover the cost involved in such dental care? Many of these people are just one crisis away from everything going up in smoke. They are under a great degree of pressure, including mental health pressure. They know that in the small community in the housing estate in which they live, every Thursday evening there is somebody who goes around door to door collecting money and offering a loan. It is an easy opt-out and they take it. The moneylender comes back again six months later and offers the person a loan for something else. People get into this trap and they cannot get out of it. They become smothered by it. People in abusive relationships, and again it is mainly women, are vulnerable. The husband may be drinking and his wife cannot get money when a crisis arises and moneylenders feed on that. They target that. They can smell it and they go for it. It is absolute greed. There cannot be any excuse not to accept this Bill or to kick it down the road for a while. I concur with the Minister of State that he is genuine about addressing this issue but it should not be deferred for a year. If it was his mother or sister who was in this situation, would he leave addressing this issue for a year? I think not. That is what we need to realise. One hundred years ago women went out and said that they wanted economic independence, a better future for their daughters and granddaughters, and now their granddaughters are in this situation today and the Government is saying it will leave addressing this issue for a little while. It has been left long enough. The essence of this issue is that poverty has become a policy. If poverty is the policy, then that policy is driving those people who make their money on poverty. That is what is at the core of all of this. The compounding of poverty, interest and debt on a sector of society that is at the bottom and kept at the bottom must change. While we are dealing with the specific issue of the interest rates and how these people are doing this, it is connected to all the rest of it. There is a charge against the Minister of State's Government because we are dealing with this issue. We should not have to be dealing with it because these moneylenders should have no market for the product they sell. That is the reality. If we had a society that was functioning properly, there would be no market for this. The credit unions are part of the answer and we know that but the problem here is the problem of poverty. While we know we will always have a certain level of that, unfortunately, we have far too much of it. The rest of the people who sit around the Cabinet table who deal with issues of income disparity, the housing crisis, the hospital crisis, the healthcare crisis and all such matters feed into all of this for the people who are struggling the most. It is all a reflection of all of that. The issue at stake is greater than the one we are discussing tonight, but what we are discussing now must be brought into focus. We cannot continue to kick this down the road or to avoid it. Reports will appear while the Bill is going through Committee Stage and being dealt with properly. I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to us. It is clear that the Bill will pass. Fianna Fáil will support the Bill and we support it. I expect the vast majority of the House will support it. For the sake of the people who are suffering, it is only right for the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment and support the Bill.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	483	I usually do not make a request until the end of my speech but I urge the Minister of State to withdraw his amendment. As Deputy Martin Kenny said, the amendment will not be accepted anyway as the Government will not have enough support. The reason I ask is because I want to take a different angle on tonight’s debate. I congratulate Deputy Pearse Doherty on introducing the Bill. Poverty and debt and the compounding of poverty through debt are literally killing people. I want to talk about the effect debt is having on mental health and the need to regulate to mitigate that effect. The real response however is to eradicate poverty. That is Sinn Féin’s objective and should be the objective of any Government or confidence and supply agreement worth its salt. According to Mental Health Ireland, debt can be a considerable burden. It can cause anxiety and seriously affect our sleep, which has many knock-on effects. It can affect our mood and energy levels and many other areas of life such as family and career. Mental Health Ireland notes that all of these things can in turn contribute to a person's debt problem, so the cycle continues and worsens. Ireland clearly has a serious problem with debt. The root cause of this problem is the poverty which is going unchecked by this Government and the inability to provide affordable housing and other basic services. Poverty destroys people's mental health. Last year, a Samaritans report found that inequality was driving people to suicide. We all know that poverty was the real issue. In turn, through a destructive mix of poverty, debt and mental ill health, whole families and communities are being torn apart. Research on poverty and mental health has found that suicide rates in Ireland are two times higher in the most deprived areas than in the less deprived areas. Low paid workers have higher rates of suicide. People who are unemployed are two to three times more likely to die by suicide than those in employment. Working class men, living in the most deprived areas, are up to ten times more at risk of suicide than those in the highest social class, living in the most affluent areas. As the director of Samaritans Ireland, Deirdre Toner said, each suicide statistic represents a person. An employee on a zero hour contract is somebody's parent or child. A person at risk of losing his or her home may be a sibling or friend and each one of them will leave others devastated and potentially more disadvantaged if they take their own lives. Last week, a report in England found serious links between poverty, debt and suicide. It showed more than 100,000 people a year in England tried to take their lives due to debt. The severity of the behaviour and the policies of the lenders and their debt collectors was also noted, as was the major impact on the mental health outcome of those who sought to borrow. Many of those in debt and experiencing anxiety, depression or suicidal ideation had borrowed to keep up with essential utility payments and rent. I know that this is very similar to what is going on in this country. We know that the same parasitic vultures operate here, many being British companies. Families all over the country are running up small debts with big interest rates that could be their undoing. They are not doing this out of greed but to have a nice Christmas, put a turkey in the oven and have a few nice presents under the tree for their children. These are not things for which the punishment should be more hardship. If the law does not protect these families, then it is worth nothing. If our society, economy and Governments continue to create these conditions, then they are worth very little. This is a simple Bill. It will cap interest rates at 36% APR, which still sounds like a lot. We are dealing with the kind of unscrupulous companies which can charge nearly 300% APR and a Government that has allowed them to do it. I ask the Minister of State again please to support this Bill and give peace of mind to those facing debts this Christmas and in 2019.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-12-12 00:00:00	Estimates for Public Services 2018: Message from Select Committee	484	As previously said, it is very useful to have this debate. I have listened carefully to everything that has been said. In an ideal world, no one would have to pay the extremely high rates of interest charged by moneylenders. Others have said that the only thing worse than high interest credit is no access to credit at all. I argue that forcing people who are at a point of crisis, as Deputy Michael McGrath rightly described them, to avail of illegal moneylending is an even worse scenario. We will press the amendment because it will give the Department time to consider and evaluate the interest rate restrictions report and consult with others to have an evidence-based approach to the development of public policy on moneylenders. In considering that policy, we will not separate the recommendation that rates be restricted from the proviso that these restrictions are to be conditional on there being a reliable alternative to licensed moneylenders. Key to that is getting the credit union movement to commit to serve the community currently serviced by money lending firms, subject to adherence to prudent credit guidelines. As said in the opening speech of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, the work that needs to be done in this regard includes considering how we will persuade the approximately 50% of other credit unions to take part in the personal microcredit, PMC, scheme and how we will cater for individuals on low incomes who are not social welfare customers, since that PMC scheme only works for social welfare recipients. We need to analyse the sector in more detail to see the impact that setting interest rate restrictions is likely to have on the various types of moneylenders and to examine illegal moneylending as well as we can. The Social Finance Foundation, which has been identified by Deputy Pearse Doherty as a source of his motivation in bringing forward this Bill, has told us that it would be premature to fix an interest rate for moneylenders in advance of this work being concluded. We are not convinced that a fixed rate cap is the only answer available to us. It is a blunt approach to a highly nuanced issue. I appreciate that we are considering the principle of the Bill and that the justification for the rate could be considered later. Putting a fixed rate in primary legislation means that it can only be amended by primary legislation. While Deputy Doherty's proposal is succinct and clear, the situation in real life with regard to what people have to deal with daily is much more complex and worthy of more detailed consideration before we proceed further. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has said that he acknowledges that there is a problem which needs to be addressed and that he will act with urgency in arriving at a solution that works in everyone's interest.

I am disappointed that the Minister of State is pressing his amendment. He will not win that. He will call a division on something he will not win. Fianna Fáil has indicated its support for the Bill. With the Sinn Féin votes, Fianna Fáil votes and those of others which I am sure there will be, the Government will be defeated. The Minister of State says the Government needs time to address this. My colleagues brought forward this legislation in 2012. Fine Gael has been in government for seven years and has not addressed this legislation at all. I wanted to talk about some technical matters relating to the Bill but will not do that now because I want to talk about the people affected by this. Deputy Crowe referred to people in his constituency in the local post offices. That can be seen in my constituency too. One can see people, mostly women, who are outside the post offices at the time to collect their payments. The book is handed out to them. It is ongoing. Gardaí know about this. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of it. They come into my constituency office and tell me. We have legal moneylenders and illegal moneylenders, and a situation where very vulnerable families are very close to a crisis. Many might get themselves into a crisis which they cannot get out of. The moneylender then comes again. Some people may not have been educated as most of us have been. They do not understand interest rates or how they work. They have a bill to pay and Christmas is coming, a First Communion is coming, or there has been a death in the family and somebody comes and makes it seem easy to borrow money, and the family does not realise the extent of what they will be paying back. The Minister of State should reconsider his amendment. There is no point in him pressing it. He will be defeated in a division. I do not know why he would do that. He can press his amendment but he will be defeated and that is pretty pointless. I want to express my concern about Deputies from different parties who have not turned up. I understand it is a Private Members' Bill but moneylending affects all of us. I am sure it arises in every constituency office across the State. The Labour Party voted against this in 2012. One would think that they would have had some contrition since then, would have come in, made amends and spoken in support of the Bill. Hopefully they will vote for it when the Minister of State presses his amendment. I want to talk about the credit union It Makes Sense loan. It is a loan specifically aimed at those in receipt of social welfare payments. It is available in participating credit unions across the country, including many in my constituency in Limerick. When this loan was initially launched, I contacted all the credit unions in my constituency and urged them to do it. Many took it up. Others could not do it, as was referred to earlier, due to the documentation they have to complete and the lack of return they get for it. I encourage every credit union across the State to participate in the loan scheme.Credit unions are the backbone of many local communities and the first point of call for people who are in financial distress. These small loans, which are provided at affordable rates in comparison with the loans provided by rip-off moneylenders operating across the State, legal and illegal, have the potential to tackle moneylenders. For example, for a loan of €500 repayable over six months a moneylender might charge almost ten times as much in interest as a credit union. In this regard, a borrower can save more than €134 or €5 per week on a credit union loan in comparison with a loan from a moneylender, legal or illegal. According to the credit unions moneylending is worse at back-to-school time in particular. Escalating school costs are causing more than one quarter of parents to get into debt as they resort to moneylenders to purchase basic items to enable their children to return to school.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, should be ashamed of himself that he proposes to press his amendment. I again appeal to him to withdraw it. Once again he is failing the vulnerable people in our society. As Deputy Pearse Doherty explained, the amendment is not about protecting the vulnerable, it is about protecting the moneylenders. I urge the Minister to withdraw his amendment and to support the Bill.

I acknowledge all of the contributions to this debate and I welcome the support which Fianna Fáil has pledged to the Bill and its opposition to the Government's stalling amendment. As I said in my opening remarks, six and a half years is sufficient time to consider this issue. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has asked for another year to analyse a report which he has had for a year. Even if the report had never been published, we as legislators know the issue in terms of the fleecing of customers that is happening in every part of our communities, most particularly in those that are economically disadvantaged and deprived. This is not a secret. The issue has been debated in this House in the past and it has been raised continually in terms of access to credit yet the Minister of State argues that he needs more time. Organisations such as FLAC, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others have told us time and again, as if we needed to be told in the first instance, that the rate of 187% interest being charged on loans, primarily targeted at low income families and females, particularly single mothers, is extortionate. This is not just about the interest rates. The practices that surround some of this moneylending are not acceptable. It is notable from all of the studies that have been produced that for many of those trapped in this cycle of loans the practice is inter-generational in that children are borrowing from the same loan shark as their mothers and grandmothers. This is the reality. One loan rolls over to another and so on and while money lenders are not supposed to provide unsolicited loans this is what happens. Neither are they supposed to sell other goods but that is what happens. The books are full of these types of activities.  I had the unique opportunity to look under the bonnet of one of these prominent loan sharks, Provident. I did so because five people who worked for Provident - although not directly because Provident organises its staff in a way that they are self employed - had provided me with a huge amount of documentation which showed the illegal activities that were going on within that moneylender, licensed by this State. These were activities that preyed on vulnerable people and provided for roll-up of loans. There were also serious issues in terms of documentation, including identifying documentation. It was clear that the practice that existed in Donegal was widespread across the country. In 2013, I brought that information to the Central Bank and following an investigation by the bank it found against the company and fined it the miserly sum of €110,000. All five individuals lost their positions as a result of that investigation. This type of practice continues. What we learned from the documentation is that this practice is based on aggressive lending and target-led bonus schemes and this is why these loans are being pressed on individuals.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, needs to read his brief. Nobody is forcing anybody into the hands of moneylenders. If one looks to what happened across the water in terms of the restriction on pay-day lending, it is clearly stated in the report, which the Minister of State would know if he had read it, that there is no evidence that anybody accessed illegal money lending as a result of that provision. He would also know that the vast majority of people suggested that they would access credit from elsewhere, including the credit unions and other sources that are legal. If the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, is so concerned about illegal moneylending, let us beef up the prosecutions in that regard. When I introduced this Bill in 2012 not one illegal moneylender had been prosecuted. There has been a number of investigations since but the action is pitiful in terms of what is happening in our society. This Bill makes sense. It is about protecting people. It challenges the Government to stop protecting the vested interests in terms of moneylending. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have previously used the phrases rip-off lending and fleecing and said that this is not acceptable. It is extortionate. Now is the time to act. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to withdraw the amendment. It is not fair and it is not right. We know what is happening. We have a duty in this House to protect vulnerable people from being preyed on by this industry. Now is the time to act.  I commend those members who supported this legislation. I am disappointed with the Government benches for proposing this stalling mechanism six and a half years after this Bill was originally voted down by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.
