          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">In view of the recent massive mountain landslide at Pullathomas/Glendad, County Mayo, which has led to the destruction of homes and property as well as infrastructure and the evacuation of families from their homes, the need for the Office of Public Works to put in place a compensation package for the families affected and the necessary finance for the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Finance to publish the interdepartmental report on disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) (regulations) scheme, which was commissioned five years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Defence to give the up to date position regarding plans for the military barracks at Castlebar, County Mayo, and the reason the usage of the barracks appears to be substantially less this year than in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to make a statement in relation to investment in the arts, following cutbacks which amounted to €4 million overall in the last budget, in light of the continuing negative impact of such cuts on performing companies and the communities they serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The urgent need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that a rehabilitation plan for old mine sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary, is agreed and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report on the imminent closure of the Treasure Tots nursery operated by the child care community business in Le Fanu House, Ballyfermot, due to the inordinate delay in processing its grant application lodged in November 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators Higgins, Henry and Tuffy to be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Bannon, O'Meara and Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I congratulate the Labour Party on an excellent Private Members' motion tonight, which my party will support, on public transport in Dublin. The Leader has circulated an amendment to the motion which is interesting. She suggests that she endorses the progress made in providing a light rail system in Dublin, which appears to run counter to her stated views on the subject. I understand the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is currently on something of a work to rule when it comes to the Seanad. Has he been found for tonight's debate and will he be here? Will the Leader put on the record tonight the documentary evidence about which she spoke in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week when she stated categorically that any disruption to the Luas has happened over the past 16 months? Will she make the documentary evidence available to the House in the context of the excellent Labour Party Private Members' motion?</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Will the Leader make time available this week for a statement from the Government on the ongoing bin protests in Dublin? It is an absolute disgrace that thousands of householders in this city cannot have their waste collected because of a number of jumped up Trotskyites who are standing in the way. I put it to the Leader and the Government that it is time to become tough on this issue. It is time to take action in relation to a very small minority of people who are standing in the way of these bins being collected and of ordinary people going about their business. The Government will have the support of my party if a tough stance is taken on this matter. It is time this small minority of people took their protest to next year's local government elections rather than to the streets of this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I am sure the Leader joins me in giving our full support to the Irish troops travelling today under the UN banner to Liberia in western Africa. Many other Irish people are there, including Concern and other NGO organisations. These people have our best wishes and support going to that war torn country. Given the historical context between the United States of America and Liberia, there is an additional responsibility on the current US Administration to support the efforts for peace and reconciliation in Liberia and to bring to an end the appalling civil strife which has taken place in the country over the past 20 years.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_22">If the publicans say they will not apply the law, they must listen and deal with the effects of their actions afterwards. The same applies to the bin protesters. It is hugely important to reach a balance in dealing with the issue. We must allow people the right to protest, but people cannot be stopped from doing their work. It is not acceptable to stop ordinary people doing their work. There must be a different way of protesting and we must find that balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">A serious issue was raised with the Taoiseach yesterday in the other House by the Leader of the Opposition about answering questions in the House. This is an important issue. The reasons the Taoiseach gave were fair. However, I would have been much happier if he said that for reasons of security it was decided not to make the information public. This would have been in order. Governments are allowed to have some unspoken thoughts and we do not need to be told everything that is happening behind the scenes. This, however, has not helped trust and confidence. I do not have any difficulty with the Government or with people meeting the parts of the IRA they need to meet to advance the cause of peace. The Taoiseach should not be required to make that information available at all times. However, it would be better if we were told that was the reason rather than now being told he regrets not informing the Houses. There might have been good reasons for not informing the Houses at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">There are still five or six Seanad Bills before the Dáil. We are losing out as a result of that. Many of those Bills were pushed through this House at a rate of knots in order to accommodate the other House, but they seem to have stopped dead on the other side. What is going on in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_25">I seek an answer to the question raised by Senator Brian Hayes about whether the Minister for Transport will be here tonight. He has a lot to say to everyone else. One cannot turn on the radio without hearing him. I hope he will be here tonight to speak to us.</p>

        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_10">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_27">It is not necessary to tell Senator McDowell what to do or say. Senator Ryan should speak on the Order of Business.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_28">I anticipate that people might comment on my not mentioning it.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Nobody has the right to break the law. If I sat on the streets in my youth, the gardaí were entitled to move me, which they did with considerable vigour. I might have complained about their vigour, but I would not have complained about their right to do so. We want to be clear about the fact that the non-collection of domestic waste poses an enormous public health threat. If I was to consider an issue, I would invite public opinion in Ireland to first observe the law and then to insist that everyone is equal before the law. If a rich man is sentenced to a week in prison for contempt of a tribunal, then putting a poor woman in prison for two weeks for a lesser offence suggests we are not all equal before the law. However, it is a separate issue. The law will be respected if people believe we are equal before it. If some people are smuggled in and out of prison to avoid an embarrassing photograph being taken of them walking in or out, that suggests we are not all equal before the law. That is the fundamental issue. I believe in the law. We are obliged to obey laws even if we disagree with them. However, we are entitled to a court and prison system which reflects that fundamental principle. Otherwise, it is not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I notice that colleagues regularly raise the issue of delays on the Order of Business. I looked at the Order Paper for this House for this week and last week. Last week we had the accounts of the Higher Education Authority for the year ending 2001. Is that the best the Higher Education Authority can do? This week we have the accounts for the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Tralee for 2001, which is two years ago. If public bodies have that attitude to legal obligations, how can we expect them to take seriously their obligations to citizens who want a means test for a grant processed in a reasonable time? There is an organisational issue about the proper delivery by management of public services. These are management responsibilities. It would be useful to debate the management of the public services. There has been much talk about the workers in the public service and their benchmarking award. It is about time we looked at those who get paid large salaries to manage those services because they do not seem to do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">Last night another motion on Palestine was vetoed at the United Nations by the United States. That motion was on the building of the infamous wall which is essentially a land grab by Israel to take over yet more land. Given what is happening there and the ongoing chaos in Iraq, it is more than time we had a debate in this House on the Middle East generally, and I ask the Leader to consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">My colleague, Senator O'Meara, is the author of the report we will be debating later this morning. I suggest to the Leader that the ten minutes allotted to her is a little brief.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_34">Perhaps the Leader could extend it to everybody, or perhaps my colleague, who is after all the author of the report, could be allowed perhaps 20 minutes to explain the background to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_35">It would be appropriate for this House to pass a vote of congratulations to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his tremendous success at the European fisheries meeting on Monday. We have had discussions on this matter before and we all realise the devastation it would have caused if the concept of the Irish Box had been removed completely, which was suggested. The Minister played a good tactical game, however. When one hears the fisheries organisations saying he has done a reasonably good job, one knows he must have done a hell of a good job.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Last week I raised a matter concerning the comments of the Director of Corporate Enforcement regarding people appointed by the State who are operating at sub-optimal level in protecting the interests of taxpayers, which is something we do not condone. I have since read of the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, with regard to the duties and obligations of State appointees to boards. Indeed, letter writing seems to be catching on; the Minister stated that he had written to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I would be interested to see that letter too. Can we expect to have a uniform approach throughout the State system? This would be worthy of a debate if the Leader could arrange it.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">I acknowledge the exceptional contribution that Senator Mansergh has made to the peace process on this island. There is always the danger of misrepresentation but, importantly, he approached his work in an astute, sensitive and humane manner, and he also won the trust and confidence of all traditions. The success that he and others have had in the peace process is evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House and update us on the current status of Irish immigrants in the USA. Speaking in New York recently, he outlined the difficulties for undocumented immigrants that have resulted from the tragedy of 11 September 2001. I know that many of them find themselves in a very uncomfortable and traumatic situation. Perhaps the Minister could update us on the manner in which the good relations between the USA and Ireland are being used in this regard.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_49">It would be appropriate for us to bring the relevant Minister to the House to explain the relationship between Government and the organisation One in Four, which deals with survivors of sexual abuse. I understand Mr. O'Gorman was invited by the Government to establish a branch of the organisation here. He feels, because of his adverse comments on Government activities and policy, that the organisation is being marginalised and sidelined. That is clear to me from the comments emerging from the Department, that there is no obligation to fund the organisation. Why did the Department invite in the organisation? That is a question to which the House is entitled to an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">With regard to the matter in the other House, what concerns me is the fact that there were meetings with the so-called Real IRA. Subsequently, there was the Omagh bombing, but after that the meetings resumed. With reference to this, the Taoiseach said something in the other House that was deliberately untrue. That erodes confidence. It is a very dangerous thing to do, but I will leave it at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">With regard to the bins campaign, people have a right to protest but they do not have a right to place the welfare of other citizens at risk. There is a serious health issue involved. There is the proliferation of rats carrying disease and a lack of civic responsibility. I am prepared to pay for the services provided and we should pay for our water. The European Union will make us pay for our water. We should pay for the bins because that develops a sense of civic responsibility. Citizens should not expect the State to clean and tidy up after them all the time, free of charge. One of the reasons we are so cavalier about litter is that we expect the nanny State to come in and do this work. There should be a reasonable fee, one that would not cripple people on small incomes in working class districts. As responsible citizens, we should pay and expect to pay for the services we receive from the State. That is the only way we will respect them. Surprisingly, 73% or 74% of the telepoll of 14,000 people on the "Marian Finucane" programme this morning took that line.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">I join the call for a debate on the Middle East as someone who would have freely voted for George Bush – I would be in a minority in the House in that regard – if given the opportunity. It is disquieting, having accepted the view that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, to find there are apparently no such weapons. This leads to a situation where we should debate Ireland's role in a UN force. I recollect wise heads in this House counselling against war and giving good reasons against it. In my case, I accepted that there were weapons of mass destruction.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">On the Palestinian and Israeli question, it is also disquieting that the situation appears to be intractable. No serious efforts are being made, other than tit for tat violence which is having a terrible effect on that region.</p>

We have a dreadful situation in the midlands where Dublin gangs hit rural areas on a nightly basis and terrorise elderly people in isolated rural areas. This must stop.

To include the entire question of Iraq, Israel and Palestine in one debate is far too wide and encompasses too many disparate issues. Given our upcoming Presidency of the EU there is much service to be done here to the Government by having such a frank debate because the position in the Middle East is volatile and we may well have a leadership role to play in the months ahead. Would the Leader consider separating both debates?</p>

What goes on behind the scenes is very important as that is where results are normally achieved.

Everything that Fr. Alex Reid or myself and others did from the months following the Enniskillen bomb to the months following the Omagh bomb had one purpose only, to establish a lasting peace in Ireland that would be an alternative to violent conflict and to the type of atrocities of which I have spoken. There are, of course, moral questions which can legitimately be raised about such contacts, but as the Taoiseach said last year, if it were wrong for governments even to countenance such communications, there would be very little prospect of securing peace and it is highly unlikely that there would have been any peace process. In conclusion, I ask those inside the House and outside it to see any meetings that took place – they were very few – in the context of the Government's absolute determination to bring all paramilitary activity to an end, by persuasion if possible and by other means if necessary.</p>

It is important that we debate the Hanly report and its consequences for hospitals at the earliest opportunity, either this afternoon or tomorrow.

There can be no question in anybody's mind of the contribution that Senator Mansergh has made over the years. He is a man of almost frightening integrity. The peace process would not have been what it was were it not for him and Fr. Alex Reid, as he mentioned. I have no difficulty about people speaking with people here and there. If someone is trying to end a conflict there is no point talking to people who are not actually fighting. It is not unreasonable in these rather murky circumstances for a government to have a certain reticence about to whom they are talking. We should not blow this issue up into a mountain.</p>

These are people who were referred by their medical practitioners in most cases. This seems counterproductive.

They made that point, not I.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">The discussions held by Senator Mansergh will surprise many of the public. They were held after the Omagh bombing which struck a resonance with everybody round the country. People will be surprised they took place. The meetings were held in secret and it was only when the information went into the public domain that the Taoiseach responded, in the Dáil yesterday, that the meeting had taken place. That is the issue. The Taoiseach during a process of questioning over past years did not release that information in replies in the Dáil.

The investigations of these murders are being carried out in Blanchardstown because the Garda station in Finglas is not suitable for this type of investigation. It is time the Minister came in here and explained how he is going to rid our society of this gangland warfare, which is quite unacceptable. The Commissioner of An Garda Síochána told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights he does not have the resources he would like to deal with this.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">I could think of plenty of answers to that. We welcome the Leader of the Opposition's strong statement here to the effect that the law should be enforced. Those of us who live in rural areas cannot understand the protest. We pay bin charges and have done so for years. In a wider sense, if people pay their charges they are entitled to have their bins taken and not to have the collection thwarted by those who seek to block it for their own ends. It is a clearcut case and it is appalling that people are being held to ransom and that there are widespread disturbances.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Senator Brian Hayes also wished good luck to the Irish troops going to Liberia. We had a very good meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs yesterday with representatives from the Army, the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs during which this was discussed. We all wished them good luck but I remind the House that this action must be formally passed by the Dáil. A reconnaissance group has gone first. That will be followed by the full complement when approved by the Dáil. We heard the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs on the radio this morning describing the elections in Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Senator O'Toole referred to the need for balance in the whole debate on the issue of bin charges, while expressing the clear view that people have a right to have their refuse collected when they have paid for that service. Senator Mansergh has already responded to Senator O'Toole's comments on the Taoiseach's reply to a question in the Dáil. On the question of Seanad Bills currently before the Dáil, there is what one might describe as a pile-up of Bills which have left this House and are awaiting attention or being dealt with in the Dáil. My office has had meetings with the Whips in the Dáil and it is up to them to clear the backlog. Next week, we hope to have the Bill dealing with provisions in relation to pregnant workers, involving the addition of a new section. I mention that by way of general comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Senator Ryan also referred to the non-collection of refuse and the need for observance of the law. He said the public would have a better regard for the law if it was seen to be applied equally. I assume his concern relates to people being treated equally in terms of whatever punishment is meted out. However, the absence of standardisation is a feature of the law, in the sense that it is a matter for each individual judge to decide in each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">With regard to the management of public bodies, some of which are now almost two years behind time with their annual accounts despite legally specified deadlines, I agree that would be a useful subject for a debate, as also would a motion on Palestine and the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">On the question of allocating more time for a debate on local radio, Senator O'Meara must be congratulated on bringing forward the report on that topic. However, the time factor is relevant. If the debate has not concluded, we can allocate time on another day. I understand it can remain on the Order Paper pending further debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Senator Kenneally congratulated the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the outcome of the EU negotiations in relation to the Irish box.

          <p eId="para_112">Senator Ó Murchú praised Senator Mansergh's work. I believe he echoed the views of many Senators in that regard. At that time, the Senator was Mr. Martin Mansergh and he did some fine work. Senator Ó Murchú also sought a debate, involving the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on US immigration issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Senator Norris referred to Mr. Colm O'Gorman and the position of the One in Four organisation. I understand the Minister for Health and Children will meet Mr. O'Gorman tomorrow and, no doubt, some statement will follow that meeting. The Senator also referred to the Taoiseach's replies in the Dáil. In relation to the refuse collection issue, the Senator drew attention to the health implications. It is noteworthy that, in a recent opinion poll, 73% of people agreed that people who have paid their refuse collection charges should have their bins collected. There is a very lopsided and wrong-headed debate on this issue. Those who pay their money are entitled to have the collection service provided. The point of the whole campaign rather escapes me.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Senator Hanafin joined in the call for a debate on the Middle East and also expressed pride in Senator Mansergh's work in relation to the Northern Ireland peace process. Senator Bannon called for a debate on crime and the situation in relation to Garda stations. He also praised his party leader. Senator Minihan suggested there is a need for two debates, one on the situation involving Palestine and Israel and another on the wider Middle East situation. I agree with the Senator in that regard. The requests have been submitted and I anticipate a positive response.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Senator Mansergh made a very proper statement which will appear in the Official Report but I would like to add to it. Senator Mansergh has a long record of public service to this country, particularly in the cause of peace. When a country is trying to move from a violent to a peaceful situation there are bound to be times when things are said and people are met but there is no need to blazon that to the wider public. It is necessary that hearts and minds meet to try to move the process forward. I remember the outcry when John Hume started to meet with Gerry Adams but we should consider where that led us. I fully support the role Senator Mansergh played and continues to play with his advice on Northern Ireland matters. I repeat that it is necessary for people to meet and talk, regardless of their background, and that it is done privately.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_136">The provision, as currently framed, allows the Minister to direct the temporary release of a prisoner having regard to the purpose of such release and the considerations the Minister must take into account before deciding whether to grant temporary release. The Senator is seeking a written direction but it is always open to a Minister to make a decision orally and provision has been made in a separate amendment to have any such oral direction recorded to writing. It is not intended to change section 4 of the 1960 Act which provides that where the release of a person is made subject to conditions, these shall be communicated to the person at the time of his release by a notice in writing. A notice in writing is sent to the person released informing them of any conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">While the Minister's direction may also include conditions, both standard and specific to the prisoner in question, the written conditions referred to in section 4 will be included in the notice for temporary release given to the prisoner by the governor or the Prison Service. Such a written notice would always be given to a prisoner when granted temporary release, regardless of the circumstances or urgency of the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">However, some flexibility must always be maintained in the administration of the scheme. To specifically provide that such directions can only be in writing could be extremely inflexible in an emergency. For example, the Minister could be attending a meeting in Brussels. There are many such meetings in the evolution of the justice pillar and an urgent circumstance might arise where a decision would have to be communicated orally by the Minister. While the importance of written directions in this area cannot be overstated, it is important to be realistic in relation to catering for unexpected events that can occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">A similar amendment was proposed in the Dáil and in order to deal with concerns on this issue, an amendment was made to section 1(5) to provide that the governor shall make and keep a record in writing of the direction given to the prisoner. This ensures that a record is always kept but allows the flexibility required, especially at weekends or late in the evening. The practice for a prisoner in all circumstances to receive a notice in advance of his or her temporary release setting out the period of temporary release and the conditions which apply to that period will not change and the provisions for this will be contained in rules which we have made in accordance with the amendment. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_143">The formula of words used in the subsection was chosen with deliberation by the Parliamentary Counsel. The wording introduces the notion of a direction being issued by the Minister. This is important when one remembers the reason for the Bill, which is to provide a clearer legislative basis for the powers of the Minister to grant temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The approach used introduces and defines the term "direction" thus avoiding the need for the term to be separately defined elsewhere. The structure of the Bill is then based on the subsequent use of the term "direction" which is used throughout the later subsections. I agree with Senator Terry that the particular sentence could be read more concisely if her amendment was accepted. However, it must be recognised that to accept the amendment would cause problems elsewhere in the overall text of the Bill by upsetting the premise on which other subsections are constructed, namely that the term "direction" has been defined at the outset and is then referred to throughout the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The Senator will notice that the Bill, unlike many such Bills, does not contain a definition section. There is clarification in section 1(10) and (11) of the meaning of what is a probation and welfare officer and references to other enactments. There is not a section in this Bill defining the terms used in it, although such a section is often included in legislation. Therefore, the other cumbersome formula used at the inception of the measure is to clarify the concept of a "direction", which is one of the key concepts of the Bill. If the draftsmen had chosen the route of inserting a separate section defining "direction", I could have accepted the amendment proposed by Senator Terry. However, I regret that I am unable to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I assume that the intention of this amendment is to provide that, within a certain overall time period – I am not sure how or in what circumstances this would be determined – a prisoner can be granted specific periods, or blocks, of temporary release. Presumably, the Senator is referring to cases where temporary release is granted for specific hours each day and for a specific number of days or weeks to attend a training course. In any event, I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill which allow for the granting of temporary release for specific purposes and specific periods of time, subject to the relevant conditions that apply, meet such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The current wording of the Bill is effective and allows for full flexibility in determining the times and periods for which temporary release is granted and allows that the person may be on a temporary release for a period of a number of days, or on a day to day basis for a number of hours. I do not accept that the amendment gives any added value to the Bill. It may only lead to confusion and, therefore, I do not intend to accept it.</p>

I am aware that the Minister argued in the Dáil that the interpretation of legislation allows for the term "he" to be interpreted as "he" or "she". This is new legislation and from now we should not refer solely to "he". Legislation should be gender-proofed and this is the way to do it. The amendment deliberately does not refer to "he" or "she" in deference to maintaining the drafting conventions of the principal 1960 Act. However, it is correct at this stage to use terms such as "the person" instead of "he". I am interested in the Minister's response.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_157">I assume the purpose of the Senator's amendments is to gender-proof this particular Bill. All new legislation is now gender-proofed in that it always refers to "he or she". Where the purpose of the legislation is to amend older legislation, such as in this case, amendments are drafted in the same gender as the original Act. This is the particular issue highlighted by the amendment. The Criminal Justice Act 1960, which this Bill amends, was drafted using the masculine gender – hence the use of "him" and "his" in this Bill. As Senators will be aware, the Interpretation Acts of 1937 and 1993 provide that in every Act, every word importing the masculine or feminine gender, unless the contrary intention appears, is construed as applying to the other relevant gender. The masculine is taken to embrace the feminine and <i>vice versa.</i>However, similar amendments were proposed in the Dáil and it was suggested that the other sections of the 1960 Act, which are not the subject of this Bill, might be amended and gender-proofed. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel was consulted and its strong advice was that this would create a huge additional workload which would have huge resource implications for all legislation. Were we to set about gender-proofing the earlier provisions of the 1960 Act, clearly a precedent would be established which would require us, in the case of any legislation amending older legislation which was not gender-proofed, to gender-proof the entirety of the older legislation as part of the amending legislation. I am sure Senators are aware of the large number of Bills considered in the Houses of the Oireachtas which amend older legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">I reiterate that new legislation is automatically gender-proofed, but this is not new legislation in the sense that we are amending older legislation which was not gender-proofed. In any legislation which remains pre-1993 legislation, the practice is to use the same gender as is used in the original Act. This approach applies equally to both genders. An issue of this kind has to be primarily a matter for the professional judgment of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Department must be guided by that advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I do not intend to accept the amendments. It is not a question of applying a male gender regime to legislation. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assured us that it is a question of applying the appropriate terminology as suits the circumstances. Senator Terry referred to the need for plain and intelligible language in legislation. This Act must be construed as one with the 1960 Act and, in that context, it would be inappropriate to have a form of expression used in one item of legislation and a divergent form of expression in the other.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I do not accept the Minister's response or that he is correct that if our amendments were accepted, it would be necessary to amend previous legislation. One of the reasons for this is modern expectation, which is why new legislation is gender-proofed. The amendments to the legislation should be gender-proofed.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Obviously I will not persuade the Minister of State to change his mind today, but I ask him and his Department to examine the issue again. The Labour Party does not accept that our amendment would require the Government to gender-proof, amend and redraft all previous legislation. Therefore, the Minister of State's reasoning for not accepting the amendment is incorrect and I ask him to re-examine the issue with his Department in that context.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_162">The Department is embarking on a programme for the consolidation of the entire criminal law, which will be dealt with on a gender-proofed basis because it will be a consolidation of the entire corpus of criminal law. It will afford the Department the opportunity of gender-proofing many of the older enactments which were not gender-proofed at the time. As I said in my initial reply, all new legislation is now gender-proofed. The Long Title to this Bill makes it clear that it is a Bill to amend the Criminal Justice Act 1960. It would be inconsistent of us to simply amend the 1960 Act and gender-proof this legislation without reverting to the principal Act of 1960 and gender-proofing it too. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel advised us that it would not have the resources to embark on that exercise were it to be a precedent in draftsmanship.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">We must be consistent with our draftsmanship because a dialogue takes place between the Oireachtas and the courts as to how legislation is interpreted. If we do not have a consistent system in regard to drafting and if we pick and choose between how Bills are drafted, it is not a good way for us to do our business.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">The amendment provides for a person to be allowed temporary release to an enforcement authority other than the Garda and for a person to be made available to foreign law enforcement authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The Garda Síochána has overall responsibility in this jurisdiction for the prevention, detection and investigation of offences. This amendment would only serve to add confusion to that. The Garda, as the primary body with responsibility for prosecuting criminal offences, would expect to be asked for assistance by any other bodies which might require it. As Senators are aware, there are many statutory bodies which have a role in the enforcement of the law, for example, the Health and Safety Authority, and I assume it is not intended to release prisoners on a temporary basis for the purposes of assisting these bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">In regard to the issue of making a person available for the purposes of investigations which involve another jurisdiction, procedures are already in existence for mutual assistance, under section 53 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, to cater for such circumstances. That provision will be supplemented by the criminal justice international co-operation Bill, which is in the course of preparation and will give effect to a number of EU instruments and a Council of Europe agreement regarding mutual assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">These instruments contain provisions in regard to the temporary transfer of detained persons to other states or territories to assist in investigations which will allow for temporary release to assist with investigations in another jurisdiction where the prisoner has not consented. The regime for dealing with a prisoner who is required to be transferred to another jurisdiction or territory for investigation can be dealt with under this proposed legislation. This will provide a proper structure and a system of reciprocal and mutual international guarantee which will protect the interests of the sending and requesting states.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">In these circumstances, it is inappropriate to include a provision in this legislation. The current position is that the consent of the prisoner is required for such international co-operation. When the legislation to give effect to these provisions comes into operation, that will no longer be the case and we will have the concept of extradition for questioning. The development of that area is sensitive and requires careful delineation of the responsibilities of the states involved and the rights of the parties to be subject to that process. The legislation to give effect to these provisions will be published in 2004. For those reasons, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p>

I take it that the Senator is not opening the wider question of the removal from the jurisdiction of a prisoner for questioning. However, on the narrow question, the Garda Síochána is the primary investigative authority in the State. Furthermore, some investigative authorities, such as the Office for Corporate Enforcement, have gardaí on their staff. The request to question a prisoner must be made through the Garda. Therefore, the amendment is superfluous since the request from an investigating body in another state, which wishes to investigate or question a person in Ireland, must come to the Garda. They cannot arrive at the gate of the prison and open the latch themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">In page 4, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following new paragraph:</p>
          <p eId="para_181">"(<i>d</i>) any representations made by the victim or next-of-kin of the victim on the proposal to direct the release of the person from prison,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">On Second Stage I discussed the need to strike a balance between the rights of victims as against those of the criminal. I suggested that I would bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to provide, in particular, for victims to be informed of a proposal for the early release of a prisoner. I hope the Minister of State will now accept this amendment. In dealing with legislation such as this, we must keep victims' rights in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The prison service has to deal with prisoners and their rehabilitation, so I wish to quote an acknowledgement of victims of crime from a submission by that service. It stated the service wants "to ensure that in all cases where temporary release is being considered, any potential risk for the victim is taken fully into account". In order for the prison service to take this fully into account, the legislation should provide for the right of victims to be informed of a proposal that a prisoner is going to be released. Far too often we hear of a victim bumping into the perpetrator on the street. We all know about the plight of victims so we can now help to avoid such situations arising in future. The Minister of State should consider accepting this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_184">I am in agreement, in large measure, with Senator Terry's amendment. We covered this point fairly well on Second Stage. Much of our law concentrates technically on the offender and offences, while the victim is often sidelined. We need to inject a change into that type of thinking. There are many fine examples of where jurisdictions have moved the victim to centre stage, thus having a rehabilitative effect on the criminal. The issue of restorative justice has operated well in other countries and is now being examined here with some pilot schemes in place. We should try to apply that concept more widely to the existing legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">One caveat is that a report arising from consultations with the victim should not prejudice a decision not to grant temporary release, thus leaving it open to the prisoner to take action that would prejudice the case in some way. The Minister of State might deal with that caveat in his reply. The Minister of State must have regard to various issues, including the idea that the victim should be part of the process. I am encouraged to take that line, given the range of issues involved, as well as the sentences imposed and recommendations that courts may make. There is much evidence of inconsistency in sentencing by judges dealing with similar offences. There is no reference that that evidence at a trial is being taken into account, which may leave it open to victims to refer to some issues they may wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention before a decision is made to release a prisoner. I ask and encourage the Minister of State to accommodate this amendment without prejudicing the decision and, thus, perhaps leaving it open to challenge. I hope that much of the legislation emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in future will take more account of victims than has been the case heretofore.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">While I support the intention of Senator Terry's amendment, the Labour Party's amendment No. 10 is making a slightly different point. An amendment made on Report Stage in the Dáil sought to involve the victim more in legislative terms, which is an important change. Amendment No. 10 states that it is not just the victim of the particular offence committed by a person in relation to their current prison sentence that should be taken into account, but also any other offence committed by them. It is important to consider the safety and security of a prisoner's victim or victims. It would not necessarily mean that a prisoner would not be released but it may mean that conditions would be attached to their release. The amendment, therefore, seeks not just to deal with victims in terms of the offence to which a period of imprisonment relates, but also other offences committed by the prisoner. The impact of the prisoner's release upon the victim or a member of their family should be considered.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_101" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_187">As I indicated on Second Stage, I have considerable sympathy with the proposed amendment and I said I would look forward to it with interest. There are difficulties with this matter, however, because when we talk about the interests of the victim in the criminal justice system, the person who is convicted and sentenced for an offence has a definitive sentence imposed upon them. In imposing sentence, the court frequently refers to the need to protect victims and to protect the public from this kind of offence, as well as marking the wrong done to the victim. That is the reason for sentencing. It has been suggested that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should take more account of victims but no other Department is more concerned with victims than this one. We have a system of justice which is designed to deal with persons who perpetrate offences. The philosophical problem is that the concept of temporary release, which as a matter of principle is desirable for the humane administration of a prison, is inconsistent with the idea of serving the entire sentence that has been imposed on an offender. It is important to operate a system of temporary release that is objective, transparent and that operates under a specific set of criteria, which is legally sustainable. From the debate last week, it is clear that all Senators understand the reasons behind and the purpose of the temporary release system. If there was no possibility of temporary release it would be an inhumane prison regime, which I am sure none of us would wish to see in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">If one accepted Senator Terry's proposed amendment relating to representations from the victim or the next of kin concerning a proposed temporary release, it would be very difficult to operate a system of temporary release as it is likely that a large proportion of the representations from victims or their relatives would set out reasons why the person should not be granted temporary release. As matters stand, of course, the Minister can receive representations of that character but to transfer them onto the statutory plane, which is what is being proposed in that amendment, would create a statutory obligation on the Minister to take these representations into account. Were the Minister not to take those representations into account on a consistent basis, he or she could be taken to task in the courts for abusing his or her powers under the system of temporary release. This would create great difficulty in the administration of the entire system of temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">If I accepted Senator Terry's amendment there would be a statutory obligation on the Minister to take these representations into account. In these circumstances, the Minister might be unable to grant a prisoner temporary release, even though other factors indicated that temporary release should be allowed for rehabilitative or other purposes. Where the concerns of the victim, or his or her family, is made known to the Minister, to the prison service or to the interim parole board, appropriate conditions may be imposed on the granting of temporary release if such temporary release is considered appropriate. The difficulty of the Minister concerns what representation the victim can make in this context. As was hinted at in Senator Terry's amendment, the victim can only seek to veto the temporary release. A victim might write to the Minister and urge him or her to allow the person to be released, but that is a more unlikely circumstance. The more likely circumstance is that the victim would write to the Minister, or the next-of-kin, as Senator Terry has carefully formulated, objecting to the release and outlining the hurt, pain and trauma it would cause to the victim. Of course, the original sentence of the court seeks to address this in the first instance. We must administer the system of temporary release because we must operate the penal system in a humane manner. While such representations are made, and the Minister attempts, having decided whether to grant temporary release, to decide whether these particular representations can be accommodated in the form of conditions, nevertheless there is a fundamental difference between that procedure and elevating it to a statutory formula that requires the Minister in all cases to have regard to that factor. The practicality is, however, that were this to be legislated for, the Minister would find himself in a position whereby his exercise of ministerial powers would eventually be called into question in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">On Senator Tuffy's proposal, Senators will be aware that subsection (2) sets out the considerations which the Minister must take into account in deciding whether to grant temporary release for one of the purposes set out in subsection (1). Subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) provides that the Minister should have regard to the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should a person be released from prison. As I stated on Second Stage, the latter provision was amended following discussions in Dáil Éireann. This now also includes a reference to the potential threat to the safety and security of the victim of the offence. The safety and security of the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served relates is a statutory matter which can be taken into account. This consideration as a matter of law must be taken into account by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">What Senators Tuffy, Ryan, O'Meara, McDowell and McCarthy are proposing is that this be further amended to include a victim of any other offence committed by the person, or a member of the family of a victim. I point out to Senators that subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) already specifically provides for the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public which could include any such persons. Other considerations which the Minister must take into account include the person's previous criminal record, the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release, the nature and gravity of the offence, the sentence of imprisonment and any recommendations of the court. It is important to remember that under subsection (3) a prisoner cannot be granted temporary release if the Minister is of the opinion that for the reasons connected with any one or more of these it would not be appropriate to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_192">Following what the Minister of State said, he is certainly tipping the balance in favour of criminals. He indicated that he would be open to accepting an amendment. If that is the case, I am disappointed he will not accept my amendment. If he believes in balancing the rights of victims with those of criminals, why did he not table an amendment to provide for these rights? If he does not accept my amendment, I would have expected him to table an amendment in view of his comments on Second Stage. My amendment proposes that the Minister shall, before giving a direction under this section, have regard to any representations made by the victim. I do not believe that will tie the Minister into denying temporary release to a prisoner if he or she deserves it on all the other grounds. It gives the victim an opportunity to put forward his or her views or suggestions and the Minister must then decide whether these representations are strong enough to deny the prisoner the right to temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Perhaps the Minister was told by the real Minister before he came in here today not to accept this amendment. I am sure the Minister of State is big enough to stand up for himself and make his own decisions. I ask him to reconsider and accept my amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_194">On the Labour Party amendment, the legislation accepts that the victim's safety and security should be taken into account. The purpose of the amendment is to broaden the scope of this to include victims of other offences and family members. In response to the Minister of State's reason for not accepting the amendment, if he mentions victims of a particular offence as distinct from members of the public, surely he should mention other victims of that particular criminal as distinct from ordinary members of the public. For example, a prisoner could be serving a prison sentence which could immediately relate to a particular offence but he or she might have previously served a sentence for another crime against another individual. Similarly in relation to family members, Senator Terry's amendment indicates that the family is especially affected by the crime as distinct from other members of the public. We believe they should be mentioned specifically together with the general public.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_195">I empathise with much of what the Minister of State said in this regard. A particular difficulty with the amendment is that every crime does not necessarily have an identifiable victim. I also admire the Minister of State for defending his Department. He may or may not agree with me that there are many victims who might not necessarily share that view and who feel their particular plight is not always given the significance it deserves when decisions are being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The Minister of State made an interesting point in his speech. He rightly pointed out that while victims are not specifically mentioned they could make representations if they were aware of the potential release of a prisoner who had offended against them. The point he was making was that any good points the victims might make could be applied on certain conditions, which might bring new information to the process. In that regard, and acknowledging that consideration of the release will happen without their knowledge, that valuable information which could be part of the process of consideration is missing from the framework. Perhaps the Minister and the Department might examine some way of taking that into account. We are talking about an important exercise of duty by the Minister in the temporary release of prisoners, which could have serious effects for individuals. Like everything in life, not all early releases are successful. There have been cases where people have reoffended with more serious crimes. I know the Minister and the Department are anxious to deal with that. We should include in the legislation every possible precaution to ensure that does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">As regards the views of the victim, paragraph (<i>h</i>) refers to any report of, or recommendation made by a number of bodies, including the governor, the Garda etc. I would like to think that if a prisoner is released early back into the community of which I am a member, the local gardaí would have an input by way of a report. I am not saying the Garda Síochána should be the deciding body, although it would probably have the best information about the person behind bars and it would probably be more knowledgeable than the governor or prison officers about the offence committed. Paragraph (<i>h</i>) refers to any report of – there may not be a report – or recommendation made by the governor, the Garda Síochána etc. However, there should be some line of communication with the local gardaí so their views are available to the Minister to assist him in making the correct decision about an early release.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">We all subscribe to the rehabilitative nature of the early release programme. However, we should give equal priority to the safeguarding and security of the community into which that person is released. I would probably put more weight on that than on the rehabilitative aspect. Perhaps I am wrong to do that, but it should at least be equal. I would like to think we would make this legislation as good as we can. There will still be cases which will not work out satisfactorily or as intended by the Minister, the Department or society. However, we should try to ensure a minimum level of safeguards. Consultation with the victim and the local gardaí is an important and valuable component of the process of early release.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_105" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_199">This legislation entrusts a grave and fundamental power in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He would be a foolish man if he did not consult with the Garda Síochána or the victim. That is not the issue here. Victims make representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister makes the most minute inquiries, particularly in the case of serious offences, with the relevant officers of the Garda Síochána. The difficulty is that the Oireachtas has entrusted this power to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am sure it is not a power which any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform takes any pleasure in exercising. However, he must make that decision and he is accountable to the other House in the exercise of that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The difficulty with the amendment does not stem from any of those matters but from subsection (3) which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Minister shall not give a direction under this section in respect of a person–</p>
          <p eId="para_202">(<i>a</i>) if he is opinion that, for reasons connected with any one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2), it would not be appropriate to so do.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">If I accept Senator Terry's amendment, that will become "one of the matters referred to in subsection (2)". The substance of her amendment would then be translated into section 2. It would then be a matter in which the Minister could not give a direction "if he is of the opinion that, for reasons connected with any one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2), it would not be appropriate to so do". Then we would have the vista of the courts intervening and suggesting at the behest of a victim that the Minister should not have formed a particular opinion in relation to a temporary release. That would be an undesirable state of affairs. The Oireachtas, for better or worse, has to entrust this power to a person who is at least accountable to the Oireachtas. That is what we are legislating for here.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I do not accept that in refusing to accept this amendment there is any suggestion that this is rebalancing the rights of the criminal and the victim. The person we are talking about is not the criminal facing conviction, but a prisoner serving a sentence. It is important to note that the first factor set out in subsection (2) is the "nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates". That directly relates to the punishment of the offender for the wrong done to the victim. That is placed uttermost in the Minister's mind by this Bill. The "nature and gravity of the offence" is the first consideration listed. It must be a factor taken into account in an objective sense by the Minister when arriving at an opinion to direct a temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">While I understand the spirit in which the amendment was proposed, having considered the matter without any assistance from Big Brother, I independently arrived at the conclusion that it is dangerous to legislate for verities in which we all believe but which may lead to difficulties in the future. The practice of the Minister in the administration of this section is to entertain representations from victims, which he must do. However, if we accept the amendment, we would translate them on to the plain of positive enactment which could impose substantial legal obligations on the Minister in what must be a system operated on a discretionary basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_214">The granting of temporary release is not a right but a privilege for which a person serving a term of imprisonment can apply and which is granted at the discretion of the Minister. The amendment tabled by the Deputy provides that the Minister should have regard to representations made by the prisoner or on behalf of the prisoner. The former is already dealt with under the current system. The prisoner will set out the reasons temporary release is being sought and may include other information or facts which he or she considers relevant to their application.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">With regard to the making of representations on behalf of a person, that could conceivably lead to circumstances where the Minister would have to consider representations made in all cases, regardless of their bona fides. That could lead to an unworkable burden being imposed on the Minister and, ultimately, would be a recipe for chaos. Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I realise it is not a right. One of the main benefits of temporary release would be the rehabilitation of the prisoner. It is important also that their own case be made as well as all the other cases. Surely representations could be made by the person. If I recall correctly, the question of other parties making representations was raised by Senator Henry on Second Stage. On the broader issue of temporary release, other parties might make an argument on behalf of the person concerned on why it is beneficial and what exactly it is for. We have already referred to the importance of the victim. The reasoning behind temporary release is the benefit to society in terms of the rehabilitation of the prisoner. Surely their representations have to be considered. Why cannot others make representations on their behalf?</p>

          <p eId="para_217">Having disagreed with Senator Terry about the position of the victim I now have to disagree with Senator Tuffy about the position of the prisoner. The Bill deals with what is viewed by us in the Oireachtas as a privilege, not a right. It is not a right to apply for temporary release. We would send out the wrong signal if we were to so legislate. If Senator Tuffy's amendment was accepted, it would follow that a person had a right to apply. Those in public life know how conscious our citizens are of rights. This is a person who is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment for commission of an offence which is serious enough to warrant a term of imprisonment. In those circumstances, I do not accept the Bill should include any implication of a right to seek temporary release. Although temporary release may have many of the benefits outlined by Senator Tuffy we should not legislate for a right to apply for it. In those circumstances, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">The purpose of this amendment is that humanitarian considerations, in terms of age and health, should be taken into account by the Minister. It is important that he would have regard to these basic elements in terms of his decision on whether to release a prisoner. To have that inserted would be in keeping with the previous subsection, where the Minister has to justify temporary release, for example, on grounds of health or for other humanitarian reasons. The Bill mentions later on "humane and just management of the prison concerned". Grounds of health has been acknowledged. Age or other humanitarian grounds should also be a consideration. The Minister has already acknowledged that those are factors in terms of the previous subsection in the Bill and they should also be included in terms of the subsection where he has to have regard to various things before making his decision. That would be a reasonable and humane way to deal with temporary release. I would have thought that should be current practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">The advice from the Parliamentary Counsel is that the reference to health and humanitarian grounds, which are referred to in the amended section, is sufficient to cover this issue. As was indicated on Committee Stage in the Dáil, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that caution must be exercised on the grounds contained in section 2(3)(<i>a</i>). That subsection requires the Minister not to give a direction for temporary release where he is of the opinion that it would not be appropriate to do so for reasons connected with one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2). If a specific reference to age, which is proposed in this amendment, were to be included, it might have the effect of creating a problem about the release of a prisoner for whom age grounds did not apply, thereby leading to the opposite effect intended by the amendment. In this instance I must be guided by the advice from the Parliamentary Counsel that the amendment gives no added value to the text and I do not propose to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I would be much more comfortable standing with what is already in the text of the Bill, where circumstances exist that in the opinion of the Minister justify a temporary release on grounds of health or other humanitarian grounds. Clearly age is comprehended in "other humanitarian grounds". I would be unhappy about further defining other humanitarian grounds to include age, because such a reference might only lead to further complications in the administration of the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">"(<i>k</i>) whether any risks arising on temporary release could be obviated by attaching conditions to the release, by limiting the duration of the release, by directing release during specified hours only in the course of a specified period, or by directing release with escort and with or without personal restraining measures,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The purpose of this amendment is that, allowing for the possibility of risk, the Minister might also, in terms of setting out conditions, limit a release option. The prisoner would still avail of temporary release, but the victim, for example, would be protected because of the conditions attached. The amendment sets down that there would be conditions, by limiting the duration during specified hours, for example, or by providing an escort etc. Could the Minister of State comment on that?</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_229">What is proposed by the Minister is already comprehended in section 2(1), which provides that the Minister may direct that "such person as is specified in the direction shall be released from prison for such a temporary period and subject to such conditions as may be specified in the direction". Inherent in the practice in this area has always been the attachment of conditions for the protection of the public. No departure is envisaged in this legislation. The Minister can impose such conditions as he deems fit in relation to temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I am not quite sure what the purpose of the amendment is since it seems to be spelling out in greater specificity that power which the Minister has. It appears to seek to ensure that the Minister would not rule out temporary release, solely because of the element of risk. The reality is that temporary release by its very nature always involves some element of risk, even with conditions attached. The Minister has the responsibility to seek to minimise that risk as much as possible with the attachment of conditions that are suitable for the particular case. That is why the considerations which must be taken into account by the Minister before granting temporary release are so important. The primary concern has to be the safety of the public. That is adequately protected in the Bill before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">I understand what the Minister of State is saying, but we are concerned that the Act might not properly reflect the fact that there are different levels of release. It starts with release in handcuffs and the prison service escort. Subsection (3) says "the Minister shall not give a direction under this"– I stress "shall not", which is mandatory –"if he is of the opinion that for reasons connected with one of the matters referred to in the previous subsection" it would not be appropriate to do so. Is the Minister of State happy that the wording of the legislation would not prevent the Minister from having a more limited release if the different factors in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>) are taken into consideration?</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I am satisfied on that. In fact, without appearing to criticise the Senator in any way, I suggest that were we to accept this amendment which spells out particular types of condition which can be imposed by the Minister, we might trammel his power and ingenuity in imposing conditions in appropriate cases. It is, for example, the view of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that in an appropriate case a prisoner could be permitted to attend a funeral in handcuffs under the Bill as it stands. Clearly that would also be comprehended by the Senator's amendment. Other forms of restraint or device can arise, however, which may not be comprehended by amendment. To leave the Minister the power simply to set the conditions allows him to respond to the different circumstances that can arise.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_236">The Minister is not sympathetic to this amendment. While a person is remanded for detention pending trial, clearly that person has been charged with a serious offence and the court has not seen fit to release the person on bail. That is a remand prisoner. Temporary release for such a prisoner has to be a matter for the courts because it is the courts that decided to remand the prisoner for trial and to remand him or her in detention pending trial. It is not the Executive but the court which made that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I am aware that the Inspector of Prisons, in his first annual report, made a recommendation for change in this area. He was concerned about the issue of granting temporary releases for remand prisoners in special circumstances. The Senator outlined the circumstance of a sickness. Another circumstance could be a humanitarian one such as the funeral of a close relative. The court can grant temporary release but, because the trial has not yet taken place, there are difficult constitutional questions about whether we can empower the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a decision like that where the order remanding the person in custody pending trial has been made by the courts. The judicial process has been put in motion and as an aspect of that judicial process the particular prisoner has been committed to a trial court. I am not satisfied we have the power to do this even if we were minded to do it. Apart from that, as a matter of general principle it is undesirable because the person has been remanded on a serious charge by the courts. Plainly the court will in most cases have been invited to consider the option of bail and will be the body best equipped to make a determination on the issue of whether a person should be temporarily released.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Senator makes the point that while under the court system it is always open to apply bail there are vacations and it may be difficult to contact a judge. Bail applications continue during vacation. They are the only regular sittings of the courts which take place throughout the calendar year because of the jealousy with which the courts have always protected the liberty of the citizen. They are available and their jurisdiction can be invoked even when the sessions of the court are on their well known vacation.</p>

The amendment proposes that a notice of a direction of a temporary release should always be given to the victim or the victim's next of kin. There are already a number of options in place for those who wish to receive such information. A victim of a serious sexual or violent offence may ask the Prison Service, through the prisons' victim liaison officer, to notify the Garda prior to the release of the perpetrator from prison, either on temporary release or at the end of his or her sentence. That request can be made by a victim of a serious sexual or violent offence. In addition, a victim may also ask the Prison Service, through the prisons' victim liaison officer to be notified if an offender is to be given temporary release. It is important to remember that many victims of crime do not want to be informed of the temporary release of the offender as it may bring back memories of the hurt and pain they have experienced.</p>

We should have a blanket decision to inform all victims. The Minister of State has said that victims may not want to know but how can he know which victims do not want to be informed of the release of a prisoner? That is taking something for granted. The provision that all victims will be informed is what victims want. We constantly hear from victim support groups about the stress caused to victims when they do not know about the release. In order that some do not slip through the net we should insert this provision and thereby avoid the mishaps that occur when prisoners are released unbeknownst to the victim.</p>

Then, as a matter of form, they would be kept advised and notified. That is satisfactory. I had not thought of it but I do understand why certain victims would not want to know.

This is not the place where this particular issue can be raised. I made clear that there is a practice in the Department that a victim can ask the Prison Service, through the prisons' victims liaison officer to be notified if a person is to receive temporary release. It is an important issue. I am glad the Senator tabled the amendment if it gives us an opportunity to point out that this is the practice and that the facility is there. There is merit in Senator Walsh's proposal that there should be some legal mechanism when the offender is sentenced whereby the victim can be advised of this facility.

          <p eId="para_255">The Labour Party tabled this amendment because the way the section is worded at present would permit discrimination between classes of prisoners and that is undesirable. I raised that issue during the debate on Second Stage. The legislation is in part a response to the High Court case where this type of approach was struck down. It should not now be reintroduced through legislation. Many things have to be taken into account in terms of providing temporary release but it is wrong to make that decision on the basis of the class of crime committed. That type of approach could be subject to political pressure, or the media response to a particular crime or criminal, and that is not the right consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">All the other elements are right, the safety of the victim, the impact on society, the benefit to the prisoner, and most importantly, the long-term impact on society, but the type of crime or the class of prisoner are not the right considerations. They do not necessarily relate to society. It is an emotive matter by which we could all be affected but that should not be a matter for the Minister's consideration.

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_257">Senator Tuffy wants to delete words which refer to classes of persons. I can reassure her that it is not the intention of this provision in the Bill to restore the old system of automatic or blanket refusal of particular categories of offender. The Senator expressed a concern that, due to prejudicial reporting of particular types of offence, the Minister might be so minded under these rules to formulate rules which would expressly exclude a whole category of offenders from consideration for temporary release. That is not the intention behind this part of the Bill. The intention is to allow the Minister prescribe rules on the conditions which can be imposed on persons granted temporary release. For example, standard rules apply requiring a person to keep the peace, be of good behaviour and of sober habits, during the period of release. That is a particular standard condition and the Minister can specify for that to be applied to classes of persons under these rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The second part provides that prisoners being released may have conditions attached to their release which are specific to certain types of offender. An example would be an attachment of a condition of curfew to the temporary release of a juvenile offender but I stress that such a condition will in no way impinge on the fact that each case will be taken on individual merits. It is not the intention of this Bill to reinstate powers to exclude categories of offender from temporary release. The subsection as now drafted allows for a more efficient, clear and effective way of operating the system of temporary release and provides for a regime of standard, as well as specific, conditions to be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The proposed amendment would take away from the efficiency and clarity of the proposal. The provision envisages both standard conditions, such as to be of good behaviour and keep the peace, and that conditions can be specified for classes of offenders, for example, for juvenile offenders that a particular curfew is observed. That is all that is envisaged.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I still say that including the phrase "classes of persons" is wrong because it brings into the Minister's consideration the type of crime that has been committed by the person in question. Why specify? Surely the type of rules the Minister of State has mentioned with regard to juvenile offenders can be taken into consideration under the other provisions in the Bill and do not need to be spelt out here. In arguing against the amendments proposed by me and other Senators, the Minister of State has resisted specifying too much in the legislation, yet now he seems to be making an exception and I wonder why as it is unnecessary. Maybe I exaggerated slightly the impact of the phrase but it does start to differentiate between types of offender and that is the wrong approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I am in some difficulty here because I am not aware of the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission. The commencement section reads, as the Senator indicated, in the future tense that the Act "shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may by order appoint". Senator Terry's amendment would replace that with the present tense "The Act comes into operation on such day as the Minister may by order appoint" or as Senator Terry used the expression, the active voice as distinct, I assume, from the passive voice.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I am not clear whether the Law Reform Commission recommendation suggests that the active voice should be used in place of the passive voice. The provision is a standard commencement provision and is the standard wording used and favoured by the Parliamentary Counsel's office. A random survey of ten Acts enacted over the past six years shows that the wording "shall come into operation" is the only wording used in the commencement section of that legislation and I would instance the Bail Act 1997, the Criminal Law Act 1997, the Freedom of Information Act 1997, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, the Adoption Act 1998, the Criminal Justice Act 1999, the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, the Competition Act 2002 and the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">That said, the Senator's point is interesting and there is need for dialogue between the Law Reform Commission and the Parliamentary Counsel's office and for reflection by the office on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission regarding the use of the active voice.

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_274">I thank the Chathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to open the debate. I want first to congratulate the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for bringing forward its report. The joint committee has been very active in a number of areas and has a considerable workload. I congratulate the chairman and also the members.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Reports such as this could not be brought forward without the members and the executive of the committee devoting much time to it, and I thank them for that. I congratulate and acknowledge the significant input of the chairman, Deputy Noel O'Flynn, and also Senator Kathleen O'Meara, who acted as rapporteur to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Today's debate is timely as my own review of radio licensing in Ireland, which I announced some time ago, has moved on apace. I will provide the House with some details of it later, and the committee's report will inform that review as it is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The committee's report deals with the subject of the licensing of local radio. As Members are aware, licensing of local radio services is a particularly sensitive matter. The Oireachtas has determined that licensing decisions should not be taken by politicians but by an independent regulator. I agree with that principle. It is important for the political system, and the Oireachtas specifically, to actively engage in the development of the policy in this area. When I say the Oireachtas has already decided that the decisions should not be taken by politicians, that works both ways. As I have said repeatedly, a Minister should not interfere in the granting of licences but, equally, a Minister should not even be seen to interfere in decisions made by the independent regulator. Senators and Deputies will be aware that there have been people and concerns who have been unhappy with decisions made by the independent regulator, as set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas, but people have endeavoured to lead in deputations to me as Minister in order to complain about the decision of the independent regulator. I repeat that people cannot have it both ways. If we want an independent system, it has to be independent in all its facets.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Local radio is a somewhat recent phenomenon. It is only 15 years since the Radio and Television Act 1988 was enacted to establish the Independent Radio and Television Commission. This was the legislation that paved the way for the licensing of local radio services. The first services were then licensed in 1989.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The story of local radio has been a great success. Anyone from rural areas in particular would know that. It is more a rural than an urban phenomenon, but not exclusively. Indeed, it has changed the way many of us politicians have operated over the past 15 years or so. The sector has developed beyond all our expectations. The people have been offered a new alternative. Local radio has provided a new forum of high quality programming that is of relevance to specific local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The analysis and recommendations of the joint committee's report are based on views set out by licensed radio stations and as such represent one analysis of licensing policy and processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Of the stations that responded to the committee's request for information, the majority indicated that they were happy with the existing licensing regime. Licence holders accept the need for independent regulation and have generally commended the increased level of consultation they enjoy with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. In that regard, I thank and congratulate the chairman and the previous members of the existing Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Many special interest and community stations singled out the commission for praise for its support for new and small stations starting up. The committee report also highlights issues of concern identified by the local radio sector in relation to the commission's processes and procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Respondents to the committee have sought greater transparency with regard to licence application analysis. Applicants have raised issues around the cost of making an application for a licence. Some applicants have questioned the need for any licence renewal process where operations appear to be running smoothly, and a number of operators have also raised issues around programme diversity and challenges in radio station ownership and control.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The report includes a very informed historical analysis of the developments in local radio since the Radio and Television Act 1988. Drawing on this analysis and from the views of radio station operators, the committee's report makes a number of recommendations. These relate to transparency, possible appeals processes, application costs, alternatives to existing application processes, licence non-renewal issues and ownership issues. All of these matters are discussed in some detail in the report. These recommendations and the analysis underpinning them will be considered by the review I am undertaking in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I want to select two of the issues addressed by the report to demonstrate the complexity of this area. The report addressed the issue of licence rollover and an appeals process. On the licence rollover, an argument can be made that where an incumbent has met all licence conditions and provides a high quality service, there is scope for an automatic renewal. The outcome would be that the public in the franchise area concerned would continue to have a local radio service that they valued. However, there would be a possible downside to that. If the licence was open to competition, it is possible that another provider would come forward with an even better offering. The approach adopted must always be informed by what is best for the audience and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">At present, appeal of a licensing decision is restricted to an appeal on grounds of process only. Like the committee, I see merit in a broader appeals mechanism, as I have said publicly. I accept that developing such a mechanism could prove a difficult task. Getting the balance right could prove difficult. If a body is charged with making licensing decisions, that body should decide who is awarded a licence. If too broad a power is provided to an appeals body, the appeals body could, in effect, become the licensing body. Notwithstanding the complexity of the matter, it will be a central issue to be addressed in the review being undertaken by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The committee's report approached the subject of licensing local radio services from the perspective of the experience of local radio stations in Ireland. In some quarters, this approach might be criticised on the basis that it would not provide balanced analysis. I am of the view that the approach adopted by the committee was useful. The committee's report offers a particular perspective on the subject and has contributed to opening up debate on this topic. The views of those who have been licensed are articulated clearly in the report. Since the report was published the committee has continued the debate in a useful and thorough session with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I have no doubt that as my own review progresses, the committee will return to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I now turn to the review being carried out by my Department. During the summer I announced the terms of reference for my review. The review will consider the processes through which radio licences are awarded. It will consider the local radio sector but will also consider the question of national, regional and community licences. The review will also consider the policy objectives that underpin Ireland's approach to licensing radio services.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I recently appointed expert external advisers to provide me with independent analysis on a range of relevance to this review. The task of the advisers will be to review the processes through which radio licences are awarded in Ireland having regard to comparative international experience and to make recommendations on the licensing of services in the future. The first task they have been asked to consider relates to the objectives of radio licensing in Ireland. They have been asked to describe the current objectives of radio licensing; evaluate whether there is a need to revisit objectives having regard to changes in Irish society and in broadcasting markets; and to consider the existing power of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, including its powers to decide the type of services to be provided and franchise areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The advisers will also consider the processes through which licences are awarded and will describe and evaluate existing licensing processes; evaluate existing roles of the executive of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and of the commission itself; evaluate the need for independent or outside expertise in the licensing process; and explore options for an appeals mechanism in relation to licensing decisions. There are also issues around who and what can be licensed, the terms of the licences and how difficult it is for new entrants to emerge. The advisers have been asked to consider what and who should be licensed; terms of existing and future licences, including duration; issues of licence rollover; and barriers to market entry. Clearly, many of these issues pick up directly on the report of the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The final task the advisers have been asked to reflect on is the existing policy interface. I see this as an integral and important part of the review. I am on record as stating that I am specifically ruling out the possibility of any increased ministerial or political involvement in the licensing process. Political interference or involvement in licensing decisions is simply not an option. As long as I am Minister, as I said earlier, I will not countenance such interference on either side of the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I am strongly of the view, however, that there has to be an ongoing political role in reviewing and developing policy. The review will consider how these two objectives can be best achieved. I have asked the external advisers to report to me by the end of this year. I will then publish the report and consult widely on its findings. It is important we plan now for the next 15 years given that we have had 15 good years since the original set up was put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We need to consider the experience to date, see what lessons can be learned and take stock of the current range of services on offer. We also need to look outward and draw on the experiences of other European countries and consider how they have developed independent radio. Most importantly, we need to plan for the future to ensure we maximise the quality and range of listening opportunities for Irish audiences. Again, I congratulate the committee on its work and its initiative in bringing forward this report. I look forward to today's debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I thank the Government side for allowing this debate in such a speedy fashion. I only asked for the debate last week. It is extremely useful and I thank the Minister for coming to the House. He is clearly familiar with the report and, as he pointed out, the committee has had a thorough discussion with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on its findings, a discussion which will probably continue. The role of the Seanad is important in such a discussion. We have had this discussion at the joint committee but this debate gives us all, including the Minister, myself as rapporteur to the committee and members of the committee, an opportunity to hear a wider range of views on this issue which is important to the Minister's brief and to us as public representatives. As the Minister said, local radio has been successful and the last licensing round generated a certain amount of controversy. In light of the Minister's review, the report is timely and is proving useful. I welcome the Minister's open attitude to our discussion so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">As I pointed out at the joint committee during our useful exchange with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland two to three weeks ago, a local radio licence is a valuable and scarce resource. The entire country is covered by successful, well run, popular and commercially successful local radio stations. In rural areas, in particular, people feel close to and a sense of ownership of their local station. We, as legislators, must take account of the importance of local radio in the lives of the people we represent and to the general political and social life of the country. In that regard, the question of the changing and granting of licences is extremely important. I agree with the Minister that it should be an independent power awarded to an independent body, but the main issue which arose in our deliberations was that of an appeals mechanism against the decisions of an independent power.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I make an important distinction between the issue of independence and accountability because the granting of a licence is a powerful role for anybody. The Oireachtas has given the BCI this role. We set it up and we have given it the power to award and, indeed, take away licences but it is necessary to review how that is going. The issue of an appeals mechanism was considered important and I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the establishment of an appeals mechanism in the new legislation. We are not talking about setting up another layer of bureaucracy. It is not our intention to take the power of decision from the BCI and give it to another body. Our intention is to ensure there is general agreement abroad that there is accountability of decision making. The whole question of the transparency of the decision-making process is linked and is important in its own right. People have to know, particularly when the decision affects them, be they the owners, workers or listeners of the station, that the decision was made in a transparent way and that there is accountability for the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">We suggest an appeal mechanism whereby an eminent person could arbitrate in the event of a dispute. We are not suggesting a permanent superstructure to mirror the BCI, but the possibility of calling on an appeals mechanism when, or if, it was necessary to do so. The circumstances in which an appeal could be made against a decision of the BCI should be limited. It should not be the case that people who are unhappy with a decision of the BCI could immediately go running off to appeal it. The Minister, without any disrespect to our colleagues in the legal profession, would accept that having no recourse except to the legal structure for an appeal is essentially limited, as one can only raise points of law. In such a case, one cannot make the broader argument one may need to make. It is an extremely useful proposition and I hope the Minister will have an open approach to it when he is drawing up the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The other issue that has arisen in our discussions is transparency, to which there are two elements. The manner in which information given to the commission by a proposed licence holder containing data on audience figures could be, and probably should be, independently assessed with a scoring system whereby applicants are marked and assessed. That should be done in a very open and transparent manner. Also, the examination of that data should be done with the necessary expertise. If that is not available on the commission or among its membership or staff, it should be acquired, with the results of that process being transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The deliberations of the members of the commission at the point of decision on a licence application should be open and transparent and the legislation should ensure, in the event of an equality of votes on the commission, the chairman would preserve the <i>status quo</i>. Though I do not have a definitive view on this, perhaps the Minister would consider this in the review. It would be useful, because in this House and many other bodies, where there is an equality of votes we are used to the chairman exercising his vote to retain the <i>status quo</i>, rather than making a change.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The role of co-operatives in local radio needs to be raised, as there is a fear or perception in some quarters that they are not suitable vehicles for the running of a commercial station and that they are more suited to the running of a community station. We have received an assurance from the BCI that this is not the case. However, coincidentally this year it was co-operative-run stations that lost their licences. In the case of Tipperary Mid-West, the licence has become a community rather than a full commercial licence. We need clarification on that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Co-operatives have served this country extremely well over the years. They have modernised and met the new commercial imperatives that have developed. There are some powerful and impressive co-operatives, such as Kerry Co-op, operating effectively on a global basis. I hope we are not looking at a situation where co-operatives are considered not to be the correct vehicle for running a radio station. I hope that what happened this year was pure coincidence and that more explanations will be offered on why we have seen the removal of co-operatives from the commercial radio business.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I look forward to hearing the views of other Members. It is an important issue in a general sense, not only in those areas in which our constituents have been affected. Local radio is such a critical part of our social life it should be given the attention it needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_303">As a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am delighted to have this opportunity to discuss this report on local radio and the licensing process. It is particularly appropriate that we should be doing so in the Seanad, as the rapporteur for the committee is a Member of the House, Senator Kathleen O'Meara, and I compliment her on the great work she has done in researching the huge volume of information, contacting the various local radio stations, collating the results so clearly and effectively and publishing this excellent report. I should point out that there was cross-party support within the committee for this report and I am quite sure this will be reflected in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Even if this report was not before us today, we should be discussing local radio, as the system has been in existence, legally, for 15 years. Stations have settled into a pattern and have created their own place in the media and our population. It is time to look back and reflect on the success of what was an entirely new medium, or at least a new version of an old one, which was designed to be closer to the people, particularly in provincial areas. We can also look at the shortcomings which have come to light along the way, though it is clear that the successes and advantages of local broadcasting far outweigh any arguments we might be able to find against it.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">When local broadcasting was first introduced, or at least when it was first put on a legal footing, very few people could have foreseen the great success it has turned out to be. Certainly, there were those who, for a variety of reasons, would have liked to gain access to the people of their region for the promotion of community items, advertising a product, or just expanding an audience they might have had through theatre or the print media, but the vast majority of our people would have been unaware of the huge potential of this new opportunity, even though the then pirate radio stations were quite successful at a variety of levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Some of the local radio stations have turned out to be hugely successful, reflected in the very large sums for which some have changed hands through the years. Everyone, for one reason or another, probably has a different way of looking at these stations from the time they were set up a decade and a half ago. Quite obviously, the number and size of the bids for some of the stations demonstrates that there is a high level of interest in the sector among the business community and investors now wish to get involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I wonder at this stage if the market should be allowed to dictate what is happening. Perhaps the time has come to make more licences available and allow the market to decide which of them succeed or fall by the wayside. There would, of course, be a problem with the radio spectrum which is available for transmission purposes in each area and in any event this is not what this report primarily addresses. Another reservation is in regard to quality of programming. We would not want stations just to pander to the interests of the spending population, or any single interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">In any debate about local radio, one would always have regard to the service in one's own area. The people of Waterford and environs are fortunate to be served by a station of the calibre of WLR FM, which has consistently high independently produced national ratings and which is a mirror image of many other stations throughout the country. The station's programming is of a consistently high quality, covering wide interests, and its schedule takes account of local needs in precisely the manner first envisaged for the stations. In common with a number of other stations, WLR FM has built up huge expertise in various elements of broadcasting, including news, sport, current affairs, music and special interest areas. It has also discovered local broadcasting talent which might never have emerged otherwise and has contributed household names to the national radio and television stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Most importantly, the local radio stations have given access to the airwaves to people and interests for which the national stations could never hope to cater. In the main, local stations have become what they were intended to be – vehicles for expression at community level all over Ireland. I am pleased that WLR FM is the first and only radio station to have provided its own purpose-built studio and administration complex since RTE went to Montrose over 40 years ago. This is now shared by Beat 102, a regional radio station which came on the air this year and is proving very popular among its target audience. This new station is an experiment which is being closely watched by the BCI and the rest of the country and could well be the model for other stations in time. WLR FM is the kind of success story dreamed about when local radio was first set up 15 years ago and since then it has discharged its mandate fully and responsibly.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">We must remember that some of our radio stations are less commercially driven than the majority and that there are community and special interest stations for which there is a place and which must be catered for in society. Recognising that they must survive financially too, community stations can derive up to 50% of their income from commercial activity. If there is a broadcast area which seems to prefer its community radio and where it thrives better than its fully commercial counterpart, the choice of the people should be respected and accepted. I wonder what the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is doing as it seems to be phasing out community stations in favour of the commercial sector. If that is its policy, it should spell it out clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The situation in Kilkenny, where the licence of the community radio station has not been renewed, is a case in point. Since I represent a neighbouring county, I have better knowledge of this situation than others elsewhere. Greater clarification needs to be given by the BCI on why Radio Kilkenny and the other stations are losing out to what are seen as purely commercial interests. It has created unease, at the very least, in various areas and the BCI should move to clarify its thinking and operate in a more transparent climate. I realise this matter is <i>sub judice</i> and I do not wish to prejudice it in any way. However, we have privilege on such matters in the House and while I do not wish to abuse that by excessive comment, these cases highlight more than anything else a greater need for transparency in the affairs of the BCI.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">One of the fundamental recommendations of our report is that an appeals mechanism should be put in place for those who have lost their licences. However, for whatever reason, the BCI does not seem to agree with this stance. There needs to be an individual body or board, totally independent of the Minister, the Department and the BCI, to which an appeal may be made and which will give the aggrieved party an adequate and impartial hearing. The only avenue available at present is the higher courts and this is much too expensive for the bodies which administer community radio. Appeal systems are in place for lesser bodies in other fields of enterprise which feel aggrieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">As a genuine and tangible element of a local community, its own radio should be able to have its say and its day, without having to enter a very complex and expensive legal process. However, I accept the Minister's point that such a new independent body could become the licensing authority itself. That is something which can be thrashed out and I am sure it is not beyond us to come up with some form of proper and enforceable appeals mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">In the context of transparency, it emerged during our deliberations that the BCI does not commission any independent research. This might well improve the level of its knowledge and the quality of its service and it is worth examining.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The report suggests a quota for local programming. It is clear that some stations make more of an effort at increasing the level of their home-produced content than others and we should actively encourage this area. I realise that programme making, by its very nature, is costly and that sharing is an attractive alternative. However, perhaps we should consider such a stipulation as an element in the issue of a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The automatic rollover of a licence should also be considered, particularly in the case of a station which has fulfilled its remit, produced good programming, looked after its community and listenership, complied with all regulations and maintained a quality station. There is no reason, if there is no other bona fide contender for the licence, that the operating station should be put through the demanding, expensive and time-consuming procedure of re-applying for its licence. In such cases, there is a strong argument for automatic renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I regret that time constraints prevent me from raising other important issues in regard to local broadcasting, but I have no doubt that they will be dealt with in the contributions of other Members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I welcome the Minister to the House. As a member of the joint committee, I acknowledge the great work Senator O'Meara put into the report, which opened the debate about radio licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">At the outset, the BCI complained that it was not consulted about the report. However, the objective was to have consultations with the radio stations to see how the procedures and mechanisms were working and whether they had any criticisms in regard to the licensing system. Some 65% of the stations indicated that they were happy with the operation of the BCI, while others had reservations.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">It is understandable that reservations were expressed, having regard to the backdrop against which the report was formulated. There was a furore in various areas in regard to stations with existing licences whose renewal applications were unsuccessful. A classic situation pertained in regard to North West Radio when the seemingly successful station was unsuccessful in renewing its licence, which was instead granted to Ocean Radio. Ocean Radio carried out market research, the results of which presented North West Radio as "drab, unexciting, old.", etc. This was unjust and was taken up by the station's listenership, some 7,000 of whom, as Senator MacSharry is aware, marched in Sligo to support it. This station was a classic example of the efficiency and success of local radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Local radio is truly local and has begun to outstrip RTE in recent surveys. At 86%, Ireland has one of the highest listenership rates for local radio in Europe. All politicians like the oxygen of publicity and turn to local radio to communicate with people. The Cathaoirleach and I are fortunate to have Limerick 95 FM, a successful radio station with a large listenership. There are also a number of other stations in Limerick which are classified as pirates and cause concern to certain people. However, they seem to serve a niche market and many constituents ask why some of these stations cannot be left on the air. Many of the local radio stations are geared towards a mainstream audience which is sometimes pop music oriented towards the 18 to 35 age bracket.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Quite often, the older generation is precluded from listening to the radio because the type of music that is entertaining for them – mainly traditional or country and western – is unavailable. However, various radio stations are now trying to identify and capture such niche markets. From time to time, the ODTR closed down radio stations by removing their antennae, although they could be reactivated later.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I agree with Senator Kenneally that radio wavelengths are subject to restrictions for the purpose of conformity but there is a contradiction in talking about liberalisation for other areas while this does not apply to radio licences. At the end of the day, consumer choice will dictate what radio stations are being listened to. If such a liberalisation came about, and assuming the radio band widths could cope with it, one would find legitimate stations capturing certain niches. If the type of music played on local radio stations is not entertaining for older people, are we right to deprive them of a chance of listening to the music of their choice? I have received telephone calls from elderly people asking me if there is any possibility of restoring a radio station that has gone off the air. They are extremely concerned about it, even though such a station may have been put off the air quite legitimately by the authorities. That is one dilemma concerning unlicensed radio stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Looking at a recent licensing case, three board members of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland voted for North West Radio, and three for Ocean, while the chairman gave his casting vote in favour of Ocean. Seven people were involved. When the broadcasting legislation was enacted in 1988 none of us could have realised the sums of money that would later be spent in purchasing local stations, which have turned out to be massive money spinners. Given the sums spent on these takeovers and the advertising revenues involved, the legislation should have included a clawback for the State. If a radio station is sold for €20 million or more, which has happened, would it not be legitimate for the State to receive 20%, which may be reinvested in the radio network? In drafting the original legislation, we never realised that millions would be made from lucrative local radio stations but that has happened around the country. One may say that the original investors took a risk in 1988 but there is a huge disparity between the amount they invested and the revenues accrued through takeovers since then. That disparity is not compatible with the consumer price index. One may say good luck to those millionaires but there should be some mechanism in the legislation whereby the State can claw back a certain percentage for the development of the radio network.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The furore over the licence bids by North West Radio and Ocean FM proved the necessity for an appeals system. The BCI cannot be expected to hear an appeal against an original decision it has made. In the interests of objectivity and fairness, and because such investments are so lucrative nowadays, a mechanism for appealing against licensing decisions is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I sympathise with certain radio stations that have lost their licences. Senator Mansergh and myself were interviewed regularly on Tipperary Mid-West Radio, which was servicing a useful niche market in south Tipperary and south Limerick. People listened to that station's chat programmes, which I found very interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Earlier this year, some 47 expressions of interest were made concerning the provision of local TV licences. That will be an important development for the future.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_328">I welcome this opportunity to comment on the Fifth Report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, focusing on the licensing system for local radio stations. As a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources I was delighted to be associated with the excellent work of Senator O'Meara in drawing up a report on the licensing of local radio stations by the BCI, specifically examining the response to local radio stations themselves to the most recent round of licensing.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I am pleased that the objectives outlined by the committee in advance of the report were met. These objectives were comprehensive and important targets and I would like to pay tribute to Senator O'Meara for her excellent work as the rapporteur. Before the committee began its report it was agreed that the aims should include an assessment of the opinions and experiences of the licensing system by local radio stations. This ensures that the report is representative of those affected by licensing procedures and gives an insight, which is necessary to draw up effective legislation to deal with the problems identified during the course of this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Following consideration of the concerns of local radio licensees, the report made nine recommendations. The first recommendation is to establish an appeals mechanism and I am particularly pleased with this suggestion as most other independent licensing authorities have the facility to appeal their decisions. The need for an appeals mechanism was exemplified in the cases of North West Radio and Radio Kilkenny, which, following the decision to revoke their licenses, were unable to appeal the verdict. I fully understand that should any appeals mechanism be implemented, it would not be retrospective.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">As a representative of Sligo, which formed part of the area served by North West Radio, it is important for me to make a few points concerning this matter. I fully respect the decisions of the BCI and the criteria it must follow, which were laid down by the legislation in the first place. I also acknowledge the tremendous work that North West Radio did over 12 years in building up a business which was hugely successful and important to the local community. I also acknowledge that the application by Ocean FM, which won the licence, must have had – as was duly decided by the BCI – a better set of criteria in order to win. It is, however, hugely regrettable that an appeals process did not exist then. I appreciate that the process being proposed cannot be retrospective, it is a shame that it could not have been in place before now. It would have given NWR the opportunity to appeal against the licensing decision without having to pay extortionate fees in the courts. The high cost of legal fees would prohibit many local stations from taking that course.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The situation of stations, such as NWR and Kilkenny Radio, which have had their licences withdrawn, should not be emulated by other stations subject to decisions by the licensing authority. I welcome the report's recommendation for more transparency and for the provision of an appeals process in the awarding of local radio licences. I am glad that this appeals facility will not be governed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland but that a non-judicial, independent body should adjudicate appeals in relation to licensing decisions. The report's provision for this independence is desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I do not want to imply in any way that I am critical of the BCI. In fact, I pay tribute to the excellent work it has done since its establishment but I agree with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that changes in licensing procedures are timely. The Minister has ruled out any increase in ministerial involvement. This is because there is an existing framework which, in the main, has proved to be very successful, whereby licensing decisions are made by an independent regulator. I am pleased that the Minister, upon receiving the recommendations of the committee, announced a review of the radio licensing regime. I agree with him that the time is now opportune to review the granting of local radio licences, given the forthcoming establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the conclusion of the present round of licensing. I am glad the Minister has recommended that the review procedure will be carried out using comparative international experience which will provide an insight into radio licensing processes leading to Ireland adopting the best practice observed. Like the Minister, I have concerns about cost, fairness and transparency in the radio licensing industry raised in the review of licensing systems in Ireland. There is a case for a reduction in the cost associated with the application for local radio licences and I am fully behind the suggestion in the report that cost is a major issue for licence applicants which has to be tackled as soon as possible. The current cost for a radio licence application is in the region of €80,000 and above. Considering that the communities behind local radio stations are operating on what are at times very limited budgets, I believe this fixed cost is a contributory factor to the establishment of pirate radio stations. The extortionate costs associated with the licensing of local radio stations must be curtailed and I am completely behind the committee's suggestion that cost may act as a deterrent to applicants. Therefore, alternative ways need to be examined to reduce the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I thank the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his proactive approach to radio licensing. After commencing a series of fundamental reforms to public sector broadcasting, the Minister is now concentrating on the reform of the independent sector. It would be easy for him to suggest greater ministerial interference or involvement as a means of reforming the licensing process, but I join with him in not supporting the removal of strong independent regulation in this area. The soon to be established Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will serve the interests of local radio licensees and licence applicants best.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I am very pleased with the report on local radio licensing drawn up by the committee. The recommendations suggested are comprehensive and desirable at this time. The time has come for the Department to conduct a review of the radio licensing procedures as a result of this report and as a consequence of the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I hope we will see the implementation of the recommendations suggested as soon as possible to improve the current local radio licensing procedures. I thank the Minister for his response to the report. Finally, I again pay tribute to Senator O'Meara for her tremendous effort in this report.</p>

          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_337">I welcome the Minister of State and I thank Senator O'Meara for bringing this issue to the House where we will have an opportunity to discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I want to refer to North West Radio and the good work it has done over the last 12 years since being awarded the licence to run the local radio station. There is no doubt that problems have arisen as a result of what has happened, particularly over the past two or three years in regard to licences being changed from one station to another. In my opinion and in the opinion of independent observers, North West Radio appears to have done the best job possible. It has been recognised as a local station in the real sense. Listenership figures have been increasing for 12 years, including 70% steady listenership over the past three to four years. It has done a very good job. Some 42 people are currently employed by the radio station. However, it was unsuccessful in its application, which we must accept, and we accept the BCI's decision. North West Radio was notified three months ago that it was not successful. Since the new licensees will not take over until September 2004, it is very unfair to the 42 employees of North West Radio to have to continue until then. It is difficult for these people to be motivated and keep the station at the present level. There should be a shorter time span between the old licensee leaving and the new licensee taking over.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">While there are ten members on the BCI board, only six people were present when the decision on North West Radio was taken. If there are ten people with different expertise on a board and four are missing, it means that four people with a certain amount of expertise are not present on the day a decision is taken. Given the decision of 3:3, plus the chairman's casting vote, it is no wonder those involved in North West Radio felt aggrieved. If a decision is to be made by a board, the least that can be done is that the full board is present when the decision is taken, otherwise no decision should be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I welcome the appeals process, which is necessary. It will give people who feel aggrieved, as in the case of North West Radio, a chance to appeal and a second bite of the cherry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_341">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, and the fact that there is a debate on this issue which is very important for many communities. I warmly congratulate Senator O'Meara on her report, which I broadly support and which appears to touch many of the main issues. While I am not a member of the joint committee, I sat in on the session a week or two ago when the BCI was present and there was a very interesting and worthwhile exchange of views.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">As the Minister pointed out, local radio has been a great success. It has made a marked contribution to the quality of life throughout the country. Despite the controversies, it was one of the main political achievements of the former Minister, Ray Burke, when he held that portfolio. Prior to that there had been a kind of stand-off as to whether it should be State owned, community or commercially run. Some of the controversies relating to that period contributed to the decision to keep the licensing process strictly on an arm's length basis. While I accept this, it creates difficulties in terms of accountability because if a community is up in arms over a decision, naturally they tend to turn to local politicians. The normal response would be for a local politician to go to the Minister but the Minister can do nothing except perhaps look at the way the system operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">A number of controversial decisions – I am not familiar with the ins and outs of decisions in other parts of the country – have provided an opportunity to look at how the system operates. This is what the rapporteur's report and recommendations deals with. She would have been well aware of the situation in mine and her part of the country when so doing. I agree with the comments about transparency and the need for an appeal mechanism. I do not know whether there are any other situations, such as exists in Mid-West Radio, where a licence is being withdrawn from the existing operator who is being put out of business. They were community in spirit, with a commercial licence, but there is now a question of getting a community licence. There are some considerable difficulties of transition involved in that. It was received at the time as a worsening of the terms of trade and it was believed it would create difficulties for employees and also in terms of raising enough income to operate. There is a comment in the report about the co-operative ethos and whether the BCI understands that. Without taking a position on that, in parts of the country, particularly in Tipperary, the co-operative ethos is important not just in terms of running the radio or the agricultural co-operative, but in many other facilities, including the Excel heritage centre in Tipperary. I hope that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I endorse what the report says about the objectives of the legislation, namely, that it would contribute to cultural and social discourse within the locality or community, build an even richer broadcasting sphere and increase the audience by different age groups, etc. Senator Kenneally made the point well when he spoke about it being a valuable force of expression within the community and giving people and organisations, which would not have access to the national media, a voice. A radio station such as Tipperary Mid-West provides a service to the community, particularly to older groups. My main concern is that under the new situation Tipperary Mid-West would be able to operate viably as a community radio without too much disruption. I appeal to the BCI to give every assistance in terms of the flexibility to operate and to raise income. I understand a portion of the licensing fee is devoted to such things as community radio. Attention should also be paid to the need for a corps of experienced employees. One cannot expect a community radio or any other activity to be run mainly on a voluntary basis or solely with FÁS workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I am not aware of other such transitions. I hope it will be a success once it happens. I also hope the BCI will give the maximum assistance and understanding to the people running Tipperary Mid-West radio in the transition which will be difficult for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_346">I congratulate all those involved in this report, including Senator O'Meara. This is a topical issue which has raised many hackles throughout the country. My colleagues on the other side of the House spoke about the west. However, the case in Carlow-Kilkenny has been equally controversial. Lessons must be learned from this process. The Minister was correct when he said he would rule out any ministerial interference in the future. However, there must be some scope for an appeals process because these licences are worth a lot of money. They could make a person wealthy overnight. The idea behind local radio is to give a voice to local people. We all know that little media coverage is given to places outside Dublin. Unless something happens in Dublin, it is not relevant. I am glad that local radio has allowed many of us to raise important local issues, which would not make it past the editor's desk in the Dublin media.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I regret the Minister did not say he plans to introduce an appeals process in the future. I hope he will consider that in the review currently under way. People deserve to know why they were unsuccessful in getting a licence. The lack of a full attendance at board meetings is also a concern. People feel aggrieved that decisions were made when only half the board was present and that the chairperson had the casting vote, which, in effect, meant two votes. That is not the way to do business. People do not mind if decisions go against them but they will be justifiably angry if they feel the decision is not fair. That is the case in Carlow-Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">We must learn from the current format. Every county should have its own radio station. Carlow shared a radio station with Kildare, but Kildare now has its own station. Carlow is now sharing a station with Kilkenny. Many people in Carlow would prefer their own radio station and I am sure the people in Kilkenny feel the same way. Although we are neighbouring counties and we get on well together, there are different traditions in the two counties. Kilkenny, for example, is a hurling county whereas Carlow is more interested in football. One of the main successes of a radio station in Carlow would be the sports coverage on Sundays. People in Carlow would tune in in their thousands to listen to the county final. I am not sure how the new station will work given that Kilkenny does not share the same football tradition. It would be better to have a radio station in every county because it would cover local issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">It is unsatisfactory that some radio stations must go to the High Court, the Supreme Court or the European Court of Justice to seek rulings and judicial reviews. That is why I urge the Minister to consider an appeals structure. It is also unfortunate that the assets of people who are unsuccessful in getting a licence, but who had a licence in the past, are devalued overnight. I am not sure what the solution is, but something must be done. I hope the current review will consider some of the issues I have raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I am intrigued by the use of the word "independent", which is often abused. How can the board be truly independent? It is only possible to have a truly independent board if it is made up of machines or computers because once human beings are involved, it cannot be independent. I am concerned about the background of some of the people on the board. There seems to be a bias towards barristers. While I have great respect for barristers, they do not know the answers to everything. It is important to have a board which will be able to make independent decisions in the true sense of the word while bearing in mind the broader picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I hope the Minister will consider an appeals structure. I also hope each county will have its own radio station. People should be told why they did not get a licence as that would leave them in a better position to apply for one in future. I hope local radio is not hijacked by commercial interests. It is ironic, given our history, that many of the radio stations in Dublin are owned by English or Scottish based companies. It is worth noting that 80 years after getting independence from England the main media group will have an English background.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_353">The report from the Oireachtas committee was timely. It is important that we have the opportunity to discuss this report, mainly because of the debate that has been taking place throughout the country, some of which is quite animated. There was much confusion about the future of existing radio stations and the method of granting licences. It is important to provide a focus in addition to the work being undertaken by the Minister. Much of the debate was to do with people's realisation of the potential of local radio. They had seen at first hand the results of many of the stations not only in terms of reflecting community aspirations and issues, but also in terms of the professionalism that existed in those stations. One of the biggest fears when local radio was initially established was that we would not have a professional service, but, by and large, we have been successful in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Local radio was established mainly to reflect the views of the community and provide a service for it. Before the introduction of local radio, a service was provided by RTE where an outside broadcasting unit would go to a town or area for a week, giving people the opportunity to design, produce and publicise their own programmes. That was the foundation of local radio, although RTE might feel that to some extent it was helping to put itself out of business. At that time there was a suggestion that RTE might also act as a service provider to those stations. There were arguments for and against this and the resources at RTE's disposal, the archive it built up over the years and its expertise in the area were taken into account. One of the strong arguments against the idea was that involving RTE might result in a return to a monopoly – we might only see copies of what was already available at national level – and that we would be defeating the purpose of local radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">One of my big fears in recent years has been the over-commercialisation of local radio and this issue has been central to much of the debate that has taken place. Local radio is seen more as a method of making money than providing a service. If that is the driving force of local radio, it does not bode well for the future. We will have more difficulties down the road. This worry was accentuated by some of the monopolies I have seen building up in recent years. Local newspapers are being bought up by conglomerates and to a large degree a monopoly is being created. In my own area, the <i>Tipperary Star</i>, <i>The Clonmel Nationalist</i> and the <i>Kilkenny People</i> have been bought and are now being run by Scottish Holdings. Members will have seen in the media in recent times that Scottish Holdings, UTV and others are eyeing a lucrative market. The more local radio stations are absorbed and controlled, the more we will return to the days before local radio. That was the fear we had of RTE becoming a service provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">It has already been mentioned that the radio station in my area has gone through some rocky patches in terms of viability but, through good leadership by many people, including the late Seán Kelly of the ICMSA, the station was turned around. This station epitomised for me what local radio was intended to be. There was community involvement in presentation and programmes. Nobody could be critical of the professionalism of the station and loyalty to it was built up throughout the years. We must achieve a balance between the loyalty and satisfaction of the local community and a pseudo-professional approach to the service. In the Tipperary case, the pendulum swung too far. It should have been possible for us to have ensured that the two stations there could continue and compete and possibly make the potential market a little less lucrative for a commercial takeover by one of the other stations, which seem to be adding many prizes to their baskets at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">We have seen examples of what I am talking about not just in Tipperary, but in other cases. If a station is offering a good service, reflects what we thought local radio would be, is viable, has a certain voluntary input and has loyal listeners, one would think we, as legislators making policy, should be happy with it. I am not talking about the commission but us as legislators. That is surely the result that everyone wanted to achieve, so I still cannot understand why this is happening. In many ways the commission does not set about explaining its decisions; there is not that type of transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Whatever the future holds, however, it is important that where there are genuine local community-based radio stations providing a good service, there is a way of ensuring that the big money is not capable of ousting them. We must ensure that the whizz-kids – I do not speak in a derogatory sense – do not hijack these services, because the service that is there when they take it over is not necessarily the one that will be there when they are finished. As someone who has supported and been directly involved in local radio right back to the RTE days, I would like to think that we will not dim the vision we had or lose the opportunities we have now.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_359">I join the Acting Chairman in thanking the Leader for arranging this debate so soon after we raised the issue in the House. I agree with much of what my colleague, Senator Browne, said. He spoke about what is happening in Kilkenny. I know there are difficulties in other parts of the country also, but, as a Kilkenny man, I am very conscious of the controversy that has arisen about the position of Radio Kilkenny and the fact that its licence has been withdrawn. Consistent JNLR survey results have shown that Radio Kilkenny has been one of the two or three most listened-to radio stations in the country. It is, and has always been, run on a co-operative basis by the community in Kilkenny and it has been by any measure an outstanding success. Senator Browne has outlined the importance of local radio so I will not rehash it, but we all know the significance of its role, especially in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">With regard to Radio Kilkenny, it appears the BCI decided to change the franchise area that existed between Carlow and Kildare. As Senator Browne pointed out, it decided that Carlow would be included with Kilkenny for radio licensing purposes. While I accept there are many cross-overs between Carlow and Kilkenny – in a political sense there has always been a relationship between Carlow and Kilkenny – how did the BCI arrive at its decision to divide Carlow from Kildare and, following on from that, to include Carlow with Kilkenny in the context of local radio? That is the nub of the issue from a Radio Kilkenny point of view and from where the problem arose. The question of franchise areas and how they are determined has not been properly explained. The BCI has work to do in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Other speakers mentioned the fact that many of the local radio stations and radio channels are being taken over by non-national companies, large conglomerates which have interests in other media sectors and in different industries. Radio Kilkenny was set up as a result of the community spirit there and its whole emphasis was on being a voluntary co-operative. The current situation where large conglomerates take over radio stations is highly undesirable and goes against the wishes of the founding fathers of local radio and those responsible for initiating the whole process of local radio. It flies in the face of the role local radio plays in local communities that large multinational entities are taking over and increasing their role in local radio.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The main point made by a number Senators revolves around the lack of an appeals process. Radio Kilkenny has gone the legal route and proceedings are ongoing in regard to its appeal against the decision of the BCI to remove its licence. It beggars belief in this day and age that a State organisation, which had such power and control, did not have a clear and well thought out appeals process. I am disappointed by what the Minister said because he gave a watered down commitment. In expressing support for the idea of an appeals process, he used the word "possible" to explain his position on the issue. If a situation such as that at Kilkenny Radio is not to arise again, it will be necessary to have a clear appeals process laid down.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I express my disappointment at the decision reached in regard to Radio Kilkenny, which has been a highly successful local radio station. I learned with regret that the licence was being removed from it. As Senator Browne pointed out when he mentioned football in Carlow and hurling in Kilkenny, it comes down to such issues. Up to now, Radio Kilkenny has been focused entirely on Kilkenny. The question is whether a radio channel which can play as important a role in the lives of people in Kilkenny can do so if it has to cater for two counties because counties Carlow and Kilkenny are very different. There is much merit in what Senator Browne said regarding the possibility of a radio station for each county. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_364">As the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Ahern, is not present I shall ask the officials to convey to him the views expressed here. I thank Senators who contributed to the debate and I thank the House for the opportunity to conclude the debate on behalf of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The subject matter is clearly of great public interest as evidenced by the quality of the contributions. I join previous speakers in congratulating the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for bringing forward its report. The Minister has asked me to point out that he wishes to acknowledge, in particular, the work of the committee chairman, Deputy O'Flynn, and Senator O'Meara in her role as rapporteur to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">When opening the debate the Minister detailed how the committee's report will feed into the review he is conducting. The Minister's review of radio licensing is a broad one encompassing radio broadcasting policy. It will consider issues surrounding the licensing of local radio services and it will, therefore, consider many of the issues addressed by the joint committee's report. The recommendations of the joint committee will feed into this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The review will look at the issue of local radio licensing from a range of perspectives, including that of the radio stations. It will also consider the approach to licensing radio services at a national, regional and community level. We have come a long way in a relatively short time. Less than a decade and a half ago we had no independent local radio services. Today, it is impossible to imagine a world without these services. Each one of us can tell our own tale of the key role our local radio station plays in our community. We can all point to individual examples of where the local radio station has made a real difference. More than anything else, it is in doing ordinary things that local stations have shone. Local radio truly has been about empowering local communities. The stories that matter to us in our day to day lives do not always deserve international or national coverage, but that does not mean those stories are not important to us. Local radio provides individual communities with the chance to tell their story and have their say. As the Minister said earlier, the story of local radio in Ireland has been a huge success. I agree with him that we should not be complacent. As policy makers it is our duty to ensure objectives are in place and strategies adopted to make certain the success story continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The review being conducted by the Minister has that objective. It will focus not only on the procedures and processes through which licences are awarded, but address some more fundamental issues. I also welcome this move. The review will take a step back and look at the bigger picture. It will consider what we have achieved in Ireland, but also look at the experience of other countries. I am sure there are lessons to be learned, both positive and negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">As we move forward we need to be sure our core policy objectives are appropriate for the Ireland of today and the decade ahead. We need to consider whether the range and categories of services available today best meets the demands of audiences. We need to consider and debate the categories and the number of services that should be licensed in the future. As the review progresses, no doubt there will be opportunities in this and the other House for further debate as well as in the local radio stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I congratulate the joint committee on its initiative in bringing forward the report. The officials will bring to the attention of the Minister the points raised in the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_371">I welcome the invitation to address the Seanad on the subject of aquaculture. I wish to avail of the opportunity to advise the House of the current state of the industry, its prospects for the years ahead and the action required if we are to ensure that its potential for further sustainable growth and development is to be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Aquaculture worldwide has undergone considerable expansion and development over recent decades. Growth since 1990 has been of the order of 10% per annum and the Food and Agriculture Organisation's 2002 report, State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, indicates that aquaculture is growing more rapidly than any other animal food sector. Production, including aquatic plants, is estimated by the FAO to have reached over 45 million tonnes in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Like the industry worldwide, Irish aquaculture has undergone extensive change and expansion over recent decades. If we look back to 1979, production in that year is estimated to have been of the order of 4,000 tonnes and was made up in large part of native oysters, bottom-cultivated mussels and trout. By 2002, however, production had increased to some 62,000 tonnes, valued at €117 million. Some 90% of this production was exported. This is equivalent to 1,600 full-time jobs in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">In 2002, production comprised 38,000 tonnes of shellfish, valued at €30 million, and 24,000 tonnes of finfish valued at €82 million. Shellfish production has seen the emergence of new areas of production, including rope cultivation of mussels as well as Pacific oysters. Finfish production now consists primarily of the farming of Atlantic salmon.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">We have now reached a stage where the industry plays a central role in the economic life of many periphery coastal communities, where there may be few, if any, alternative employment opportunities. The Operational Programme for Fisheries, 1994-99, played a key role in supporting its development in the last decade through the provision of €15 million in EU and Exchequer funding. Over the lifetime of the operational programme, the value of the industry's output rose from €51 million to over €87 million. Notwithstanding the considerable growth that has taken place, the industry is widely accepted as having the potential for further growth and development. For example, a report prepared by consultants engaged by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, CIRCA, predicted that output could grow very substantially over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Recognising this further potential, the national development plan provided over €30 million in EU and Exchequer grant assistance for the industry over the period of the plan. This assistance is carefully focused on the achievement of a number of core objectives, including the attainment of critical mass in the production of key species, the implementation of quality improvement programmes, the promotion of diversification and the introduction of new technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Achievement of the industry's potential will require a committed approach on the part of the industry to seizing the available opportunities, as well as the effective discharge by the State bodies concerned of their specific regulatory and developmental responsibilities. The industry must be market-driven, focused on producing top quality output that meets demanding consumer requirements and is capable of holding its own in highly competitive international marketplaces. It must also show itself to be responsive to changing circumstances. This means, for example, that it must be open to possibilities such as new production methods or diversification.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Rather than relying on a straight-line expansion of existing means and areas of production, the industry must be prepared to consider possibilities such as the farming of new species and the adoption of innovative farming techniques and practices. In the case of finfish farming, this could mean looking to species such as cod or sea bass and to the possibilities of offshore production. The State will, through IBM, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Marine Institute, continue to play an active role in supporting and assisting the industry as it grows and develops.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">It is clear also that the industry's potential can only be realised, and the future of existing operations secured, if it develops and operates on a sustainable basis and in accordance with high standards of environmental and ecological protection. As a natural resources based enterprise that is itself crucially dependent on a high quality environment, the industry has a particular responsibility to ensure that its operations are conducted in accordance with appropriate environmental standards and the relevant statutory requirements. Failure to do so could, apart from the serious legal issues involved, damage the reputation, competitive position and future prospects of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The State, for its part, has an important role to play in determining where aquaculture should be allowed and in ensuring that appropriate management and operational conditions are specified and enforced in respect of any operations that are permitted. These responsibilities fall to be discharged primarily through licensing of aquaculture operations and monitoring and control of licensed operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Aquaculture is regulated under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, which established a modern and effective licensing system for the industry. Applications for licences are made to the Department in the first instance and are determined by reference to considerations specified in the 1997 Act. These include the likely environmental and economic impacts of the proposal and the suitability of the waters concerned for the activity proposed. It is open to any person to make submissions on a licence application and anybody may appeal to the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board against a licensing decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">There is, therefore, an open and transparent process that ensures full account is taken of all considerations and points of view before a decision is made on the granting of a licence. Where a licence is granted, it is subject to specified terms and conditions. In the case of shellfish farming, for example, the conditions may include requirements as to the layout of trestles or longlines in the interests of visual amenity. Licences for finfish farms include conditions dealing with matters such as permitted production levels, site management, sea lice control, preparation of emergency plans and reporting of specified events.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Marine finfish farms must also comply with the terms of protocols promulgated by the Department, following consultation, in 2000. These cover matters including benthic and environmental monitoring, fallowing of sites and lice control. Monitoring and control of aquaculture operation is carried out by the Department, with the advice and assistance of the Marine Institute, to ensure that fish farming is conducted in accordance with the applicable standards and requirements. Marine Institute staff visit each finfish farm 14 times a year for the purpose of sea lice monitoring and control. They also carry out fish health inspections and operate a residues monitoring programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Fish farm inspections are also carried out by officials of the Department. For example, its engineering division has carried out inspections of 35 marine finfish sites to date this year. Farm operations are, in addition, monitored through reports and returns that operators must make to the Department, including the results of benthic monitoring.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I emphasised earlier the importance for the industry and for the marine environment of ensuring that aquaculture is conducted in full compliance with licence terms and conditions and other applicable requirements and standards. I am, therefore, concerned by recent reports of instances of alleged departures from the high standards required of aquaculture operations. The House may be assured that any such case will be fully and rigorously investigated and that appropriate action, up to and including revocation of aquaculture licences, where justified, will be taken in the light of the results of the investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">While it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on specific cases, I can inform the House, by way of example, that a specific instance of alleged inappropriate disposal of fish mortalities has been investigated and that the advice of legal services has been sought as to the further action that should be taken. A further major case of the apparent inappropriate disposal of fish mortalities and apparent breaches of aquaculture licence terms is currently under investigation and will be referred, as appropriate, for the advice of the legal services on appropriate action. I am determined that any other cases of this nature will be similarly investigated and followed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">In addition to the investigation of specific cases, I have instructed the Department to initiate a comprehensive review of the procedures in place for monitoring and control of aquaculture and marine finfish farming in particular. The objective of this exercise will be to ensure that appropriate monitoring, control and enforcement processes are in place in respect of all aspects of the industry and that they operate as efficiently and effectively as possible. The review will be carried out by a unit established for the purpose and will be completed as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Department is also, in parallel with this review of monitoring and control arrangements, examining overall structures for the delivery of regulatory services in respect of the aquaculture industry. This review is fully in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government to develop new devolved service structures to support the sustainable management, development and protection of the marine coastal zone and seafood resources. Proposals in this regard will be brought forward in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Voluntary initiatives such as quality schemes, management plans and codes of practice can play a significant role as a complement to formal monitoring and control and can also assist the industry by offering assurance to customers about operational practices and product quality. Third party accredited food quality assurance schemes, such as the Irish quality salmon, trout and mussel schemes, are already showing their worth. The aim should be to implement certification to EN 45001 standards right across the range of the industry's products.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems, CLAMS, process involves the drawing up on an open and consultative basis of management plans for aquaculture in particular bays or regions. CLAMS groups are in operation in 15 areas and nine plans have been published to date. More recently, an environmental code of practice, ECOPACT, has been developed specifically to assist the industry to conduct its operations in accordance with best environmental practice. The code of practice will be implemented through CLAMS groups in the first instance and will be extended from there to the industry generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">As Senators will be aware, some aspects of the aquaculture industry and its operations have been the subject of public comment recently. I wish to take this opportunity to clarify the position in respect of three of these matters, namely, sea lice at marine salmon farms, escapes of fish from those farms and the disposal of waste from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The complaints made against marine finfish farming include the alleged effects of sea lice from salmon farms on sea trout. This is an issue that has been hotly contested for many years, with the aquaculture industry and wild fishery interests taking fundamentally different positions as to the effects sea lice from salmon farms have had on sea trout numbers. While wild fishery interests have ascribed the decline in sea trout numbers primarily to infestation by sea lice from fish farms, the aquaculture industry has contended that no causal linkage has been demonstrated and that the sea trout problem is multifactorial in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Government, for its part, acted on a precautionary basis in accordance with environmental best practice and established a national programme for monitoring and controlling sea lice numbers at salmon farms. This system requires that action be taken at farm level when lice levels are much lower than the lice levels that would be tolerated without treatment in Norway or other countries. This programme involves 14 visits a year by Marine Institute personnel to each fish farm. If sea lice are detected at levels in excess of the very strict trigger levels that have been set in Ireland, the farm in question is required to administer appropriate approved treatment to the fish.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The monitoring and control system is well developed and allows remedial action to be prescribed at an early stage if it appears that problems are emerging with lice levels. I intend, however, to have the systems and procedures reviewed as part of the wider review of enforcement and control that has been initiated, with a view to ensuring that we have the best possible means of detection and control for the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Objections are also made against finfish farms on the grounds of the alleged effects of escapes from these farms on wild fisheries. Complainants argue, for example, that escaped fish interbreed with wild fish and contaminate the gene pool. There is an onus on fish farmers to take all appropriate measures to avoid escapes from their operations and to have plans in place for dealing with the containment of any escape that may occur. In the event of an escape, the fish farmer must notify the authorities and all possible steps must be taken to capture the escaped fish. The arrangements for preventing escapes, and for dealing with any that may occur, will also be examined in the overall review of enforcement and control arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">In regard to waste arising from fish farm operations, I emphasise that there is an unequivocal obligation on all fish farmers to have appropriate arrangements in place for dealing with the waste generated by their businesses. Furthermore, these arrangements must be such as to ensure compliance with the EU regulation on disposal of animal by-products and the related Irish legal provisions. This means, for example, that fish waste must, depending on its precise nature and how it arose, be disposed of by specified methods that include ensilement, composting and rendering. Any departure from the appropriate standards and requirements for waste disposal is a very serious matter and will be dealt with accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The Department is currently working with industry representatives and other public bodies in a group established to examine all issues relating to disposal of waste from fish farms. Key objectives from the Department's point of view will be to ensure that the group's work progresses as quickly as possible and that any recommendations it may make are aimed at maximising practicality and efficiency while also ensuring full compliance with the legal provisions governing the disposal of fish farm waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I wish to inform the House of the position in regard to fish mortalities in Donegal Bay. Reports were received in July that significant levels of fish mortalities were being experienced by salmon farms in Inver Bay, County Donegal. The Marine Institute was mandated immediately to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the situation, with a view to determining the cause of the mortalities. An extensive process of investigation and analysis has been undertaken since then by staff of the Marine Institute and other experts engaged by the institute. The investigation was widened to include McSwyne's Bay in August when it became apparent that significant mortalities were also occurring in that bay.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Despite the considerable time and resources that have been devoted to the process, it has not been possible to date to establish what caused the mortalities. The Marine Institute has held a number of meetings in connection with the investigation and issued a statement on 29 September to outline progress with this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">During September, it came to light that significant unreported mortality levels have also been experienced over recent months by other fish farms along the western seaboard. The Marine Institute was, therefore, asked during September to broaden the scope of its investigation to look also at what has happened at other locations and to seek to draw overall conclusions in regard to the increased mortalities generally. As the investigation is ongoing, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The aquaculture industry has experienced remarkable change and growth over the recent past and undoubtedly has the potential for further expansion and development. The challenge facing the industry is to select the development options that will best serve the achievement of this potential. Whichever options are chosen, it is clear that any development must be on a sustainable basis, have a clear focus on market opportunities and requirements and be able to meet exacting environmental and ecological standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Government, for its part, will continue to ensure that appropriate assistance and advice is available to the industry through the relevant State agencies. We will see to it also that there are efficient and effective systems and processes of licensing, monitoring and control, capable of ensuring the orderly development and operation of the industry in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">If it is apparent, following the various reviews and investigations that I have outlined, that changes are required to legislation or procedures or practices for monitoring or regulating the fish farming industry, these changes will be introduced without delay. Our objective is to ensure an environmentally friendly and sustainable fish farming industry, operating in harmony with other marine interests and providing long-term employment in coastal communities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_404">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statement. Shellfish farming and fish farming were first established about 25 years ago and the whole aquaculture field has been successful. The greatest success is that about 19,000 people depend to some degree on aquaculture. Many of these are in peripheral communities into which it would be difficult to attract industrial employment. The aquaculture industry supplies sustainable jobs and is worth about €40 million annually, a substantial amount. A recent report said that every euro of public funds invested in aquaculture yields €2.8. The recent CIRCA report on aquaculture predicted that by 2015 the industry would be worth €362 million at first point of sale and €625 million at processed output value. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 urges the salmon producers to raise the level to 40,000 tonnes per annum. The Norway-EU agreement on licensing helped to create stability in the market. Last December, however, an EU disclosure document found that it was wrong, anti-competitive, unworkable and an impediment to fair trade. As a result, in May of this year the Norway-EU agreement was abolished. Norway is the largest producer of farmed salmon in the world and a significant exporter. That agreement insisted that salmon could not be sold at EU level for less than €3.25 per kilogramme but that is gone now. The market is opening up to Norwegian and Scottish salmon with the result that prices are low. There is concern for salmon prices in the future. In a recent comment, Johnny Carroll, a prominent fish farmer, said that if prices remain chronically low into 2004 it will lead to a revenue blockage for most producers in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Irish Salmon Growers Association has been asking the Minister and his Department for labelling in accordance with EU directives. The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong but this has not happened yet. The consumer is entitled to transparency and to know from where the salmon has come. A knowledgeable person in Norway was asked recently if the marketplace opened up to Norwegian salmon how one could identify the salmon as such. He said it was labelled at first source but there was no guarantee that label would proceed all the way through. One can interpret that statement however one wishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The introduction of the Q label was important for the salmon industry. It was created between BIM, the Food Safety Authority and the Consumers Association of Ireland. There is a 90% participation rate in this quality mark which is important because it lets the consumer know that he or she is buying quality salmon. The Minister of State launched a voluntary environmental code of practice for aquaculture companies and traders, ECOPACT, on behalf of BIM, which is important because one of our great assets is a clean environment. He made the point that an industry dependent on a high quality environment</p>
          <p eId="para_407">has a particular responsibility to ensure that its operations are conducted in accordance with appropriate environmental standards and the relevant statutory requirements. Failure to do so could, apart from the serious legal issues involved, damage the reputation, competitive position and future prospects of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, on which many of us here present sit, several members expressed concern and some alarm about a recent "Prime Time" programme on television. Many people approached me about this because such a programme can damage the fish farming industry. There are certain questions to be asked about that programme. While I respect that there are ongoing inquiries, I note a comment, made at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in Killarney and quoted in the Sunday papers about cowboys in the aquaculture industry. I would like to see the full text of the Minister's words. I do not know to whom he referred or what he meant by that but many people are concerned. Johnny Carroll, whom I already mentioned, was identified in that programme. I respect the fact that in August Galway County Council visited that site near Casla where salmon were buried. We all know the bog can preserve butter for a long time so everyone would know that salmon buried in a bog would not necessarily decompose. If, for example, economic returns for salmon production are low there may be a tendency to take short cuts. The Minister of State said that as far as he is concerned people will conform to aquaculture regulations or pay the penalty. That sends out a very bad message. I respect the Minister's recent statement about An Post, the ESB and companies under his control, to the effect that in future he would lay the onus on their boards of directors to make sure they concern themselves with the profitability of their companies and to ensure that as directors they would furnish whatever tax clearance certificates are required. He spoke about greater responsibility. However, it will give a very bad impression if directors found to be involved in malpractice remain in place. Subsequent to the Minister's inquiries, if he discovers that, as stated in "Prime Time", Mr. Carroll was guilty of a serious offence will he take the decision or does he have codes of ethics that apply to boards of directors on his other semi-State companies? I am referring to the Marine Institute in this case and to BIM in Mr. Gallagher's case.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">If the Minister is to have credibility, and whatever his investigations reveal, it would be very wrong that as flag bearer for an organisation such as the Marine Institute, people who have been engaged in wrongdoing retain directorships. The Marine Institute's new headquarters are being established in Oranmore and by 2004 a total of 1,400 people will relocate there. The Marine Institute works at the forefront of the business, being involved in research. The organisation which represents people working in aquaculture would contend that I am perfectly correct in saying that this would not be good for the industry in the long term. I appreciate that may be concerns about profitability or taking short cuts. I look forward to a thorough investigation of what happened in Donegal and Connemara. When the committee comes to discuss this it will hear from various representative organisations and will ask them pertinent questions and invite responses. Following that "Prime Time" programme the industry needs to respond in a positive fashion and the measures which the Minister of State has articulated in his speech should be taken into account. People do not deserve to be directors of semi-State boards if they are identified as being involved in any untoward activity such as the programme exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">When I was in the Dáil I was spokesman on the marine and I always took an interest in the subject, especially in the development of aquaculture. This industry goes through turbulent phases and moves in cycles when prices are up or down but the arrangement with Norway gave us a good break on prices. People have to survive now in an open market.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">When the Minister of State mentions 14 visits a year to identify sea lice I am not sure what sanctions are imposed if the Department finds that sea lice are present in excessive quantities. This argument has raged for many years in relation to sea trout, particularly during migration in estuaries, usually between January and May. That is a critical time for the survival of this species, including the effects of sea lice. In such a situation the Department should invoke whatever sanctions are required. It is good husbandry practice to ensure proper treatment for sea lice infestation. I would be concerned with short cuts being taken for economic reasons. I am not saying that is happening but it could arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Regional fisheries boards are sometimes maligned by the organisations representing fin fish farming or farmed salmon. Usually they are asked for observations in relation to developments. In areas where there has been an excessive level of aquaculture, those involved in wild fishing contend that the number of sea trout has greatly diminished. Their comments are sometimes regarded as being negative and anti-jobs. In fairness, when they are asked for observations, they put forward their position as professionally as possible. It is necessary to ensure the survival of wild fish stocks in tandem with fish farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">A few years ago, I participated in a most interesting visit to Norway in connection with that country's aquaculture and fish farming operation, which I considered highly impressive. Despite its professionalism, Norway has also had incidents similar to those in Ireland, involving the escape of farmed salmon from their cages. That also gives rise to genetic concerns with regard to inter-breeding with wild fish stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">It is important to have a combined approach by all organisations concerned, including the Central Fisheries Board, the Irish Farmed Salmon Growers Association and so on. They must work together. In the final analysis, the environment is the important consideration. The wild salmon and farmed salmon sectors must be able to live in tandem. All of us recognise the importance of aquaculture and wish it to be a sustainable industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I referred earlier to positive developments in relation to the Q mark. As the Minister of State is probably aware, there is a matter of some concern within the Central Fisheries Board as it is understood that three laboratory people may be reassigned to the new research laboratory being established by the Marine Research Institute at Oranmore, County Galway. The board also has development personnel at various locations around the country – I understand the total number is 15 – who do a very valuable job, understand what is happening in communities and have long service in the Central Fisheries Board. There is concern with regard to these people being lost by that board to the Marine Research Institute in Galway, as I understand may be proposed. Any such decision should be looked at very closely in terms of the long-term interests of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The Minister of State and I have a common interest in securing a vibrant aquaculture industry and we also wish to have good environmental practices in operation. This is not an industry which can tolerate short cuts and I do not believe the representatives of the industry should or will do so. The end result would be a loss of credibility in the product on the part of consumers, with serious consequences for the aquaculture industry. I wish the Minister of State well in the investigations and I hope there will be a successful conclusion and no smokescreen or withholding of information. If people are found to have been wrong, it behoves the Minister to remove them from positions as directors of the relevant institutions on the grounds they are not conforming to best practice in the industry.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the fishing industry in general and the salmon farming industry in particular. Unfortunately, my allotted ten minutes will not allow me to cover all the ground I would like in relation to a complex issue and an industry of particular importance to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I congratulate the Minister on his great success in the negotiations in the European Council meeting last Monday in regard to the Irish Box. Before this meeting, people were very fearful of what the outcome might be in regard to Spanish access to our waters. We knew the devastating blow it would be to our industry if we were not able to maintain, in some fashion, the integrity of the Irish Box which has been so important to Irish fishermen over the years. From the media reports, it is quite obvious that the Minister played a very successful tactical game in the negotiations. When the fishing interests are able to acknowledge that the Minister gained a reasonably good deal, we can take it that he came home with the very best that was on offer. For those with such an interest and dependency on the fishing industry and the Irish Box in particular, this must mean they are aware of the tremendous success he has had. In contrast, the annoyance of the Spanish Minister, as displayed on television news reports, might be taken as a sign of our success, given the polarity of our positions on the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I do not agree with the criticism by a Fine Gael MEP, who stated that no fishing whatsoever should be allowed in the Irish Box. It is generally agreed that we must control the fishing activities of this region and the fishermen are in full agreement with that. They have a vested interest in controlling and preserving the industry into the future and a responsible attitude to the problem of dwindling stocks. I was also disappointed by the comments of the Labour Party spokesperson on marine issues, who appeared to side with the Spanish view. It was important that Spanish access to this resource did not increase and I am extremely happy this was achieved by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I now wish to address the salmon industry. One cannot discuss salmon farming without also referring to the wild fish sector. This has been the subject of a very extensive debate over the years. Salmon fishing in the wild is almost as old as Ireland itself. It is part of our culture and folklore and has been a way of life for many centuries. It is essential for us to retain as much of our traditional salmon fishing industry as possible, not least because much of it is based in those relatively remote areas of our country where our traditions and language are strongest. In many cases, it is the only employment available and, if fishing goes from these areas, there will be nothing left to sustain them and they will become a burden on the State. More importantly, their quality of life will deteriorate significantly. We must maintain our coastal communities where at all possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">It appears that if the officials of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources got their way in the morning, drift netting for salmon would be eliminated altogether. This would be devastating for those communities dependent on the industry and an unnecessarily harsh solution in the light of the relatively light catches which this element of the industry takes each year. I accept it must be closely monitored and reasonable quotas must be applied based on accurate data. The fishermen would be in agreement with this sensible approach, because they realise at this stage that the future of their industry is at stake and stocks must be preserved. They know, too, that priority must be given to allowing the salmon free access up-river to the traditional spawning beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I understand there are plans in the Department to ban drift netting at sea and confine it solely to the estuaries and rivers. This may be acceptable in some areas, but it will cause huge problems elsewhere. It will mean, for instance, that some fishermen in the salmon business will have to go elsewhere to fish and that alone will cause friction among the fishermen of the area and the new arrivals. There will also be an additional cost involved, not to mention very great inconvenience and hardship for some while others will be forced to leave the industry. I would not like to see any regulation in this respect being imposed, but if it is, at least the traditional estuary limits which have been in place for hundreds of years should not be reduced in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">On the question of conservation, the preservation of stocks and the calculation of quotas, I would like to see proper and reasonably accurate fish counters brought into our rivers. I am aware that has been introduced in relation to the Foyle at quite a modest cost of approximately €30,000. If one of these were provided in the Suir estuary, for instance, we would establish fairly accurate data on the numbers of fish going up-river to spawn. We could then set realistic quotas for the following year which, on the basis of the evidence would be more likely to be accepted by the fishermen and as a result a reasonable number of fish would survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I understand the Central Fisheries Board and its consultants recently undertook to speak with fishermen in all the fishing districts and to brief them on a questionnaire which was to be completed by the people in the industry. This happened in all districts except for the Waterford area. I am extremely annoyed by this and ask why the Waterford district was singled out and neglected. It is not good enough that Waterford was the only one of the 17 districts omitted. We are at the end of the salmon run. The number of days in which people can fish is down to four per week in June and July. Why are the industrious people in the Waterford area being ignored in this way? I call on the Central Fisheries Board to immediately redress this discrimination and state clearly and publicly the reason the Waterford fishermen were not given the information available to others and given an opportunity to have a proper input into the proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">It is accepted now, even by environmentalists, that properly conducted aquaculture could feed the world without polluting it. A favoured method of the environmentalists is the hard-walled pen system, which isolates the fish from the surrounding water in 40 foot deep tanks which catch their waste on the bottom. Although salmon farming has been a highly profitable industry for a number of decades and shows strong promise for the long term, profits are being squeezed today making it more difficult for operators to adopt more expensive eco-friendly methods.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">There is a place for this type of farming in our society as it has been several decades since there have been enough fish in the sea to meet, on a sustainable basis, the growing worldwide demand for seafood. Approximately half the world's wild fisheries have been exhausted by over-fishing. In the north Atlantic, one of the most depleted oceans, populations of popular fish such as cod, flounder, haddock, hake and tuna are one sixth of what they were a century ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Another benefit of salmon farming has been that, like other areas of food production, it has put a food on people's tables which had been generally denied to them in the past by its cost. It is now one of the most reasonably priced species available.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">While the principles of aquaculture are generally accepted, experts fiercely debate which types of fish farming are safe to pursue. Salmon farming can be a dirty business. A biologist who worked for 30 years for Canada's Department of Fisheries has stated that a large salmon farm can pour as much liquid waste into the sea as a small city. One can add to that the plague of destructive sea lice, which thrive in densely packed salmon pens, and the schools of farm-grown fish which inevitably escape to the open sea, spread disease and compete for food at the breeding grounds with wild stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Disease is always a problem among fish which are reared at close quarters. After a 1999 outbreak of infectious salmon anaemia in fish farms in Scotland, all the farm-grown fish within 25 miles were slaughtered. A similar anaemia in Maine, in the United States, two years ago led to the destruction of more than 2.5 million fish.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">We have had an incident closer to home in Donegal in the not too distant past, to which the Minister referred, when 100 tonnes of salmon died and were dumped illegally. This will inevitably cause problems in that area but worse still, nobody seems to know what killed them, which casts a cloud over the whole salmon industry. There are many who believe this is an enterprise which needs better regulation to ensure this type of incident does not occur again. I was glad to hear that the Marine Institute is continuing its investigations into what happened and I hope its findings will be published. Perhaps we should consider establishing an independent inspectorate separate from the Department, which I understand operates in some other countries, to issue licences and monitor the operation of all fish farms around our coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">There have been some differences between the fishermen and the aquaculture farmers, which is understandable but regrettable. We need to find ways of allowing the two industries become compatible and those involved to live in peace. It is a little like the old song from Oklahoma, "The farmer and the cowman should be friends". I would very much like to see these two important elements of the fishing industry being able to live in harmony and thrive for the benefit of the communities they maintain and the wider economy.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_432">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. I speak with a slightly different interest from many of those who contributed earlier, namely from the consumer perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I remember coming back on an aeroplane from a holiday in France five or six years ago and being served a nice meal containing meat, which I realised was the first meat I had eaten for two weeks. I had been away for two weeks and had eaten nothing but fish and I realised that does not happen with the customers in the supermarkets I run because the amount of fish we sell, which is perhaps large compared to others, is a small section of what is eaten. I realised this was a business opportunity and that opportunity had already been identified by the Irish fishing industry, particularly by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, because on a visit around that time to Paris I saw many fish restaurants on Boulevard St. Germain which whetted my appetite. I then discovered that the vast majority of that seafood was from Ireland. The Irish consumers did not see it in our supermarkets and were not nearly as tempted, which is the fault of our retail and fish industries and also the restaurant business.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">When I talk about the food people buy in supermarkets, a small portion is fish but in many restaurants, even the restaurant in Leinster House, fish makes up a sizeable portion of the number of servings. One can walk into a restaurant and realise that people eat fish when they are away from home but not necessarily at home. That is an opportunity for the fish industry and one which has been recognised by Bord Iascaigh Mhara and those involved in the fish industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Three years ago I was invited by Bord Iascaigh Mhara to judge the best oysters from the oyster farms.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_436">A pearl of wisdom.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_437">It was a very pleasant task. I remember travelling to Bord Iascaigh Mhara in Dún Laoghaire and, along with one or two others – one was Derry Clarke, the owner of L'Ecrivain, the lovely restaurant in Baggot street – being asked to taste 26 oysters. It was very well done. We had to examine each oyster from the 12 or 14 farms we picked in terms of how they looked, how clean they were, how easy they were to open, how they looked inside but particularly how they tasted. I realised that Bord Iascaigh Mhara and those involved actively recognised that if they were going to continue to export and expand that export market, they had to ensure they got everything right.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Senator Finucane referred to something with which I did not quite agree. He said a certain amount of damage was done recently to the fishing industry as a result of what I call some of the scandals that were exposed. It was not a certain amount of damage. The fishing industry is a delicate plant and he was being delicate with the words he used. A huge amount of damage is in danger of being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I think back to what happened to the beef industry on 26 March 1996. I had been listening to customers in our supermarket some years earlier, particularly the Dublin customers who talked about their concerns about pharmaceutical companies advertising on RTE radio, directed at the farming community and the beef industry, telling them what they should be injecting into their cattle and sheep or the stock they were producing to avoid certain diseases and so on. The customers, who were not farmers, were concerned about the food they were eating from simply listening to those advertisements directed at farmers by the pharmaceutical industry. Some of us in the business took steps to make sure a traceability system was put in place. When BSE was exposed in March 1996 we realised that not only could a certain amount of damage be done to an industry, but that a huge amount of damage was being done to the beef industry, particularly in Britain. We managed to avoid a great deal of that criticism but one can see considerable dangers, particularly to the fishing industry. It is a delicate plant. When one considers how much depends on confidence in the traceability system and in quality and on the public's awareness, we must be so careful if the public is to buy fish or seafood of any type, particularly salmon.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I was interested in and impressed by the amount of information the Minister of State gave us, some of which I knew already, particularly as regards the quality seafood programme BIM has instituted and how the auditing being undertaken is to ensure it is instilling confidence in the business. I know the auditors are recognised by the industry as being independent and without bias. However, we must go out of our way to ensure that independence is guaranteed and that there is not a danger of any suggestion that there is a bias or an influence. We must make sure there is a strong wall between those on the inside and those on the outside. I am confident that there is and that the quality seafood programme and the recognised certificate that is issued are being adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I understand that yesterday two of the ten sea farms were suspended for some form of misbehaviour. It is important that is done. We should, however, be aware that in doing so there is a great temptation to bend or stretch the rules a little because of the danger of letting customers down. Last week was interesting because tides were high, gales were strong and the swell of the sea was considerable and many of the boats were not able to go out to those fish farms. I know of one case where four pallets of fish were expected but only one pallet was delivered. It is tempting for those whose livelihood depends on this business to bend the rules in some form or other rather than tell their customer they must let them down. I hope that will not happen given the controls which have been put in place and the watch being kept, particularly by those issuing certificates only on condition that there is control.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Senator Finucane and the Minister of State mentioned the danger of farmed salmon escaping into the wild, mixing with wild salmon and damaging it. I am not an opponent of genetically modified organisms and do not say we must never move in that direction. We must start a balanced debate on that issue in the years ahead. However, I am frightened by what could happen given what I hear has happened on occasions – perhaps not in Ireland but more likely in Norway where I have heard genetic modifications to salmon have taken place to enable them to grow to a larger size at a much faster rate. Some of those large fish could have escaped into the sea, and perhaps they have. As they are so powerful and large, they could infiltrate the wild salmon. There is a danger they could damage that entire industry which is worldwide rather than confined to one area. The business is a delicate plant in so much as anything could go wrong with it. We saw what happened with BSE in Britain, so we can easily appreciate what could go wrong with this industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I was impressed by some of the figures the Minister of State gave, of which I had no idea. He said that in 1979, four tonnes were exported while in 2002, there were 62,000 tonnes of exports. That is a huge increase and a great success. The fact that 90% of seafood is exported reminds us how much has been done and achieved. Let us make sure we are careful and do not take chances. The opportunities are there. Even with what seem to be large figures, we have only touched that market. I was in the United States last week and visited a number of supermarkets. One of the things for which I look are Irish products. When I went to the salmon department, I was delighted to see Irish salmon. I did not see much of it but I saw Norwegian salmon. Norway has a longer coastline than Ireland and it is perhaps longer in the business than we are, but its population is the same. Therefore, if Norway is able to export in such a successful manner, it is a reminder to us of what we can achieve. However, we will not achieve that by taking shortcuts. It will be a long haul and we will have to be careful and make sure confidence in quality, taste and food safety is in no way damaged. If we risk that confidence, we place all of this in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">This debate has been useful and welcome. I was impressed by what the Minister of State said because I realised how much was being done but I also realised how careful we must be in the future if we are to succeed. There is a huge potential which we and those in the industry recognise but we must be careful. There is a lovely seanfhocal I remember from my school days which suits this debate – Éist le fuaim na habhann agus gheobhaidh tú bradán, Listen to the sound of the river if you are going to catch a salmon. The marketplace presents a huge opportunity for us and if we listen carefully to it we can make a success of this. Let us make sure we do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_158">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_445">I commend the Minister of State on the work he is doing in fisheries, both in this area and in respect of game fisheries. At the outset I must declare a vested interest because I am unashamedly an angler and have been for nearly 50 years since I started to fish on the banks of the Liffey. In the past I have bored previous Ministers, and probably the House, by going on an angling odyssey around Ireland from the time I started to fish on Lough Sheelin, which I had to leave because of pig pollution. I then went to Lough Ennell but had to leave it because there was no tertiary treatment in Mullingar. I then went to Lough Conn but had to leave it because of the phosphates going into it. The perspective I bring to this debate is an environmental one and the damage done to the environment by greedy people.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">All this hogwash about maintaining rural communities, people living in depressed areas and the need for jobs and so on does not add up when one considers the jobs lost in the same communities and areas by virtue of the devastation to the environment and the millions of pounds lost to the economy from the loss of the anglers who came to Ireland. When I started to fish on Lough Corrib nearly 40 years ago, the people who came from abroad flew to Shannon, hired a car, stayed a month, hired a gilly every day and had serious money when there was no money in this country. They are now going to Russia and the Falkland Islands, with some going to New Zealand and Alaska. They have left Ireland because the sport is not here. If the sport was here, they would come here because they have the money. My sympathies are with people like Kieran Thompson running Newport House in County Mayo, Peter Mantle running Delphi Lodge – who bought a place and tried to make a go of it – and Máire O'Connor running Lough Inagh Lodge. The Zetland Country House Hotel is being sold and is on the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">It was argued that there was no connection whatsoever between the welfare of those rural activities and what was going on at sea in the salmon fish farms. Every scientific argument put forward to show a connection between the demise of the sea trout and fish farming was repudiated, even though some very eminent scientists put forward plausible reasons. At this stage, perhaps the argument is irrelevant. We have moved on from it other than to say "if it walks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck".</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The other point is that the High Court held in the case of Hanrahan <i>v.</i> Merck, Sharpe and Dohme that the only plausible reason for what happened on the Hanrahan farm was the presence of Merck, Sharpe and Dohme, even though there was no tangible empirical connection between what happened on the farm and the output of Merck, Sharpe and Dohme. The High Court found in favour of Mr. Hanrahan.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">There is a connection. The salmon farming industry cannot have it both ways. It cannot tell us there is no connection between what happened to the sea trout as a result of fish farming and then tell us that bottom-dredging in Donegal bay is responsible for the fish kill there. They cannot have it both ways. Either it stands empirically in one direction or the other, or it falls in both directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Senator Quinn made a critical point. We must have confidence that the material that comes on to the market for human consumption from the fish farms is of high quality, traceable and produced in a sustainable way. If we have learned anything from BSE and the hormone debates in agriculture, it is that consumers must have food that they can have confidence in and that is safe. The task of the Department and the salmon growing industry is to ensure quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I take Senator Finucane's point regarding the dumping of salmon in a bog in Connemara. The salmon may not decompose but whether it decomposes is irrelevant because it should not be dumped in the first place. In particular, it should not be dumped in a place that is beside one of the best fisheries in the country in Costello. This fishery was written about by T. C. Kingsmill Moore in <i>A Man May Fish</i> which is regarded as a great piece of Irish literature. It is not just an angling book, but it is the greatest angling book and a great piece of literature.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">I accept that such points do not register with people who are prepared to dump salmon in a bog near a pristine salmon fishery. However, it is appalling that somebody should be on a State board if he or she is even accused of doing it.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">The standard is not one of conviction under the law, but that one must be seen to be above it all. It is the same standard that would apply in politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">Many politicians who have suffered grievously were never responsible for anything in law or did anything illegal, but because there was a whiff that something wrong had happened, they had to go. This same standard applies in this particular circumstance and in other similar circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">There is an onerous responsibility to ensure that the environment is protected. This responsibility falls primarily to the monitoring Department, which is responsible for ensuring that the licensing requirements are met, the procedures are correct and things are done properly. In the event that they are not done properly, the same standard that applied in agriculture in the case of hormones should apply. One should be closed down if one uses materials that are totally inimical to the environment. The standard that applies in agriculture is very rigorous. Farmers can lose their herd numbers and have to stop trading. This had happened and it is hugely difficult for the people that suffer as a result. However, that is the standard that must apply to ensure that the environment is protected and that the consumer gets the quality of food to which he or she is entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I commend the work done by the Central Fisheries Board and particularly by the chief executive, Mr. John O'Connor. I echo the point made by Senator Finucane. I can accept that laboratory analysis can be done almost anywhere, but I do not accept that the biological research and development which is essential to the development of the game fishing sector can be done anywhere. My appeal to the Minister is that this part of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards should be maintained within the ambit of the boards and not lost outside because a hugely important issue is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Game fishing is an example of where the State can do things very well. The Errif in Mayo, the Kerry Blackwater, the Galway weir, the ridgepool in the Moy and several others of that nature are managed extremely well by very competent and professional staff. They are a pleasure to visit. I stayed in Ashleigh Lodge this year, at Leenane, where Mr. Jim Stafford and his wife are doing a superb job. This facility was created and is maintained by the State. It is highly commercial and is generating revenue for the State. There is a message in that for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Indecon report, a socio-economic evaluation of wild salmon in Ireland, was commissioned for the Central Fisheries Board and it is a very good report. The Minister is familiar with it and there have been consultation meetings around the country where the various stakeholders have made their cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I accept that the activities of drift netting and draught netting are centuries old. They lived side by side with angling for so long and there was no difficulty. However, now that drift netting has become so efficient, it has become a problem. If one has miles of monofilament, it is very easy to sweep everything in sight, particularly where fish are swimming near the surface. This is an issue and the work being done by R. E. Vickerson with the North Atlantic Salmon Trust has set a headline for us that hopefully we can follow. I accept that draught netting in the estuaries is probably not very detrimental to fish stocks, but drift netting out at sea is a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I subscribe to what Senator Kenneally said about the need for statistics and to know how many fish are travelling up river systems. It is easy enough to count them on a small river system, although the counters are not that accurate because fish travel downriver as well as upriver. It is much more difficult to count in an estuary, although it can be done. The conservation of stock is the essential issue and I commend the initiatives with regard to catchment management.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">However, I cannot understand how people who depend on the stock, whether they are drift, draught or anglers, can destroy it. There are examples in agriculture where people have exploited the land and found, to their cost, that one cannot do it indefinitely. That is why agricultural practices such as crop rotation and fallowing have developed. We are only at the beginning of learning those lessons both in the management of fish stocks and the intensive farming of salmon.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The Indecon report states that 24,000 overseas salmon anglers visited Ireland in each of the years from 1998 to 2000. It is a highly significant part of our economy, particularly our tourist economy. The report also refers to the capital value of the industry and the value of game angling compared to netting. It says the net socio-economic value of the commercial sector is £39.9 million while the net value of salmon angling is £91.6 million. I agree that they are both important and that salmon angling is very important as a source of revenue in areas where there have been difficulties in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Senator Kenneally referred to a modern system for managing farmed salmon, whereby waste can be trapped in cages underneath the ponds. However, we cannot argue in two directions at once. We cannot say, on the one hand, that the polluter pays in one context and, on the other, that people can pollute indiscriminately just because it is being done at sea and cannot be seen. If waste was being dumped on the roadside, everyone would complain. However, because this waste is being discharged into the sea and no one sees it, there is not the same fuss there should be. The people making money from the industry should be responsible for maintaining the environment and ensuring the food which comes from the farms is of a quality that Senator Quinn can sell over his counter and be confident that the people who buy it will be safe and happy with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I had the privilege of fishing in New Zealand some years ago and experienced the high standards set there, which I understand also apply in Australia. If one is visiting the country to fish, one must go through what is almost a major decontamination process. One is not even allowed to bring angling gear or boots into Australia because of the possibility of a parasite being introduced. These are the standards which must apply if we are to maintain the resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The economic argument is the only one which washes with governments and large corporations. Nonetheless, why are we not protecting a resource which has existed since the Ice Age? Those fish travel thousands of miles at sea to return to the rivers in which they were born. I cannot understand why people are prepared to allow them be destroyed and those same people do not understand me when I talk in this manner. We have learned lessons from BSE and the use of hormones in agriculture and we must apply them with equal rigour to all food producing industries, whether they are at sea or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">A Senator referred to the bad impression which is being created. I watched the RTE "Prime Time" programme and I obtained a recording of it in order to watch it again because of its significance, even though some people have opted to shoot the messenger. One could argue about the scale of the dramatisation of the events which took place. However, one cannot argue that nothing was going on, since that is evident from the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Nonetheless, there is a solution. I accept the reality that one cannot close down the salmon farming industry and I do not suggest we do so. Our game fisheries are an important economic and environmental resource which can live side by side with salmon farming. It is up to the Department to work out how that can be done. It might be through fallowing, as is the case in agriculture, or perhaps by moving cages further out to sea where there are greater tides and scouring effect. However, I do not see the determination to come up with the answer. The attitude is that if we leave it alone, it will be all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I caught sea trout in Lough Beltra, Lough Inagh, the Waterville River and the River Erriff, all of which were small but were clean and did not have lice. Perhaps it is possible for the two to exist side by side and I appeal to the Minister to try and make that happen.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_471">I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister to the House. I congratulate the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Browne, and the entire team negotiating on behalf of Ireland in the fisheries negotiations in Brussels. They have shown tremendous resolve, persistence and superior negotiating talent in being able to snatch an element of victory from the jaws of defeat in regard to the Irish Box.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I am delighted to have the opportunity to make some points in regard to salmon fish farming and the wider area of aquaculture in Ireland. It is appropriate we have this debate since people are substantially unaware of its contribution and potential. Aquaculture is recognised as the fastest growing food industry globally and has increased in size by 10% annually since 1990. The aquaculture industry in Ireland provides employment for more than 1,700 people. In 2002 alone, finfish production – salmon and trout – had a value of over €80 million and shellfish had a value of over €34 million, giving a total of more than €115 million. Aquaculture is of significant economic importance to coastal communities and has reversed their decline because of the significant opportunities and employment it has created. The Marine Institute's socio-economic analysis of selected areas and an Údarás na Gaeltachta study by Ernst and Young of the Kilkerrin area show the particular significance of finfish farming and aquaculture in sustaining employment and social cohesion in peripheral areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">A recent RTE "Prime Time" programme highlighted two salmon farmers who were engaged in bad practice. The programme gave considerable profile to the poor conditions, bad management and, in particular, the illegal discarding of fish carcasses at salmon farms in Donegal and Galway. There is no doubt what we saw was particularly disturbing and did nothing to help stimulate consumer confidence in the finfish farming or aquaculture industries. However, it is important to acknowledge that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has already taken appropriate measures to deal with the guilty parties highlighted by the RTE broadcast.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Furthermore, it is vitally important we accept that such incidents are the absolute exception rather than the rule. Occurrences in Donegal last year and Galway earlier this year in regard to the dumping of dead fish from cages are regrettable. However, they are isolated incidents and should not reflect on the high standards and good work practices employed by aquaculturists on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Irish farmed salmon is leading the entire Irish food industry on quality assurance and food safety by being the first sector to achieve EN45001 quality accreditation for its quality assurance scheme. The Food Safety Authority stated that the EN45001 series and quality assurance standard is the most appropriate means of quality assurance for the whole food sector. The Irish salmon farming industry, with the assistance of Bord Iascaigh Mhara's environment and quality section, is leading the way in this regard. There is no question the farmed salmon sector is ahead of the beef, dairy and poultry industries in so far as other sectors have only begun the process of accreditation to EN45001, which is the ultimate pan-European and Commission approved quality assurance standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The Irish quality salmon scheme assures buyers and consumers of Irish farmed salmon of consistently high food safety and fish welfare since the standards were written to include best practice in traceability, food safety, fish welfare and environmental care. The majority of salmon producers in Ireland are in the process of joining the scheme and over 80% of the industry are already full members.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">In regard to mortalities in the Inver Bay area of County Donegal, it is important to state that no cause has been established yet by the Department. The independent co-ordinator of the investigation, experienced fish pathologist Dr. Marian McLaughlin, indicated that far from solving the problem, the investigation is unlikely to provide any conclusive answers. The investigation has already ruled out disease, pollution from land and the farm's own practices as being the cause. Farmers are alleging that the dredging of 200,000 tonnes of material from Killybegs harbour caused the problem. However, the material was dumped at an appropriate and safe distance and there is no evidence to prove a link between the dredging and the salmon deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">We all look forward to establishing the actual causes of the mortalities in Donegal and taking the necessary steps to remedy the situation without delay. I know the Minister and all the offices at his disposal are working tirelessly in this pursuit. However, I ask him to ensure it is given priority and renewed urgency as it is having immeasurable effects on the salmon farming industry in the north-west region. I welcome the fact the Minister is to initiate a comprehensive review of the existing procedures for the monitoring and control of aquaculture and marine finfish farming. I acknowledge that the vast majority of those engaged in this industry are operating to the highest possible EU standards, consistent with the highest product quality and in accordance with the five protocols as set down in the conditions of farm aquaculture licences. I further acknowledge there are many inspections annually but I respectfully suggest that the Minister should increase the inspections of all aquaculture operations and explore the possibilities, as Senator Kenneally pointed out, of establishing an independent audit inspection team to enforce the licensing conditions. In 99.9% of instances there are no problems but a specifically dedicated audit, inspection and enforcement team is necessary to root out the bad practices threatening this industry which is so vital to our peripheral communities and has such economic potential for the country as a whole.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_479">Salmon fish farming has been an economic success story in County Donegal, specifically on the Fanad peninsula where the hydro fisheries have been developed under Norwegian influence. Fish farming has made the local community vibrant, as well as helping local people to remain in the region. The fish farming sector is concerned, however, that lice is a major problem. Only two products are currently available for the treatment of lice but neither is combating it. In fact, some lice are becoming immune to both products. The Minister should investigate whoever sanctioned the use of these products – it may have been the Irish Medicines Board. A broader range of products is required to combat lice in the fish farming industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">While much media attention has been focused on the fish kills in County Donegal, there has been a lack of co-operation between the Departments involved. Ultimately, the Department of Agriculture and Food has responsibility for investigating fish kills, so there should be more communication between it and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in order to deal with fish kills, such as those that occurred in County Donegal recently.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_481">I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials on the results they achieved at Monday's Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg. It was not looking good for a while but everyone agrees that the outcome was very positive. The tactical game played was successful and no greater accolade or confirmation of the achievement can be made than the generous praise from the fishing industry itself. Despite this positive outcome, however, there is a general air of disillusionment among certain sections of the fishing industry at the moment. On several occasions during the summer, when I was on holidays in west Cork, I met fishermen who had serious issues with departmental policy. Whereas I am no expert on fishery matters, I beg the Minister of State's indulgence to pose some legitimate questions. A number of fishermen raised the delay in issuing fishing licences by the Department and I understand that some vessels that have satisfied the requirements to purchase tonnage have been tied up at piers for months. The Minister of State will appreciate that this is causing huge financial problems for owners of small and large vessels, as they still have to make loan repayments and meet other financial commitments. While I understand the licensing policy is currently being reviewed, is there any reason why run of the mill licensing transactions cannot be finalised in the short term?</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I have encountered some herring fishermen who complained that their boats are outdated. Stricter market requirements on quality are forcing them out of their traditional fishery business. I fully support the need for strict quality control measures but when I inquired as to why they do not upgrade their boats, I was surprised to hear that departmental policy prevents them from doing so. The boats required are called tank boats and, while I am not an expert in this field, what I was told seems to make sense – that the market is changing and they need to change with it or they will go out of business. Will the Minister of State clarify and explain the rationale behind the non-issuance of new licences to these vessels? Are these licensing issues not being resolved because of the Minister's severe workload following the creation of the new Department? What is causing the blockage we have seen?</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Some influential players in the industry feel the sector is being neglected under the current Administration and while I do not concur with that view, some issues are in need of clarification. One such issue, for example, concerns moves being made to transfer the marketing department of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara to Bord Bia. This seems to be another swipe at the industry with the overriding objective of downgrading the importance of fishing.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_485">One would hope this is not so and that the reason for the transfer is to give us a better fishing industry but clarification is required on that point. While I can see some merit in such an amalgamation, surely an integrated body like BIM, with decades of experience in developing the fishing industry from catching fish to marketing them, represents the best option for maximising jobs and profits in the sector. Will the Minister of State say whether these views are well founded or are members of the industry being overly alarmist? They point to the fact that the Government began by getting rid of their Department and now it is effectively getting rid of the fisheries development agency. Perhaps the Minister of State could shed some light on these most recent rumours.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Once again, I congratulate the Minister of State on the success of recent days. I apologise for my lack of detailed knowledge of the fishing industry but when issues such as these come to one's attention it serves everyone's interest to ask questions about them. Sometimes innocent questions from someone with no vested interest can result in greater clarity. Some people in the industry are very concerned and they would welcome the Minister of State's views on the points I have raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_487">I compliment the Minister of State on the work the Department is doing, especially for the aquaculture industry. I acknowledge the huge contribution that industry has made in terms of generating employment and revenue. The industry is worth about €100 million annually and thousands of people are employed in the sector, particularly in coastal areas where there are few alternative employment opportunities. I fully support the development of the aquaculture business as well as the Department's plans to expand further the industry, creating more employment and revenue, and generating expanded economic prosperity, especially in coastal areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I have always been supportive of the aquaculture industry and I was taken aback by recent reports of incidents we have seen in the national media. I compliment RTE on its investigative work on some of the aquaculture projects, where it identified serious malpractices and indicated the necessity to take action, including legal action, to stamp them out. If such malpractices were to be continued, by what I would say is a very small minority, it would damage the good name of the aquaculture business which is recognised worldwide, undermine the prospects for further development of the sector and discourage people from becoming involved in it. It is of paramount importance to the industry that whatever has been happening in the business is remedied quickly. I am not satisfied that the Marine Institute under the current arrangement has the capability to deal with this problem. There is a necessity for further action and I strongly recommend that the Minister of State gives some direction to the regional fisheries boards who have responsibility in matters of conservation, management and development of fisheries and execution of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">If not already involved, the regional fisheries boards should be asked immediately to give a helping hand to the Marine Institute. It appears the Marine Institute is involved in a whole lot of other research projects and activities which are totally unrelated to the management, conservation and prosecution of breaches of fisheries regulations. There is no reason the kind of activity we saw in a recent television programme should be tolerated and those responsible should be brought before the courts and prosecuted. Otherwise they will damage the industry and put its development at risk because people will be concerned about the produce. There is an urgent need for the fisheries boards and the central authority in particular to get involved immediately with the Marine Institute and all the other agencies of State, including the Garda Síochána, to stamp out illegal activity which is damaging the industry, putting the jobs of people at risk and giving a bad name to Irish aquaculture, which it has not had up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">I am intervening because of the alarm felt by most people who saw the recent television programme. While these matters may have been exaggerated, they should be investigated. If the fisheries boards are not in a position to do so, and if those responsible are not capable of dealing with the illegal activities taking place in the industry, they should be asked to reconsider their position and new people appointed. If the law needs to be changed to give new powers to local authorities or someone else to enforce the law in this area then it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The industry to some extent may have been a victim of its own success. I recall in 1982 that there was very little activity in this area. I was Minister for Fisheries at the time and I sought EU funding to develop the business, which was forthcoming. Many people recognised at that stage the huge opportunity to create employment in isolated rural and coastal communities on the western seaboard. Now the industry is on its feet, a small minority of people is willing to undermine it, put people's jobs at risk and create a situation which could be very damaging to the long-term development of the Irish aquaculture and fisheries industry. I am intervening at this stage to underline again the necessity for strict enforcement of the laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I am afraid I cannot get worked up about sea lice, which is part of the marine environment. It has existed as long as salmon and trout. There are recognised ways of dealing with the infestation of sea lice. This will always exist where there is salmon and trout fish farming. Sea lice is part of the maritime environment which will not go away – there are others we might wish would go away but who will not go away either. There is a recognised and established international way to control this problem. If the rules are not being implemented, someone somewhere should be in a position to enforce the law. I strongly recommend that the regional fisheries boards which have responsibility for the implementation and execution of inland fisheries legislation should be brought to bear in this regard. If there is a necessity for further legislation to be introduced by the Minister I am sure it will get a very speedy passage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_493">I would like to be associated with the good wishes and congratulations to the Minister on his recent negotiations in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">As previous speakers have said, the growing aquaculture business is worth a lot of money to this economy. The Minister's speech, however, does not make hectic reading. The Marine Institute was put in place to deal with a number of issues. There were three occurrences in July, August and September to which we seem to have no answers. In July the Marine Institute was called in to Donegal Bay. In August it was called in again and in September its scope was widened, but there appears to be no conclusion on the issue. This is very serious because it is an important industry. As Senator Daly said, the aquaculture business in this country is getting a bad name because of a few people. Answers must be found quickly. I support the Minister in taking quick action because it is necessary in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The aquaculture business and game fishing can exist side by side. As Senator Daly said, sea lice has been in existence as long as salmon and trout has been around. There are critical months early in the year when this is a problem but there are ways of controlling it. What are these critical months? The Minister said in his speech that Marine Institute inspectors visit farms up to 14 times a year. However, if they were to visit them more often during these critical months we could get answers and get this sea lice problem under control.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Game fishing is a very important industry. I support Senator Finucane's proposal to put together research and development units from the game fishing and Marine Institute. It would be a retrograde step to take 15 people from the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards and put them into the Marine Institute. These people have a lot of experience and have done tremendous work. There are many good fishing rivers and lakes throughout the country and we have a tremendous number of people with enormous expertise and experience. It would be a retrograde step to move people from the Central Fisheries Board and the regional authorities to the Marine Institute because there is a system in place whereby the fisheries boards can liaise with each other. Ways have been found to improve tributaries to lakes and rivers and to improve the spawning beds. We could lose some of this expertise if we put the research and development section of game fishing, which is under the control of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards, under the Marine Institute.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_497">I thank Senators for their contributions, which reflect the interest in the subject and the concerns that have arisen in light of some of the recent reports on the industry. I have taken note of the serious concerns raised which will be dealt with in the Department. Senator Finucane suggested that in a time of changing market conditions there may be a temptation to take short cuts. There cannot be any excuses for departures from the high standards expected of the industry. There will be no acceptance or tolerance of sloppy practices. Any cases which come to light will be fully investigated and pursued and serious action will be taken against the people who step out of line in the area of aquaculture farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Senator Finucane referred to the member of the board of the Marine Institute. We have taken legal advice and we have been advised about due process. I assure the Deputy that if a person, regardless of who it may be, on a board or elsewhere is found to have broken the law, we will not have any problem dealing with him or her accordingly. As regards the Connemara issue, it is being investigated. The advice of the legal service has been sought. We must bear in mind the need for due process. I do not want to comment any further at present. However, we will not tolerate any law breakers and we will deal with them accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Senator Finucane and others raised the issue of sea lice. The levels specified are set and there is a trigger system if those levels are breached. The Marine Institute will serve a notice on the farms concerned requiring them to apply any appropriate anti-lice treatment. It is clearly critical to the success of the system that these treatments are applied where necessary. We do not want any short cuts taken in this area. In the review of enforcement and control arrangements now under way, we will look at ways of ensuring that this happens in all cases. If changes are needed, we will take them on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Senator Finucane also raised the introduction of a statutory labelling system for seafood. That was introduced recently and is now in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Senator Kenneally raised the issue of fish diseases. He can rest assured that structures for fish health, such as monitoring and control, are in place. Inspections are carried out regularly at fish farms. Arrangements are also in place for the control of fish farms. We are considering the possibility of reviewing the system to see how we can control it further. The regulations are already in place and we are reviewing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Senator MacSharry raised the issue of an independent inspectorate. We have controls and procedures in place. However, if an independent inspector is required in the future, we will seriously consider that. I know all options are being considered in the Department at present. We will take on board the Senator's suggestions in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Senator Dardis referred to the need for high standards of environmental protection. I agree fully with him. That is why a number of monitoring protocols specifically for finfish farms were introduced some years ago. We will ensure that all the necessary environmental controls and monitoring are in place for the future. This issue will also be examined as a central element of the review of monitoring and control arrangements which is now under way in the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I know Senator Quinn received an award recently for high standards in the fish area. He rightly highlighted the damage which can be caused to the industry by the publicity arising from unacceptable practices. I fully agree with him. Everyone concerned must ensure the business operates to the highest standards. If that does not happen, the prospects for further development will be damaged and the position of existing operators will be undermined. The State will play its part in enforcing and controlling, however, as I said at the outset, there is a considerable onus on the fish farmers involved to adhere to the high standards expected of them in conjunction with the State's involvement in monitoring practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Senator Minihan raised a number of issues. The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 2003, in line with the programme for Government, has introduced a new open transparent licensing process. In line with the requirements of the Act and with a new EU fleet policy, a new open transparent licensing policy is being put in place in consultation with the fishing industry. There is general support in the fishing industry for the long awaited reform of the licensing process. There was wide cross-party support for the reform process under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act when it was discussed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Senator Minihan also raised the licensing of tank boats for herring and mackerel. These are large and efficient vessels which can land hundreds of tonnes of fish on each fishing trip. For more than a decade the general policy has been that the boats can be introduced to the fleet only by withdrawing a similar type of boat from the fishing fleet. The policy is a recognition that the available quotas are decreasing and a reflection of the decline of the stocks. If new vessels are introduced, old ones must be taken out. The future policy for licensing these vessels is being reviewed in light of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Senator MacSharry referred to the investigation of fish mortality in Donegal and the need to speed up the progress towards a solution. I agree that we must find the cause of the fish mortality. We have asked the Marine Institute to continue to deal with the matter as a top priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Senator Daly referred to the Marine Institute's role in the monitoring and control of fish farming. I appreciate the work done by the Marine Institute to advise and assist my Department in this area. I agree, however, that we must take a careful look at the overall arrangements for enforcement and control. This will take place as a priority and will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Senator Dardis also referred to fallowing as a possible means of environmental control at fish farms. I am pleased to inform him that this practice is already well established. Fish farms must fallow cages in accordance with the terms and conditions of their licences and must also comply with the specific requirements laid down in the protocol adopted in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Senator McHugh expressed concern that the effectiveness of sea lice treatment may be diminishing due to resistance. While that has not been an issue to date, I would be happy to have the matter checked out by the Marine Institute to ensure we have the best means of dealing with the problem of sea lice.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">As regards the Irish Box, I thank the Senators on all sides of the House for their congratulations to the Minister and myself on the outcome of the negotiations on the Irish Box and related conservation matters. As Senator MacSharry said, the Minister has, through persistence and tough negotiations, managed to stem a defeat and to work a good deal for Irish fishermen which gives a good degree of security to the island and fishing generally. I thank all the Senators for their support on this issue. I also thank Dr. Cecil Beamish who was involved in the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I thank the Senators for their contributions to the area of aquaculture. We will not leave any stone unturned in trying to find the causes of the mortality in Inver, McSwyne's Bay and other areas of the country. More importantly, we will not tolerate law breakers in aquaculture. We want to see a thriving aquaculture industry. That is important particularly to coastal communities where approximately 1,600 or 1,700 people are in full-time employment. We all agree that the industry must reach the highest environmental standards and that it will continue to grow into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I thank my officials, Mr. Joe Ryan and Dr. Cecil Beamish, for their input into today's debate, for their preparation of the documentation and for supplying some of the answers.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">That Seanad Éireann noting:</p>
          <p eId="para_516">(<i>a</i>) the delay in constructing the Luas lines in Dublin, the significant cost overruns associated with that project and the severe disruption caused in much of central Dublin by the construction works;</p>
          <p eId="para_517">(<i>b</i>) the fact that the provision of the QBC network is well behind time and that moneys allocated in 2002 for carrying out work on the network were not spent;</p>
          <p eId="para_518">(<i>c</i>) the failure of the Government and the Railway Procurement Agency to set out a coherent plan for the provision of a metro service;</p>
          <p eId="para_519">(<i>d</i>) the fact that the completion of the M50 is behind time and that the existing road has inadequate capacity;</p>
          <p eId="para_520">(<i>e</i>) the failure of Government and Iarnród Éireann to carry out capacity enhancement works on the Maynooth mainline rail line and the DART, notwithstanding the fact that such improvements have been announced by Government on numerous occasions in recent years; and</p>
          <p eId="para_521">therefore calls on the Government to set out and finance an integrated transport plan for Dublin and deplores its lamentable failure to do so heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Tá áthas orm an rún in ainm Seanadóirí Páirtí Lucht Oibre a mholadh. Public transport in Dublin is, to use a phrase with which the Minister of State will be familiar, a joke. It is a mess. Despite ten years of economic growth and unprecedented resources, our system is still woefully inadequate for our purposes and is by any reasonable standard worse than that available to the citizens of any other capital city in the EU. The circumstances enjoyed by Governments during that time, especially this Government and the one before it, could hardly have been better.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">It is important to remember that this Government had available to it a virtual consensus about what needed to be done. Opinion formers and policy makers gave up making the case for a road based solution in Dublin many years ago. I was a member of Dublin City Council for 12 years until earlier this year and virtually every councillor of the 52 in that body had long since bought into the view that we could not solve the problems of transport in Dublin – getting people from A to B, particularly into the city centre and out again – by using roads. It could not be done. We were all agreed on this, sometimes to our political cost. I recall more than one meeting in my constituency at which views were loudly expressed by car users that QBCs were a waste of space and that we should be concentrating instead on widening the roads. All of us in our time have opposed those views and there has been a consensus available to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">There has also been available to Government an unprecedented level of resources. Double digit growth in the economy for most of the late 1990s made available resources which were simply never available to any of its predecessors. The fact that much of that money came from the German taxpayer is ironic because the average German is now rather less well-off than the average Irish person, albeit with much better public transport and other infrastructure available to him. There is no excuse for the utterly lamentable position in which the citizens of this city now find themselves. The average Dubliner, if he works in the city centre, will typically spend an hour or more in traffic every morning and another hour in the evening, with all the obvious consequences for his quality of life. It is not simply a matter of inconvenience; significant disadvantage to the economy of this city arises from the gridlock we experience on a daily basis. Surveys have shown that it takes longer in Dublin for goods to be transported from A to B, whether from the ports to the M50 or within the city, than in any other city of comparable size or population in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Where do we find ourselves now? Ten years after it was first announced, Luas is still behind time, well over budget and causing immeasurable disruption to businesses along the lines which nobody ever envisaged and which the businesses involved were never told about. The DART is still massively under-capacity. I am fortunate enough to live on the DART line, near Killester station. It is not unusual – in fact it is almost a daily experience – for people who arrive at the station between 8.15 a.m. and 9 a.m. not to succeed in getting onto the DART because it is full. We have known for many years that there was an under-capacity. Governments have made announcements about the lengthening of trains too many times to count. The intention to lengthen platforms to accommodate eight-car trains was first announced at least eight years ago, not by this Government or its predecessor, I suspect, but by the Government before that. Yet we are now being told that the DART will have to close at weekends for 18 months in one part of the city or another in order to carry out works which are obviously long since overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Most of us support the implementation of the QBC network, but it too is massively behind time. We have demonstrated our utter incapacity to put in place the necessary planning to ensure that something that seems to be relatively simple happens. The results of the QBC network have been patchy but generally good and they certainly justify the extension of the network. Money was supplied by Government last year for this but was returned because the bodies concerned were incapable of putting together their plans in sufficient time to spend the money. The outturn is woefully inadequate in circumstances in which the work needs to be done quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The metro is the crowning glory in this catalogue of disasters. It is now four years since the Leader of this House, then the Minister for Public Enterprise, announced that the Government had agreed in principle to build a metro system in Dublin on a public private partnership basis. Four years later, none of us has a notion of what Government policy actually is. Certainly, one would be hard pressed to find any Dubliners who believe that the metro system will be in place, for example, ten years from now. Government policy has simply lost any measure of credibility it once had.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">It is worth considering in detail the example of the Luas. It a good example of how things have simply not happened. The Luas was first announced by Government in 1994 as part of the Structural Funds round of 1994-99. When the Fianna Fáil-PD Government came to power in 1997, one of the first things it did was to suspend the public inquiry that was then in place so that it could resolve a row between the Government partners, one party of which wanted to put the city centre section underground while the other did not. The consultants reported a year later – a year that was lost to the whole process – and their suggestions were ultimately disregarded by Government. The three lines initially planned soon became two and the city centre area was left in limbo. We still do not know whether it will actually be developed. Close to the end of the process we are left with a fraction of a network, which is not integrated as the lines do not meet and probably will never meet. It does not have the capacity to move anything like the number of people who live along the line and it cannot be converted, in a realistic way within a realistic timetable or at a realistic price, into a metro as proposed in the platform for change at the DTO. It is causing enormous disruption and is costing a fortune.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">There is also the utter farce of the Red Cow roundabout where the Government is floundering around, throwing out weekly possible solutions and, clearly, does not have a clue how to deal with it. Three or four weeks ago we were told we could spend €1 billion upgrading the M50. Then we were told the Luas could be put on stilts and later still that the roundabout could be redesigned at a cost of €100 million and that part of the M50 could be upgraded at a cost of €300 million. I do not care what is done if it works. I represent the views of most people in Dublin when I say that. The bottom line is that ten years after we first talked about Luas we do not know what the solution to that problem will be. However, we know that whatever solution is found will almost certainly delay the project beyond its mid-next year end point so that there will be further delay and further diminishing of the service when it eventually becomes available.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I listened with great interest to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in the Lower House yesterday. All of us accept that buses will form an important part of public transport in Dublin into the future but I do not have a notion of what is Government policy. In 1999-2000, the Government announced it would introduce a measure of flexibility, liberalisation and deregulation, but would put in place a regulator who would look after standards and ensure everybody got a service. In his contribution in the Lower House yesterday, the Minister did not seem to have a notion of his own policy. He actually used the phrase at one stage that "it was all terribly confusing". His announced policy is to franchise out 25% of the existing routes. We do not know whether he will make Dublin Bus buses available to a private user.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Minister does not appear to know, but he has informed us that he is talking with the social partners to resolve the matter. If we are to wait for those talks to arrive at a solution, we could be waiting a long time. He does not appear to know whether he wants a regulator for Dublin, the greater Dublin area, regional regulators or whether he wants a regulator at all. This is characteristic of the incompetence, lack of direction and lack of planning we have seen in the Government's policy and approach to public transport in our capital city during the past four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I have pleasure proposing a motion which I acknowledge is largely negative. However, its negative thrust is more than adequately justified by the inaction of a Government which appears to have no feeling for what it is at, no notion of where it is going and, certainly, no respect for the citizens of the capital city.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">I second the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I start with a quote from Ms Luas Lane, in a recent letter to <i>The Irish Times,</i> in an Irishman's Diary – alias Mr. Kevin Myers. She asks the question: “And why has Ireland made its prime national route less like a Spaghetti Junction and more like macaroni cheese out of a tin?”</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The recent news dispatches about the Red Cow roundabout, to which my colleague, Senator McDowell referred, are amusing. However, they are not amusing for all of us who are caught up in the daily traffic jams in Dublin and beyond. To use the words of the Tánaiste, I find the whole thing incredible. In one dispatch, stilts at the Red Cow roundabout are announced. On another day a spaghetti junction is disclosed and more recently there is the €300 million plan for the Red Cow roundabout. All this information is piecemeal. It is as if there is a change every week. I find the whole situation incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Let us take the plans for a spaghetti junction at the Red Cow roundabout. A public consultation procedure by South Dublin County Council and the National Roads Authority took place about two years ago. How could the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, not have known about the plans for a spaghetti junction? Suddenly, the Tánaiste finds the proposals for the Red Cow roundabout incredible. She represents the constituency in which the Red Cow roundabout is located. As a member of the Government and a public representative for the area how could she not have known the position with regard to the roundabout and the plans for the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_537">It was a good idea by the Government to set up a Ministry specially for transport. I thought there would have been an integrated and strategic approach to transport plans, but our motion indicates that the reality is different. The Minister for Transport does not appear to have all the information. He appears to be operating from piecemeal and changing information. His desire is to appear dynamic, but he is the opposite and is showing a lack of leadership. The Government and the Minister need to get their acts together in terms of doing something about the transport position. I am sorry the Minister for Transport is not present.</p>

When the plans were originally announced the idea from the DTO was that in the meantime, the bus would be used to sort out traffic congestion pending the introduction of Luas-metro. The bus was to be an important part of the overall plan. Similarly, the current rail infrastructure would be used and upgraded. The provision of Luas and the metro should not take as long as has been suggested. Given all the delays, they will take longer than was ever anticipated. Much remains to be done in the meantime. The situation will get much worse—</p>

There is a need to invest in Dublin Bus and to double the service on the Dublin-Kildare route. There is no confirmation from the Government that it will provide the necessary investment to ensure Iarnród Éireann fulfils its plans to double its service on the Dublin-Kildare route. We have a Department of Transport. The idea was that there would be one overall integrated Department that would solve our transport problems.

          <p eId="para_549">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann," and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_550">"welcomes the significant progress made in recent years to improve transport infrastructure and public transport services in Dublin and supports the continuing actions being taken by the Government to implement an integrated transport plan for the Greater Dublin Area. In this regard, the Seanad:</p>
          <p eId="para_551">(<i>a</i>) endorses the progress made in providing a light rail system for Dublin;</p>
          <p eId="para_552">(<i>b</i>) backs the prioritisation of investment in a Quality Bus Network for Dublin;</p>
          <p eId="para_553">(<i>c</i>) notes the proposals made by the RPA for the provision of a Metro service for Dublin;</p>

          <p eId="para_555">(<i>e</i>) notes the significant investments being undertaken in the suburban rail network in the Greater Dublin Area, including services on the DART and on the Maynooth line;</p>

          <p eId="para_557">(<i>f</i>) supports the Minister for Transport's proposals for regulatory reform and restructuring of public transport that will deliver better value for money for the customer and the taxpayer.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss the current programme of infrastructural development, particularly in the Dublin region. I thank the Labour Party for giving us the opportunity to set out clearly the level of investment that has taken place. While we take much criticism on this side for what has not been done during the past five or six years, this is an area of which we are proud and I am delighted to address the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The Government and indeed its predecessor have developed an integrated transport network that when completed will transform our lives, particularly in this region. When the current work programme is completed we will have a first class transport network that will compare favourably to the best in the world. It has not been without difficulties along the way, however, as Senator McDowell has indicated and Senator Tuffy has talked about; there is a level of inconvenience. There will always be inconvenience associated with development and construction. It is difficult for commuters and residents to sit through the construction phase of these many projects. It is largely due to the fact that the current network has reached saturation point and therefore there is not the extra capacity to allow for an unhindered existence through the period of construction and expansion of the relevant projects. This is clearly due to lack of investment by successive Governments. Senators on this side of the House must share in the responsibility as do Senators on the other side. Regardless of that, the importance of investment in our infrastructure must be recognised. I am proud of the achievements of the current Government and its predecessor, and in particular the commitment to our transport network at a time of relative constraint in our economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">We have to look to the future and to recognise the enormous benefits that will accrue to both society and the economy as a result of the current investment programme. I sometimes get annoyed, coming as I do from the midwest, at the level of criticism levelled by colleagues, sometimes on the Fianna Fáil side, about the hardships associated with the many projects under construction, whether it is Luas, the metro, the Dublin Port tunnel or whatever.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_562">We are talking about the projects on this side. I will get to the Ennis bypass. The Senator need have no worry about that. I get annoyed because I know how grateful we would be in the entire midwest region to suffer the inconvenience people on the eastern side of the country are experiencing. We would be grateful because we know that inherent in that inconvenience would be the recognition that one would reach a point where the difficulties and problems being experienced would ultimately be resolved. That is not the case for us at the minute, unfortunately. We see the necessity to have a programme along the lines set out in the NDP and the national spatial strategy to include many of the projects that would help to bring balanced regional development, as espoused in those two documents, to put in place the vital infrastructure needed. Senator McDowell is right, it would include the Ennis bypass, but not totally. We will not be totally parochial about this. It would also include the road link from Limerick to Galway, the western rail line, a fourth river crossing in Limerick and it would seek to put in place a co-ordinated infrastructure in that region that would include a rail link from Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I assure the Minister of State and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, any inconvenience associated with these projects which might qualify for funding over the next few months would be welcomed with open arms. We will be delighted to suffer that inconvenience and I can assure the Minister of State he will not hear me or, hopefully, any of my colleagues complaining. There have been a number of tremendous infrastructural developments on the eastern side of the country, particularly with Luas. No doubt there have been difficult issues associated with a project like that but I would like to believe they have been resolved. Some of them have been resolved in the media, which is not the best place to do it. Nonetheless, the project is progressing relatively well. Significant milestones have been reached of which we are all aware. Two of the train depots are completed and most of the trams for the Sandyford and Tallaght lines are already delivered and in place. A significant amount of the track has been delayed. There were some bottlenecks associated with the laying of the track and that certainly caused tremendous inconvenience for everyone, Members of the Oireachtas included. Bit by bit, however, they are being resolved. The Railway Procurement Agency has a programme for project commencement which the Minister of State has already indicated will see the Tallaght to Connolly line opened by August 2004 and the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line opened by June 2004. While there has been a level of frustration over a number of years the end is in sight. There may be potential delays. We are not sure about that. Within the next number of years, however, these projects will be delivered and we will all reap the benefits. It is a difficulty for people at the time but we have to live with it. To use the old cliché, there is no gain without an element of pain and there is no doubt that people are currently suffering an element of pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">There was some mention of quality bus corridors. Currently there are nine in operation in Dublin, covering about 100 kilometres. The news is so good I am not going to have time to deliver it all, but I am sure my colleagues will. The quality bus corridors are working. A number of statistics are important. From November 2001 to November 2002 the level of usage of the QBCs increased by 16%. As a result there was a decrease of 7% in the amount of car traffic on those routes. That is a positive move and I know the Minister is seeking to have a number of others QBCs in place by 2005. There is now a quality bus network office associated with Dublin City Council. From now on it will be spearheading the introduction of further quality bus corridors.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The metro project will be of huge benefit to this city. Having travelled to a number of other cities, both in Europe and the US over the years, it has become clear that a city such as Dublin has reached a point where it is no longer enough to move people from point to point above ground as the city grows. Given the low density housing in this city it will be necessary to go underground, as is facilitated by the metro. I strongly believe in the metro and encourage the Minister to progress it. The Joint Committee on Transport, on which I and a number of Senators on the other side serve, has seen in great detail the work involved in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">We may have jumped a bit early in terms of identifying the need for a metro project, but I welcome the kind of information and co-operation taking place between the Minister's office, the Railway Procurement Agency and the Spanish authorities in terms, perhaps, of identifying cheaper methods of delivering the project. This could have implications for the Oireachtas in terms of imminent legislation which will assist in the procurement of land and the delivery of a project in an unprecedented fashion for infrastructural projects of this size. It has been difficult as it is recognised that there has not been a pattern or a history of delivering projects of this nature in Ireland. We are on a learning curve and it is probably unfair to put the blame on the RPA, the Government or whoever. I urge all sides to come together and to come forward with positive ideas to build the transport network we need and ensure we have a world class transport system.</p>

In the light of the public fracas taking place at present between the former Minister for Public Enterprise and current Leader of the Seanad, Senator O'Rourke, and the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, it is regrettable he is not in the House. They appear to be attacking each other in the papers. The Leader of the House is calling on the Minister to stop moaning and groaning and to take his finger out and stop blaming her, and he is retaliating. The Leader of the House is saying everything was on target while she was in office and is asking what happened over the last 16 months.

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_569">In defence of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, there is the former CIE chairman, Brian Joyce. He informed Senator O'Rourke in 2000 that the Luas was heading towards the €1 billion mark, so her story does not add up either. There is grave confusion within the Fianna Fáil Party between past and present. Unfortunately, while Fianna Fáil Members argue among themselves, the public is suffering. The Luas system is already a year behind schedule. I remind the Minister of the famous advertisement which advertised the first train for 2003 and every five minutes afterwards. It will be 2004 at the earliest before the Luas is up and running. Even then there is no guarantee that it will run according to plan. We could be talking about a system that can only cater for about 10% of peak time traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">It is vital, as proposed in the Labour Party motion, to have one transportation policy unit in charge of Dublin. There are far too many transportation areas in Dublin. It is a case of too many chefs in the kitchen resulting in too little food being cooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The Minister for Transport who has been in office 16 months has already been attacked publicly by his predecessor. The public is getting tired and weary of him. He is a good man to issue press releases, provide spin and look good. Unfortunately, so far he has not delivered. The penalty point system has only had limited success. We were told in this House that a dedicated traffic corps would be set up to monitor the system but that has now been scrapped. Unfortunately, the penalty points are not as effective as they should be as a result of that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Minister announced he would get provisional driving licence holders off the road. It was a fantastic announcement. However, he provided no extra resources to Ballina, where licences are processed, and the result is chaos. In my constituency of Carlow there is now a ten month waiting list for a driving test. It is worse in other parts of the country. There is also the crazy scenario of huge variations in the driving test pass rates around the country. The first time application pass rate in Athlone is 43% while in Shannon, County Clare, the pass rate is almost 70%. Something must be done in this regard. Why is there such a huge variation in the pass rate and in the waiting times for tests?</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Recently we had the fiasco with the DART where the Minister was not even aware of the massive disruption that would take place as a result of weekend suspensions of the services. He admitted under cross-examination in the other House that he was not fully aware of the plans. Why can work not be carried out at night, at off-peak times or at weekends while still maintaining some level of service? I cannot understand why everything here must come to a stop at night with any infrastructural project. It is unsatisfactory and we need to get the country moving. Our infrastructure is appalling. It is a ringing indictment of this Government that while in Government at a time of economic boom it did not plan ahead and foresee the difficulties the boom would bring in terms of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Earlier today I spoke about the possible abuse of the word independent in this House. The word expert is definitely abused. An expert is somebody who has great knowledge in his or her field and is reasonably competent and able to predict what will happen in that field. Mr. Owen Keegan told us lately that the level of traffic predicted for Dublin in 2016 is already here. We are 13 years ahead of target. Who were the so-called experts who predicted that level? If I professed myself a transport expert and got my targets wrong by 13 years I would be mortified, I would hang my head and have to go back and learn new formulae because the formulae I used were certainly not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">There is great confusion about the size of vehicles that can use the Dublin Port tunnel. Until the tunnel opens we do not know what percentage of trucks will use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">This week in the Dáil the Taoiseach was forced to clarify the record of the House. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, might do likewise. When he was here during the previous session I raised the issue of the Red Cow roundabout and explained the fiasco we were facing with the Luas and the extra traffic. I was told there was no problem as the experts had agreed there was no difficulty with traffic. They would see how the current system would work. The so-called experts said everything would be fine. Already, before the Luas has even opened, the Minister for Transport has been embarrassed into a climbdown. He has talked about putting the line on stilts and now we have a €300 million plan to upgrade the M50 and the Red Cow roundabout. Where are those experts, who were they and how much were they paid? How can they call themselves experts when they are so clearly wrong?</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Common sense certainly, did not prevail. It was blatantly obvious to anybody who used the Red Cow roundabout that it could not take all the traffic. To introduce Luas trains every three minutes on top of the existing traffic was a recipe for disaster. Even allowing for nominal yearly growth in traffic would lead to interesting times at the roundabout. To expect people to cross over three lanes with a filter light was optimistic in the extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Fine Gael will have no problem supporting the Labour Party motion tonight. The Luas lines in Dublin are a disgrace. A friend of mine who works in the Harcourt Street area had both entrances to his business blocked off by the construction work. It is unbelievable that people take part in works that go way over time and budget. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the original intention was that the Luas would be constructed in 100 meter sections and for the section to be dug up, work carried out and then completed? Instead we seem to have the streets dug up for miles, no timeframe and certainly no hurry on the contractors to get the work done. I cannot understand how the project went so over budget, from €300 million to almost €1 billion, with no questions being asked. Surely if contractors get a contract they should agree to undertake the work and if they go over time the costs should go to them and not the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">In regard to the metro, the credibility of the Government, the NRA and the RPA in particular has been called into question. Either that or the members of the Joint Committee on Transport are the best parliamentarians in the world. When the committee called in the RPA and quizzed it on its projected costs for the metro, the costs were reduced by about €400 million. That is either a compliment to the competence of the Joint Committee on Transport or it is a ringing indictment of the incompetence of the RPA in getting its projections so wrong.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_581">The Minister of State has been here a few times during the past 12 months and I welcome him here again to hear our discussion on transport. I plead with him to take into account that the Progressive Democrats believe there are too many agencies interlinking with the various local authorities in the transport area in Dublin. There are breakdowns in communication which lead to lengthy time spans for decisions to be made. The DTO is a policy driven body which issues policy to the various organisations. Often that policy is not taken into account and the strategy the office might propose is put to one side.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I ask the Minister to consider investment in rail, roads and underground as a transport system for Dublin. He should not just look at the argument that we should have a roads, rail or tram based transport system. There must be a link between all three. For too long we have had the argument of one versus the other and for far too long we have been caught up in a long decision making process as to which way we would go.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">We hear much talk about the Red Cow roundabout and the traffic on the N7. I would like to bring it to the attention of the House that the peak traffic at the Red Cow roundabout is equivalent to the off-peak traffic at Scott's roundabout on the Navan Road, the N3. These are the NRA figures and should be a cause of concern for the way Dublin is developing. They would also be a grave cause of concern in regard to the imminent decision, which I hope will be soundly based, as to whether to upgrade the M50 to three lanes in both directions. That decision will come before the Minister very soon. Any work will cause grave disruption. Given the problems caused by Luas, people in those areas, especially the commuting public, will have to be told at an early stage what is involved in future transport networks in Dublin and the pain they will have to undergo. We cannot make any more decisions without telling the public in advance what is required. We need only recall the hysteria about the weekend closure of the southside DART service. If the DART has to be upgraded then so be it, the work is being carried out only at weekends and there is an alternative system of buses in place. We will have to take some pain over time. As the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said, we will have to give Luas a chance and see what happens. The overall benefit that Luas will bring will be equivalent only to the numbers carried on the 46A QBC at peak times. The extension of Luas to the docklands is worthwhile but future extensions should be deferred to ensure we see the merits of extending Luas further.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The most important item for the Minister to consider is further investment in the rail network. The suburban rail network coming into Dublin from Kildare and Navan is under-resourced. The existing line needs only further signalling, platform extensions and extra carriages. It is not a case of reinventing the wheel as the capacity is available on the line. These improvements will not cost as much as one might think when one looks at our future traffic congestion. Compared to the rest of Europe the level of traffic congestion here is imponderable. No city in Europe of comparable size is now operating without a metro, except Luxembourg whose population is only 80,000. I urge the Minister to make an early decision on the metro. Last summer I had the pleasure of visiting Professor Melis in Madrid. When one looks at what has been achieved there in the last eight years, with over 100 kilometres of tunnelling and a metro in place, one has to ask serious questions of the systems and methods used in to do business in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">We have to question the costs forecast by the RPA as the taxpayer cannot bear them. The money will not be there. For those reasons we must look at the issue of competition for the metro contract. Who can do it most cheaply and most efficiently? We must look at the European experience, not just at Irish or English experiences. Madrid offers a reasonable example which works. Professor Melis has visited this country and gave the benefit of his knowledge to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. He is available to continue sharing his knowledge with us. I hope we will have an Irish metro at Madrid prices, not an Irish metro at Irish prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">We have to continue investing in our rail service across Dublin and in a metro. We will not get traffic moving freely without a metro, given the levels of car ownership and employment in the city. We should not have to wait seven or ten years for this. Building the metro in Madrid caused far less disruption there than building Luas has done here. Our systems and our methods to date have been found wanting. I do not know whether consultants are to blame, as Senator Browne said and as Professor Melis believes. He says we have too many consultants, consulting among themselves and with local authorities, and that does not allow for quick decision making on behalf of Government. For those reasons the metro is essential as is further investment in rail and in Dublin Bus. To have those investments we must ensure our unions and the management of CIE deliver reform with that future investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">There is no doubt we are in a mess on this issue. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, who is an old friend of mine and I am always happy to hear what he has to say. However, I have the impression that the Minister has funked coming in here to debate this with his predecessor, Senator O'Rourke. We would have enjoyed hearing their views. I do not know what he is afraid of. They could speak at different times. The Cathaoirleach might mention this to the Minister because it is upsetting and it takes away somewhat from the debate.

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_594">There is always a double-think on the question of traffic. As a starting point there should be one person in charge of transport. There are too many bodies. If I had a choice in the morning I would nominate the one person who has achieved everything he has set out to do, the much reviled Mr. Keegan. He has always delivered exactly what he said he would, he has taken on those who criticised him and has always been prepared. When he set up the Donnybrook quality bus corridor the people in RTE were appalled – they get upset about that kind of thing outside their front door. He offered them bets that he would have increased usership and improved the time within months. The recent survey, to which Senator Dooley referred, has just proved that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The problem with Mr. Keegan's job is that his remit extends only to the city area. He has done his part of what needs to be done but it does not fit in with anyone else. A good example is the park and ride scheme. The quality bus corridors are working very well but they are no good if people cannot leave their cars at their starting point. There is no place to park where corridors begin in Finglas, Blanchardstown, Stillorgan or Malahide, and I could go on. If park and ride facilities, which were part of the plan into which Mr. Keegan was feeding, were there, it would make life much easier. There is no doubt that a bus can bring someone into the city far quicker than a private car and more people are using it in that way. If someone is coming along the N3 who wants to use the quality bus corridor when there is a bus from Ashbourne or from Finglas, what can he or she do with his or her car? Senator Morrissey made the same point about lack of co-ordination.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The other example is the port tunnel. Will we ban trucks that cannot fit into the tunnel from the roads, a decision I would support? It is a great idea but I do not believe the Government will do that. Those trucks are not allowed into many parts of Europe but we will build the tunnel to comply with the current regulations and they will just come back onto the streets, or somewhere else, and continue on their way. When the port tunnel opens it will bring another 8,000 trucks a day onto the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Having regard to the current state of the M50 and the Red Cow roundabout, where will the 8,000 additional trucks go from the M1/N1 at that stage? Similarly, in relation to the Luas lines, there is no integrated system. One has only to look at a map of Dublin, showing the DART and Luas lines – we will leave the proposed metro aside for the moment as nobody knows where it will go – to realise that none of them connect. There is a gap between the two Luas lines and neither of them meet the DART line. How can one have fluid transportation and movement in that situation? It just cannot be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I would prefer to spend €300 million on getting the two Luas lines to meet, rather than discussing what to do about the Red Cow roundabout. I do not believe there will be any action in relation to the Red Cow roundabout. Subject to correction, I believe I heard the Minister for Transport give three different costings as to what he might do there, on a good day. Whatever may be done in that regard, there will still be toll booths further up the road – we should get rid of those.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">We are facing a complete mess, taking account of the situation with the Luas lines, the lack of co-ordination between the Luas and the DART, the lack of park and ride facilities in relation to quality bus corridors and the complete lack of clarity as to the effect of the Dublin port tunnel on other traffic in the area. The latter project will make matters worse in many ways. It will do what it sets out to do in the immediate underground section, but it will cause trouble further back.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Incidentally, I have no objection to the proposed work on the DART system at weekends. That is the only time it can be done and politicians should be supportive in that regard. It is not a Government issue, one way or another. The real issue is the lack of proper long-term planning. We should have realised a long time ago that we needed longer platforms and more carriages.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I hand over now to the acknowledged expert and spokesperson on transport in the Independent group, Senator Norris, who has made this his brief.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_602">In thanking Senator O'Toole, I deny that I am an expert but I am certainly interested in the topic. We are fortunate in having such an excellent Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, including Senators Dooley, Morrissey and Browne, in which excellent work is done on a non-partisan basis. Unfortunately, when issues come to the House, they become partisan.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">While I will vote with the Opposition at the end of this debate, I am not convinced that, given the opportunity, it would have made a better fist of the situation. I have been in the House long enough to know the rigmaroles which have gone on. Let us please concentrate on the key issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I am glad the metro idea was supported on all sides as it is critically important to the welfare of this city. I particularly support the Labour Party's comment on the failure of the Government's Railway Procurement Agency to set out a coherent plan for the provision of the metro system. That agency must be given a kick and told to get on with it. I am greatly concerned that the Government's amendment weakens the position it appears to take with regard to the metro. It simply "notes the proposals made by the RPA for the provision of a Metro service for Dublin". That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">During the summer, I read a book by Gore Vidal about American foreign policy and the creation of a new American empire. At one point, he said: "The sweetest words in the English language are ‘I told you so.'                       "  That is not true – those are the bitterest words in the English language. Five years ago in this House, I outlined what would happen if the Luas proposals went ahead as they were then scheduled and spoke of the need for an underground rail system. I do not gloat over that and I do not want to say "I told you so". I wish I was in a position to point to a metro system being developed and say "There you are". Those would be the three sweetest words in the English language if, through co-operation, we can bring a project to fruition and fulfilment.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">With regard to the Luas, a recent newspaper report highlighted the fact that 2,800 km. of railway were built in Australia for the same price as the Luas is costing us. That is astonishing. I acknowledge that we reduced the cost and I lay a little claim to that – I know that nobody else will give me any credit for it so I will do so on my own behalf. Professor Melis has been much quoted in this context. Over a number of years, I worked very closely with Cormac Rabbitte and Rudy Monaghan, who really deserve a statue to commemorate their contribution to recognising the defects in the Luas and the need for the metro, which they articulated very capably.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I arranged a meeting between Cormac Rabbitte and Deputy Eoin Ryan, the excellent chairman of our transport committee, who established contact between Professor Melis and the Cabinet sub-committee. The Minister for Transport went to Madrid to see the system in operation there, including a form of head-to-head contract under which the various elements were split up. Over a period of 18 months, work proceeded on sections of the project, rather than giving a single contract to one contractor. All sections proceeded simultaneously, working round the clock.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">It gives me no joy to say "I told you so", nor do I particularly wish to do so. However, the record of this House speaks for itself. We foresaw these situations over five years ago in terms of identifying the factors which would make the Luas more costly and the issue of the interface between dedicated rail transport and private vehicles. All of that was pointed out, but we now have the situation of the mad cow roundabout, or whatever is the appropriate description. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, said it is incredible that this situation should happen. It is a dreadful indictment of our processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">In my mailbox today, and, no doubt, those of other Members, there was a copy of a report on the proposal to put the Luas on stilts at the Red Cow roundabout. Was it not rather late to commission that report on 27 August 2003? The project has been in the planning stages for a long time and the inbuilt contradictions had been pointed out. Yet, it was not until the end of August that a report was commissioned with a view to rectifying the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">In supporting the Labour Party on this motion, I hope I am not doing so in a divisive way. I look forward to working with my excellent colleagues from all sides of the House. As one of the older Members of the House, it gives me some heart that we have such intelligent, talented and committed young people on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, working together in a constructive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Without repeating the entire argument, it is essential that a metro system is installed. Senator Browne said it can only deal with 10% – the figure is actually less than 10%, as we pointed out five years ago – but let us try to go ahead. The metro is so important and essential to the welfare of this city. I appeal to Senators on the Government side to express their disappointment that there is not a commitment to the metro. Nobody can describe "noting proposals" as a commitment – the situation has gone far beyond that stage. Those on the Government side must ensure that we live up to this commitment. It is cheaper in the long run, as has been stated over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">In the European Union, we have free movement of goods and services. If we cannot obtain a decent deal from the Irish construction industry, let us advertise it all over Europe. If necessary, let us ask Professor Melis to bring over a team to do the job for us, if we are incapable of doing it ourselves at the right price. The costings for this project are absurd. In a radio interview, the head of this operation mentioned a figure of the order of €4.8 billion, of which the construction cost was only €1.2 billion. When he was asked how the other €3.6 billion was accounted for, he referred to contingencies, overruns and insurance. If insurance and contingencies are to cost three times as much as the cost of construction, we are in an Alice in Wonderland situation. Let us get back to reality, with the excellent talent we have in this House and push forward for the metro.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">I am proud to support a Government, including this Government and its predecessor from 1997, which, on a sustained basis, is putting so much investment into transport, including public transport. That was not the case in the past. Senator Browne referred to lack of foresight. In the 19 point programme put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party at the start of the 1997 election, one will not find any mention of transport or infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">If one looks at the Book of Estimates one will see there was no Exchequer money for public transport, although there was some European Union money. That situation has been totally transformed and much of the credit for that goes to our Leader, Senator O'Rourke, when she was the Minister for Public Enterprise with responsibility for transport. She will go down in the history books as having pioneered the rail safety programme which is vital to the maintenance of the network. I give credit also to the current Minister and the public is giving him credit also, as shown by the opinion polls, for his energy, commitment and application to the problems involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The quality bus corridors are excellent. I have used the ones on the Stillorgan road and the buses arrive very regularly, but their limitation is that they are a road-based solution competing with other road space. The QBCs are definitely part of the solution for a long time to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Huge capacity improvements are taking place currently including the DART, the Luas and so on. Much of the Opposition motion appears to be taken up with complaining that we are breaking eggs while making the omelette. Inevitably, there will be disruption but an enormous amount of work is under way and we are seeing the fruits of it. For example, the M1 to Dundalk is terrific and it is something that is actually complete. While it is correct that many projects are not joined up at present, they will be much more joined up in three or four years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I am a great believer in the Luas. It will be a marvellous facility when it is opened. I hope that coming up to the Red Cow roundabout, for example, people will find a station or stop to leave their cars and come into town by public transport and pick up their cars at the end of the day. There are problems at the Red Cow roundabout and they have nothing to do with the Luas. The problem is that we do not have enough experience of trams. In a city like Vienna, trams go through some of the main streets, wait for the lights and so on. There is no extra disruption involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Senator O'Toole, myself and others discussed this matter in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the aspect that would make the biggest difference to Dublin transport currently in that area would be if we were to buy out national toll roads, remove the toll booths and so on. It is not good transport policy to have tolls on the periphery of cites. Paris has tolls on the cross-country routes but they do not have them in the city. We should give serious consideration to putting electronic tolling in place fairly quickly. If we have €200 million to spend on one area, that might make a bigger contribution than stilts, graded separations, spaghetti junctions or whatever are the different options.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The metro is an important project although I would prefer a public transport system for Dublin that puts an emphasis on Luas rather than metro. I would like to see the metro supporting Luas rather than the other way around. If, for any reason, the Government decides it cannot currently afford the metro, there is the alternative of the fixed rail over-ground link to Dublin Airport but whatever is decided, there should be a rail link, be it metro or overhead line, to the airport by 2007. I urge the Minister to stick to that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Mention is made in the Opposition motion about the southern ring road but the delays in that are largely due to Carrickmines. I looked up Peter Harbison's <i>National Antiquities and Monuments of Ireland</i> and Carrickmines Castle is not even mentioned. If we are going to spend large sums of money on environmental improvements and so on, is it necessarily the areas identified by protesters that we want to spend the money on? The Taoiseach referred to the snails, the swans and all the rest of it, and he had a point.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The final point I wish to make is a broader one. We must avoid becoming so immersed – Senator Dooley made this point – in the problems of the greater Dublin area that we lose sight of the larger picture, which is the national spatial strategy. Dublin is not the only city in this country. Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford also need public transport investment. For the €200 million or €300 million talked about to fix the Red Cow roundabout problem, the problems of Cork, Waterford, Galway and Limerick could be fixed in one go. Something that causes some resentment throughout the country is the fact that money appears to be no object when it comes to Dublin but projects like, for example, the Midleton line in Cork has been ongoing for 20 years without a decision. Unless something is done, the same will be the case with Limerick, Shannon and so on. We need a balanced national transport policy that also looks beyond the problems of the greater Dublin area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I support the motion. Everybody in this House should support it because, as we are hearing from those on the Government side, they support the idea of providing a good public transport system and they are only splitting hairs in opposing the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I want to pick up on something Senator Mansergh said. We all agree that we need a good public transport system throughout the country. I live in Dublin but come from Cork. We are here tonight to talk about Dublin and we must recognise that we have a huge population in Dublin and this is where many businesses want to invest their money. We saw an example of that recently with a company called eBay. The Government offered that company huge incentives to locate in the countryside but eBay decided it wanted to locate in Dublin. That is the reality. Dublin is the centre for many businesses. It is close to the airport and to ports. We have to strike an imbalance, so to speak, when we are dealing with the infrastructure for Dublin because we are so congested that something will give. My fear is that many of the businesses which have located here from overseas will vacate the country because it is so difficult for them to move about the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">From the Dublin Chamber of Commerce we hear that congestion costs the economy €1 billion and costs businesses €650 million. A total of 420,000 people commute to the city by bus, train or car but 70% of the people travel by car. The reasons for that are simple. The public transport system is not adequate to cope with the numbers involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In my area we have the Connolly-Maynooth line, which has been upgraded. We have seen improvements, for which we are grateful, but the line is not adequate to cope with the number of people who wish to use it. For example, we have no park and ride facility, which has been referred to by others. There is only one park and ride facility beside Clonsilla railway station. No other station has such a facility. We have no park and ride facilities outside the Dublin boundary where we should have them to get people out of their cars before they reach Blanchardstown. The same can be said for the rest of the city. It is a disgrace that we have not developed park and ride facilities. If we are serious about getting people out of cars, we have to provide those facilities for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Members on the Government side must be really embarrassed about Luas because the way it is being dealt with is a farce.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">We talk about the length of time it should take to deliver a system, whether it is Luas or metro. Senator Morrissey referred to the model in Madrid which we should follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">In 1997 the city of Montpellier in France was developing its Luas type system. It is up and running, yet we are still struggling with ours. There is something seriously wrong and Members on the Government side have referred to that. When we talk about the problems Luas will bring, it is not just the Red Cow roundabout. There will be serious problems on the north quays with traffic coming in from west Dublin through the Phoenix Park. Luas will cross the quays from Heuston Station every three minutes. That will cause major problems unless we get people out of their cars. However, there is nothing coming on stream in the west of Dublin to get people out of their cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">As I said, the Connolly-Maynooth line has improved but it is not adequate. The Minister of State has heard me say that before and he will say he takes the train and there is plenty of room on it. There is not room on that train during morning and evening peak times. People have been known to faint on it. Pregnant women taking that train must stand for the duration of the journey and feel unwell when they get off it. It is a Third World service.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">We need to develop the Spencer Dock terminus for the Maynooth and Sligo routes and we must have an interchange in Phibsboro. In the longer term, the proposed new rail tunnel linking Connolly and Heuston stations should go through the south inner city thereby creating a circular line connecting the central rail stations and key locations in between. We must invest in the signalling system between Connolly and Pearse Street stations to increase the number of trains coming through at peak times. These measures are essential and it will take years to get these things done at the present rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The programme for Government stated that there would be integrated ticketing between bus, rail and DART stations and smart card technology but we have seen no sign of that. These are essential things which are taken for granted in most other European cities. The programme for Government also stated that the metro for Dublin would be developed on a public private partnership basis making the maximum use of private finance and achieving a link to Dublin Airport by 2007. Like Senator Mansergh, I hope there will be a link to the airport by 2007 and that there will be a metro.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">When we discussed where the national stadium would be located some time ago – the discussion has not been completed – and when it was proposed to locate it in the Dublin 15 area, the carrot being handed out at the time was that the area would get the metro if it took the stadium. Even if we had got the stadium there is no way this metro would have been provided by 2007 given how long it has taken to provide the Luas lines. There is much work to do. The Progressive Democrats seem to be very much in favour of the motion put down by the Labour Party and I would like to see it support it.</p>

I have never seen him shy away from confrontation on any issue he believes should be confronted. The issue under discussion is Dublin transport services and how we can have an integrated plan for the greater Dublin area. I am delighted the Opposition has given us this opportunity. It has allowed us to make our views known and to state how good we are.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">There is no perfect solution. I would like the world to be perfect. I am not perfect; I do not know whether I am saying the right or wrong thing but at least I can say I am doing my best, as our Government is, to get an integrated plan for the greater Dublin area. That is what the Government is trying to do and the plan is on its way. We are not negative. I want to be positive. Why would I want to be a whinger? There are too many whingers. I want to be able to say the Luas is coming on stream.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Opposition was in Government between 1994 and 1997 when the big question was why we could not extend the platforms in stations as far as Greystones and beyond Skerries. Those opposite were in Government. Why did they not bring in the extended platforms at that stage? The DART is chock-a-block during rush hour every evening. One would not be able to get on unless one queued for an hour, particularly in the Sandymount area where I have tried to get on but it was impossible. Extra carriages are needed, although I am glad to say we have increased the number of carriages. Capacity has been increased by over 50% in the last three years, so we are trying. It is not a success story yet but I want it to be one.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Of course, there are faults. We do not have an integrated system or an integrated bus system throughout Dublin. The situation is crazy in pockets of the city. However, we have bus corridors which are working well. There is a fabulous one on the Stillorgan Road and I would never use a car coming in on that route. However, when it started to operate, there was considerable opposition to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">The DART came on stream about 15 years ago but it took years for it to get off the ground. I do not blame the Opposition for that. It was not its fault that it could not get it off the ground when in Government. It is not our fault when things go wrong because we have problems getting things off the ground. I welcome the Taoiseach's proposal to establish a national infrastructure board which will consider the common good when trying to progress matters in relation to the national infrastructure, including the roads network. This is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The M50 is a great success. As Senator Terry knows, it used to be called the ring road. It is almost completed and has reached Dundrum. The next stage is being held up but when it is completed, it will link up with the N11 and the airport road. It was a superb achievement to get it off the ground. Nobody anticipated that the Celtic tiger would roar to the extent that there are four or five cars to each household. We all know young people use their cars rather than buses. We have the problem of incorporating thinking on public transport as well as introducing a link between public and private modes of transport, which has to come into play.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">We also have to make sure that the links in the outer suburban areas work. We have got that very wrong in the bus network outside the greater Dublin area. That is not working and I do not know why. I am always fighting for that, locally, in an effort to get a network of buses east to west. That is not working, but I do not know where it is falling down.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">There are pitfalls and I would be the first to point out to the Minister where he is slipping. However, the overall vision is what I am interested in. We must ask how we can fast track this to the extent that cars will be removed from the roads to facilitate the working of the public and private transport system in the greater Dublin area, implement the Dublin Transportation Initiative bus corridors and have the Luas project up and running. The line from Sandyford to town is almost up and running, as well as the line from Tallaght to Connolly Station. That work is beginning to move.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">We have a long way to go but we are trying. We have an overall vision. Up to now it has not been working as well as we would like, but the M50 is nearing completion. The metro is being reappraised at present to evaluate cost effectiveness and those proposals are due to go to the Cabinet shortly. Matters are progressing and the Minister should keep moving these projects as fast as he can to give quality of life to the people of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Four years ago, it took people in the area I represent three hours to get to work in the morning. I received many telephone calls at 9 a.m. about it. Now, they sail into town as a result of the completion of the ring road. Things are working not absolutely as desired at present, but in four or five years we will have an increased quality of life that everybody in the greater Dublin area will enjoy.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_663">There are a number of reasons for somebody based 160 miles from Dublin intervening in this debate, as I am doing now. For a variety of reasons over the last year, I have had to drive to Dublin virtually every week and, as a result, I have come to realise that Dublin's traffic is in an appalling mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">When I was a child living in south Kildare, when most cars could not exceed 40 mph and the roads were infinitely worse than they are now, one could drive from my home town of Athy to anywhere in Dublin with the assumption that it would take no more than an hour. Now we have motorways, bypasses and ring-roads, a point on which Senator Ormonde was eloquent, and it takes two hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">When I first moved to Cork it took three hours to get from Cork to Newlands Cross and a further half hour to get anywhere else I wanted to be in Dublin. It now takes three and a quarter hours to get to Newlands Cross and an hour to get to wherever one wants to be in Dublin. That is by car, after some of this provision has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">If one is an unfortunate person from the country heading in the direction of Dublin Airport one's shock only begins with the "mad cow" roundabout, which seems to have been designed – I do not often quote Kevin Myers – to guarantee the maximum upset to the maximum number of people coming into and going out of Dublin. I have no idea which genius decided that so many major roads out of and into Dublin should all coincide in one inadequate junction. However, somebody did and I have a suspicion I know which Department took the decision to underinvest in that roundabout. It was probably not the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department of Transport. I am sure the geniuses in the Department of Finance, who are not accountable to anybody, whose performance is not measured by anybody and who are not under any benchmark of any form, decided that the traffic expectations that are now the reality were unrealistic and decided we did not need what turned out to be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">If one manages to get beyond that roundabout one meets the Westlink. If ever there was an exercise in ideological nonsense it was the decision to make the most critical link on the northern loop of the M50 a toll bridge. No matter how many explanations the operators of that bridge try to produce, the fundamental problem on the M50 between the Red Cow roundabout and Dublin Airport is that there is not sufficient capacity to handle the number of people who are required to slow down and pay tolls. However, they do not stop at the ideological nonsense of forcing people to pay for something that should have been provided by the taxpayer. They add to it by not telling people until they are at the tolls how much they have to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">If one comes off the M50, as most people going to Dublin Airport from the country do, one sees a vague sign saying "toll ahead."  When one gets closer to it, one discovers there is a way of paying without having to look for change, but at that stage one is in whichever queue one happens to get into because nobody gave the information one needed beforehand. Nobody on the whole M50 thought of telling anybody anything, confirming my view that my profession of engineering is very taken with large constructs but not very good at thinking of the people who have to use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Those who created that structure put up a big sign saying "autopay", or whatever it is, but when one gets closer, one finds a handwritten sign, stating "all vehicles through this lane", at which stage one changes rapidly into another lane at the risk of colliding with a motorist behind who has better eyesight. I wonder about the people who organise these things. It is not relevant to Dublin, but I heard my colleague Senator Hayes describe coming from the North to join the new motorway outside Dundalk only to find that they will not take sterling.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_673">I go around the M50 sometimes in desperation, trying to avoid coming in on the main, direct route. Therefore, I enter the M50, turn right and come in through Templeogue. On the main road from Clondalkin to the M50 roundabout there is a big sign telling one to take the right-hand lane if turning right, that is, going to the M50. Once in that lane, one discovers that the construction of the Luas has closed off the lane which the main signpost tells one to take if one wants to get onto the M50. Who plans those things? That is the fundamental problem with this country and this city's traffic. People are planning grand constructs without thinking about the implications and the impact on ordinary citizens. One can go through this to the point of tedium.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The current policy about the M50 which changes from week to week, from spaghetti junction to stilts, is bad enough. However, newspaper reports suggest that the National Roads Authority and the Railway Procurement Agency have an occasional semaphore exchange of vague intentions when they should be working hand in glove. If they are incapable of doing so, it is the responsibility of the Minister who will not come to this House to talk about it. If they cannot work out an agreed coherent position, they should be made to do so or be fired. The idea that two agencies are discussing the most difficult roundabout in Dublin through occasional communication with one another sums up all that is contained in the Labour Party motion. The Government amendment says no more than that it is doing more than zero and that, therefore, it is very good. However, the citizens of this country and city deserve a proper performance which has not yet materialised.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">I give my full support to this motion. We wait with bated breath to see how Senator Morrissey votes and hope to see him support the motion given his contribution in its favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">How can a Government, which presents for our consideration a national spatial strategy, national development plan and the Dublin Transportation Office and Department of Public Enterprise document, A Platform for Change, with the accompanying implication of transport cohesion, ignore or not have the spatial intelligence or foresight to consider and put in place a coherent and viable transport strategy for our capital city?</p>
          <p eId="para_677">While there is no denying that Ireland as a whole needs and must have major improvements to its transport infrastructure, the general public and particularly those residing, working and visiting Dublin are losing faith in the Government's ability to provide this essential development. We are currently lost in a maze of disconnected and seemingly dead-end transport projects. The much published and self-congratulatory national development plan of 1999 contained plans for dual carriageways from Dublin to all major cities and the Luas tram system in the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">However, the Government has already admitted that its plans for Dublin were as inadequate as they now seem to be. I hope I am not being prophetic in attempting to cover the Government's tracks. In their amendment to this motion, Senators Dooley, Ormonde and Mansergh had the audacity to endorse the progress of Luas despite the assurances of the Minister for Transport that aspects of the Luas system are a mess and that it would be better to build a city-wide rail system completely underground. I am surprised at the Leader tabling an amendment to this motion, given her attitude towards the Minister which is in the public domain, namely, that if she were still Minister for Public Enterprise, she would have righted the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Luas project has been described by former Fine Gael Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, as "an unmitigated disaster". Surely this is no understatement when describing a project that is more than twice over budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">From the time Luas was first discussed, it was apparent that a metro system would offer a more practical and ultimately more cost effective long-term solution to the Dublin's out of control traffic and transportation problems. However, following the major disruption that laying the Luas tracks has brought to Dublin streets, they are to be dug up again before Christmas for testing a metro rail system which has not even received Cabinet approval. This is despite the fact that Harcourt Street and Abbey Street have already been dug up for over two years. The Australians built a 2,800 kilometre long railway system for exactly the same price as the 23 kilometre Luas system not only ahead of schedule but under budget.</p>

I cannot imagine what will happen to the Opposition's arguments when we manage to find a solution, which we will. The Red Cow roundabout was conceived in 1984, when the thinking was that in 2014 it would be capable of handling 45,000 vehicles. Our recent economic success, which as Senator McDowell said reached double digit figures, has meant that today upwards of 100,000 cars are using the Red Cow roundabout. Ten years ago there were 800,000 cars in the country while today there are 1.63 million cars compared to 1.2 million houses. We have to deal with the problems stemming from our economic success but we are solving them.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Senator Terry mentioned the experience of Montpellier in France, of which I am aware. The Montpellier project was conceived in 1992-93. The Senator is correct in saying that it was started in 1997 and is now operational. We started our Luas project two years ago and it will be finished next year. Many Senators have mentioned the Luas project and the Dublin Port tunnel. I saw a young man on the television news the other night complaining about what the Taoiseach had said concerning the eco warriors costing us a fortune in recent years. In the soundbite, the young man said "Take a look at the Luas and the port tunnel", but what is wrong with those two projects? The Luas will be finished in 2004 and the port tunnel in 2005. I am quite sure that Senators with an interest in the Dublin transport system will be making sure they are in the photo opportunities when those projects open. Senators are saying exactly the same things that were said about the DART 20 years ago.</p>

We are working in accordance with the DTO's Platform for Change. If Senators examine our current figures they will see that people are already changing over to public transport. We have examined other public transport areas, including what has been called the London miracle. I accept there is a difference between Dublin and London's public transport systems because the latter has extra facilities. I am not blaming people here for taking their cars to work every morning but I believe that when we are able to produce a suitable public transport system people will use it.</p>

          <from>Dr. McDaid</from>
          <p eId="para_708">That is exactly what we are trying to do. As Members will be aware, the Luas system consists of two light rail lines. It is the first major piece of public infrastructure to be constructed in Dublin since the DART some 20 years ago. I have no doubt it will prove to be as popular and attractive to Dubliners as the DART. As the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has said, Senators in the greater Dublin area will be looking for extensions of the Luas line to their own areas when it is up and running. It is a pity, therefore, to hear what they have had to say about it in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The Luas depots at the Red Cow and in Sandyford have been completed. Some 70% of the light rail line has been completed and the test tracks at the Red Cow and Sandyford are in place. I have heard arguments about differences in cost but obviously the people making those arguments do not know what they are talking about because there were two different projects, plan A and plan B. We decided that we were going to run with plan B, which was estimated initially at €465 million but when all the planning problems were taken into consideration the cost was put at €675 million. That was taking into account competitive tender prices, higher inflation in the construction sector, higher than anticipated property acquisition costs and changes to the scope of the project. The Luas project is running to cost and, although there has been some slippage in the time element, the consequences are not significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The RPA has advised my Department that the final cost of the project will be within the approved budget of €691 million, plus the contingency plan of €84 million as advised to the Government in December 2002. Unfortunately, there has been some slippage in the timetable for completion of the Luas. We urge all the companies involved, both in the public and private sectors, to do all in their power to ensure that no further delay takes place. We are happy that this will be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Senators have heard about all the discomfiture that the Luas works have brought about but I am not aware of any cities where light rail systems have been installed without disruption. Once the systems commence operating, however, they have been a great success. Which of us would not put up with some short-term pain for long-term gain? Senators can ask their opposite numbers in foreign cities what the situation was with regard to the construction of light rail systems and they will say that exactly the same situation prevailed.</p>

          <p eId="para_723">Some people consider what is happening with the DART to be a necessary evil. It does not matter, however, if we upgraded the system – adding extra carriages and extending the platforms – in 1984, 2014 or 2024 because the same discomfiture would occur. We have to deal with it now because the long-term benefits of upgrading the system will be great. The Department has gone into all the aspects of doing this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">QBCs were referred to, some of which have been a huge success. Naturally there are some problems because QBCs do not appear overnight. Someone said that we are giving money to Dublin and Cork. We are currently waiting on plans for QBCs from Waterford and Galway for which the money is available. We are not keeping all the money in the Dublin area. Some €19 million is being invested in traffic management grants in the quality bus corridor network in the Dublin area. This follows a total investment of €72 million for QBCs up to 2002 and €15 million is already committed to QBC projects in Dublin next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">As Members know, the metro has many advantages. It can reduce travel times and congestion, improve the reliability, availability and quality of public transport and make public transport more attractive to car users. It also has the potential to improve the quality of life for the people of Dublin and for those visiting whether on business or for tourism. In 2001 the Government decided that, given the costs involved, the metro network should be phased and a call for expressions of interest were sent out. There were 22 companies anxious to build the metro. Late last year, the RPA submitted an outline business case for a number of routing options with different costs. However, given the changed economic environment, even the cheapest option was considered too costly. The RPA was asked for a more affordable option, taking account of the experience in Madrid.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The estimated patronage for the metro line one, which we will all agree is a necessity, is 24 million passengers by 2016. The RPA has tailored a proposal to allow for this patronage level initially, with a possibility in the future of the metro being expanded to cater for a significant capacity increase. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, will be bringing proposals for phase 1 to Cabinet in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I also heard arguments this evening about the linking up of all the systems, which is desirable. Given time this will occur. Surely it is of some benefit that even the Luas line from Tallaght to Connolly station links in with Heuston station and Bus Áras because 15 million people pass through these stations each year. Instead of building all the systems Harry Potter style, it is not such a bad idea to be able to convenience 15 million people with the current Tallaght to Connolly station line.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">There have been five major roads projects since 2000 at a cost of €2 billion. These are necessary in areas with a high population. Like many Senators, I come from a rural area and I would give anything for a small percentage of the money which is being spent here. However, Dublin is our capital city. It is a major population area and this must be taken into consideration. Some €1.2 billion is being spent annually on roads. At the moment three of the projects are costing between €700 million and €800 million of that budget. When the projects to which I referred in my speech are completed I hope we will have money to spend throughout the country. However, we should walk before we run.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">On traffic management, to help encourage greater use of public transport, the DTO has engaged consultants to undertake a demand management study. It is looking at Dublin city centre and whether charges should apply. No decision has been made in this regard. We are looking at London, though it is different from here because they have alternatives. Perhaps we should look at London after we have the initial infrastructure in place. We must accept that people do not use their cars for selfish reasons. People will use public transport when it becomes available.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">As reform and regulations have not been mentioned there is no point in my going into these areas again. Senators Morrissey and Browne referred to provisional licences, which is being considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">The Minister of State suggested that we on this side of the House were reading Harry Potter novels during the summer. My life is much sadder than that. I have been reading the New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, published by his Department in August 2002. The nature of its fantasy makes Harry Potter seem rather mild. I read The Proposal on Public Transport Infrastructure, published by Forfás in the same year, which is total fantasy. I also read A Platform for Change, to which the Government committed itself three or four years ago. It is full of wonderful fancy diagrams, which is in the realm of fantasy. I would be more than happy to come back here in two years' time and present the Minister of State with that diagram and if he can fill in any of those lines, I would be surprised.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">None of us is complaining about the fact that eggs must be broken to make an omelette but about the fact the Minister is flinging around eggs with gay abandon with no particular planning and to no effect. The problem is that for years we have been spending much money and getting virtually nothing for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Talking about fantasy, I am not sure if anyone remembers the press statement issued by the Minister of State's Department in 2000 under the name of the then Minister, the now Leader of this House. It states: "Government announces metro for Dublin". That was announced more than three years ago. It does not use the words "would", "maybe" or "if". It states the Government directed the CIE light rail office to immediately commence the necessary preparatory work for the metro public private partnership with the objective of seeking invitations to tender within 12 months. We are now told three and a half years later that a number of companies have expressed a certain interest in a much scaled down version of the metro which was announced as fact and planned three and a half years ago. How can we have any faith that the Government will deliver anything next year or in two years' time as the Minister of State promised? It is as a result of bitter experience over the past six years, when money was available, that we can, unfortunately, predict with some confidence that much of what has been promised yet again here this evening will not become reality in four or five years' time and that the difficulties which the citizens of this city experience on a daily basis will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I want to mention one Government proposal which was widely supported, particularly on this side of the House, but which has still not seen reality, although I do not understand why, namely, the proposal announced three and a half years ago to put in place a transportation authority for Dublin which would, among other things, take a strategic view of the overall Dublin area, including the four local authorities which it currently comprises and would look, among other things, at land use strategy within the city. The intention was that that would decide the overall policy and would have enforcement mechanisms to ensure that the bodies charged with implementation would do that job. That body has not been put in place. I understand there is still a commitment from the Government to do it and I do not understand why such a simple mechanism, which everyone accepts is necessary, has not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The Minister forthrightly defended his case, although it is a difficult one to defend.</p>

        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_758">I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach for choosing this matter for discussion on the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Friday, 19 September 2003 will be etched in the memories of the residents of Pullathomas and Glengad, County Mayo, for many years to come. A freak, massive torrent of rainwater poured down on the local mountain, tearing huge craters in the landscape. The debris was washed in massive quantities down the side of the mountain. Roadways were completely ripped up; bridges were destroyed and washed away; small mountain drains and streams became huge torrents, cutting deep ravines into the hillside; tractors were swept down the hills and, as I have seen myself, some of them remain embedded in several feet of mountain soil; dwellings and farm buildings were submerged under mounds of mountain debris; a total of 32 houses were evacuated and alternative accommodation had to be found for these families.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Gradually, based on the geologists' reports, families began to return, depending on whether their dwellings were categorised as low or medium risk. Eight families cannot return because their houses are deemed to be high risk. Another four houses were under construction at the time of the landslide and are all deemed to be in the high risk zone. As of now, it looks as though these houses will never be safely habitable again. Many of the houses to which people have returned were very badly damaged. I visited the scene with my party leader, Deputy Kenny, Deputy Ring, Joe McCartan MEP and Councillor Gerry Coyle. Substantial repairs and reconstruction will be necessary in these cases and in the case of the 12 high risk houses there is the prospect of relocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">When I was the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works in 1995, I was confronted with a similar situation at Glenbrack, Gort, County Galway, and other areas throughout the country where widespread flooding occurred and where beautiful new dwelling houses were submerged to a depth of several feet, and in some cases to roof top level, for several weeks. I set up a one stop shop in Gort to co-ordinate relief work. I chaired an interdepartmental committee which met on an ongoing basis to assess the damage and monitor the situation. I brought a detailed report to Cabinet spelling out the extent of the damage caused and the cost of restoration and compensation. I travelled to Brussels and obtained money from the Commission. We made Government money available to provide humanitarian relief for families whose homes had to be evacuated. We put in place also the relocation compensation scheme to enable families who could not return to their damaged or destroyed homes to relocate elsewhere in the vicinity. We brought in the Irish Red Cross Society to administer the scheme and it did a superb job.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">While the local community acknowledges the excellent work done and being done on an ongoing basis by Mayo County Council, from the point of view of restoring infrastructure, there is strong local criticism of what is perceived, rightly or wrongly, as a lack of urgency or action at Government level. People feel they have been left in limbo. They do not know what, if any, Government funding will be forthcoming. They want to know if there will be compensation for agricultural losses. They want to know if those who have returned to their houses which are damaged will be compensated. They want to know if interim payments will be made to assist those who have no incomes because of this catastrophe. They want to know when a final report will be available assessing the full extent of the damage. That is the reason I look forward with eager anticipation to the reply from the Minister of State.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_763">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. On my behalf and on behalf of the Government I express sympathy to everyone affected by the recent landslides in north Mayo, as articulated by the Senator. I have had firsthand reports from a number of people there. It was a traumatic experience for everyone and my heart goes out to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The impact and extent of the damage caused by the landslides has been considered by the Government and I am pleased to announce that the Government has decided to initiate an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme of humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship caused to individual householders by the landslide. The scheme will be administered through the Office of Public Works with aid distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I emphasise that the aim of the scheme is to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship and not to compensate for losses. The criteria for determining eligibility for assistance will be similar to previous humanitarian aid schemes namely, death, serious injury, homelessness, damage to home, loss of income or extreme hardship. My officials in the Office of Public Works will be in touch with the Irish Red Cross Society and Mayo County Council over the next few days with a view to putting the scheme in place with immediate effect. Through the Irish Red Cross Society, I am confident that all applications for aid will be assessed and dealt with speedily, confidentially and sympathetically.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">With regard to the position on the ground, in response to a request from Mayo County Council, the Office of Public Works has provided machinery and personnel to assist the county council in the initial clean-up of mud and debris. The question of repairing damage to infrastructure is a matter for consideration by the local authority in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I reiterate my sympathy and concern for the victims of the landslides in north Mayo and I hope the measures I have announced will help to relieve the hardship experienced by all those affected.</p>

          <p eId="para_768">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and for indicating that <i>ex gratia</i> payments will be made on humanitarian grounds. He stated also that it is not intended that there would be compensation for losses. What exactly does he mean? For example, does he mean that in the case of households or dwelling houses which have been destroyed or damaged there will not be compensation? In the case of Gort, they received 100% compensation. Does he mean that for agricultural losses, which have been considerable, there will be no compensation?</p>

          <p eId="para_769">I have had the unfortunate experience of having to oversee two schemes as a result of severe flooding, the most recent of which was in the Drumcondra and County Meath areas for humanitarian aid.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_287" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_771">That matter has to be decided. The Red Cross Society has been contacted today. It will carry out a preliminary assessment, as a result of which we will have to seek a Vote. Whereas thousands of houses were affected by the previous flooding incidents, the one positive element of this case is that we are talking about approximately 40 houses. The scale of the damage is in our favour.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">In terms of the other situation, I am aware that the geologists' report is being drawn up. I was in discussions today with the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, who is looking into the situation. It will be very much an issue for Mayo County Council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in terms of the major infrastructural response needed there. This is humanitarian aid to relieve hardship which will be administered quickly. I hope that within a matter of weeks money will be on the ground and that, hopefully, whatever other arrangements with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be on hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">The Red Cross Society will evaluate each individual case. It is more likely that people were uninsured. I am sure it will take into account if an individual family has everything insured and the insurance is coming through. Obviously, that will alleviate the hardship. Clearly there will be more hardship and calls for more support in a situation where there is no insurance.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Disabled Drivers and Passengers Tax Concessions.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_776">The last time I raised the issue of the need to reassess the medical criteria under which people are assessed for the disabled drivers' and passengers' tax concessions regulations was on 23 June 1999. The then Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, told me an interdepartmental review was being undertaken which would report shortly. Nearly five years later there is no sign of the review. I could reproduce, word for word, my contribution in the House that night but I will not bore the House by doing so. The appeals board members, some of whom have now resigned, wonder if there will ever be evidence of this review, which is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The medical criteria for these taxes have existed for the past 35 years. The criteria are old-fashioned because they were brought forward when a limb amputation meant one did not get a new good prosthetic limb. Amputees have said to me that they can run in cross-country races and can get tax concessions, but young people they know, who have serious neurological conditions and are trying to take up jobs, cannot get them. There are situations where the parents of children with serious conditions who live in remote areas cannot get tax concessions. I have in mind, in particular, a man from the Minister for Finance's constituency who contacted me in 1998 to ask if I thought there would be any changes in the tax concessions and if he should go ahead and buy the car. I am glad I did not tell him to delay because goodness knows what state the car would be in by now. He has contacted me again to say he should change his 1998 car and asked if I thought there would be any change in the tax concessions soon. I feel so ashamed writing back to people such as him saying nothing has happened. He quoted a letter I wrote to him some years ago in which I said "Be patient, I am sure something is going to happen". He revised this letter by saying "It is two years on, I have been pretty patient. Nothing has happened."</p>
          <p eId="para_778">In the year in which the Special Olympics were held here and we all had such warm feelings about the disabled, it is shameful that the medical criteria have not been updated. It is wrong that people who cannot take public transport are not being given these concessions. The blind who cannot possibly drive a car cannot get any concessions as disabled passengers. I ask the Minister to give me hope that there will be some change. It is important to remember that some of these people, if they got tax concessions regarding being able to drive, could become taxpayers. With the permission of these people, I remember particularly that the appeals board asked me to sit in on some of the cases it was assessing.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I particularly remember one young engineer in his thirties, who was desperate to get back to work, but he had had a stroke and finances were engulfing him. Perhaps he could have paid tax for the last five years if he had been in a position to get these concessions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_780">I will not be delivering the same speech as the Minister delivered in 1996 because, I understand, there have been quite a number of changes since. This scheme, which originated in 1968, provides valuable tax concessions for disabled drivers and disabled passengers. Over time the benefits were extended and the scheme was put on a statutory basis. The scheme is open to persons, drivers and passengers, with disabilities, who have obtained a primary medical certificate. To qualify for a medical certificate, the person must be severely and permanently disabled and meet one or more of a number of specific medical criteria relating to the use of upper and lower limbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Possession of a primary medical certificate entitles a person to benefit from the following reliefs: remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax and a refund of VAT on the purchase of a vehicle; a refund of the VAT on the cost of adaptation of a vehicle, up to a maximum of €9,523 for a disabled driver and €15,872 for a disabled passenger; repayment of excise duty on the motor fuel used in the vehicle for the transport of the disabled person, subject to an annual maximum of 600 gallons, approximately €1,016 per annum at current excise rates; and exemption from the payment of annual road tax to the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Annual ongoing relief also includes the possibility of changing a car every two years. The same tax reliefs are available to organisations for qualifying activities, that is, the transport of those disabled who are covered by the scheme. The cost of the scheme has increased significantly in recent years. It came to approximately €35 million in 2002 compared to just under €6.5 million in 1996. The projected cost of the scheme is €37 million in 2003. It is estimated that some 8,350 people with disabilities are actively participating. The average claim for VRT and VAT relief amounts to approximately €5,250. This is what it is worth, on average, on an annualised basis to an individual beneficiary.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">There are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. These include both persons with medical conditions other than those covered by the scheme and those with medical conditions who are covered. The disabled drivers' and the disabled passengers' scheme carries substantial tax benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The scheme was reviewed by an interdepartmental group chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In addition to representatives from that Department, it had representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The group, which has since reported, examined all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The Senator will appreciate that the report of the review group is complex. As part of it deliberations the group heard oral submissions over a period of five and a half days. In addition, it received over 260 written submissions from interested parties. Many factors have been taken into account by the review group in the formulation of this report. The Minister for Finance is currently considering the issues raised in the context of the objectives to be met and the best use of resources. The issues are difficult and many different and some conflicting viewpoints have to be taken into account. It is envisaged that the report will be published once the deliberative process is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The great interest shown by various groups in seeking access to the scheme is understandable. The benefits are significant on an individual basis. Nevertheless, it is important that we review how the scheme can be operated in a fair, focused and manageable manner within available resources for those whom it can most effectively assist. I trust the House can share in this goal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_787">I do not think the workings of the review group are complex at all. This is a disgrace and I am absolutely horrified. Professor Niamh Brennan complained because she has been waiting since April for the Department of Health and Children to do something about a report she produced. Can the Minister of State imagine how I am going to go back to people who have been waiting for over five years? It is not complex, it is just mean spirited. Only a tiny percentage of people are getting any relief in this area and it is the most mean spirited thing I have seen for a long time. I know of one particularly serious case where the person has been to see the Minister for Finance to try to apprise him of his terrible difficulties. What kind of review is going on for decade after decade while people are in such a dreadful position? This reply makes me even more angry than I was before I came into the House tonight. One feels so ashamed being contacted by people who have such very serious problems and having to tell them – I know the Minister of State did not write this himself – that "the Senator will appreciate that the report of the review group is complex".</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_788">I remind the Senator again that the scheme has increased in cost from €6.5 million to €35 million. Almost 8,500 people have benefited and I am sure they appreciate the substantial relief that is there. The report is almost ready and I am sure it will be made available. Decisions will be taken by the Minister for Finance within the resources available.</p>

          <p eId="para_789">It is a very serious problem for the appeals board because it cannot be seen to be bending the rules, so the medical criteria have got to change.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Castlebar Military Barracks.</heading>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_790">There is another Mayo issue on the agenda tonight, namely the need for the Minister for Defence to give the up to date position regarding plans for the military barracks at Castlebar, County Mayo, and the reason the usage of the barracks appears to be substantially less this year than in previous years. There is concern in the town with regard to future plans and it has been noted that there has been a reduction in the use of the military barracks. This is of particular concern for people who are involved in the Defence Forces or the reserve forces.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_791">I welcome the opportunity to outline on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, the position with regard to Castlebar barracks. The Minister is abroad on official business and regrets that he is not able to be present this evening to deal with this Adjournment matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The main usage of Castlebar barracks in previous years was for the annual summer training camps for members of the Reserve Defence Force. This year, because of health and safety factor, it was not possible to hold the summer camps in Castlebar and the necessary arrangements were made to facilitate personnel at Columb Barracks, Mullingar, where accommodation and training facilities are of the highest standards. Specifically, the electrical wiring within the sleeping accommodation in the Castlebar barracks is in need of upgrading. As safety is of paramount importance, it was decided by the military authorities that the sleeping billets could not be made available for use this summer. Renovations are also necessary to upgrade the kitchen facilities in the barracks to meet health and safety requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">A number of works were carried out at Castlebar in 2002. These included the reroofing of the dining hall at a cost of €37,000 and the upgrading of the dining hall and other areas at a cost of €73,000. These upgrading works include the installation of fire alarms, ceiling repairs, electrical rewiring, heating, fire doors, shower, washrooms and some tarmacadam. In addition, local service contracts to service routine maintenance works were completed at a cost of €84,000, which covered windows, door, gutters and painting and decorating. The Minister for Defence has previously stated that it is not his intention to close any Reserve Defence Force location. He is conscious of the need to preserve and retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards a nationwide geographical spread.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Since his appointment, the Minister for Defence has been totally committed to developing the reserve into a top class organisation. Members of the reserve have already seen the benefits of this process in terms of improved equipment, more training days, enhanced levels of training and better clothing. This year saw an increase of 16% in the level of gratuity payable to personnel who attended annual training. As the current reorganisation process develops, there will be additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve and a better overall organisation structure. There will also be additional benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The question of upgrading the present permanent accommodation and kitchen facilities at Castlebar barracks to ensure compliance with building, health and safety and fire regulations is being carefully examined at present in the Department of Defence from the value for money perspective. No decisions have been made as yet on the matter, but the Minister for Defence has advised me that he will ensure the matter is dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_796">Is the Minister of State aware if finance has been committed for the necessary upgrading works? The Minister of State said that the matter is being examined carefully from a value for money perspective. Is there a commitment that the money will be spent as soon as that investigation has been carried out?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_797">I cannot be specific on that point. Clearly, there has been considerable investment in the barracks already. It would appear to make little sense not to complete the job. I will find out the information and ask the Minister for Defence to pass it on to the Senator.</p>
