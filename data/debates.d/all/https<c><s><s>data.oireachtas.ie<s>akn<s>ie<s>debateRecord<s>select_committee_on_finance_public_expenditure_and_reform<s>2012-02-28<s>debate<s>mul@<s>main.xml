          <from>Vice Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_13">Before welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, I wish to express, on my own behalf and that of members of the Select Sub-Committee on Finance, deepest sympathies to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, on the passing of his wife, Florence.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is substituting for the Minister at this sad time and our thoughts are with the Minister.  The Minister of State is welcome and I thank him for stepping in at such short notice.  I also welcome the departmental officials who will accompany the Minister of State during the select sub-committee's consideration of the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The purpose of this meeting is to consider the Finance Bill 2012.  The Bill was referred to the select sub-committee by Dáil Éireann on 16 February 2012 and the sub-committee is required by the Dáil to report the completion of its considerations of the Bill not later than Friday, 2 March 2012.  The times by which the sub-committee must have completed its considerations of specific groups of sections and the amendments addressed to those sections are determined by an allocation of time order made by the Dáil on 23 February 2012 and this order has been circulated to members.  The order of the Dáil further provides that any division claimed on the proceedings of the Bill must be postponed until immediately before the time set for the relevant guillotine or, if proceedings conclude before the time of the guillotine is reached, on completion of those proceedings.  The putting of any question that is contingent on a postponed division must be similarly postponed.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Before we commence, I remind everyone that mobile telephones must be switched off.  In addition, we will try to get through these amendments as quickly as possible because we have approximately 30 amendments to consider this afternoon.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I move amendment No. 1:<entity refersTo="#bill.2012.5.dail.3.amd_1" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_17">In page 11, before section 2, but in Chapter 1, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_18">2.—The Minister shall within 3 months from the passing of this Act prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on a cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures provided for by this Act, setting out the costs of tax foregone, and the benefits in terms of job creation or otherwise.".</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I am delighted to be involved in the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill and am highly impressed by the array of officials before members.  While I am unsure how much hope members on the Opposition side should have of getting any change through, hopefully the Minister of State will have an open mind on some of their ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Each year, during the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill, whoever is in opposition appears to table this amendment and whoever is in government appears to oppose it.  The purpose of amendment No. 1 essentially is to request the Government to justify the new tax reliefs that are being proposed in the Finance Bill and to justify any expansion of existing reliefs within the Finance Bill, of which a number are included in the Finance Bill 2012.  It is important that we are very clear as to the purpose of such reliefs and that their outcome can be measured in respect of the amount of increased investment within the economy to which they lead and by the number of new jobs that are created.  A number of new tax incentives are proposed in this Finance Bill, including the new capital gains tax incentive for the purchase of property in Ireland and abroad up to the end of 2013.  Fianna Fáil proposed that the Government should consider targeting the enormous amount of activity in the black economy in the construction sector, particularly in respect of small-scale jobs, repairs and maintenance work to private dwellings, of which a great amount is being done under the radar, and we tabled an amendment that has been ruled out of order but which would be relevant to this area as an alternative to the capital gains tax incentive the Government has proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We have some concerns about this capital gains tax incentive.  It is not limited to one transaction per person.  Someone could avail of it on a multiple number of properties in Ireland and abroad.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree the purchase of property abroad by an Irish person will not yield any economic dividend, and that is a concern.  I am also concerned that introducing such a relief could represent an attempt by the Government to put an artificial floor on the property market, which it is attempting to kick-start.  It is an important sector and we all want to witness an increase in construction activity.  However, I am of the view that the property market should be allowed to find its own floor over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">There are other reliefs contained in the Bill which, in our view, the Government should justify by bringing forward a cost-benefit analysis such as that proposed in amendment No. 1.  I am sure we will engage in a more detailed discussion on the new special assignee relief programme, SARP, proposal.  That is one obvious incentive the Government is putting forward to which very strong economic justifications should be attached.  If the purpose is to bring additional inward investment to Ireland to facilitate the creation of further jobs, then why not include the conditions relating to such a scheme in the text of the Bill?  Other reliefs available include the foreign earnings deduction, enhanced research and development tax credits, royalty pooling, renewable energy generation relief, etc.  The central thrust of amendment No. 1 is that it seeks the bringing forward of a cost-benefit analysis such as that to which I refer in order that where tax expenditures are incurred by the Exchequer, there will be clarity regarding the purpose of those expenditures and that their success will be measurable.  That is why we tabled the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I support the amendment.  As Deputy Michael McGrath indicated, similar amendments are regularly put forward by Opposition parties.  I put forward a similar amendment in respect of the previous Finance Bill and it was rejected.  During the year we were able to tease out the actual cost of some of the tax expenditures that exist in the State.  However, we were not able to identify the cost of others because the Department of Finance has not carried out costings in respect of some existing tax expenditures.  Obviously, this is not good in the context of there being transparency regarding the identities of those who are benefiting from the tax expenditures to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I tabled a parliamentary question last week in which I asked the Minister for Finance to provide details on the net cost of each section of the Finance Bill.  I presumed it would be quite easy to provide such details because I am sure it is necessary to ensure that the Bill is costed.  It would be good if we could be provided with a net figure in respect of each section but I accept that some sections may not involve a net cost.  Astonishingly, the Minister was not in a position to furnish the information I requested in my parliamentary question.  He stated that we would go through the figures on an item-by-item basis when this committee dealt with the Bill.  I do not want to be asking the Minister of State what is the net cost of each individual section.  Would it be possible, therefore, to take it as read that I wish to know the net cost to the State of every section of the Bill?  Perhaps the figures in that regard could be furnished to members prior to the second session because if they are not, proceedings will merely be delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Amendment No. 1 refers to the Minister laying before the Dáil a report on a cost-benefit analysis.  In 2009 the Think Tank on Action for Social Change, TASC, estimated that the tax expenditures in question cost the State approximately €7.4 billion.  TASC also put forward the argument that if personal income tax breaks and corporation tax breaks were based on the EU average, these expenditures would only cost €2.2 billion.  This would give rise to a saving of €5.2 billion.  It is important, therefore, that the type of cost-benefit analysis to which the amendment refers should be provided.  When indirect taxation is being increased in respect of the majority of people in the State, we should at least know the cost of the expenditures in question and the number and identities of those who will benefit from them.  Will the Minister of State indicate the number of new tax expenditures that are being introduced in the Bill?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_26">The hallmark of the recent budget - which sets it aside from previous budgets - is its emphasis on the key proposition that income tax should not be increased in order that work would not be taxed.  One of the measures we introduced relates to job creation and is a slight variation on that which is contained in the amendment, which refers to "the benefits in terms of job creation or otherwise".  The Government wanted to ensure that it would not place an unfair burden on those who seek to create jobs.  The hallmark of the budget is the fact that we did not increase income tax.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Brian Hayes)</from>
          <p eId="para_27">I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling the amendment, which rings a few bells in the context of what happened when I was in opposition.  I recall similar amendments being tabled in previous years and I suspect the Deputy will recall the replies that were delivered in respect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I do not propose to accept amendment No. 1 but I fully accept the principle of the need for an <i>ex ante</i> and <i>ex post</i> economic impact assessment, including carrying out a cost-benefit analysis, in formulating and evaluating tax policy.  The major change to existing tax expenditures proposed in the Bill relates to the legacy property reliefs and this was subject to a full economic impact assessment.  The latter was published with the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to costings.  It is not the case that each section has an enormous amount of expenditure associated with it.  Where we have recognised the existence of a major expenditure item, namely, in the context of legacy property reliefs to which I refer, as already stated, a full and substantial assessment has been carried out and published.  I am not sure how realistic it would be to provide full costings in respect of every section.  There are no costs at all in respect of many of the sections.  This is because such sections only involve small changes to or tinkerings with the system.  A commitment was given in respect of carrying out a full assessment of the legacy property reliefs.  That assessment has been concluded and it was published with the Bill.  The economic impact assessment involved a full public consultation in order that the views of all interested parties might be taken into account, the publication of two reports - including an interim consultation report - an economic model and a substantial data analysis exercise.  This was a transparent and comprehensive process which was in line with best international practice for policy evaluation.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">As the committee will be aware, the issue of carrying out cost-benefit analyses in respect of tax expenditures was considered by the Commission on Taxation.  The commission was of the opinion that tax expenditures should be the subject of ongoing evaluation and appropriate and timely cost-benefit analyses.  This is to ensure that they are both economically efficient and that parliamentary oversight can be well informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I am, however, opposing the amendment on a number of grounds.  First, as the experience with the impact assessment demonstrates, three months is insufficient in the context of undertaking the analysis required for the various measures.  The second point is that there is an underlying principle of proportionality in cost-benefit analysis.  In other words, the level of resources invested in carrying out the analysis should be commensurate with the scale of the expenditure involved.  For example, the 2005 capital appraisal guidelines only recommend full cost-benefit analysis in respect of expenditures exceeding €30 million.  In many cases, the figures at issue are well below that level.  While the costs associated with the legacy property reliefs certainly justify a full economic impact assessment, many of the tax expenditures in the Bill are not of sufficient significance in terms of costs to make the completion of such studies cost effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">We will consider these matters, in consultation with the committee, on a case-by-case basis.  On major ticket items such as that under discussion, we are open to doing this.  However, we are of the view that it would be slightly disproportionate to do so across the board and without any understanding of the full costs involved in respect of all of these items.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  As he indicated, the Commission on Taxation indicated that there would be ongoing evaluation with regard to the impact of tax expenditures.  I acknowledge there was a report conducted into the legacy property tax reliefs and the Government accepted recommendations that the process of shutting them down - which was already well under way - would be allowed to take its course and they would not be just ended overnight.  There are very valid concerns and, in particular, I raised the issue of the new property tax incentive being proposed as it relates to capital gains.  It has been indicated that the reliefs proposed are not as significant in terms of cost but the truth is that the cost is open ended, and there is no limit or allocation on the amount that can be drawn down under any of these new tax expenditures.  They will be demand-led so the cost is unknown and open-ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">A door has been opened, particularly with the capital gains tax for property relief, to speculators buying an endless amount of properties in Ireland and abroad, holding them for seven years and avoiding all liability to capital gains tax.  The Government is refusing to accept the need for an evaluation of the effectiveness of that proposal, which is the core point I make, particularly with that relief.  As the process would be open-ended a comment cannot be made on the likely overhead cost because it is simply unknown.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_35">It is disappointing that the standard response from the Government is still applicable, given all the promises that we would do the Finance Bill differently.  The Government has fallen at the first hurdle.  I take the Minister of State's point with regard to a cost-benefit analysis on each section of the Bill but that is not what the amendment speaks to.  I have asked a simple question on each section of the Bill and I cannot see why a table was not provided.  Leaving this to one side, there is the issue of a cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">I will ask again the question I posed at the beginning.  How many new tax expenditures will this Bill create and how many existing tax expenditures does the Bill amend?  The question concerns a cost-benefit analysis.  Given that the Minister of State is refusing to carry out that cost-benefit analysis, would he at least be open to the idea of telling us the cost of those tax expenditures?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_37">In the budget book published on budget day, there was a full assessment of the yield and cost on each of the measures proposed in terms of the estimate we gave.  If we were proposing a tax expenditure item, the amounts would be set out there.  It is a slightly different issue to Deputy McGrath's point but there was a full evaluation of the costs involved with the budget documentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Deputy McGrath has asked a question and the two biggest issues are the special assignee relief programme, SARP, and the foreign earnings deduction.  It is our estimation that the SARP issue will involve a maximum of €5 million per year, which is on the basis of 100 people applying for it.  On the foreign earnings deduction, we understand the expenditure will be approximately €2 million per year.  Both of those would fall under the €30 million threshold.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">It is €2 million.  I was in Europe last week and we deal in billions over there.  The €30 million threshold was a general principle provided in the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Data are collected on a multiannual basis for many of these areas of expenditure and it is really only after a number of years that one can assess the full impact of an item in raising certain amounts.  The difference between tax and expenditure is that we know how much money can be spent but on a tax measure there is never absolute precision because one would not know the full uptake of the amounts involved.  For the information of the committee, with the film relief scheme it is our intention this year to initiate a major economic assessment, given the totality of the expenditure involved.  We will partake in such processes on a case-by-case basis if the moneys are big enough and after a period we can consider issues again to see if a scheme can be altered.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Where the committee specifically believes there should be a major economic assessment of a headed item, I am sure the Minister would be amenable to looking at it.  Perhaps what is required is a greater dialogue between the Minister and the committee, as it is the Government's strong intention that issues like this should be flagged to committees and there should be an immediate reply.  If there are specific issues that have merit, we will consider them on a case-by-case basis.  I cannot accept the amendment because it is open-ended and it does not seem to discriminate between expenditures big and small.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">The Finance Bill introduces many new measures that were not included in the budget.  Will the Minister of State inform us if there are tax expenditures that were not announced in the budget that are being introduced in the Finance Bill?  Should I take it that the Minister of State might be open to an altered amendment on Report Stage that might refine the scope of a cost-benefit analysis?</p>
          <p eId="para_44">For example, in questioning a Minister in the Dáil who was taking the Order of Business - it was Deputy Burton - I was told that the SARP would be measured by the IDA and each individual would have to create 30 jobs.  I presume the Minister at the time was talking through her hat because there is nothing in the Finance Bill which speaks to job creation as part of SARP or that people must create 30 jobs.  How will SARP be measured?  There is an argument that this will cost €5 million, and one might think this is small potatoes but it is not in the real world.  Why should 100 people be able to avail of this tax expenditure when the rest of the country is being told that an additional €100 household charge and septic tank and water charges must be paid, along with a 2% increase in VAT?  People putting clothes on their children have found increases in diesel, petrol and home heating oil but the SARP individual would receive a tax write-down of €427,000, allowing him or her to fly the family home to America or whatever part of the world that person is from once a year.  There is a tax deduction for sending children to private education at the same time that rural schools are faced with losing teachers, with DEIS rural schools having legacy posts withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Outside of the economic argument being given that it may be too costly to carry out a cost-benefit analysis, there is a bigger question in that such analysis should be about more than just money.  There should be an examination of the social consequences of a Government introducing expenditures for a cohort of people at the top of their earnings capacity while asking the rest of the public to pay for those expenditures.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I will answer Deputy Doherty's question directly of whether there is substantial change in the Finance Bill compared with the statement by the Minister in December.  The answer is "No."  Any of the changes announced in the Finance Bill were alterations of proposals set out originally by the Minister.  There is no major new expenditure item.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The Deputy asked if a more specific Report Stage amendment with regard to scope of the assessment would be accepted but that is a matter for the House to decide.  I do not know if I would be replying to the amendment on that day so I could say to bring it forward by all means.  I suspect the boss might be back on that occasion.  As a general rule we are not against this in principle and where there is merit, it is useful.  In regard to the amendment under consideration, we take the view it would not be beneficial to do this for every headed item.  The Deputy referred to sections 9 and 10 in particular, which we will discuss.  There are other sections in this Bill which paint a very fair picture for people, in the circumstance where there is no money in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The next section will deal with taking out the universal social charge for more than 300,000 people, in a very progressive and substantial amendment which the Government is pleased to bring to the committee's attention.  We can discuss that later but I cannot accept Deputy McGrath's amendment No. 1.  However, if he recasts it I am sure the Minister for Finance will look at it.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_53">section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_54">2.—The Minister shall within six months from the passing of this Act prepare and lay before Dail Eireann a report detailing the financial impact of all measures contained in this Act on the general population by income group broken down by decile including all categories of earners including PAYE, self-employed and social welfare recipients and by household income type broken down by decile based on gross household income.".</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The standard reply from the Government is it will accept this amendment, at least for one year.  There is a precedent in that the Government accepted an amendment at the time from the Minister for Social Protection, which I believe is word for word the amendment I propose here, so I advise the Minister of State not to disgruntle the Minister, given it is her amendment.  At the time it was supported by Fianna Fáil, perhaps because there was nobody in the Chamber or for some other such reason.  It slipped through.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I ask the Minister of State to consider this amendment which asks for a report detailing the financial impact of all measures contained in the Act on the general population, based on income group, broken down by decile, for all categories of earners, including those on PAYE, the self-employed, social welfare recipients, and by household income type, broken down by the decile, based on the gross household income.  If we are to do our job differently in terms of how we deal with financial legislation, beyond what is contained in this Finance Bill, we must have a different approach.  The Opposition needs information which is held by the Department.  It is important that we look at the impact of the measures we are introducing, have a chance to evaluate them properly and thoroughly and then, if need be, seek to amend them.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">I raised this issue before and do so again.  It is appalling - I use the word carefully - that the members of the finance committee have not yet had a briefing on the substance of the Finance Bill, bar the briefing provided today which was on the proposed amendments only.  In spite of repeated requests from my office and perhaps others, since the publication of the Bill officials in the Department have not been available to meet with Opposition spokespersons to discuss sections of this Bill.  It makes a mockery of political reform to ask committee members who do not have a financial background to argue and articulate in the best way we can without the benefit of information that is held within the Department or without an understanding of the rationale behind the introduction of these measures.  It is just not on.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">This amendment seeks to build on that.  If we are to have proper information and disclosure we need to look at the potential impacts of the budgetary proposals.  We already know that different groups are looking and assessing budget 2012.  For example, there is the ESRI study which, in its consideration of the impact of budget 2012, states it is clear that the greatest reduction in income is for those with the lowest income.  It continues by-----</p>

The poorest 40% therefore will take four times the hit the top 30% will, according to the ESRI.  We have not had the opportunity to discuss this with officials from the Department of Finance to find out if they dispute these claims.  There is a need to look at and assess the impact these budgetary measures are having on the basis of the different deciles.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">In section 2 I welcome that there has been a change to the universal social charge, in that a large group of people have been taken out of that category.  If previous Governments were able to show within three months of implementing budgetary measures their effects on the different categories we might have been able to form a more reasoned opinion, or to have convinced the Minister at the time there was a need to do this.  The money which would have been saved by taking so many people out of the USC is small enough in proportion to the actual amount of money being taken in but the social consequences would have been much greater.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">This has been done before and is therefore possible.  The Department produced a report on this in 2010 or 2011.  There is a precedent.  In the spirit of trying to change the way we do business I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I support Deputy Doherty's amendment.  A more meaningful measure, however, would be to show the impact of all the budgetary measures on the different categories of people, as outlined by the Deputy.  The Finance Bill accounts only for a portion of the measures that affect them.  The household charge is not mentioned, for example, nor are the various welfare changes, and the increases in a whole raft of Government charges would not be included in such an assessment.  A more meaningful and helpful portrayal would be to show the impact of the entire budget package on each of these categories of people by income group.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_66">Yes.  Much of this has already been done by the ESRI.  There are now two Departments where previously there was one and the smaller is the actual Department of Finance, compared with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If one were to do this work on a regular basis it would tie up an inordinate amount of time for officials who, in any event, are preparing the budget and the assessments regarding the decisions that must be taken.  One must ask whether this would be an appropriate way of acting when we already have another vehicle in place such as the ESRI, to which Deputy Doherty referred.  It is amazing how two different people, reading the same report, can come to two different conclusions.  It always happens in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">I saw a headline last week following the publication of the report and had a chance to read the piece last weekend.  I will read from what Mr. Callaghan, the senior ESRI research officer who wrote the report, stated.  Speaking of budgets from 2009 to the present, he wrote: "The net effect over the whole period is strongly progressive, rising in line with incomes and is among the most progressive in six EU countries examined in a recent study".  He refers to the fact, which is stood over by the ESRI, that when one looks at the different income groups or cohorts, the biggest reduction is found in the incomes of the top 10% of earners, those who have more than €3,000 spending per month.  These incomes have fallen by 13% in real value, or spending power, since 2009.  Meanwhile the bottom 10% of earners, with disposable income of less than €900 per month, suffered a 5% drop in real terms.   The net effect is that it is the view of the ESRI as a result of the most recent assessment, which is better than anything that could come from the Department of Finance and which is totally independent of it, that this and recent budgets have been progressive in the sense that those at the top have paid more than those at the bottom.  The six countries involved were Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Estonia.  The adjustment made by Ireland is substantially greater than that in the other countries analysed.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The second point is that the distributive impact of the policy changes in Ireland is among the most progressive.  The position on taxation is totally different from what it was some years ago because of the collapse and the overall effect of this change in the independent view of the ESRI is that these measures collectively have been progressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The Deputy has asked who is doing the work for us.  An agency is producing reputable work which can feed into our deliberations either at this committee or throughout the year.  It is not a good use of taxpayer's money to replicate something being done and, for that reason, I do not accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">My amendment refers to the 2012 budget.  I do not dispute what the Minister of State read from the ESRI report, but what I referred to in it deals with this year's budget and this legislation.  Does he agree with the ESRI's assessment in this regard, given that he has stated it is the independent expert?  The report states it is clear that the greatest reduction in income is for those on the lowest incomes, a fall of between 2% and 2.5% for the poorest 40% of households.  This compares with a fall of close to 1% for the fifth to seventh deciles and approximately 0.7% for the top 30% of households.  That is the ESRI's assessment of budget 2012.  We do not have the budgets of 2009 to 2011 in front of us; we are dealing with this year's budget.  Does the Minister of State accept that the institute states the poorest 40% of households in the State are four times worse off than the top 30%?  Does he agree with this assessment?</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_73">No, I do not agree with it because the focus of the Government's decisions on the budget was on trying to keep the 1.8 million in employment working.  The Government's considered view is that the way to reboot the economy fundamentally is to keep them at work and not increase the tax burden on them.  The budgetary decisions are not only about keeping these 1.8 million people at work but also about trying to bring forward other measures for which there is little money available to create more jobs in the economy.  The real inequality in Ireland lies in the difference between those who can find a job and those who cannot.  That is the fundamental equality test in terms of whether people have access to a good life and the opportunity that goes with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I do not dispute that that is the Government's view and that that is what the budget is based on, but whether I agree with it is a separate issue.  However, that is not the one we are discussing.  The ESRI has stated boldly and bluntly in its report which the Minister of State claims has been compiled by independent experts with no axes to grind that the Government's budget has reduced the income of the poorest 40% of households in the State by 2.5% compared with a reduction of 0.7% for the richest 30%.  That the Minister of State is disputing the ESRI's assessment is precisely the reason the amendment should be made.  Initially, he argued that the ESRI was in place to do this work and asked why should the Government replicate the work being done.  The reason we have to replicate its work is that the Government does not agree with its assessment and, because it does not, the Department has to do the work.  Does the Department dispute the assessment that the budgetary measures reduced the income of the poorest 40% of households by four times the amount for the top 30%?</p>

          <p eId="para_75">The Deputy referred to the impact of the VAT reduction.  I am aware of what the ESRI stated, but it is only one of a number of issues that dictate whether people are well off or whether they have suffered disproportionately in comparison with other cohorts within the population.  Our view is that as a means of keeping direct tax on income down, we have decided this year to increase indirect taxation.  That is what the Minister said.  We made that decision and it was crucially important not to reduce basic social welfare rates and not to increase direct tax on work.  That was the policy decision the Government took.  We are conscious, however, of what the ESRI and others say.  These reports continue to be part and parcel of our deliberations, but we stand over the decision we took in the budget.  I do not suggest the Deputy disagrees, but we think the best way to keep people in work in the current circumstances when there is little money around is to make sure we do not increase income tax.  The only way to do this and make the numbers stack up is to increase indirect taxes such as VAT.</p>

Does he accept the ESRI's finding regarding the budget?  If not, there is a need for the Government to carry out its own assessment of these deciles.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_77">The Minister of State would strengthen his own argument if he were to accept the ESRI's analysis of the budget on a stand-alone basis because the context he used was the impact of the adjustments made since 2008, which has been highly progressive.  However, the ESRI conducted a stand-alone analysis of the budget and its clear conclusion was that its impact was regressive because it impacted most on on low and middle income households.  The Minister of State should accept this.  The ESRI's other conclusion is also recognised, that if one examines the entirety of the adjustment process, it has been highly progressive.  The Minister of State cannot say, on the one hand, that there is no need for Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment because the ESRI is doing the work and, on the other, that the Government does not agree with its conclusions.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">It is not just that report; there are a number of others.  If that were the case, one could equally quote from a number of OECD reports on the taxation system and its view, based on the model it has established, that our system is highly progressive, given the adjustments made.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The VAT change was the least harmful way of balancing the books this year and making sure we did not deliberately affect economic recovery, difficult and all as that would be to achieve.  That was the assessment we made at the time.  If other agencies, independent of the Government, come to another view, that is their right, but the Government must make decisions.  The decision we took, which the Deputies accepted, was related to the need to maintain employment.  One cannot do otherwise.  Equally, one could make the case that if there was to be a change to direct tax on income, it could have a harmful effect on employment opportunities.  We take all these issues as they arise in the round, but more than one agency is involved.  The Deputy raised the issue of the ESRI initially and I replied, but a number of agencies are involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">I acknowledge the position the Minister of State is in.  However, the ESRI has stated clearly that the budget is regressive and that the impact will be four times greater on the poorest 40% of households in the State than on the richest 30%.  The Minister of State does not want to say publicly that he accepts that this is the consequence of the budget.  The Government has taken decisions because it believes in X, Y and Z, but the consequences are in black and white.  Whether we agree with increasing VAT or not taxing work is a different issue.  The issues we are trying to establish are the effects of those policy decisions.  What will be the effect when we decide to opt for VAT increases instead of wealth tax increases, for example?  That is what the ESRI has calculated.  The Minister of State is saying now that the report from the OECD and other reports will give us a calculation for this year, but my amendment is the reason the Department of Finance should carry out that work.  The Minister of State said that to carry out that type of an estimate would tie up many staff and involve a great deal of time-----</p>

That a Minister or a Government would sign off on measures without knowing the impact they will have on the poorest in society compared with the impact on the richest in society shows that this is a Government that is more interested in the pounds and pence and is forgetting about the social consequences.  Is the Minister of State telling me the Department has not carried out any assessment of the impact of these measures on the different deciles or would that have to be done from scratch?  I would imagine that any Government worth its salt has already ensured there was evidence and data to show the impact of that, and we are asking the Minister of State to publish that in a comprehensive way.</p>

It would be silly for any Government to replicate that.  I appreciate that the Deputy's comments about the ESRI relate to this budget and in particular to the VAT changes, and that will feed into our ongoing analysis in terms of where the economy is and as we frame the budget for next year, but he cannot focus on one aspect of one budget when our rationale in making the decisions we made on income tax was based on a clear view as to where the economy should be.  All of these things will be taken in the round but it would not be an effective use of the public sector resources, particularly in terms of the limited resources we have currently, to replicate all of that throughout the year.

Regarding the VAT increase which amounts to approximately two thirds of the additional taxation that will be brought in by the State, has the Department carried out the assessment I have mentioned?  Has it examined the financial impact of the VAT increase on the general population by income group, broken down by decile?  If the Minister of State is saying that will take days upon days and nights upon nights and tie up many officials, I can see the logic in that.  While I appreciate the Department of Finance has a huge job of work to do outside of this issue, I would be astounded to learn it has not already carried out an assessment in regard to increasing VAT by 2% and the impact of that on the population broken down by decile.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">This amendment relates to the universal social charge.  I support this subsection which would take in the region of 300,000 people out of the universal social charge net.  It was one of the measures that bore down heavily on low income earners.  There was no justification for bringing people who earned such a small amount of money into the tax net, and the impact was felt harshly by many people.  I welcome the move.  It is an issue we raised on numerous occasions along with a motion in the Dáil and I am glad the Government has agreed to remove a certain number of those who were outside the tax net from the universal social charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">My amendment seeks to increase the threshold.  The measure being brought forward in this Finance Bill is that those earning under €10,036 would no longer be subject to the universal social charge.  My amendment proposes increasing that to €17,000.  I chose the figure of €17,000 because those who are paid the minimum wage should be exempt from the universal social charge.  The Minister of State will note that in our pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin examined the reconfiguration of the tax system in terms of abolishing the USC but reintroducing the income levy and the health levy and examining the different rates and exemptions.  That is all in our pre-budget submission, and that would be our favoured option, but as a minimum step we should be looking to increasing the threshold to €17,000.  The Minister of State might put the counter-argument as to the reason he believes that people earning under the minimum wage should pay the universal social charge.  The threshold remains very small at approximately €198 per week.  Why has he not gone to the minimum wage level?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_45" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_97">I thank Deputy Doherty for his amendment No. 8.  It is an attempt to amend section 2, which contains miscellaneous provisions regarding the universal social charge, by proposing that the exemption threshold for the universal social charge be increased from €10,036 to €17,000.  The Bill already provides for an increase in the exemption threshold from €4,004 to €10,036.  This measure will cost in the region of €47 million in a full year and will remove almost 330,000 people from the USC.  While that is a significant cost, I do not expect it to result in a reduced yield for the Exchequer because of the switch on a cumulative basis of deduction and payment by the Revenue Commissioners from 1 January 2012.  That will save a similar amount by avoiding the occurrence of underpayments of the universal social charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The cost of Deputy Doherty's amendment, if it were to be implemented, would be in the region of an additional €117 million for a full tax year and would remove an additional 273,000 people from the charge.  He asked me to put the counter-argument to his proposal.  It is a further narrowing of the tax base in a circumstance where we have a substantial deficit and the question must be posed whether that is wise when we must increase taxation and reduce expenditure.  This is a significant net cost, particularly in the context of the current budget balance.  Moreover, a figure of €17,000 would bring the exemption threshold for the universal social charge above the current entry point to income tax of €16,500.  This would seriously undermine the rationale for the introduction of the universal social charge, which was to broaden the tax base from its narrow, unsustainable level, where a relatively small proportion of income earners were responsible for a disproportionate amount of the overall income tax yield, and to ensure most people would make some contribution, however small, to the provision of services and towards assisting the correction of the public finances.  The removal of an additional 273,000 people - our estimate - from the charge would effectively reverse the base broadening already achieved.  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Clearly, we would like to make further progress on this issue.  The change the Minister announced on budget day was something we had highlighted in our pre-budget submission when we were in opposition.  It was also part and parcel of the programme for Government.  Of course, we would like to do more in circumstances where the tax base is under extraordinary pressure.  Therefore, the matter will have to be reviewed in due course.  However, with regard to the Deputy's amendment, we do not have another €117 million in a full tax year to remove over 273,000 taxpayers.  I wish we did but we do not.  Also, if one examines the totality of the tax yield, the top 1% of taxpayers pay approximately 20% of the total yield.  Even if one considers those earning €50,000 per annum or less, the great majority of taxpayers, this cohort pays approximately 19% of the total yield.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">We have two problems.  We obviously must increase taxation and do so in the least harmful way to employment.  Equally, however, we must do so in a way that is equitable, fair and broadens the tax base.  A total of 38% are not making a contribution or paying any tax; they are paying other taxes, of course, but they are not paying income tax.  That percentage has reduced from the previous level of 45%.  Obviously, the 38% comprises those on the smallest incomes and it is only right that they, in so far as possible, would not be affected by tax.  However, to do as the Deputy asks would cost us a further amount that we simply do not have.  We would like to move in that direction, but we must see what happens.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_46">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_101">I am glad the Minister of State acknowledged that the 38% pay tax.  He started by saying this was about asking people to make a contribution towards the provision of services.  Individuals earning €200 a week will, as a result of the measures introduced in the past and the fact that the Minister is not changing the threshold, pay the universal social charge.  These individuals are paying a larger proportion of their disposable income in tax than other percentages at the higher end of the scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">We can throw around figures and there is always a set that will counter an argument and support one's own.  The Minister of State says this is fair and that they need to pay tax and so forth, but some of the people concerned simply cannot afford to pay additional tax.  This is not the only tax they are paying.  New charges have been imposed on them.  The VAT increase, for example, will affect them disproportionately because of their disposable income.  The reason the top 10% pay more tax is that they have larger disposable incomes.  They have a larger income because they hoard more of the wealth.  It is a sad fact in this state that 38% are earning so little they are outside the tax bracket which will be set at €10,036 after the enactment of the Bill.  The Minister talks about fairness in terms of tax and work, but what about those who are not working, given the new raft of taxes introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_103">It is very simple to say the Government cannot find €117 million.  This might be an ideological argument, but I have offered suggestions on behalf of Sinn Féin about where we could save millions of euro and bring the individuals in question out of the tax net.  One of them is halving mortgage interest relief for landlords which would save €400 million, that is, three times the amount that would be required to remove 273,000 people earning the minimum wage from the tax net.  This is about fairness.  It is fine to say the Government will look at this issue again and would like to do more, but we have choices in terms of the impact of taxation measures.  I agree the State needs to bring in more tax revenue, but I disagree that those earning less than the minimum wage should pay this €117 million in tax.  There are other ways of getting the money at the higher end of the scale from those who have the ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">I genuinely welcome the fact, because it could have been a great deal worse, that the Government has moved to remove approximately 300,000 people from the tax net.  The logic for this is that their incomes are so low that they should not be paying the universal social charge.  However, those earning less than €16,500 per annum should also be exempt from the universal social charge.  They are already paying taxes which have a disproportionately heavier impact on them.  They are earning very small incomes and it is not right that the State should levy direct taxes on those earning as little as €200 a week.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_112">The essential point is that the entry rate for paying income tax is €16,500.  The equivalent rate in the United Kingdom is approximately £9,000.  We have a very high entry rate for those levied at the basic 20% rate.  That is not sustainable in circumstances where the country has a deficit of €15 billion to €16 billion, which we all acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Which experts does one believe, those in the ESRI or the OECD?  The OECD has examined this issue across the broad range of taxation systems, particularly in Europe.  In the context of whether a system is progressive, most European countries have a progressive rating of between 120 and 130.  Ireland's rating was 178 in 2011.  I suspect, however, that it was not always that way; in the alleged good times we were not that progressive.  In more recent years, however, that has changed because more tax is being taken in owing to the increases in taxes across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">We have a very high entry point and one simply cannot balance the ultimate taxation position unless one widens the tax base.  However, I wish to give some very interesting information.  Those persons whose gross earnings are €200,000 or more represent 1% of income earners who pay 20% of the total amount paid in tax.  Those persons earning €150,000 or more comprise 2% of the total number of income earners and pay 27% of the total amount paid in tax.  The 5% of the population who earn €100,000 or more account for 44% of all tax paid.  As one moves down the income levels that percentage diminishes.  As I said, the 77% of taxpayers who earn €50,000 or less, the great majority of taxpayers, account for just under 20%, or one fifth, of the tax take.  Deputy Pearse Doherty will say, rightly, that is the way it should be and that is the way it is - those who have more pay more.  The problem is that the great majority are paying at the lower rate and, as a consequence, if we are to try to do something significant in terms of the overall increase in tax revenue, we have to broaden the tax base.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">I appreciate that the Deputy recognises that we have made some progress this year in terms of the universal social charge.  Those who will be affected most are in temporary or seasonal work who are taking home buttons.  It is only right and proper that they be removed from the USC net.  Recently when I asked how much was taken in by way of the universal social charge, I was told it was about €4 billion a year.  That is a big chunk of money.  If we were to break it up and do things differently, we would have to find other options to raise that €4 billion.  Is it better to raise the money by this big measure, the universal social charge, or by a variety of other measures?  We will always have to get in the money if we are to balance the books and widen the tax base.  Would we like to do more on this issue?  Yes, we would.  Will it depend on what is happening in the economy?  Yes, it will.  Removing from the USC net that group of people who are on very small incomes and for whom a few euro one way or the other makes a huge difference is a progressive measure.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_139">"(a) notwithstanding subsection (1) and the Table to this section, the individual shall be charged to universal social charge for the tax year in which the income tax is charged on the full amount so charged to income tax at the rate of 4 per cent, and".</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are to section 2 which contains miscellaneous provisions relating to the universal social charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Amendment No. 10 relates to section 17 which deals with certain taxation provisions concerning retirement benefits.  It includes provisions to allow individuals in public sector pension schemes an option to encash some or all of any private sector pension savings they may have and, effectively, repay the tax relief provided on those savings so as to ensure the limit on the maximum pension fund allowed at retirement for tax purposes is not exceeded.  This is known as either the standard fund threshold, which  stands at €2.3 million, or the personal fund threshold, as appropriate.  The purpose of the provision is to give affected individuals in public sector pension schemes some of the flexibility available in the private sector to avoid breaching the maximum pension fund limit.  The exercise of this encashment option will attract tax at the point of encashment on the full value of the pension rights at a ring-fenced rate of 41%, plus USC.  This will broadly neutralise the tax relief such individuals availed of when building up their private pension funds.  The amendment will apply the universal social charge at a flat rate of 4% on the full encashment value of the pension rights where the option is taken and, together with income tax at the current higher rate of 41%, will represent a ring-fenced charge of 45% on such encashments.  It may be noted that the nominal higher rate of income tax which would have applied to relieve many of the contributions to pension savings from tax has averaged about 45% in the past 20 years or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Other amendments have been tabled to section 17.  I will address the provisions of the section in a more detailed way when we discuss those amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">This links to my previous argument about bringing persons under the minimum wage out of the universal social charge, USC.  If we are devising a scheme to reduce the universal service charge by 3% on a group within the legal profession who will have pensions in excess of €115,000 and for a number of senior politicians, it is seriously flawed and it is an approach that should not be supported.  Forgetting about the rights and whether we would agree to allow them to encash their private pensions so that they would not exceed the personal threshold limit of €2.3 million, it is wrong on the basis that if we allow them to do that, we are reducing their tax liability by 3%.  One can argue that when they paid into the pension, the USC did not exist, but the effect of the measure the Minister of State is introducing today will allow public sector workers with pensions in excess of €115,000, of whom there are a few in the State and who fall only within probably two categories of individuals, to avail of a reduced universal social charge.  This is in the context of the Minister of State refusing to bring people under the minimum wage out of the universal social charge net.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">It is not a measure to reduce tax on public sector employees.  The purpose is to bring a level playing field for those who had a private sector pension and who came into the public sector.  I am not sure whether we have the numbers involved but I will see whether I can get Deputy Doherty that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">The difficulty here, as the Deputy well knows, is that when the previous Government reduced the total pot involved from €5 million to €2.3 million, suddenly a group of persons who had come into public sector employment who previously had built up very substantial private sector contributions would obviously face an encashment value.  This is being introduced to create a level playing pitch where otherwise they would have to find possibly up to €900,000 to give back when they leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">As far as we are concerned, given the totality of it is close to 45% anyway and that was there previously, the difference is not significant and it creates that fairness for those who had come in on one scheme and then found, as a result of the radical reduction in the amounts involved, that they would have had to face this enormous additional cost.  That is the issue.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_155">The Minister of State is now starting to deal with section 17, which is about the encashment option and the fact that the changes in the previous Finance Bill, which reduce the threshold from €5 million to €2.3 million, resulted in some persons having to use their entire lump sum to pay their tax liability because their pension was above €2.3 million, and the difficulties such persons face as a result.  Under section 17, the Minister of State has provided a range of options for persons who would find themselves in that position, whether they are private sector employees, public sector employees or those with public and private pensions.  That is to one side.  If section 17 were implemented in full, those who have pensions above €2.3 million would have a range of options to ensure that their lump sum would not be used up for tax purposes.  For example, one measure is that a maximum of 50% can be used for tax purposes.  That gets around the Minister of State's argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">This amendment concerns one cohort of persons who are able to encash their pensions, namely, public sector workers with a pension the value of which is in excess of €2.3 million, which means the public sector pension the State will pay them on retirement is in excess of €115,000.  It is a very small number of persons, an elite at the top end.  The Minister of State is saying the reason we are allowing them the option to encash their private pension is in order that they do not exceed the threshold which would oblige them to pay the excess, and if they choose that option, he will reduce their USC liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Allowing them to encash their private pension is one argument which we will have when we come to section 17, but the point is, if the Minister of State allows them to encash their private pension in order that they do not exceed €2.3 million, he is proposing that the committee accepts that we reduce their tax liability.  Their tax liability, if they encash their private pension, is 48% at present.  It is 41% of tax plus 7% USC, and the Minister of State is suggesting we reduce their tax liability by 3%.</p>

It is not as if they are giving the State something back.  We gave them the 41% in the first place through a tax relief.  They must pay the tax relief back and at present they also must pay a 7% universal social charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The Minister of State is saying that we will reduce their tax bill by 3%, after which their income is treated normally for tax purposes and they must pay tax on top of that again.  It is unbelievable for these groups of persons, who are the most highly paid politicians in the land and the most highly paid persons within the legal profession, that the Minister of State proposes to decrease their tax liability at a time when he refused my amendment to bring persons under the minimum wage out of the USC net.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">As we all know, when one pays into a pension fund, one gets tax relief on the contribution one makes as an employee.  In effect, it is a deferral of tax because when one draws down the pension, one is subject to the tax regime.  The Minister of State appears to be saying that because the tax relief was applied at a certain rate, when the income is drawn down the person should only be charged at the same rate.  The net effect of what he proposes appears to be a preferential USC regime for certain very high income persons.  There is an inherent question of fairness here.  Why is that income not subject to the same USC regime to which every other income earner is subject?</p>

          <p eId="para_166">The issue of fairness applies here.  When they were making their contribution, they were making it at a different rate.  Now that this change has occurred, they are already paying tax at the top rate and on the full amount.  All we are doing is taking back what effectively was the full impact of that at the time.  That is the question.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">If a person comes into one system and there is one set of rules, and then he or she finds that the rules are changed which will lead to this abnormal tax liability on one side, the argument is that there should be some fairness in terms of the person's exposure, and that is the point we are making in the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">I repeat what I said.  Effectively, we are talking about people who came into the public sector at certain levels, and who had already built up quite a substantial private sector pension contribution over time.  At the point of retirement, as I understand it, we get 45% of that back.  Effectively, that is the tax relief forgone coming back into the system as a result of the changes we are proposing.  The question the Deputy is asking is whether they should pay more in that circumstance.  The point of rebuttal is that, given the changes that have occurred, there comes a point where it could be argued that if this change were not introduced, there would be a difficulty getting people who have built up such contributions to come into the public sector at that level.  It is a question of whether this would be more disadvantageous to the public sector with regard to access to such people.  That is the logical argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">These people find themselves in this position because of the change in the rules and also in the circumstance that the thresholds have been utterly diminished.

Will he state clearly, so there is no confusion, that what happens at present, with section 47 gone through, is that they pay 48%?  In other words, there is currently a charge of 48% and the Minister of State is proposing to reduce that charge to 45% through this amendment.</p>

The reduction from €5 million to €2.3 million had an unintended consequence, which was basically that it reduced the level in terms of the excess and, therefore, people had to use their entire lump sum to pay their tax liability and some had to pay more than their lump sum.  That was the unintended consequence.  The 7% USC is not an unintended consequence and is completely separate.  This is a decision that has been taken outside of the fact the Government has now dealt with that unintended consequence to reduce their tax liability.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">In light of the discussion we have just had, the provisions of this section seem somewhat harsh.  We are opposed to the removal of the tax exemption which applies to the first 36 days of illness benefit and occupational injury benefit, as proposed in the section.  The Minister gave an outline in the Dáil Chamber of the rationale for this proposal, namely, that in certain circumstances where a person is on sick leave and continues to be paid by his or her employer, the tax exemption means he or she is better off out of work.  That may well be the case in certain instances, but the reality is that most employees are not paid by their employer when they are sick and that illness benefit may well be their only income during the course of their illness.  When one contrasts this proposal with the special assignee relief programme, SARP, proposal, for example, whereby high earners coming to the country can save more than €50,000 per annum in income tax, it seems deeply unfair.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's justification for the proposal.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_137" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_220">Illness benefit and occupational injury benefit are taxable by virtue of section 126 of the 1997 Act.  However, the first 36 days, that is, the first six weeks of the payment in a tax year, are disregarded for tax purposes.  Under certain employer and employee arrangements, an employee may remain on full salary while on sick leave.  However, such an employee may at the same time also be in receipt of illness benefit or occupational injury benefit from the Department of Social Protection.  In some instances, the receipt of full salary from the employer is conditional on the employee paying his or her illness benefit from the Department of Social Protection to the employer.  Where an employee continues to be paid in full by his or her employer while on sick leave while at the same time being in receipt of illness benefit or occupational injury benefit, such an employee is generally better off while on sick leave than when working, even where he or she hands over the illness benefit to the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">This situation may reward the taking of illness leave and, in addition, has the capacity to increase expenditure on social welfare payments over and above what it should be.  The section seeks to remove the tax exemption that applies to the first six weeks of illness benefit.  The yield from this proposal is difficult to quantify, but a tentative estimate points to a figure in the order of €13 million in a full year.  To clarify, if the social welfare payment is a person's only income, he or she will not be taxed on it.  Unless the employee has transferred his or her tax credits to a spouse or civil partner or elected to offset them against another source of income, illness benefit will continue to be tax-free by virtue of the tax credits and will not be eligible for the universal social charge.</p>

I accept that in cases in which an employer continues to pay full salary while an employee is on sick leave, the employee may receive a small increase in net pay.  However, there are other social welfare benefits to which the same logic could be applied.  Is the Government considering any such measures to bring these payments into line with what is proposed in this instance?  I am concerned that we are starting on a slippery slope whereby other social welfare payments will be affected.  Maternity benefit stands out as one to which the same logic could certainly be applied.  Will the Minister of State give us an assurance that there is no intention to extend this provision to maternity benefit and other payments?</p>

          <p eId="para_228">As I understand it, there is a certain uniqueness to this payment which was introduced in 1997 and is the only benefit with a 36 day exemption attached.  While all social welfare payments are under review, this case was considered unique.  The saving will amount to some €13 million a year, which is significant.  However, I would not like the Deputy to think this is part of a general demolition of all of the benefit schemes available.  There were particular circumstances in this case where the issue of an increase in net pay arose.  That is why we brought forward the proposal.  It is not to say we are going through every single benefit scheme with a view to knocking it out.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">These amendments relate to section 8 of the Finance Bill which provides a new relief for key employees engaged in research and development activities.  Amendment No. 17 relates to the definition of key employee.  The Bill as initiated provides that for an individual to be a key employee, 75% of the duties of his or her employment must relate to the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems.  The amendment clarifies that to qualify an individual need not be involved in each of the activities referred to, rather 75% or more of the duties of his or her employment may relate to one such activity only.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Amendment No. 18 is a technical amendment to clarify that for an employee to be a key employee, 75% or more of the cost of his or her emoluments must qualify as expenditure on research and development.  The Bill as initiated states that 75% of the costs must qualify.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Amendment No. 19 relates to the manner in which the credit surrendered by the relevant employer is claimed by the key employee.  The provision allows the employee to use the credit in the year following the year in which the company surrendered the credit.  An amendment is needed to ensure that a key employee can claim the credit surrendered to him or her even if he or she is no longer a key employee in the year he or she is claiming the credit or even if the company is not eligible for the R&amp;D tax credit in that year having moved on to do other things.  This is provided the employee remains in the employ of the company surrendering the credit.  The employer must have been a relevant employer in the year for which it surrendered the credit and the employee must have been a key employee in that year.  This amendment allows for the fact that there is a time lapse between the company surrendering the credit and the employee using the surrendered credit.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">There is no cost because the company is already getting the credit.  This provision redesigns how it is claimed.  I recently visited a business in my constituency which outlined to me the way in which it was using the credit.  It was being used in a general way in the business and was not specific to one person.  The objective of this provision is to focus the advantage on the key individual who is the inventor, the person ahead of the posse who has created something different.  My understanding is that previously this credit could have been used in a global way around a business and was not specific to an individual.  As I understand it, the rationale behind this is to focus part of the credit on a key individual within the operation.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">This is a competitive area.  People move around a great deal.  People are important in terms of the viability of a business.  In circumstances now whereby bigger businesses are spending huge sums of money on R&amp;D, it is only right and proper that some of the credit can be focused on the people creating the ideas.  That is the objective of this provision.  There is no extra cost involved because as I understand it the credit is still there.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">I would like to comment on one issue and ask a question on another.  How is research and development defined for the purposes of this tax credit?  It seems to me that it would be possible for people to define all sorts of things as research and development in order to avoid tax.  What safeguards are in place to ensure that this is not just another way for the corporate sector which, in my opinion, already pays ridiculously low taxes, to pay even less tax?  Unless there are clearly defined criteria in regard to what constitutes research and development, this could be used as a tax avoidance measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Just as in the case of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, which we will come to later, this is pretty nauseating given huge numbers of people, who one could just as easily argue deserve incentives, be they in the public or private sector, have had incentives robbed from them in the form of the universal social charge and have had all sorts of cuts, including cuts in income, imposed on them.  Is there not an enormous double standard here?  High-fliers or whizz kids, or however the Minister of State chooses to define them, will be given financial incentives to work harder, but vast numbers of others are having disincentives imposed on them, even though we require them to work just as hard.  In fact, to use the Minister of State's famous slogan, he wants more for less.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">We will come to it.  We have set out in the legislation, in so far as we can, who the employees are.  They are not directors of the relevant employer or associated company, rather they are people who have no material interest in the relevant employer and spend 75% of their time on duties related to the creation of new knowledge products and processes.  It is very much in line with what I understand to be the "Frascati definition" of the European Union of research and development.  This definition has wide European acceptance of what constitutes research and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">If we are to come back as a country, we have to attract high-end jobs in areas in which there are opportunities.  Research and development is perceived to be one of these areas.  One of the key offerings of IDA Ireland in attracting investment is in this area.  What we are proposing is much more focused than the previous Government's policy on research and development which was more generic.  This is focused on the people with ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Deputy has asked how we will know whether somebody is involved in research and development.  I have been reliably informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they engage with scientific experts to examine projects claiming this credit to confirm that they are defined as research and development projects.  This is the area in which we must invest.  The Government will put significant capital funding into research and development in the next few years, as did the previous Administration, because there is an expectation that there will be a significant return for the country in seeking new markets and opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">There will not be any additional cost.  This is redesigning the credit to relate it to specific individuals, as against a business.  While I do not want to say that in the past some of the credit was able to be written off against the CEO of a business - I am not sure if that actually happened - in this case the credit is specific to the individual person with the idea.  That is very positive in an environment in which people can move from one business to the next because of the skills they offer.  They can also move from one country to the next.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">Is it specifically defined as scientific research and development?  A big emphasis has been placed by the Government on financial services.  Are we going to reward people for coming up with ingenious or dastardly financial instruments such as those that helped the economy and the global economy to crash?  Could it be defined as research and development if someone comes up with new variations of hedge funds, derivatives and futures?  That might be seen as a plus for the financial services sector but a minus for the rest of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">While I am absolutely in favour of research and development, it should be applicable across the board.  I do not agree with making a distinction in incentivising one group categorised as being involved in research and development and not incentivising teachers whose contribution to the future development of society is every bit as important as that of those engaged in research and development, nurses or street cleaners.  All of the people concerned are equally as deserving of financial incentives if the Government believes that is what needs to be done to advance society and encourage people to be creative and come up with new ideas.  Why should we single out one narrowly defined group rather than apply it across the board?</p>

I fully understand that if a free-for-all was allowed, this provision would be wide open to abuse, but are there no circumstances in which the person who created the business and may be self-employed can be allowed to benefit from it, if he or she is genuinely driving research and development?</p>

If any excess still remains it may still be carried forward and used to reduce the corporation tax of succeeding accounting periods.

          <p eId="para_301">I was asked whether this relates to the totality of the economy.  As I understand it, it relates to science or technology.  Of course, technology could be the adaptation of software or the creation of a new software scheme to do any of the matters to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred in the IFSC.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I will be straight about this.  It has long been the case that the research and development credit was recognised as a good measure but I think the view has emerged that it needs to be much more focused on those who create the ideas, who are the initiators and who then allow other businesses to go on and succeed, rather than for it to be used for the purposes of the CEO.  I understand there have been examples on the patent royalty exemption scheme where that kind of abuse applied and the Government led by Deputy Michael McGrath's party took the view that we should change that.  All we are doing here is providing for something that has been a legacy issue for quite some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">This is up for review every year.  If there are examples of some abuse of this measure or it is not being focused on what I described as those in white coats, then we can review it in every Finance Bill, as is already the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I think I have a legitimate worry in that we will all be aware that these obscure financial instruments which not many fully understand played a significant role in destabilising the entire global economy.  Somebody sat down and thought, "This is a brilliant idea", and somebody else said, "Yes, this is a great idea.  We can make a lot of money out of it".  However, the macro effect of these great ideas was disastrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I would be quite concerned about a definition of research and development that provided an incentive to persons in an area which, notwithstanding our differences, almost everybody agrees must be more regulated and controlled.  It is a reasonably serious concern to provide an incentive to come up with new and devilish ideas for making more complex or innovative ways of making money on the financial markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The Minister of State did not really answer the question.  I think I know from where he is coming but as it happens I do not agree.  I half-glibbly said it but the more I think about it, the more I think it is true.  To my mind, a street cleaner who is creative in his or her job is contributing potentially as much, if not more, to job creation in this country by contributing to the tourist potential of the country as somebody who is in a white coat and has a degree coming up with whatever it might be - some technological development.  I do not see why the Minister of State distinguishes between one and the other, especially as he cannot quantify what jobs may be created or he states there will not be any real cost-benefit analysis as to what jobs may be created as a result of this kind of incentive.  Arguably, if we had more motivated street cleaners and the streets were cleaner as a result, that would yield as much in terms of tourism jobs as somebody who happens to be wearing a white coat and has a degree.</p>

Section 9(<i>e</i>) states it will apply “on a qualifying loan taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2008”.  Will the Minister of State explain what is meant by the words “taken out”?  Does this mean that a loan sanctioned in December 2008 and not drawn down until January 2009 will qualify?

          <p eId="para_322">While the increase in mortgage interest relief to 30% will come as a reprieve to some who are struggling, it is not focused, as the Minister of State knows.  People who have no problem in meeting their mortgage repayments will benefit from additional relief.  It is a pity this is the direction we are taking.  The measure should be more focused to help those who are struggling.  I know it would be difficult to do this without looking at individual cases.  However, the reality is that some persons who are comfortable and have very large incomes, who purchased their house during the period specified, will be eligible to benefit from the additional relief, even though this should not be the intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I have some questions that follow on from Deputy Michael McGrath's point on the qualifying loans taken out.  The Minister of State referred to the drawdown.  I will make a declaration of interest as this may refer to my own position.  In large sections of rural Ireland people do not actually purchase houses, they build them.  This is the trend and is what I did myself, although I did not physically build the house.  It is the trend to hire different individuals to build the house, although this may not be the case in urban centres for various reasons.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">The drawdown of the loan is very different.  For example, if the Minister of State had purchased his house in 2004, he would have gone to the bank and drawn down the total amount at a given time.  However, when many others and I build a house in rural Ireland, a mortgage is approved for a certain amount and people then bring in the diggers.  That work is inspected and when it is in compliance with the standards laid down, a drawdown is approved.  The next step is to have the builders complete the work to a further level.  The work is again inspected and the second drawdown from the mortgage company happens.  Not to be difficult, but which drawdown are we talking about?</p>

          <p eId="para_339">No, a price would not have been agreed.  It takes a significant period to build a house in rural Ireland, probably one year, possibly longer, depending on how it is being financed, the availability of individuals and so on.  During the period under discussion there was a lot of building activity; therefore, a person could have been waiting for three months for, say, a plasterer to become available.  Everyone involved is an individual contractor.  As such, it is necessary to price a contract taking into account the cost of plastering, plumbing and painting.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">Exactly.  It is not a situation where a person would have employed a contractor, rather he or she would have employed the blocklayer and so on.  While I appreciate the Minister of State's point that the provision will have the same effect on the other side, the reason these dates have been chosen is this was when the market was at its peak; it was the most expensive time to either purchase or build a house.  I, therefore, ask him to consider amending the section to allow for those persons who drew down their mortgages within the period.  He can exclude me because there would be a conflict of interest.  I presume many would be affected.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I reject the Deputy's claim that this provision lacks focus.  It is very focused.  It reflects an absolute commitment my party gave in the run-up to the last general election to focus specifically on the negative equity generation which bought at the worst possible time in terms of the housing market, namely, between 2004 and 2008.  We recognised that people who are in negative equity, albeit making their mortgage repayments, have a right, through the taxation system and specifically through mortgage interest relief, to get something back.  We were very focused in the commitment we gave in this regard before the election.  We were told by others that it would not be done during the lifetime of this Government.  We have delivered on that commitment and are very proud of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Second, the provision is also focused in the sense that it is during the first few years of repaying a mortgage that the interest build-up is the most significant.  In seeking to assist that cohort of people who are stuck in negative equity and stung by the fact that interest payments are higher in the first several years, the provision is very focused.  Third, it is focused in that it directly targets first-time buyers.  We were clear in setting out our intentions in that regard in the context of our pre-election undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I understand the point the Deputy is making in regard to stage payments.  However, our view is that it is first drawdown which triggers the relief.  The Deputy asked whether I will consider an amendment that would broaden the definition.  I am not in a position to do so.  Regardless of the timeframe one chooses, there will always be difficulties in this regard.  In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, he made it patently clear in introducing this provision in the budget that anybody with a drawdown date from 1 January 2004 until the end of December 2008 would be eligible for the relief.  He has been very flexible in the approach he has taken.  I will not give the Deputy false hope that the provision will be extended.</p>

We all know that when one ascribes particular dates to measures such as this, all types of anomalies will be thrown up.  Anybody who received mortgage sanction in the dying days or months of 2008 but was not in a position, for whatever reason, to draw down the loan until January 2009 should be considered eligible for this relief in the spirit of what the Minister is seeking to do.

          <p eId="para_352">My understanding is that registration fees were never eligible for tax relief.  As education spokesman for the Fine Gael Party in the last Dáil, I made clear my personal view on the question of finding new means of funding higher education.  I suspect my position is different from the Deputy's.  The Government is in a situation where we must look at the broader picture in terms of funding higher education.  As the registration charge has an impact across the tax code, any changes in terms of eligibility on one side has a knock-on effect on the other.  Over the years all types of facilities were developed within the tax code in regard to fees, including tax covenants and the like.  My view, which reflects the direction in which we are going, is that in the long term, some form of student contribution or loan system will be required to get us over the current difficulties and lessen the difficulties that exist for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">As I understand it, because the budget increased the student contribution to €2,250, this provision is required in order to increase the disallowed amounts of €2,000 and €1,000 to €2,250 and €1,150, respectively, for 2012 and subsequent years.

Having considered the comments of Government colleagues and Deputy Fleming on Second Stage, I am introducing an amendment to this scheme.  The amendment reduces from ten to four the number of consecutive days which must be spent in any of the relevant states for a trip to qualify towards the overall minimum requirement to spend 60 days in the BRIC countries.  The change will allow shorter business trips to qualify in recognition of the possibility that such trips may be undertaken as part of a broader trade mission which encompasses travel to states other than the BRIC countries.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_261" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_384">I thank Deputy Doherty for tabling these amendments.  The focus behind the provision of this relief is to assist in the development of new markets for Irish exports in the BRIC states.  Deputy Doherty's amendment No. 23 proposes that where an employer is either unable to demonstrate an increase in the volume of trade with the relevant state or where there has been no increase in the volume of such trade, the relief should not be granted to employees who work abroad seeking to generate new business or market share.  Outside of the practical difficulties which the proposed requirement would place on claimants, I am conscious that preparatory and substantive work in the relevant states will not always yield measurable results.  I do not propose to accept the proposed amendments.  I am of the view that it would be wholly unreasonable and impractical to impose such requirements on employees or employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Given that I do not propose to accept amendment No. 23, it would not be possible to provide the detail suggested in a report for Dáil Éireann as proposed in amendment No. 24.  However, information regarding the volume of relief claimed under the section will be available through the usual channels.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Deputy Doherty also raises in amendment No. 24 the issue of how we will measure the impact of the relief, which is a fair point.  I understand that the Central Statistics Office produces regular reports on Irish exports.  These include information regarding the value of exports to individual countries and should indicate over time whether exports to the targeted markets are increasing.  The number and value of claims for the relief will also be used to evaluate the scheme.  The scheme is being introduced in a limited manner in order that it can be monitored.  We have undertaken to look at this over three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The maximum deduction in any tax year for an individual is €35,000.  Let us see how it goes.  One of the shining examples of the Irish economy is the performance of our exporters in the first three quarters of last year, which were up 5.5%.  Given that the world economy is as it is, the key to a return to growth in our economy is export-led growth.  The Deputy and other colleagues will be aware that because we are exporting more than we are importing, we have a balance of payments surplus, which normally highlights that when the international economy turns and sentiment improves, we will be able to recover quicker.  Many of our businesses are much more competitive than they used to be and are exporting well.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I understand that this proposal came from the Irish Exporters Association.  It is important we listen to and engage with the association to determine if this can help.  Some of the countries concerned are not the most hospitable places in the world to which to send people, including those with families.  This measure will assist companies in sending some of their best people into these markets to try to increase market share, thereby increasing employment opportunities in the country.  That is the objective behind this provision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_389">Measurement of whether exports are increasing does not tell us the full story.  It does not tell us whether individuals or companies availing of this relief is resulting in increased exports.  What is required is an assessment by a company or individual to show that there has been an increase in trade.  Amendment No. 23 states "the authorised officer shall request evidence that the period of time for which the relief is claimed resulted in a clear and demonstrable increase in the volume of trade" and "The Minister shall set out by ministerial order the basis" of these requests.  This does not preclude the relief being granted but attempts to focus and channel that relief to ensure it is individuals who are trying to grow the export market for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Minister of State should answer a number of questions in this regard.  What is the implication for the State's tax take and what will be the net cost of this measure?  How many individuals does the Government believe will avail of this relief?  What are the safeguards to prevent, for example, a financial institution with a sister company in South Africa from sending someone there who would then be able to avail of this provision?</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_391">The Deputy asked a question on the cost.  The Government's estimate is €1.5 million per year on the assumption that 100 people claim the full tax relief.  On the question the Deputy asked on the assessment, the Government will know the numbers involved and the number of those who claimed.  In addition, through the CSO the Government will know whether it has made any difference in respect of market share for those particular countries.  It might take until next year, because such data probably are one year in arrears, to realise whether this measure has made any difference this year.  As the individuals must claim back the reliefs, it will not be until next year that we will know.  However, the Government's estimate is that it will cost €1.5 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">Briefly, it is essential that Ireland increases its trade footprint in these countries.  As the Irish Exporters Association has pointed out, not everything is rosy in the export garden either and Ireland is losing market share in many of these countries.  While Fianna Fáil is prepared to support the Government on this issue, controls must be put in place because tax experts are watching these proceedings and await the enactment of this legislation, after which it will be their function to devise mechanisms for clients to reduce their tax liability.  If there are any loopholes or if the aforementioned experts can find a way for their clients to benefit from this measure, they will so do.  Consequently, members must put in place the requisite checks and balances.  The critical test for me is whether it leads to increased trade and exports and more employment creation in Ireland.  Similarly, in respect of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, proposal, to which I hope members get before the guillotine, one must have in place those controls.  One must have a measurable link between the outcomes for which one hopes and the input one is injecting by way of this tax relief.  I believe some of these sections are a little too loose.  Fianna Fáil is prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt for the present as they are short-term measures but they must be measured effectively over that period.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.  There is very little money about the place and in virtually all the proposals set out by the Minister for Finance and which members now are transposing into legislation, there is an element of attempting to provoke the economy and of trying to help business along.  In all of these measures, this review will be put in place.  I believe the Government has stated that a maximum of three years will apply in this regard.  I refer to the scale of the tax preferment, namely, €35,000, which I understand to be worth approximately €14,000 in net terms to an individual.  While this is significant, it is not on the tax lawyer or corporate side of organising a major scam.  I hope these words do not come back to haunt me, as it is always dangerous to say such things.</p>

While it might not be part of a major tax scam, it could be thrown in as part of spending a week over in South Africa, visiting the sights such as Robben Island and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_465">As announced in the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, we are introducing in the Finance Bill significant enhancements to the research and development tax credit scheme as we need to encourage the productive, high value added sectors of the economy to work our way out of the downturn.  Until now, subcontracted research and development costs in respect of payments made to unconnected persons have been eligible for the tax credit to the extent that they do not exceed 10% of the expenditure incurred by the company in question on research and development activities.  In the case of payments made to third level institutions in the European Economic Area for undertaking research and development, the limit was 5%.  These limits had the effect of disproportionately affecting smaller companies which may have a greater need to outsource research and development work than larger multinationals with greater internal resources.  The outsourcing limits for subcontracting research and development costs have been increased to the greater of 5% or 10%, as appropriate, up to €100,000.  This will provide a targeted benefit to SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">However, the proposed amendment which seeks to include a requirement that the company should first attempt to obtain research and development subcontractor partners who are resident in the State would bring the research and development tax credit scheme into conflict with EU state aid rules.  It has been a deliberate policy to avoid EU state aid complications by maintaining the research and development tax credit scheme as a general measure which does not favour one form of domestic company over another or discriminate against companies or universities in other EU member states.  The amendment attempts to ring-fence for the purpose of the scheme that the company would employ an Irish person first.  I am informed that is in conflict with EU state aid rules because they should apply to all member state companies or individuals.  For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

A similar increase has been applied to deposit interest retention tax under section 35.  The amendments to section 27 are being made to address anomalies that have arisen as a result of the difference between the tax rate of 25% on investment income for companies and the rates of exit tax on the investment funds and life assurance products which are 30%, and 33% from 1 January 2012.  The anomalies include the administrative difficulty of having to refund exit tax in certain cases, the anomaly of similar income being taxed at different rates if one type is subject to an exit tax, and the current disincentive to investing in certain products, not least the fact that tax rates encourage investment in foreign life policies over domestic life policies.  The amendments provide that companies with income from such products are liable to tax on that income at the rate of 25%.  This rate already applies in the case of companies receiving deposit interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_527">Section 43 provides a deduction for expenditure incurred on the purchase of EU emissions allowances that may be used in offsetting a company's emission level under the EU emissions trading scheme.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a tax deduction is already available for expenditure incurred in the purchase of emission reduction credits issued under the Kyoto Protocol.  These credits, known as certified emission reductions, CERs, and emission reduction units, ERUs, are generated by emission saving projects undertaken in third countries, subject to a verification process under the Kyoto Protocol.  These credits are traded in the carbon market and can be exchanged for EU allowances for the purposes of meeting a company's compliance obligations under the EU scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">As these credits can be purchased and used by Irish companies to cover part of their emissions in the same way as EU emission allowances are used, it is appropriate to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred for this purpose.  The amendment will also provide that the sale of any purchased credits will be treated as a trading receipt of the trade similar to the sale of purchased EU allowances.  The profits for such sales will attract tax at the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5%.</p>

Group relief for companies is a basic feature of modern tax systems.  It recognises that groups of companies generally comprise a single economic entity and provides a system of relief for trading losses and related matters within the group.  Simply put, the relief may be surrendered to another company of the group, subject to strict criteria being met.  Group relief is important to Ireland's competitiveness and attractiveness as a location for foreign companies.</p>

A recent article in the media - I think it related to Greencore - reported that a company with extensive losses was allowed to extend those losses to a profitable company, resulting in greatly reducing its tax liability.  Are there restrictions on this type of practice?</p>

          <p eId="para_565">For the purposes of clarity, I will read the note into the record.  It might explain the provision better than I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">In recognition of the fact that groups of companies generally comprise a single economic entity, the legislation provides for a system of relief for trading losses and related matters under which the losses of one member of a group, the surrendering company, may be offset against the profits of another member of the group, the claimant company.  Trading losses and other amounts of which relief may be given for corporation tax may be surrendered by a company which is a member of a group of companies.  Relief given to another company in the same group is termed group relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Originally, to be in a group all of the companies had to be Irish resident.  However, this was held to be discriminatory under EU law in a landmark UK case.  To meet the requirements of that case, the Finance Act 1999 extended group relief for trading losses to situations where the parent was EU-EEA resident.  It has been highlighted by the international insurance industry and the EU-EEA that restriction is a negative factor when non-EU-EEA companies and multinational groups are exploring the possibility of setting up Irish re-insurance operations.  The issue has been also raised less formally by other industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">In addition, a recent UK High Court case has found that the non-discrimination article in treaties permits a group relief claim where two resident UK companies are subsidiaries of a company resident in a treaty country.  This means the current Irish rules are open to challenge.  In anticipation of that ruling, the UK changed its law on this point in 2000.  In light of the industry representations and the recent UK case law, the new provision being introduced in section 46 allows into the group subsidiaries of companies resident in tax treaty countries or listed on a recognised stock exchange.  This means that losses can now be transferred between two Irish-resident companies, where those companies are part of the 75% group involving companies resident in a jurisdiction with which Ireland has a treaty or quoted on a recognised stock exchange.</p>

          <p eId="para_581">On the Deputy's question regarding cost, it is not possible to estimate the cost of this extension but it is not expected to be significant.  This is because most multinational groups already will have structured their organisations so that their Irish companies fit within the current definition of groups.  However, some groups with non-EU or non-EEA parents, particularly in the insurance industry, may not have been able to so do due to regulatory reasons and their Irish operations will now be able to avail of group relief.  The removal of the EU and EEA restriction in respect of group relief should make Ireland a more attractive location for non-EU and non-EEA companies and multinational groups that are exploring the possibilities of setting up here.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">This amendment is designed to counteract a scheme which attempts to avoid capital gains tax on the disposal of valuable shares in a company by means of an exchange of shares in the company for units in a collective investment undertaking and the subsequent disposal of those units to an offshore company.  The proposed amendment will counter such attempts by providing that where a shareholder of a company exchanges his or her shares for units in a collective investment undertaking, whether in the context of a reorganisation of the company's own share capital or in the context of a company restructuring or amalgamation involving two or more companies, such a transaction will not qualify for capital gains tax relief under the relevant provisions of the Taxes Consolidation Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I have included this provision in the Bill on the advice of the Revenue Commissioners.  Revenue recently has become aware of attempts to circumvent a charge to capital gains tax on the disposal of shares held in an asset rich company through a scheme, which involves the following steps.  The first step is the setting up of a Part 13 company, being a company authorised by the Central Bank under Part 13 of the Companies Act 1990, which operates as a collective investment undertaking.  The second step is the swapping of the shares in the asset rich company for shares in the Part 13 company and the subsequent disposal of the shares of the Part 13 company.  Agents acting for shareholders using this scheme argue there is no capital gains tax liability on the disposal of shares in the Part 13 company by reason of the special computational rules applying to the taxation of collective investment undertakings.  I should emphasise that the Revenue Commissioners do not accept the validity of such arguments.  The arrangements clearly are being designed to avoid tax and Revenue will contest vigorously any such arrangements using all the available means at its disposal.  Nevertheless, it is desirable and prudent to close off any possible loophole that may exist under existing legislation or that may be exploited through the use of this type of scheme in view of the potential tax loss to the Exchequer.

          <p eId="para_630">Amendment No. 87 relates to section 57.  The purpose of that section was to give effect to the proposal in the Budget Statement to reduce the retirement relief in section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  That section grants relief from capital gains tax on disposals made by individuals aged 55 or over in respect of the disposal of business or agricultural assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Full relief from capital gains tax is given where the consideration is less than €750,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">This amendment replaces the original section 57 because a drafting error contained therein had the unintended effect that individuals currently aged 66 or who will attain that age on or before 31 December 2013 would not qualify for retirement relief.  The new section 57 is similar to the original with the exception that subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), which is being inserted into section 598 of the principal Act, ensures that individuals currently aged 66 or over or who will attain the age of 66 on or before 31 December 2013 will be able to avail of the current relief of €750,000.  The new section 57(2)(<i>a</i>) ensures that the relief currently available will continue to apply in respect of the disposal of qualifying assets by individuals who are aged 55 or over but who have not attained the age of 66.  Section 57(2)(<i>c</i>) gives effect to the proposal in the Budget Statement to reduce the relief from €750,000 to €500,000 for disposals of business or agricultural assets by individuals aged 66 or over.  This provision applies to disposals made on or after 1 January 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Amendment No. 88 relates to section 58, which amends section 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The latter grants unrestricted relief to individuals aged 55 or over who dispose of business or agricultural assets to their children and certain other individuals.  The amendment replaces the original section 58 because of a drafting error contained therein which had an unintended effect, namely, that individuals currently aged 66 or who will attain that age on or before 31 December 2013 would not qualify for retirement relief.  The new section 58 is similar to the original with the exception that paragraph (<i>b</i>)(ii), which is being inserted into section 599(1) of the principal Act, ensures that individuals who are aged 66 or who will attain that age on or before 31 December 2013 will be able to avail of the current unrestricted relief.  Paragraph (<i>b</i>)(i) ensures that the relief currently available will continue to apply in respect of disposals by individuals who are aged 55 or over but who have not attained the age of 66.  Paragraph (<i>b</i>)(iii) gives effect to the proposal in the Budget Statement to limit the relief to €3 million in the case of individuals who are aged 66 or over.  This provision applies to disposals made on or after 1 January 2014 by such individuals.</p>

It is one of a number of measures, announced on budget day, which are designed to assist in the transfer of land and to encourage younger farmers to take ownership of land.  I do not know whether the matter was raised by the farming organisations but it was certainly one of a package of measures proposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

If the reference in the new section 57 is to disposals of business or agricultural assets, we must determine whether it is sufficiently broad to include land.  If land is part of a business holding, then it is possible to argue that it is contemplated within the terms of the provision.  Perhaps we might reconsider the position in respect of this provision to see whether it might be tightened up.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_680">(3) On a disposal of land or buildings to which this section applies, such portion of the gain shall not be a chargeable gain as represents the same proportion of the gain as 7 years bears to the period of ownership of such land or buildings.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_683">(<i>b</i>) where arrangements (within the meaning of section 546A) have been put in place and it can be shown that relief (apart from the relief given under subsection (3)) would be less if the arrangements had not been put in place.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">This amendment relates to section 62.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">That section gave effect to the proposal in the Budget Statement to give relief from capital gains tax for properties purchased between 7 December 2011 and 31 December 2013 where the property is held for more than seven years.  Where such property is held for more than seven years, the gains attributed to the seven-year period will not attract capital gains tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">This amendment substitutes a new section for the existing section 62.  A number of changes are introduced in the new section.  A technical drafting error in the original section is corrected to ensure properties situated in this country qualify for the relief.  The new section also provides that the relief will only apply where the property was acquired for at least 75% of its market value at the date of acquirement if it is acquired from a relative, as defined in section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A relative for this purpose is a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, ancestor or lineal descendant.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">A further condition for the relief is included in the new section.  This condition is that for the incentive scheme to apply, any income, profit or gains from the property must be subject to Irish tax.  An anti-avoidance provision is included in order that the relief will not apply if arrangements have been put in place and it can be shown that the relief provided for by the section would be less if the arrangement had not been put in place.  I commend the amendment to the committee.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_688">I am deeply worried about this section.  From my reading, the intention is to fuel a property bubble again, as we are giving reliefs on land and building purchases if people hold on to them for seven years.  I am deeply concerned that we are following the mistakes of previous Administrations and we will come to regret this.  There has been a big learning curve over the last number of years for everyone to see and we should not incentivise the purchase of property as we have done in the past.  Although this is of a more limited nature, it would still have an effect, especially if coupled with other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">We have seen figures today indicating that property prices have decreased by the largest degree in quite a while.  I could be wrong but I believe the last thing we should do is try to initiate policies to drive property prices again.  We are starting at a zero base now but with every tax relief or expenditure item in the past ten years, there was always a clear argument, although it may not have had the desired effect.  On the introduction of such measures one may have seen such logic but considering the cumulative effect, the process was definitely not helpful but was very destructive to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">There is a serious question over this amendment, which affects the entire section.  Will the Minister of State explain the rationale for the Government initiating such a measure and how does it respond to the argument that these measures could fuel another property bubble?</p>

          <p eId="para_691">I have heard what the Deputy is saying and I will be blunt.  His comments would have some validity in circumstances where there are normal levels of transactions.  Both the Deputy and I know this is not the case now, as the market is utterly dysfunctional.  I was interested to see recently that the same number of transactions occurred in 2011 as in 1971, despite the fact that in population and development terms, the years were on different planets.  In some parts of the country, the cost of building a house, which we spoke of earlier, is more expensive than the purchase price, which shows that the market is deeply dysfunctional.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The objective of the Government's approach in the last budget was to encourage transactions and this is one such small measure.  This could not be presented as any kind of short-term speculative gain as holdings must be in place for seven years.  This formed part of a suite of different options, and there are also proposals such as stamp duty reductions on the commercial side to bring it more in line with the UK experience.  That is useful.  I know we will discuss the matter later but I know of people around this town who fielded many calls the day after the budget because there is a significant pent-up demand, with people waiting to make a transaction if the critical confidence is achieved.  Our actions on stamp duty were important, as were the measures dealing with mortgage interest relief, as encouraging people to get into the market this year was important.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">This is a slow, cumulative, confidence-building exercise and transactions are a part of that.  If this encourages people to make a purchase, it would be good, as the State would have a greater take on the taxation side.  I hope we all have an interest in bringing about a more functional property market.  Our pensions, asset values and the future of the country are predicated on coming back in this area, although not to the extraordinary heights that existed in the past.  Even those of us who purchased in recent years and who find ourselves in negative equity have an interest in encouraging transactions.  This measure is nothing more than part of a suite of options set out by the Minister in the budget which I hope will encourage limited transactions in order that we can get our revenue going again.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">We do not want to return to the unsustainable property bubble - it will not happen - and the degree to which the revenues of this State were dependent on that bubble.  Nevertheless, we have a responsibility to the wider society, including the construction industry, to encourage more transactions.  In so far as this measure is a tentative measure in that direction, I hope we succeed.</p>

          <p eId="para_695">I hear what the Minister of State is saying.  I listened to the Minister for Finance when he introduced this measure, which allows relief for purchases between that budget day and 31 December 2013.  His comments seemed to encourage people to get into the market.  If people had followed his advice they would have been stung as property prices have fallen at their most severe rate in January and again in February.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The major concern is that this is not a revenue-raising measure as we are forgoing capital gains tax, and stamp duty has been reduced in previous Bills.  This is more of a design to stop the property market from continuing to drop to the levels at which it is headed.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">I am not sure.  There is one cohort, the people in negative equity, who would be affected but only if they wanted to sell their house.  It does not matter for people in mortgage distress if they are in negative equity as the point is that incomes have dropped rather than the value of the property.  What about people trying to get on the property ladder and the people who want to purchase now?  House prices have been at an unsustainable level, and the price was driven up because of availability of easy credit from banks, which came about from Government decisions.  I lean towards the argument of letting the property market find its own level and starting from there.  There should be a gradual increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I can see the benefits to the State and NAMA - the big beneficiary of a halt in property price falls - but there is no positive impact directly from this measure as we are forgoing tax.  I am reluctant to support a measure such as this.  I listened to the Taoiseach last week in the Dáil when he said this Government wants to invest in humans, not in property or bricks and mortar.  This measure is about investing in bricks and mortar and allowing people to forgo income tax if they buy property.  It is not designed to be fair but to serve as a means of fuelling activity in the property market.  As I indicated, while it could have benefits, I tend towards the view that its negative effects will be greater.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_700">Deputy Doherty may remember that in September 2006 the then Tánaiste and former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell, commenced a debate on stamp duty which continued until the general election of 2007.  The discussion resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of transactions in the housing market because people logically asked whether it would be preferable to wait for the new regime to be introduced following the election before purchasing a property.  Certainty is important in any economic cycle but particularly important in the current cycle.  One could argue that what we are trying to do in the section is give certainty to people who want to dip their toes in the water by purchasing a property during the window of opportunity provided.  I cannot tell Deputy Doherty hand on heart that this measure will stimulate a specific number of transactions.  However, in the round and combined with the other measures set out in the budget, I believe it will make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Deputy Doherty noted, on the basis of figures released today on the property market, that anyone who has purchased property since the budget will have lost out.  The idea that someone would buy property last December with the intention of flipping it by February 2012 is not realistic given the current utterly dysfunctional housing market.  We all have a responsibility to identify what can be done to encourage transactions where none is occurring.  Will this measure work?  While I cannot give a definitive answer, its purpose is to build confidence in a property market that has been flattened.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I concur with Deputy Doherty that we must reach the bottom of the market, not only because the National Asset Management Agency holds assets on our behalf and we need yields to increase but also because ordinary consumers must have a palpable sense that the bottom has been reached.  This must be discernible and clear to everyone if a recovery is to take place.  Fundamentally, a pick-up in the property market is inextricably linked to a return to normal levels of economic growth.  I am not a prophet announcing this measure will tomorrow ignite some special device in the property market.  However, combined with the other measures we are introducing, it will send out a signal of confidence.  We will see what develops.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_411">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_703">I will make a few points on this issue, about which I also spoke earlier.  Given that capital gains tax does not apply to the sale of a principal private residence, this measure is effectively a tax break for investors, one which is designed to get investors into the market.  If sufficient numbers of investors avail of this incentive, it could have the effect of making housing more expensive for first-time buyers and owner occupiers.  We should be clear that the purpose of this provision is to encourage investors into the market.  I believe the objective is to establish a floor for property prices.  Depending on one's perspective, one could argue that is a good or bad outcome but one cannot argue that it is of any benefit to a first-time buyer deciding whether to buy a home given that capital gains tax does not, in any case, apply to principal private residences.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">A reading of the text suggests the provision applies to land as well as buildings.  Land should be excluded from the measure.  Notwithstanding the arguments about incentivising the purchase of commercial or residential buildings, we all know what took place when people started speculating through land purchases.  We should not encourage a return to such practices.  Land should be excluded from the measure, except in the case of land that is incidental to the enjoyment of a property, for example, private gardens.  The Minister should be able to find the wording required to accommodate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I assume, based on the reference to "a person", that the measure applies only to private citizens and does not apply to corporate entities or companies investing in property.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">I did not say that was the objective of the measure.  The objective is to encourage transactions because we will all be winners if that occurs.  In circumstances in which we are getting nothing from nothing, one could argue that a smaller percentage of something is a significantly better outcome.  The purpose of the old relief schemes was, in many cases, to reduce the income tax people paid.  The new relief only applies if there is a real gain from investing in the property.  If there is no increase in value, there is no gain.  This means that those who avail of the measure are taking a punt.  If people avail of it, the State will benefit from the transaction tax and stamp duty arising from the purchase in circumstances in which it does not receive anything at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">As I pointed out to Deputy Doherty, no one is suggesting that we will return to circumstances in which one third of tax revenue will be property related.  However, we all gain when VAT and stamp duty flow into the coffers, especially given that nothing is flowing into the Exchequer from these sources at present.  That is the focus and objective of the measure.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_712">Unfortunately, when VAT, stamp duty and so on were flowing into the Exchequer, 107,000 families did not gain much.  They are now in a serious pickle as a result of Government policies which were also grounded in the argument that a bit of something is better than nothing.  The Minister of State indicated the measure will provide confidence.  The only group who will gain confidence are property investors.  He also indicated investors will take a punt.  All investors take risks but this proposal limits their exposure by providing that if they make a gain, the State will forgo capital gains tax through a relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">As I stated, I can understand from where the Government is coming because getting investors into the market will push up property prices across the board.  Such a scenario would be beneficial for the banks and the National Asset Management Agency.  The problem, however, is that it would not benefit first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">If we agree that we need property prices to stabilise and then begin to recover at a normal pace, this measure will not achieve that outcome.  While it is a confidence measure for investors, its sunset clause has the potential to skew the property market again because on 1 January 2014 the relief will be removed, as will be the incentive to buy.  This is not a policy which seeks to stabilise property prices.   This is a carrot to fuel investment in investment properties which could have a negative effect on other property prices and on the property market.  There is also the issue of the Government forgoing tax.  It is next to impossible to quantify that because we do not know how many people will make an investment.  The relief is open ended and, for example, billions of euro could be invested between now and the end of 2013.  Large corporations could snap up property because prices are at an all-time low.  We do not know if that will happen because this is hypothetical but the tax will be forgone.  Stamp duty is only 1%.  I have major concerns about this section.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">It would be wrong to classify this as the sole measure introduced in the budget relating to property and is not designed to help first-time buyers.  We have introduced other measures relating to mortgage interest to help them and they were set out by the Minister in his Budget Statement.  If we can get to the bottom of the bottom, as I described it earlier, we will all be beneficiaries as we then move back to a confident property market.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">On the question of land, the building includes the land it is built on.  It would be extremely difficult to include the land the building is on.  A company or an individual who is trading in land and buildings will not qualify for this relief.  They will be subject to income or corporation tax.  The value of the property market is falling but I understand that the value of agricultural land has increased in the past two years - quite substantially in some parts of the country.  That is unusual.  That demonstrates there is interest in agricultural land because the industry is doing well but the property market continues to slide.  It is another example of the utterly dysfunctional market.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Nobody suggests this is a silver bullet, which will allow the property market to get off its knees tomorrow.  However, in the context of lack of transactions in the market, we all have a responsibility to see if we can encourage more transactions.  The Deputy is correct that the window will close at the end of 2013, which is a minimal window for people to make an investment in property.  We need professional investors in property.  It is a legitimate business.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">I agree with the Minister of State that we need investment in property and, more important, we need the capital gains revenues that come with that.  Previous Administrations introduced section 23 property relief.  It was argued, for example, that this would help the construction industry in County Leitrim where it had hit rock bottom.  Nobody was building at the time and the relief was intended to help young people remain in a county with little employment and prevent them from emigrating.  However, the Exchequer is still forgoing the tax on the houses that were built and which are lying empty and derelict.  When the Government opens the door to a relief such as this, it does not know what will come through.  Those are my concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">The Deputy's point regarding previous tax reliefs is well made.  If one looks back on the economic history of the State in the past two decades, colossal mistakes were made in respect of how that section 23 relief was applied in different parts of the country.  In most cases, people purchased houses under this scheme to reduce their income tax liability.  I do not blame them for that and later we will debate what to do about these legacy tax reliefs.  Equally, many people who had no public service pension determined that they would invest in property for pension purposes.  Many people my own age who do not work in the public sector and who do not have private pension cover decided to put their money into property because they thought the second property would be their pension.  Many of the legacy reliefs revolved around income tax rather than investment in property.  It was regarded as a tax efficient way to utilise funds to purchase the relief.  We have to learn from those mistakes and manage them.</p>

This measure cannot be seen in the same light because the property market is on its knees and prices have collapsed by more than 40%.  That cannot be compared with the market then, which I acknowledge was inflated during these years as a result of the tax relief.  It did huge damage to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I ask the Deputy to consider this measure in the round.  If it encourages transactions and a sense that we have reached the bottom of the market, I do not know how he can oppose that.</p>
