Statements on Banking is not an adequate proposal to deal with the issues which must now be discussed in this House.  It is not possible to separate the issue of banking from the wider issue of the State’s finances and the general economic situation.  As I understand it, the meeting of the eurozone Ministers and ECOFIN, which the Minister for Finance attended, dealt with a wider range of matters than banking.  I will return to this point later.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Second, only 95 minutes has been provided for Statements on Banking.

We have people from international institutions over in the Department of Finance and we are told by the Governor of the Central Bank this morning that they are negotiating a multi-billion euro loan.  My party and I want an opportunity to discuss these matters adequately in the House today and to hear from the Government, first of all, if it is the case, as the Governor of the Central Bank said, that a multi-billion euro loan is being negotiated.  Second, if that is the case, I want to know what are the conditions the Government is negotiating with respect to that loan and what implications those conditions will have for public and budgetary policy in this country.  We will not be able to do that with statements solely on banking confined to 95 minutes, which will not take into account the number of interventions that the Ceann Comhairle will no doubt make during the course of the debate.</p>

We are only having clarity because we have had the Taoiseach and Ministers across all portfolios trundled out over the past week and more in an exercise of denial clearly to deceive the people and to mislead this House, as was the case over the past two days in responses regarding this matter raised by a range of Opposition voices.  What is being proposed is not a bailout for the Irish people.  That is not what is being looked at by the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission.  It will have no consequence in terms of reliefs for social welfare, health spending or education needs.  What this is all about is supporting the Government in its bailout of the banks and the ECB looms behind them as one of the critical investors.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">I may not have the chance to contribute to the debate on banking.  In the light of the truth spoken by the Governor of the Central Bank this morning, do I take it that irrespective of what officials are involved in negotiations or discussions, this is a matter for elected representatives and politicians to make decisions?  The job of politicians is to find solutions and make decisions.  Do I take it that the 12.5% corporation tax rate will be defended to the limit by the Government?  Although we continue to pour billions into a failed banking structure it is not going to work and will only heap further tax on Irish taxpayers for generations.  Will the Tánaiste outline the Government's proposals to shift the banks currently in State ownership from the backs of the Irish taxpayer at no cost?  Is it a fact that the Government will now change tack and that bondholders will be made to share part of the burden of what will emerge from the discussions taking place in the Department of Finance and the Central Bank?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_523">I wish to provide the House with an update on recent developments affecting the Irish banking and financial systems following my discussions with European colleagues both at the euro group and the ECOFIN council earlier this week.  First, I wish to reassure all depositors in the guaranteed banks and building societies in Ireland that their deposits continue to be safe and secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The commencement of technical discussions between the Irish and international authorities seems to have generated misinformed, inaccurate and, in some instances, mischievous comment about the protection of deposits under the State's bank guarantee scheme.  In such circumstances, it is important to reaffirm the State's commitment to the safeguarding of all deposits and the other liabilities guaranteed under the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme approved yesterday by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The scheme will be in force until the end of 2011 subject to a six month review by the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The extension of the guarantee has been approved by the European Commission and was endorsed by the European Central Bank on financial stability grounds.  The urgent and essential requirement for the prolongation of the scheme to underpin the funding position of the banking system was set out clearly in the House yesterday.  It is inconceivable that any measure would be proposed by any party to jeopardise the protection afforded by the Irish State to depositors under the bank guarantee scheme.  Any other view is simply wrong and wholly at variance with the fact that in their statement on Ireland on Tuesday evening the euro group lent its support to bank guarantee arrangements in Ireland.  Let me be clear: deposits are safe.  Nothing in the content of the discussions underway or anything that may arise thereafter will affect that fact.  Depositors can depend and rely on the protection afforded by the State guarantee up to now and into the future.  This was under-scored yesterday with the passage of the guarantee scheme for a further 12 month period in national law to the end of 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">It is legitimate and appropriate for a continuing and vigorous public debate on the Government's banking strategy.  However, it is incumbent on all of us as public representatives and those in positions of influence in the media and to public discourse generally to ensure that needless concern and anxiety is not caused to the public on the basis of spurious and often alarmist speculation.  I have not found nor has any instance been reported to me of any spurious or alarmist speculation by Members.  It is important that we reaffirm that deposits are guaranteed by the State and that the guarantee is underpinned by our membership of the euro, one of the strongest currencies in the world.  I know Deputies have received individual queries about these matters, and this position must be maintained and constantly affirmed.  As long as this is established, we can proceed with our debate in as vigorous a manner as we wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The common and agreed position of our eurozone partners is set out clearly in the statement issued by the euro group on Tuesday evening, which welcomed the significant efforts of Ireland to deal with the challenges it faces in the fiscal and financial sector areas and endorsed the budgetary strategy that will underpin the Government's four-year plan for returning the public finances to sustainability, which will be published by the end of the month.  The euro group also welcomed the actions taken by the Government to date to seek to resolve our banking sector issues, including the guarantee and the policies of asset segregation through NAMA and capital investment in the banking institutions.  However, it also acknowledged that notwithstanding these measures, market conditions have not normalised and significant pressures remain.  This gives rise to concerns that further reforms and stabilisation measures for the banking sector may be appropriate.  On this basis, the statement endorsed a short and focused consultation between the Irish authorities and the Commission, the ECB and the IMF to determine the best way to provide any necessary support to address market risks, especially in the banking sector, in the context of the four-year budgetary plan and the upcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">In any talks with the relevant authorities, the Government has acting on its behalf my officials at the Department of Finance, assisted by the National Treasury Management Agency.  Naturally, the Central Bank, although independent in the operation of its functions, has a separate and distinct role in any discussions that take place by virtue of its unique position in our banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The statement reflects the shared analysis of the Irish authorities and the euro group that further steps may be required in restructuring the Irish banking system to restore long-term market confidence in our banks and ensure they can function in the future without the need for continued significant Government guarantee supports or significant reliance on ECB liquidity facilities.  The purpose of the technical discussions that are being initiated in Dublin today is to assess the possibility of building on the significant interventions already undertaken by the Irish authorities — the NAMA scheme, the Central Bank's stress tests, and the restructuring and recapitalisation — to secure an enduring and permanent resolution to the problems of our banking system.  I welcome this morning's comments by the Governor of the Central Bank, who reiterated what I said about deposits and said that were the talks to result in the availability of a substantial contingency capital fund to back Ireland and create confidence in the firepower available but not drawn down by the banking system, that would be a desirable outcome.  However, we are not at that point at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The job of Government is to protect the taxpayer.  That is what we have been doing and what we are now doing.  If the Government has been reticent in making public comment, it has been in the interest of protecting the taxpayer.  Jumping to conclusions ahead of the facts is not to the benefit of the taxpayer, nor is it in our interest to do this in advance of the discussions that are now taking place.  It is the Government's job to assess the options in light of the facts, and the facts can best be established after having a short and focused discussion.  That is what the people would expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The international teams and our officials are working towards a common analysis of the problem.  The problems we are facing do not relate to our budgetary position.  Our budgetary strategy this year — to implement a €6 billion adjustment in the budget — has been fully endorsed by all finance Ministers in Europe, whether they belong to our group, the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the European People's Party or the Party of European Socialists.  There has been a unanimous endorsement at European level of what we are doing on the budgetary front.  It is important to understand that the problems we are addressing are of a structural character in the banking system.  They are, of necessity, technical issues requiring intensive discussions, which are now under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">As I said yesterday, the Government and its EU partners are still examining options in terms of the shape a package of financial assistance might take.  I am glad it was reported that I said, "There is no question of loading on to the Irish sovereign and the Irish state some kind of unspecified burden."</p>

          <p eId="para_534">"That is why the government took great care not to make a formal application at this stage but to engage in intensive discussions to see exactly what the options are."</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Let us be clear about what is happening at present.  Officials from the various international organisations are here to engage in an intense process of consultation.  I had good discussions with our European colleagues over the past few days, and I remind Deputies of the conclusions of the euro group: they welcomed the actions taken by the Irish Government on both budgetary matters and the banking situation, including the guarantee, NAMA and recapitalisation.  We must have a clear and shared understanding of the facts.  Furthermore, we are working on our consideration of the four-year plan, which will be made public very shortly.  This will set out the difficult but necessary decisions we must take as a country to bring order and sustainability back to our public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The main focus of the ongoing discussions will be on the banking system.  I agree there are major issues in this regard, and our officials will, in the coming days, be working closely and intensively with officials from the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  We are strongly committed to the success of the consultation process which has been agreed by the euro group in light of the serious market disturbances that have led to substantial increases in sovereign bond yields, particularly for Ireland but also for other eurozone member states.  These developments not only jeopardise Ireland but threaten the integrity of the eurozone, so it is absolutely essential that the structural issues that underlie negative market sentiment and the loss of market confidence are dealt with in a detailed and comprehensive fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Recent developments have inevitably led to a further escalation of the claim being made inside and outside the House that the bank guarantee of September 2008 had some connection with our present difficulties.  Some commentators are blaming the ills of the country on the State guarantee.  The fact is that every finance Minister in Europe indicated the other evening that the guarantee was the correct policy at the time.  We have to work towards the future in order to stabilise the banking system in the dangerous market conditions that now exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In the period now extending over two years, no one has provided any compelling rationale for the superiority of any practical or feasible alternative to the guarantee adopted on 29 September 2008.  My view, and that of the Government, on the basis of its assessment of the advice it received, remains that Ireland faced the likely collapse of its banking system within days in the absence of immediate decisive action.  It is interesting that only yesterday we had another vote in the House about the extension of the guarantee to the end of next year.  On that occasion the Opposition chose to divide the House on an issue about which the European Central Bank, the Commission and ourselves were unanimous — the need to stabilise the Irish banking system by giving a guarantee to protect confidence in it.  Despite that unanimity of opinion from our international advisers and the Government——</p>

          <p eId="para_564">However, it is important to be clear contrary to what is rapidly becoming the conventional wisdom that such a regime is not necessarily a panacea for minimising the fiscal costs to the State of our banking crisis particularly in light of various legal considerations in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">In Ireland's case, the major fiscal costs, which the State has borne as a result of huge loan losses suffered by the Irish banks, could only be reduced where some of these losses were imposed on creditors of the banks.  The Government has already made clear its intention to secure appropriate sharing with holders of subordinated debt in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, and Anglo Irish Bank has launched a recent offer to buy back subordinated debt at a deep discount.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Discussions are ongoing at EU and international level on the mechanisms that may be available in the future to share the fiscal costs of bank resolution with senior creditors of banks other than depositors.  However, this work remains preliminary and many important legal, financial and commercial hurdles will need to be cleared before there is any prospect of it becoming accepted market practice.  It is important to draw attention to that because this debate in Ireland is not taking place in isolation from developments with our EU partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The recent substantial widening in Irish Government bond spreads since the end of October in response to market concerns relating to possible burden-sharing that might arise in circumstances that a eurozone member state accesses the proposed permanent crisis resolution fund and the requirement for a joint statement from the finance Ministers of Germany, France, the UK and Spain provides strong confirmation of the critical importance of exercising extreme care in asserting that costs can easily be imposed on senior creditors of banks.  The current difficult funding position for both the Government and the banking system implies very strongly that we should be very cautious about even contemplating such a step in the current crisis, never mind whatever legal and constitutional obstacles would need to be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I welcome the support in recent days from my European colleagues as reflected in the statement issued by the eurogroup on Tuesday evening.  We are aware that there is a European dimension to our considerations.  We are part of a common currency within a broader European Union, which brings benefits but also obligations.  We are now in a short focussed and intense process.  It is crucial to complete this process before any decisions are made that could have implications for the taxpayer.</p>

          <p eId="para_569">The Minister's aunt, Deputy O'Rourke, in a speech last week reminded her audience of the common origins of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  Both parties spring from the old Sinn Féin, before that honourable title was besmirched by more recent events.  Sinn Féin means "ourselves alone" and was not only the title of the national movement, but the title contained its principal objective, that as a nation we would run our own affairs for the betterment of the Irish people.  This is what the patriot dead fought and died for and what they achieved was a sovereign Irish State.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Now an inept Government, through its arrogance and avarice has given it away. <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial today asks: “whether this is what the men of 1916 died for: a bailout from the German chancellor with a few shillings of sympathy from the British chancellor on the side.”  The Minister should be ashamed and his colleagues should share the shame.  That a Fianna Fáil-led Government should be the one to surrender our sovereignty has its own irony.  For years it posed as the super green patriots and the uncompromising republicans.  Again I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_571">It [Fianna Fáil] lists among its primary aims the commitment to "maintain the status of Ireland as a sovereign state" [which is one of the principles in its party documentation].  Its founder, Eamon de Valera, in his inaugural address to his new party in 1926, spoke of "the inalienability of national sovereignty" as being fundamental to its beliefs.  The Republican Party's ideals are in tatters now.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">In every crisis in Ireland, sooner or later a clown emerges.  Last night in Dromoland Castle, the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, took over this role.  He assured his audience that the crisis was nothing more that a game of poker by saying: "We've got to play poker over the next couple of days to see what cards these people have to play...  We would like to see the colour of their money."  I am sure his audience from Silicon Valley in Dromoland Castle was suitably impressed.</p>

The other strategy the Minister has drawn from poker is bluff and he is the greatest proponent of bluff I have ever seen in this House.  He and the Taoiseach have been bluffing for weeks now, but the bluff is not working and the Government continues to be an embarrassment to the people.  They will not speak plainly or share the nation's grief with the people who elected them or tell them what lies ahead.  This morning was a classic example of the Government's ineptitude when the Governor of the Central Bank felt he had an onus to come out and explain what was happening in the absence of any explanation from the elected Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">The origins of this crisis are in the Government's disastrous banking policy.  It was warned when it implemented it that it was on the road to disaster.  It was warned in detail by Fine Gael, which for two years has argued that Anglo Irish Bank should be been wound down in an orderly fashion.  The concept of moral hazard should have applied and I am sure the Minister is hearing from his colleagues in ECOFIN that the concept of moral hazard needs to be restored to the European Union.  Put simply this means that not only those who recklessly invested in Anglo Irish Bank and lost all their money, and those who borrowed recklessly from Anglo Irish Bank and lost those assets should be held to account, but also those who lent recklessly to Anglo Irish Bank should share the burden and the pain like everybody else.  Why should reckless lenders who got premium interest rates to cover their risks in lending to Anglo Irish Bank be bailed out by the taxpayer?  Why should the responsibility of repayment transfer to the taxpayer from reckless lenders who were getting premium interest rates to lend to the banks?</p>

          <p eId="para_583">I will come to the default strategy and if the Deputy reads the Minister's speech he would see to where he has moved; the Deputy probably missed that part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The Government has never explained adequately in this House why it decided to take over Anglo Irish Bank lock, stock and barrel.  It has been alleged that there was close social contact between the Taoiseach and the principals of the bank and that has been advanced as a reason.  Regardless of whether that is a true allegation, it is hardly a credible reason, but the Government has yet to explain its actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Some months ago <i>The New York Times</i> ran the headline: “Can One Bank Bring Down a Country?”  What is the answer this morning?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_586">Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_587">The answer has to be "Yes" this morning — one bank can bring down a country.  The Government's banking policy has been an absolute disaster and it pursued it in the teeth of opposition here and expert opinion outside this House.  That is what brought us to this point this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">As the crisis broke in recent days the Government has been trying to spin itself out of accepting the blame for the disaster.  It claims that it is not really a sovereign problem, but merely a bank rescue by the ECB.  Of course that is not correct; the IMF does not deal with banks, but with sovereign nations.  The fact that the IMF is involved means it is dealing with the sovereign and not dealing with the bank directly.  The Financial Stability Fund operating, under law, out of Berlin can only deal with euro states in difficulty.  It has no legal mandate to deal with any company in the private sector or any bank.  The fact that part of the source of the funds is the Financial Stability Fund and that one of the organisations represented in the Department of Finance this morning is the IMF proves without shadow of doubt that those that are examining Ireland are looking at Ireland incorporated and seeing it as a rescue, an injection of funds into Ireland, a major loan on which Ireland can draw, a bailout for Ireland and not a bailout for the narrow banking sector.  Yet the Government continues to spin by pretending and not being straight with the people.  It is trying to put a gloss on it by claiming that this is really an unfortunate event in the banks over which it had little or no control.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Minister has also claimed in his spin that this is a European, not an Irish, problem, that it is European action to protect the euro and that Ireland is the innocent victim of the strategy.  This is total nonsense.  Of course there has been a knock-on effect in Portugal from Ireland's problems with its banking sector and in bond prices being paid by the Portuguese, and there is an imminent knock-on effect on Spain.  However, it is a matter of the contagion, as it is described, spreading from the infection in Ireland and when the ECB seeks to address it, it does not do so in Spain or Portugal but, like a good doctor, it goes back to the source of the infection and addresses it in Ireland.  It is Ireland's problem that is being addressed.  The Minister has put us in our current position and he cannot spin his way out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The Minister's speech is interesting and I agree with one part of it.  I join him in stating that there is no threat to Irish people's deposits in Irish banks.  That is covered adequately under our law and under the law in Europe.  I join the Minister in stressing that, because I have had numerous calls from constituents to ask if they should open sterling accounts and move out their money.  If people act in that way, it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Deposits are safe and secure and should be left in the Irish banking system now that Europe is taking action.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The second interesting part of the Minister's speech is the section on the special resolution regime.  All the documents about banking and what happened in the time leading up to the guarantee in September 2008 were released to the Committee of Public Accounts.  One of those documents showed there was a memorandum in circulation in the Department of Finance as early as February 2008 which discussed resolution legislation so banks could be wound down in an orderly manner.  On seeing the word "resolution" many people tend to think it means to resolve or solve the Irish banking problem.  That is not what "resolution" means in the technical sense.  Resolution is a legal mechanism whereby a bank in trouble may be wound down systematically and those with an input into the bank share the burden of the wind down.  The Minister has been promising resolution legislation and the Department has been discussing it for nearly three years, yet we have seen nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">However, the Minister has moved dramatically.  A couple of weeks ago he moved to agree with the Fine Gael position that subordinated bondholders could be negotiated with and discounts achieved in Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

He is now opening the door to the possibility that moral hazard will apply in Europe and that negotiations could take place with senior bondholders so they, as the Minister put it, would share the burden as well.  To disguise the very significant policy move, he warned, "Discussions are ongoing at EU and international level on the mechanisms that may be available in the future to share the fiscal costs of bank resolution with senior creditors of banks other than depositors.  However, this work remains preliminary and many important legal, financial and commercial hurdles will need to be cleared. . .".</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Look at the distance the Minister has moved.  He lectured Members of the House, saying members of Fine Gael were talking nonsense.  He told us this was mission impossible and no negotiations were possible with senior bondholders.

          <p eId="para_608">There is a big policy change this morning.  Now the Government, under pressure from Europe, is contemplating negotiations whereby senior bondholders would not be paid in full for the disaster in the banks.  I welcome that.  It should have been done years ago.  If it had, we would not be in the current fix.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I do not know what mechanism will be finally put in place.  I presume the Minister has a good idea about it but he is not sharing his views with the House this morning.  However, in his last sentence another cat was deliberately let out of the bag.  He said. "It is crucial to complete this process before any decisions are made that could have implications for the taxpayer."  Obviously, whatever is introduced will have conditions attached to it and these conditions could have implications for the taxpayer, so it is important to complete the process before the implications for the taxpayer are seen.  It confirms that the Minister is deferring the publication of the four-year plan until after the negotiations take place because there will be implications for the Irish taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Will the Minister come clean?  Will the Croke Park agreement be shelved?  Will there be a restructuring of the labour market?  Will there be initiatives to cut social welfare so the poverty trap is narrowed?  Are these not the type of structural changes that people in Europe are seeking?</p>

          <p eId="para_627">If we are talking about W. B. Yeats, I should mention the greatNigerian novelist Chinua Achebe wrote the novel <i>Things Fall Apart</i>.  Listening to Deputy Fahey, I was also reminded of lines in another poem by W. B. Yeats:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_628">The best lack all conviction, while the worst</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_629">Are full of passionate intensity.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Deputy Fahey definitely comes to mind in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Confidence will return to Irish bank depositors, Irish businesses and foreign business in Ireland only when the banking crisis is settled and we have a functioning banking system.  Regardless of what defence Fianna Fáil offers for its actions with regard to the banking crisis, the crisis dates back to March 2008, when Deputy Brian Cowen was still the Minister for Finance and waiting to see when Deputy Bertie Ahern should be taken out.  In that month the price of shares in Anglo Irish Bank collapsed and Deputy Brian Cowen refused to do anything.  A month later, as he waited to become Taoiseach, he was wined and dined by Anglo Irish Bank but still apparently knew nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">It is only when we have worked through this crisis and this Government has gone that reliable confidence will return in Ireland, in banking in Ireland and in bank deposits in Ireland.  The statements by the Governor of the Central Bank, the Minister and various European agencies such as the ECB with regard to guaranteeing and back-stopping deposits are welcome.  We will only regain our confidence and sovereignty when we see the passing of this Government and a focus on a plan for economic restoration and growth with a final sorting out and accounting of the banking crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The Minister can sweet-talk us with notions that all the European Ministers crowded around him at the meeting to force him into this position.  I heard, however, they were extremely annoyed that he was not just an hour and a quarter late for the first meeting but over an hour late again for yesterday's meeting.  There was extreme annoyance with people losing patience with the way the Government is presenting the Irish case.</p>

The Minister and Fianna Fáil are trying to shift the blame to our European and eurozone partners.  The unilateral action on the night of the guarantee by the two Brians and then informing our European partners afterwards caused consternation in many different parts of Europe.  That is the diplomatic and historic record of the brave overnight move on the guarantee two years ago.</p>

The Taoiseach yesterday spoke about several possible different types of arrangement.  Professor Honohan this morning spoke about a bank bailout in the form of loan facilities.  If this is correct — which I believe it is anyway because most of this has already been agreed — it means a further large loan facility will be given largely, if not exclusively, for the banks.  The interest rates for the loan facilities from the two European funds, particularly from the Regling fund, will be three-year money.  The rates are at least on a penalty point system.  As I understand it, Professor Regling's fund attracts at least a 300 basis points charge or penalty over and beyond certain baseline interest rates.  That means we are getting three-year money, at somewhere potentially around 5% and upwards.  It means that all our debt — which is the problem for Greece and other countries that go into IMF bailouts — gradually shifts therefore——</p>

Another two are large, important banks that we would like to have seen restored to financial health.  One of them seemed to be almost there, but the current situation over the last eight weeks has damaged that institution again.  If we sell off these banks and strangers are kind enough to buy one or more of them, do they walk away having received our euro IMF loans while we continue to take the liability?  More importantly, our debt-to-GDP ratio changes almost immediately and we will have a huge extra annual interest charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">When Professor John McHale addressed the Labour Party's away day in Roscommon, we had a discussion about how we did not wish to see Ireland entering a bailout.  That is because entering a bailout is an extremely expensive operation for the country which goes into one.  The Minister owes the people of this country the truth about whatever arrangements the Government is contemplating coming up with.  That is why I want to know who these negotiators are and what is their approach to this country.  Are they people from the tea party side of political and economic views?  Or are they people who will have the interests of ordinary Irish citizens, including old age pensioners and infants, in mind, as well as those of the money men in the banks whom Fianna Fáil has striven to protect for the last two years while the rest of us could go hang?</p>

          <p eId="para_677">There is a proposal to construct a casino in County Tipperary, but I do not know if it is necessary because the biggest casino in the world is next door in Government Buildings.  This Government is gambling not just with the entire economy of the State but also with the future of our people on this island.  The Government even acknowledges it.  Deputy Noonan quoted the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, as saying that we will have to play poker over the next couple of days.  So it is about playing poker.  That is how this Government is handling this crisis.  I do not gamble myself and it is not for any pious religious reasons.  I would probably lose all the time if I did gamble, but this Government certainly does.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This is crazy.  The Government has lost every single gamble it has taken in the last two years.  As a result of the Government's gambling, we now need not so much a bank bailout but a Government clear out.  If we had that, we could put in place the infrastructure to deal with the banking and economic crisis in this State.  I do not for a moment believe that we need the likes of the IMF coming in here with their terms and conditions to run this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Let us look at the example of the puppet show over the weekend between the Ministers, Deputy Dermot Ahern and Deputy Noel Dempsey.  When asked about the negotiations and dealings with EcoFin, Deputy Dermot Ahern said: "I heard nothing about that.  Did you hear anything about that, Noel?"  Deputy Dempsey replied: "No, Dermot.  I heard nothing about that either".  That is why we owe a huge debt to Professor Honohan for his honesty and integrity on RTE Radio this morning, in coming out and laying it bare.  He said that negotiations were ongoing about trying to secure a contingency fund or loan, and that it will involve substantial sums — tens of billions of euro.  If the Government had been even close to honest with the Irish people from the middle of last week when all of these rumours were being churned out, we would not have had this concern, annoyance and deep public anger.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">The Government could not lie straight in bed.  Why did the Minister think that pulling the wool over people's eyes and bluffing was a better course of action than being reasonably open and honest with them?  The public know exactly how incompetent the Minister and the Government are.  If the Minister had shared at least some level of openness and honesty with them, he would have served the people of this State better.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Of course, they got away with it before.  In the run up to the 2007 election, they were promising more tax cuts and more jobs.  Similarly, in the Lisbon treaty referendum they promised more jobs for everybody.  They were bluffing and gambling.  What the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, said the other day was right.  He and his Government colleagues see this as some kind of poker game.  It is time Government Buildings were cleared out and changed from being a casino to a proper, functioning centre of governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Pouring billions of euro into the broken banking system will not solve it.  If it goes some way towards stabilising it temporarily it will do so by breaking the backs of the Irish people.  As the Minister knows, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are zombie banks.  Anglo Irish Bank is holed below the water-line and is almost entirely in public ownership, or will be very shortly.  The Bank of Ireland requires substantial additional funding for recapitalisation.</p>

Pouring out loans, stabilisation funds or whatever name the Minister wants to put on them — he is playing tricks with names — will not solve the banking crisis.  We need to do the business correctly and nationalise AIB.  Bank of Ireland is not going to survive and it should be nationalised as well.  That will give us what we need in the economy, in this State and in this society.  It will bring stability and security to the situation.  Dare I use the words integrity and trust?  It depends on who we put in to run it but it is achievable.  I know that words such as integrity and trust do not rest lightly on the party over there.  I know this is a huge problem for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">They scarcely understand the concept.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There is major concern in respect of something the Minister and the other spokespersons dealt with in the course of their contributions.  This is the notion that deposits are safe.  I am getting telephone calls from worried constituents asking whether they should move deposits.  No, they should not.  Deposits are underwritten by the Government, to €100,000, but also by the EU.  People should not have concern about deposits.  Sums up to €100,000 are completely safe and will remain so.  There is no doubt whatsoever about it and it is important that we acknowledge it.  The EU and the IMF support will do no good unless we tackle the source of doubt about solvency.  This is not what seems to have been discussed in Europe in the past few days.   Instead, the idea was mooted that Ireland should tap European funds for the purpose of recapitalising its battered banking sector further.  That would be a fatal mistake.  It would keep the Irish people indentured to those who recklessly funded their banks for almost a decade.  An EU-IMF bailout will not be a bailout for the Irish people.  It will not secure social welfare, nurses' wages or the provision of education.  It will be money provided for the Government to pursue its current failed banking policy.  As the ECB is one of the largest investors in Irish banks, it is obvious this is money being frontloaded to the Irish Government under the pretext of a bailout so the Irish Government can, in turn, give it to the banks which will, in turn, give it to the ECB when it takes it back from the taxpayer.  The added dimension is that this bailout will come with terms and conditions that strip future Governments of sovereignty in fiscal decision making matters.  A bailout is only needed if the Government proceeds with its failed banking plan as it stands, a complete bailout for bondholders.  A large percentage of the bailout costs arise from the decision to honour 100% of senior bondholders debt rather than burning or negotiating with them.  I welcome the suggestion, at the very minimum a strong hint, in the Minister's statement that at long last international pressure has grown to buckle Government and bring it to some kind of common sense in terms of negotiation with senior bondholders.  It should have happened a long time ago.</p>

The difference is that there is now international pressure to get some common sense into the Government.  The sooner that happens, the better.  Financing these zombie banks can buy time but not indefinite time.  We must underpin banking and financial stability.  This banking system cannot be salvaged in its current form and cannot be saved while the Government is holding the reins.  The State needs a Government clear-out, not a banking clear-out.  Whatever way the banking crisis is dealt with — whether the Government's inept and corrupt way or, better still, the Sinn Féin way, which involves burning bondholders through negotiation, allowing Anglo Irish Bank to go and not recapitalising the smaller banks — there will be costs incurred.  However, the costs incurred by the Sinn Féin plan will be substantially less than what is proposed by this Government.  Once the bailout is reduced——</p>

          <p eId="para_695">Once the bailout is reduced, Ireland would not need to EU or IMF intervention.  It could go back to the international bond markets to continue funding the country.  However, this time it would have a set of finance books that are honest, transparent, stabilised and with a proper working plan.  The sovereign bond markets are punishing Ireland and why would they not when bond rates are in excess of 9% in recent weeks and while the current policy of protecting all bank bondholders is in place?  These markets want to see a Government and a country that is not bound by its banking fates and fortune but is interested in securing the real economy and stabilising the banking sector where necessary in order to secure the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Our pre-budget submission shows how the Government's structural deficit can be dealt with over a period of six years.  Behind the scenes everyone is admitting it cannot be done in four years.  If the Government wants to continue playing that bluff, so be it.  The cat is well and truly out of the bag on that front.  If we had honest figures arising from a more straightforward banking resolution, we could produce a multi-annual plan that took those additional costs into account.  The Government's approach to both the structural deficit and the banking crisis is what is causing the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">I have explained the reasons the banking approach is wrong but, similarly, the structural deficit reduction plan of cutting €15 billion over four years is wrong and is making the markets nervous.  The markets do not believe it will work because history and international experience shows one cannot cut to deficit reduction.  If anything, it expands the deficit, as has been the case in Ireland over the each of past three years.  We do not have to look internationally for examples.  If cutting worked, the problem would be solved by now.  International finance markets want to see a plan that looks like it will work, not just the intensification of a policy that has failed to date and involved cutting faster and deeper with each successive budget.  The public may feel that, given the option of a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael and Labour Party bailout, the IMF and the EU looks like a better option.  It is important to point out that the bailout would just be for the benefit of the banks, not in the public interest but the taxpayer and members of society would end up paying back all the money for the bank bailout.  No matter how Fianna Fáil tries to spin it, the IMF coming to run our economy is the most shameful route for any country to take.  It is shameful because the history of the IMF is that it robs a country of economic sovereignty, imposes horrendous terms and conditions on its loans and is a reflection of a complete failure of Government and administration in the economy.  That is how it will be seen.  We want to see the Government's four-year plan, we want the Government to postpone the budget scheduled for 7 December and we want an immediate general election.  A new Government can pick up the pieces very quickly early in the new year.  That will give some level of stability to the international markets and some level of stability to our economy.  More importantly, hopefully it will provide moral and political leadership to the people of the State because they need it now more than ever, following 13 years of atrocious governance under Fianna Fáil-led Governments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_698">I have four questions initially.  Will the Minister state the protections available to Irish depositors?  The statutory guarantee is limited to €100,000.  Does the guarantee re-enacted in the House yesterday provide a guarantee to depositors of an unlimited nature?  Will the Minister set this out because people are concerned?</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Minister has a strong legal background and has acknowledged legal ability.  He is aware he is the only Cabinet Minister, apart from the Taoiseach, specifically mentioned in the Constitution and his role is enshrined in the Constitution.  Has he sought legal advice from the Attorney General on what his position will be in the process of budgetary control if in future the Minister becomes, in effect, a kind of puppet on a string for the IMF?  Has the Minister checked whether his actions could be challengeable in law if he is not carrying out his constitutional functions independently?</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Third, the trigger for this crisis, as I understand it, was the liquidity crisis in the banks.  The Irish banks had two sources of funding, depositors, money from the ECB, and money from the ECB through the Central Bank.  The risk of the flow drying up was the trigger but the reason people were losing confidence in the Irish banks was due to an underlying fear of insolvency.  Independent commentators and colleagues in Europe have moved away from the concept of recapitalising the Irish banks, which was the term we used previously in debates in the House in terms of the bank having a black hole and that we needed to recapitalise.  They are now talking about restructuring the sector.  Is the distinction in language significant?  What does the Minister understand the approach from Europe will be now to the banking sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The fourth question is for the Minister to expand on Professor Honohan's statement of this morning.  Will he try to put figures on his general statement that a loan fund of several billions on which the Government could draw was to be put in place and that the drawdowns would be conditional?  Will the Minister comment on the size of the loan and the conditionality which would be required in terms of budgetary policy?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_702">I outlined the protection for depositors at the beginning of the statement.  I restate the existence of the State guarantee.  It is not limited to the €100,000 permanent guarantee which is established in our statute law but also extends by virtue of the vote in the House yesterday evening on an unlimited basis to all deposits, be they corporate or retail.  That is an important issue.  I am pleased the Deputy mentioned it.  I welcome the constructive tone of the debate on deposits that was taken by all speakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Deputy Noonan's second question was on the constitutional position of the Government, my position, and what advices have been taken from the Attorney General in that regard.  I, personally, have not taken advice in that regard because I have not committed to anything in the process.  Preliminary advices were obtained on the ECOFIN statement by my officials to ensure that the type of short focussed dialogue which is now envisaged is permissible.  The advice was that it was permissible.  That is where the matter lies at this stage.  I will take into account the advice of the Attorney General in anything I do.  I do not sit here as a lawyer.  As I often tell Deputy Burton, I sit here as a Deputy of the Dublin West constituency.  I accept the advice of the Attorney General on legal matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">On the question of the liquidity crisis, and collateral and emergency support from the European Central Bank, again, the Deputy referred to an underlying fear of insolvency.  It is important to note what Professor Honohan said about that this morning in his interview.  He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_705">I don't think there's any question of it all going into the banks, as you put it.  Talk about the banks, it's true that the banks need additional confidence.  Our efforts, the huge sums of money that have been put in by the Government to support the banks, have not been sufficient, have not generated sufficient confidence yet.  The money is enough objectively, [That is the view of the Governor of the Central Bank.] but if the confidence isn't there, and it's partly not there because investors are concerned in general about the Government finances, and the future prospects for growth and employment.  So with the market uncertainty generally high, for the last four to five months, effectively since the end of April, I think it is desirable that the banks should have more capital, that's Government capital, ownership funds, available to show to the market, look this is beyond question.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">He made the point earlier that it would be "a large loan, because the purpose of the amount to be advanced or to be made available to be borrowed, is to show that Ireland has sufficient firepower to deal with any concerns of the market".  Professor Honohan was not suggesting that it is a bailout, in fact he deliberately repudiated the use of the word bailout.  Deputies who are fond of quoting him should take note of that.  His point was that a large contingency fund available to the State to stand behind the banking system would of itself create confidence.  He expressed the clear expectation that discussions would eventuate in such a fund.  The discussions have only commenced this morning.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">In his radio interview this morning Professor Honohan spoke about a large loan of tens of billions of euro.  He spoke of large teams of negotiators.  He said: "That's why the large technical teams are sitting down discussing these matters."  Who is the leader of the Irish team?  Is it Professor Honohan?  Does he have <i>carte blanche</i> from the Government on the negotiations?  Is he a plenipotentiary?  I accept there is a reference in the Constitution to the Minister.  Is this like Michael Collins going to London, that Professor Honohan has been sent by the Minister presumably with large teams on the Irish side as there are three large teams on the foreign side, the IMF, the ECB and the Commission?</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_710">Could the Minister tell us who is the leader of the Irish team of negotiators?  Broadly, what are their terms of reference and what is the template to which they are working?  That comes back to Deputy Noonan's previous question.  Two European funds can be accessed.  Which fund does the Minister see the teams accessing?  Presumably they are acting at his direction, or is it at the direction of the Taoiseach and his Department?  We do not know.  The Minister needs to tell the people of this country at whose direction the team is operating and which of the two European stabilisation mechanisms or stability funds they are approaching.  Most importantly, what is the likely structure?  In other words, we understand that the money is mostly for the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Is the money an actual transfer for which we incur liability and interest, which is what I understand from what Professor Honohan has said?  The Minister has used new terminology.  He has called it a contingency fund.  He often lectures me, deservedly, that there is a difference between Government accounting and ordinary financial accounting.  I accept that.  However, in ordinary financial accounting, a contingency is something that is available which one does not have to use unless it becomes necessary.  Therefore, at the most, one pays a very small fee for it and one only pays 5.5%, for example, if one draws down the funds.  What does the Minister's use of "contingency" mean in this case?  That is a genuine question to which I would like an answer.</p>

It is important that Professor Honohan's role be understood.  The Governor is independent in the performance of his functions, but he associates himself with the discussions or negotiations — I prefer the word "talks" — given his and his organisation's knowledge of the banking system.  He is also in liaison with Frankfurt.  Indeed, his interview this morning was from Frankfurt.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">No.  I will say it again.  Professor Honohan was very careful this morning to make clear that the decision in these matters rested with the Government, not himself.  He said this during the course of his interview this morning.  He was adamant on the point.  Of course he is of great assistance in these discussions and I am in constant contact with him because of his organisation's deep knowledge of the banking sector and given his participation in the work of the governing council of the European Central Bank, ECB.  Naturally and properly, he is associated with these discussions, but he is not a plenipotentiary in them.  Any result of the discussions is subject to Government approval and the conduct of the negotiations is subject to my direction.  That is the position in respect of the discussions themselves.  It is important that it be understood.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">Regarding the question on contingencies, Professor Honohan clearly pointed out this morning that what he envisaged was the assembling of a large fund that would demonstrate that adequate firepower is behind the banking system.  Naturally and correctly, there have been many political charges today, but there have also been many constructive contributions by Members from all sides of the House regarding the concerns discussions of this type bring, for example, concerns about adding to the burden of the national debt and about the workability of any strategy that is adopted to put confidence into the banking system.  For this reason, one needs technical discussions.  It is important that these technical issues be worked through.  In the passage I quoted to Deputy Noonan, Professor Honohan made the point that the money already put into the banks is enough objectively but, if the confidence is not there — according to him, it is not there partly because of Government finances and general economic factors — it is desirable that there be a demonstration effect in terms of what capital is available to the banks.  This is an issue the technical teams will examine.  The Government cannot possibly sign off on such a concept without this technical work being done in the first instance.  I very much——</p>

If the banks needed €20 billion, for example, they were sourcing it at 1.5% until the ECB called a halt, but we may now pay 4.5% or 5% for it.  Is this the position?</p>

As such, it has advanced substantial sums into the Irish banking system to ensure the system's stability.  I do not want to anticipate the technical discussions, but the State is not being put in a position in these discussions of becoming a lender of last resort, since it is not a central bank.  The issue that will be explored in these discussions is the very one identified by the Governor this morning, namely, whether a contingency fund can be established to demonstrate in terms of capital the robustness and indestructibility of the institutions.  This is one of the issues that arises.</p>

I understand that one of the issues in focus in the discussions was identified by Professor Honohan this morning, namely, the question of providing a contingency capital fund that can stand behind the banks as distinct from liquidity.</p>

Deputy Burton quoted from Professor Honohan's report.  I, too, have quoted from that report.  I accepted that the Governor had reservations about some of the categories included in the guarantee.  It is important to note that the category of subordinated debt about which he expressed a specific reservation was one in respect of which no principal payments were made by Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide Building Society.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_850">He accepted that a broad guarantee was necessary and he painted a picture of the devastation that would have ensued if we followed the advice of Deputy Burton and the Labour Party.  The Governor said there would have been additional lost income and unemployment, amounting to tens of billions of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The euro group statement on Tuesday welcomed the significant measures the Government has taken and endorsed this short and focused consultation now underway between the Irish authorities and the Commission, the ECB and IMF to determine the best way to provide any necessary support to address market risks, especially as regards the banking sector in the context of the four year budgetary plan and the upcoming budget.  I welcome many of the contributions in this respect from the other side of the House in the context of the legitimate concerns they raised in regard to exposure of the taxpayer, the nature of the interest rate that might apply to any such arrangement and the nature of the collateral support which will continue to become available from the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">The purpose of the technical discussions which begin today is to assess how it may be possible to build on the significant interventions already undertaken.  As I said on 30 September, the introduction of a special resolution regime will be a powerful tool for securing the necessary restructuring of the Irish banking system for the future.  Such a regime is not necessarily a panacea for all ills.  Discussions are ongoing at EU and international level on the measures that may be available in the future to share the costs of bank resolution with senior creditors of banks other than depositors.  However, the recent widening in Irish bond spreads, in response to speculation regarding burden sharing, proves the importance of exercising caution in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Deputy Noonan appeared earlier to be surprised at this part of my speech.  The Deputy must not have been listening.  He is normally a good listener.  I have spoken several times in this House about the work underway for a special resolution mechanism and referred in my statement of 30 September last to burden sharing by holders of subordinated debt in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  We need to be cautious.  We know the unsettling impact of the recent references in Europe to the prospect of burden sharing, and as such we need to exercise care in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">On corporation tax, which was mentioned in several contributions, I have on many different occasions made clear to the European authorities that our 12.5% rate of corporation tax is an important arm of our industrial policy.  As a peripheral member state, it is our industrial policy.  It is a key element in our growth model.  It is clear to all that growth will be essential in improving our longer term debt stability.  That is the position under the treaties.  It is also the case that it is an essential policy to sustain economic growth in the future.  I am satisfied, based on preliminary discussions I have had earlier this week, that this is a view shared by many of the parties to these discussions.</p>

        <speech by="#PatCarey" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Equality_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_501">
          <from>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
          <p eId="para_856">Ar an gcéad dul síos, is mór agam an deis seo a fháil labhairt anseo sa Dáil inniu ar an ábhar seo.  Don gcéad uair riamh ó bunaíodh an Stát, tá plean gníomhaíochta fadtéarmach ann chun fís an Rialtais don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm faoin straitéis 20 bliain.  Faoin bplean cuimsitheach náisiúnta seo, beidh cur chuige córasach ann le cinntiú go bhfuil an Stát, na heagraíochtaí teanga agus an pobal ag obair as lámha a chéile ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Creideann an Rialtas go bhfuil tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an nGaeilge do mhuintir, do shochaí agus do chultúr na hÉireann.  Mar theanga labhartha phobail, tá an Ghaeilge áirithe ar cheann de na teangacha is sine ar domhan atá fós beo.  Ach sa lá atá inniu ann, tá sí áirithe ag UNESCO mar theanga a bhfuil stádas leochaileach aici.  Má chailltear teanga, aithnítear go bhfuil sé ionann is dodhéanta í a athbheochan.  Cé gur deacair a mhaíomh go bhféadfadh aon straitéis rialtais aon teanga a shlánú, tá bun-chloch leagtha amach faoin straitéis 20 bliain le cinntiú go mairfidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga bheo le tacaíocht ón Stát.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Mar is eol don Teach, bhí go leor obair ullmhúcháin ag baint le dréachtú agus le haontú na straitéise.  D'eascair an straitéis as ráiteas an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge a foilsíodh sa bhliain 2006, inar dhearbhaigh an Rialtas a thacaíocht d'fhorbairt agus do chaomhnú na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  Leagadh síos go soiléir faoin ráiteas sin an bhun-chloch ar a bhfuil polasaí Gaeilge an Rialtais bunaithe.  Is minic a dúradh roimhe sin, áfach, nach raibh aon phlean uileghabhálach ag an Stát don Ghaeilge, in ainneoin na hinfheistíochta ar fad atá déanta ag an Stát i mbuanú agus i sealbhú na Gaeilge thar na blianta.  Is chun dul i ngleic leis an scéal sin gur chinn an Rialtas an straitéis 20 bliain a fhorbairt.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Ar ndóigh, bhí sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go gcuirfí a leithéid de straitéis i dtoll a chéile i gcomhar leis an bpobal gur leo an teanga.  Dá bhrí sin, tugadh faoi phróiseas comhairliúcháin poiblí chun deis a thabhairt do phobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta, chomh maith leis an bpobal i gcoitinne a bhfuil suim acu sa teanga, a rian a fhágáil ar an straitéis.  Eagraíodh cruinnithe poiblí ar fud na tíre, sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, chun deis a thabhairt do dhaoine a dtuairimí a thabhairt.  Ina theannta sin, chuamar i gcomhairle le páirtithe leasmhara na teanga, idir eagraíochtaí Gaeilge, Gaeltachta, cultúrtha, spóirt agus araile.  Fad is a bhí an obair chomhairliúcháin ar siúl, rinne meitheal de shaineolaithe idirnáisiúnta anailís ar staid na Gaeilge, faoi stiúir Fiontar DCU.  Ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de, tugadh aird ar leith ar na moltaí a rinneadh sa Staidéar Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, a ullmhaíodh i gcomhar le hAcadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge de chuid Ollscoil na hÉireann Gaillimh.  Ag an am céanna, bhí coiste Rialtais, faoi chathaoirleacht an Taoisigh, ag déanamh breithniú ar na moltaí a d'éirigh as taighde acadúil agus ón bpróiseas comhairliúcháin poiblí.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Cuireadh an dréacht-straitéis a d'eascair as an bpróiseas seo faoi bhráid an Chomhchoiste um Ghnóthaí Turasóireachta, Cultúir, Spóirt, Pobail, Comhionannais agus Gaeltachta i mí na Samhna 2009.  Bhí cruinnithe ag an gcomhchoiste le páirtithe leasmhara na Gaeilge, san áireamh cruinniú a reáchtáladh sa Ghaeltacht.  I ndiaidh na gcruinnithe seo, d'fhoilsigh an comhchoiste tuarascáil i mí lúil na bliana seo ina raibh 37 moladh inti.  Ó shin i leith, pléadh na moltaí sin leis na Ranna Rialtais éagsúla agus tá siad tógtha san áireamh de réir mar is cuí sa cháipéis chríochnúil den straitéis.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an gcoiste, leis an gCathaoirleach, An Teachta Tomás Ó Ceit, leis an Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú, a bhí mar Chathaoirleach ar an bhfochoiste, agus leis na baill eile as ucht a ndúthracht i dtaca leis an straitéis.  Tá sé ráite ag an gCathaoirleach i dtuarascáil an chomhchoiste go bhfuil an straitéis ar cheann de na céimeanna is suntasaí i bpleanáil teanga an Stáit le 90 bliain anuas agus go mbraitheann todhchaí na Gaeilge ar an nGaeltacht, áit a bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar phríomh-theanga an phobail.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Go deimhin, is mór an t-éacht é go bhfuil an Ghaeilge fós á labhairt mar theanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht i bhfianaise an bhrú atá uirthi ó ghach aon taobh.  Is sna Gaeltachtaí a maireann teanga shaibhir ár sinsear ach ní mór a bheith airdeallach faoina todhchaí mar theanga phobail.  Tá fianaise sa Staidéar Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht go bhfuil an chontúirt ann go mbeidh an Ghaeilge sínte ar leac an bháis mar theanga phobail mura ndéantar beart de réir briathair láithreach bonn, ach go háirithe i measc an aosa óig sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá úsáid an Bhéarla i réim i ngréasáin shóisialta na n-óg, fiú sna ceantair is láidre Gaeltachta.  Léiríonn an staidéar teangeolaíoch go bhfuil bearna mhór idir dearcadh agus cumas Gaeilge daoine óga sa Ghaeltacht agus an leas a bhaineann siad as an teanga ar bhonn laethúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Deirtear sa staidéar teangeolaíoch gurb é an teaghlach a chruthaíonn an cainteoir dúchais ach gurb é an teacht le chéile i measc an phobail a chinnteoidh forbairt agus buanú na teanga don gcéad ghlúin eile.  Léiríonn fíric lom sa staidéar teangeolaíoch nach bhfuil ach idir 15 agus 20 bliain fágtha mar shaolré ag an nGaeilge mar theanga theaghlaigh agus phobail sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá mo Roinnse ag dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin seo le tionscadail ar nós scéim na gcampaí samhraidh agus scéim na gcúntóirí teanga.  Is cinnte go dtógfaidh an straitéis 20 bliain ar an mbunchloch sin i gcomhar le pobal na Gaeltachta.  Is tobar inspioráide, líofachta agus saibhris teanga atá sa Ghaeltacht do phobal labhartha Gaeilge na tíre agus is tacaíocht don Ghaeltacht atá sa phobal níos leithne de chainteoirí Gaeilge.  Mar a deir an seanfhocal: "Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine".  Faoin Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge, is ar scáth a chéile a shlánófar an teanga.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Tá uair na cinniúna tagtha anois ó thaobh na straitéise de.  Ag an gcruinniú den choiste Rialtais faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht inné, aontaíodh an straitéis chríochnúil.  Is í an chéad chéim eile ná an straitéis a chur os comhair an Rialtais le ceadú, agus, ach í a bheith ceadaithe, í a fhoilsiú go foirmiúil ansin.  Mar Aire, táimse ag súil go gcuirfear na bearta sin i gcrích go luath.  Ina dhiaidh sin, beidh tábhacht ach go háirithe ag baint le tréimhse bhunaithe na straitéise ina mbeidh na struchtúir eagraíochta agus oibríochta le cur ar bun.  Tá sé riachtanach a chinntiú go mbeidh bunchloch mhaith faoin straitéis sula gcuirtear tús leis an tréimhse fheidhmithe.  Mar an phríomh-Roinn Rialtais a bhfuil cúraimí uirthi sa réimse seo, beidh mo Roinnse freagrach as maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar an bpróiseas pleanála straitéise.  Beidh ról ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, mar an phríomh-ghníomhaireacht feidhmithe, a bheidh freagrach as an straitéis a sheachadadh.  Chomh maith leis sin, leanfaidh Foras na Gaeilge ag seachadadh a chuid freagrachtaí reachtúla maidir leis an nGaeilge ar bhonn uile-oileánda.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I bhfianaise na géarchéime eacnamaíochta reatha, caithfear a aithint go bhfuil srian leis na hacmhainní gur féidir a dháileadh don straitéis faoi láthair.  Cé nach aon áibhéil a rá go bhfuilimid ag maireachtáil in aimsir dhúshlánach, is deis atá ann freisin breathnú go fuarchúiseach ar na hacmhainní atá leithdháilte don Ghaeilge san am i láthair sa chaoi is gur féidir a chinntiú go bhfuil an leas is fearr bainte astu agus go bhfuil an luach is fearr ar airgead faighte uathu.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Deirtear gur beatha teanga í a labhairt.  Cé gur féidir leis an gcóras Stáit iliomad gníomhartha a thógáil ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge, ag deireadh an lae is faoin bpobal atá sé í a labhairt.  Faoin straitéis 20 bliain, is gá don Stát, do na heagraíochtaí deonacha agus don bpobal obair as lámha a chéile ar mhaithe le buanú na teanga.  Sa chomhthéacs seo, tá ról ag gach rannóg Stáit agus ag páirtithe leasmhara na Gaeilge i normalú na teanga sa tsochaí lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus i dtacaíocht a thabhairt do chaomhnú na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail agus mar theanga theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  Léiríonn an daonáireamh go bhfuil cumas áirithe i labhairt na Gaeilge ag 42% de dhaonra na hÉireann agus léiríonn suirbhéanna éagsúla go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach i leith ár bpríomh-theanga náisiúnta ag sciar suntasach den daonra.  Tugann an straitéis 20 bliain deis don Stát tógáil ar an dea-thoil agus ar an dearcadh dearfach i leith na teanga atá neadaithe i measc an phobail go ginearálta.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta ó thaobh na ndeiseanna atá ar fáil don bpobal an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus iad ag plé leis an gcóras Stáit.  Tá feabhas tagtha ar chúrsaí mar thoradh ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a leagann dualgais reachtúla ar chomhlachtaí poiblí seirbhísí i nGaeilge a sholáthar don bpobal.  Tuigeann comhlachtaí poiblí anois gur ann do phobal na Gaeilge agus gur mian leo leas a bhaint as seirbhísí i nGaeilge ach iad a bheith ar fáil ón Stát.  Ar ndóigh, ní fiú seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a bheith ar fáil mura mbíonn éileamh orthu.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbaineann lucht labhartha na Gaeilge leas as na deiseanna atá ann faoin Acht Teanga agus seirbhísí trí Ghaeilge a éileamh ón Státchóras.  Tá ról lárnach ag na heagraíochtaí deonacha atá ag feidhmiú ar son na Gaeilge in úsáid leanúnach a bhaint as na seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge atá curtha ar fáil cheana féin ag comhlachtaí poiblí agus chomh maith leis sin chun pobal labhartha na Gaeilge a spreagadh leis na seirbhísí sin a úsáid agus tuilleadh a éileamh.  Ná bíodh sé le rá ag comhlachtaí poiblí go bhfuil seirbhísí á gcur ar fáil gan éileamh ar bith orthu.  Sin an dúshlán atá romhainn uilig inniu.  Tá sé mar sprioc ag an straitéis líon na ndaoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge gach lá lasmuigh den chóras oideachais a mhéadú ón bhfigiúr reatha de 83,000 duine go 250,000 duine as seo go ceann 20 bliain.  Maidir leis an nGaeltacht, tá sé mar sprioc ag an straitéis líon na gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge a mhéadú freisin.  Is é an cur chuige faoin straitéis ná go mbeidh creatlach thacaíochta ann chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh go nádúrtha ó ghlúin go glúin laistigh den teaghlach agus den bpobal.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis seo i gcomhthéacs na Gaeltachta.  Leanann úsáid teanga as cumas, deis agus dearcadh dearfach i leith na teanga.  Dá bhrí sin, tá cur chuige an Rialtais faoin straitéis dírithe ach go háirithe ar chumas an phobail sa teanga a fheabhsú, ar na deiseanna úsáidte teanga atá ag an bpobal a mhéadú agus ar dhearcadh dearfach i leith na Gaeilge a chothú.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Ós rud é go sealbhaítear an teanga tríd an gcóras oideachais go príomha lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht, tá tábhacht ar leith ag baint leis an ról atá ag múinteoirí agus ag scoileanna i bhfeasacht teanga.  Caithfidh an córas oideachais a bheith i gceartlár an aonaigh chun an cumas teanga i measc an phobail a ghiniúint ar a bhfuil an straitéis bunaithe.  Sa chomhthéacs seo, cabhraíonn na céimeanna atá glactha ag an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna chun na marcanna do chumas labhartha sa Ghaeilge a mhéadú sa teastas sóisearach agus san ardteistiméireacht.  Is léir, áfach, go bhfuil sé riachtanach úsáid na Gaeilge lasmuigh de gheataí na scoile a mhéadú.  Aithnítear sa straitéis an ról atá ag na coláistí samhraidh chun daoine óga a spreagadh leis an nGaeilge a úsáid.  Is é seo ceann de na scéimeanna is tábhachtaí atá á riar ag mo Roinnse.  I mbliana d'fhreastail beagnach 25,000 foghlaimeoir ar na coláistí samhraidh.  Ní hamháin go gcabhraíonn na coláistí samhraidh leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn i measc an aosa óig ar fud na tíre, ach is infheistíocht shuntasach iad san eacnamaíocht áitiúil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Mar is eol don Teach, tá an tír ar an ngannchuid ó thaobh acmhainní airgeadais de.  Ní cóir é seo a úsáid, áfach, mar chonstaic in éadan cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise.  Is fiú cuimhneamh go bhfuil dea-thoil an phobail i leith na Gaeilge chomh tábhachtach céanna is atá acmhainní airgeadais.  In éagmais dhea-thoil an phobail, is beag a d'fhéadfaí a chur i gcrích go héifeachtach.  Is tuar dóchais don todhchaí í an tacaíocht tras-pháirtí a tugadh don straitéis sna díospóireachtaí Dála agus Seanaid go dtí seo.  Dá bhrí sin, tá dóchas láidir agam go mbeidh cur i bhfeidhm na straitéise as seo go ceann 20 bliain mar thosaíocht Rialtais, beag beann ar cibé páirtí nó páirtithe a bheidh i gcumhacht le linn na tréimhse sin.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire.  Cuirim fáilte roimhe go dtí an Dáil inniu.  Tá ard-mheas agam ar Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, na gaelscoileanna agus na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge eile ar fud na tíre.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine a thug cabhair dom le déanaí.  Tá mé ag obair leis na heagraíochtaí chun an plean 20 bliain a chur chun cinn.  Tá go leor rudaí i gceist sa straitéis, ar nós cursaí oideachais, an Ghaeltacht, an Ghaeilge sa bhaile, riaracháin seirbhísí don bpobal agus teicneolaíocht.  Tá an liosta fada.  Caithfimid tacaíocht a thabhairt d'oideachas trí Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.  Déanfar athstruchtúrú ar Údarás na Gaeltachta mar ghníomhaireacht náisiúnta Gaeilge.  Tá Fine Gael ag tabhairt lán-tacaíochta don straitéis.  Creideann Fine Gael gur chóir athruithe móra a dhéanamh sa chóras oideachais.  Ba cheart béim mhór a chur ar an nGaeilge sa chóras.  Tá gá le dearcadh dearfach nua ar an nGaeilge sa chóras oideachais sa todhchaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Tá scéim phíolótach agam le haghaidh Oileán Chliara.  Chuaigh mé go dtí an oileán sa samhradh.  Labhair mé le muintir an oileáin.  Tá siad an-mhaith.  Tá iarrachtaí éagsúla i gceist sa scéim phíolótach seo.  Táimid ag iarraidh an teanga a chur chun cinn ar Oiléan Chliara.  If I may say so, is é seo an bealach chun cinn le haghaidh na céadta míle daoine, cosúil liom, nach bhfuil ach cúpla focal acu.  Tá súil agam go gcabhróidh an scéim phíolótach le turasóireacht ar an oileán.  Beidh eolas ag turasóirí faoi nósanna, cultúr agus oidhreacht an oileáin.  Ta mé ag foghlaim Gaeilge.

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_504">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_873">Nuair a bhí mé ar scoil, buachaill dána ab ea mé.  Is buachaill maith mé inniu, maybe.  I will refer to the strategy, which aims to increase the numbers of daily speakers of Irish from 83,000 to 250,000, which I welcome.  I thank the Minister for his support for the strategy over the past few months and we should look at the retention of Irish as a compulsory subject from primary to leaving certificate level.  We have views on that in Fine Gael but we will work together within the strategy to achieve a common good with all involved agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I have visited gaelscoileanna and met with various organisations.  We must develop an all-Irish education at secondary level to meet demand.  We must support preschool education in Irish and there should be support for the Gaeltacht summer colleges.  They have carried out significant work over the years and if we can open up such areas, we could get different people to attend those colleges.  Support for those colleges must remain.  There should also be support for the Gaeltacht and Irish courses abroad, which have been popular.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I enjoyed meeting with representatives from various organisations, I have gone to Clare Island and I have also met a group from Carrigaholt in Kilrush.  Those people are very anxious for their position to be recognised.  It was wonderful to meet such people, with some returning from the United States, England and Poland, learning our national language.  That is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">My brief as spokesperson for community, equality and Gaeltacht affairs is varied but I am pleased that it includes responsibility for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  I see it as an opportunity to represent the views of residents of the Gaeltacht, the Irish-speaking population and equally those who like myself, who would like to use the language daily but sadly do not have the confidence in our ability to do so as yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">We can consider that only 4% of Irish speakers, or roughly 72,000 people, use the language daily outside the classroom; we undoubtedly have a problem in the way we perceive Irish, and the engagement with the spoken language should be increased.  The Irish language is not just the realm or property of those who speak it on a daily basis and my role is not simply to represent those who speak it fluently.  My role is to try to bring about a renewed interest in the language and to do my utmost to put forward proposals which I believe will bring about that revival.  If we are to truly embrace a renewed interest and use of the language, the first step must be to accept that a small proportion of Irish people can speak the language fluently and those who cannot speak it should not be criticised or ridiculed.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">They should be encouraged.  I do not believe the measure of an individual's commitment or passion for the revival of the language is solely linked to proficiency, and I suggest this is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">In the past five months, my views of all involved have been very positive.  People have been very supportive and understanding.  I again thank Conradh na Gaeilge and Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, the gaelscoileanna and all the other organisations for the support they have given me.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Fine Gael broadly supports the goals of the strategy in aiming to deliver a greater engagement with the Irish language but we believe a resurgence of the language must be brought about through real reform in our education system.  The strategy is relatively low on targets and there are no clear indications as to what it will cost or when it will be implemented.  As the Minister noted, progressing the strategy would appear to be completely at odds with what the Government is actually doing in this area.  The capital investment programme has been slashed, which will undoubtedly have an impact on the possibility of delivering on the strategy's objectives.  The Údarás elections have been postponed for at least two years, with the perception that this is denying the people of the Gaeltacht their right to democratic representation.  While the Minister clarified this to an extent, the people of the Gaeltacht are worried these have not taken place.  Overall, I hope this report does not end up on the shelf, gathering dust, as many reports have.  The Minister has my full commitment to working with him to implement the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The greater focus on spoken Irish at secondary level is important.  We know students can pass their leaving certificate but they cannot speak Irish proficiently.  Nonetheless, there is renewed interest, particularly in Belfast and across Northern Ireland.  I note that Sinn Féin, with other agencies, had a huge role in promoting the Irish language in those areas.  We can learn much from this.  There are many people who would like to get involved in various classes and the strategy is available in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The draft was finally published in November 2007 and I want it brought to fruition in the coming few days.  There will be a restructuring of Údarás na Gaeltachta and support for Forás na Gaeilge, and the possibility of Údarás na Gaeltachta carrying out functions through Irish for other public bodies inside and outside the Gaeltacht will be investigated.  I would be happy to see the remit of Údarás extended outside the Gaeltacht areas, which is not a threat but an opportunity.  Somebody needs to lead and Údarás, with other agencies, can do so.  Most people are anxious that we do the right thing and the 20-year strategy is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">With regard to the use of media and technology to support the Irish language, there are many innovative ways in which this can be done.  I have received e-mails and texts in Irish.  Texts are handy, and perhaps a thought for the day in Irish would be a good idea as we all use texts as well as e-mails.  I would welcome an increase in licence fee revenue towards TG4 and away from RTE.  Since I took over my role, I have watched TG4 more often and know it is a wonderful tool that is broadcast into every home.  TG4's programming on sports and the arts has been wonderful.  If it has a difficulty with finance, there should be a means of diverting licence fee revenue away from RTE and towards TG4.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">There needs to be improvement in the type and availability of dictionaries in Irish.  While I can access some information online, I must still use the same dictionaries I had when I was at school, so improvement in this area should be considered.  There are also issues with regard to the think tank, the portal site, the digitisation programme and the EU, where huge inroads have been made in regard to recognition for the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">We are all in this together.  Much work has been done and I pay tribute to my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, particularly the man I call my spokesperson on the Gaeltacht, Deputy Dinny McGinley of Donegal South-West.  He has been a great proponent of the language and has worked closely with the Minister.  I miss him today as he is canvassing for a major event next week.  My party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, is a fluent Irish speaker whose children attend the gaelscoil in Tourmakeady.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">I pay a special word of thanks to the gaelscoileanna throughout the country, which have provided the way forward for many children.  When I visited Roscommon some weeks ago, it was wonderful to see in operation a holistic education through the Irish language, involving children, teachers and parents.  It is the way forward and the Minister should consider providing more facilities to the gaelscoileanna.  There is a difficulty in regard to the Gaelscoil in Ratoath, County Meath, where more funding is called for, and I hope to visit it shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">We hope to meet in the new year with Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and the other groups involved, with a view to seeing how we can implement the 20-year strategy.  I speak on behalf of the 450,000 people who wish they had better Irish, for one reason or another.  There is a new opportunity and a new willingness, and the strategy is very welcome.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_888">Tá áthas orm labhairt sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo mar gheall ar an tuarascáil a tháinig ó Chomhchoiste um Gnóthaí Turarsóireachta, Cultúir, Spóirt, Pobail, Comhionannais agus Gaeltachta ar an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Ba mhaith liom díriú ar roinnt de na moltaí; ní féidir dul trid na moltaí go léir i ndíospóireacht mar seo.  An ceathrú moladh ná forbairt geilleagar agus bonneagar na Gaeltachta a fhágáil mar phríomhchúram Údarás na Gaeltachta, nó na Gaeilge, cibé acu a bheidh ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Labhair an tAire faoin sprioc atá ann go mbeidh ceathrú milliúin ag baint úsáide as an nGaeilge ar bhonn dátheangach.  Nuair a bunaíodh an Stát ní raibh Gaeltachtaí againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Bhí 250,000 sna ceantair sin agus iad ag labhairt na Gaeilge mar ghnáth teanga.  Táim amhrasach maidir leis an bhfigiúr a tháinig ón daonáireamh de 83,000 daoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge go laethúil.  An cheist atá sa daonáireamh ná: "An bhfuil aon Ghaeilge agat?"  Bheadh freagra amháin agamsa agus freagra eile ag daoine eile ar sin, mar nílimid ag tomhas an rud céanna.  An rud is tábhachtaí faoin moladh a léigh mé amach ón tuarascáil ná go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht thar a bheith tábhachtach, mar is í an áit ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge bheo.  Ach i ndeireadh na dála, ní féidir an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo muna mbíonn poist ar fáil sa Ghaeltacht agus muna mbíonn ar chumas daoine sa Ghaeltacht slí beatha a bhaint amach ar aon dul le daoine in aon cheantar eile den tír.  Tá gá mar sin le eagras a bheith ann chun forbairt tionscalaíochta agus fostaíochta a chur ar aghaidh sa Ghaeltacht.  Sin an chéad mholadh gur mhaith liom rud a rá faoi.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Baineann moladh 22 le dearbhú a chur sa straitéis nach mbainfidh polasaí dhátheangach leis an Ghaeltacht agus nach gcuirfear i bhfeidhm sa nGaeltacht é.  Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachach do pháistí na Gaeltachta go mbeidh an Bhéarla acu, agus go mbeidh sé gach pioc chomh maith acu agus ag aon dalta eile sa tír.  An rud atá i gceist leis an moladh, agus aontaím leis, ná má cheapann muintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil iachall orthu labhairt go dhátheangach, nach láidreoidh sin an Ghaeilge.  Ar an lámh eile, bhíodh daoine ag imeacht ón nGaeltacht fadó, cuirim i gcás daoine a théadh thall go Sasana chun fostaíocht a fháil, agus ní raibh caighdeán maith go leor acu sa Bhéarla.  Buíochas le Dia, tá an t-am sin thart.  Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh caighdeán sa Bhéarla ag muintir na Gaeltachta atá gach pioc chomh maith leis an gcaighdeán in áit ar bith eile sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">I will speak in English now because one of the things that troubles me with regard to the 20 year strategy is that people do not know about it.  The vast majority of people are not aware of the strategy, which I fully support.  The Government is to be complimented for providing an overall strategy for the language.  I have long been critical that no strategy has been in place and there has been no framework within which to work with clearly defined objectives.  This strategy is now in place but, ultimately, the most important issue is driving the strategy.  If people are unaware of it in the first instance then how can they engage with it?  We all agree there is a large measure of soft support for the Irish language among the public but we must convert this into something more active and we must arrange for the people to engage and develop a sense of ownership for the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">There is an issue with regard to the public mood at present.  People are without hope in many cases and are concerned about where the country is headed.  In the days ahead this will probably unravel in a more meaningful way inasmuch as people will receive much-needed clarification.  The uncertainty is pushing them down and never before has it been more important for people's self-esteem to be lifted.  Undoubtedly, part of this self-esteem relates to who we are, what we are, what we can be proud of and what makes us unique.  The Irish language forms a significant part of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Mention has been made of seeking to revive the language but I am unsure whether that is an accurate way of describing what the objective should be.  The language has not developed organically in a long time but we should seek to place an emphasis on language development.  Language develops where language is used.  I did not always hold this view in my teaching days but my attitude with regard to simplifying language has changed in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The Minister will recall from his teaching days the teaching of the tuiseal ginideach and the considerable difficulties that came with this, including, for example, those associated with the irregular verbs or na briathra neamhrialta, of which there are 13.  Other languages have many more but they have become irregular verbs because they are used most.  These are very confusing for children.  We should seek to simplify these and remove obstacles to children learning the language.  The process for learning the language involves hearing it first and most children hear Irish for the first time in school.  We do not have what we used to call the "timpeallacht cainte" outside the school.  Na Naíonraí Gaelacha serve a significant role in this regard.  One hears a language, then one speaks it, reads it and, finally, one writes it.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I recall from my teacher training days that we were told that a child's capacity to absorb a language is in decline from age five onwards.  The early years are very important.  Having the timpeallacht cainte in place is very important.  Perhaps, it does not suit every child because many children grow up in an environment where the language environment in the English language is not sufficient to move them through the education system as it becomes more involved with language and terminology.  That is a significant issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">We should concentrate on survival and protect the joy in learning the language.  It can be an enriching and exciting experience.  Many people have a considerable store of Irish words which may be somewhere in the sub-conscious from when they were in school.  People absorb Irish language words from the media as well.  Certain Irish words are also used in ordinary spoken English.  Some years ago, I carried out an interesting exercise.  I examined an English language dictionary based on the English spoken in Newfoundland, Canada.  It was remarkable how many Irish words were in the vocabulary, including some we have stopped using but which remain in the vocabulary there.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">There is a remarkable richness and a remarkable degree of vocabulary to be picked up from place names.  It is also possible to learning about an area, its history and so on.  However, the most important message which should come from the Oireachtas and this debate is the importance of encouraging people to use whatever Irish they have, regardless of how little it is, and to seek to create an environment whereby we encourage one another.  If I know somewhat more than the next person I should help that person along.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The Minister will recall there have been occasions in the past when some people believed it was their duty to correct people who were making a valiant effort to speak Irish.  I believe this has diminished greatly but there remains a need to encourage one another.  Sometimes the view is taken that all the emphasis should be directed towards the next generation, younger people and people who already have Irish.  However, it is very important not to forget about those who have a certain amount of Irish, who are favourable toward the development of their Irish and of the use of Irish generally and in a bilingual since.  We must transmit that message.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">One fundamental aspect for the success of the strategy is the need to place the responsibility for driving it with the Taoiseach's office.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">That is absolutely vital.  One of the recommendations of the strategy is that at the beginning of each year there should be a report on what has happened in the previous year, what the objectives were, to what extent they were achieved, whether any difficulties were experienced, and how these might be addressed.  It should also contain a new programme for the coming year.  A strategy is a broadly based outline which needs to be broken down into programmes and achievable objectives.  To confer upon the Taoiseach's office the responsibility for driving the strategy would lead to much better co-ordination.  In addition, the Taoiseach answers parliamentary questions in the House two days a week, which would allow Deputies and party leaders to ask questions about the strategy if they so desired.  Equally, written questions could be tabled.  This would result in continued engagement by the Oireachtas with the language, which, in its own way, would filter through to the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">We need to consider what is being achieved currently.  We are spending fairly substantial amounts on the Irish language.  Dr. Ed Walsh recently offered a figure — I do not know from where it came — of €1.2 billion spent annually on the teaching of Irish in our schools.  That is a considerable amount.  The Coimisinéir Teanga, with whom I was in contact about this issue, provided an estimate in 2005, and he told me how he had calculated it.  His figure for spending on Irish in the school system was €500 million, which is still a considerable amount.  I emphasise, as did the Coimisinéir Teanga, that we are talking about an opportunity cost.  In other words, if our spending on the Irish language were reduced——</p>

          <p eId="para_905">I am sorry I do not have more time to develop this point.  Ultimately, we need to consider everything we are spending on the Irish language and ask ourselves whether this is the best way to spend it and whether it could be better spent another way.  Where we are spending money — I have my own views on this, as the Minister knows — and the objective is not being achieved, we should stop spending that money and put it somewhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I welcome the report and compliment the sub-committee on it.  I have discussed a small number of the recommendations.  I believe it is important to drive the strategy.  The recommendation that the Coimisinéir Teanga should have a role in monitoring and reporting on developments is important.  The role of estimating how much we are spending on the language and how successful it is could be given in the first instance to the ESRI, perhaps in conjunction with the Coimisinéir Teanga.</p>

Is trua é nach bhfuilimid ag déileáil le rún chun tacaíocht iomlán a thabhairt don méid a dúirt an comhchoiste.  Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuilimid ag caint ní hamháin faoin dréachtpholasaí ach faoi thuairisc an chomhchoiste freisin.  D'aithin an comhchoiste fadhbanna leis an dréachtpholasaí, chomh maith le réimsí inar theip ar an Rialtas dul fada go leor.  In ainneoin mo ghearán nach bhfuilimid ag déileáil le rún, tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an t-Aire go huile agus go hiomlán leis na moltaí atá sa tuairisc lena bhfuilimid ag plé faoi lathair.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé deacair don Rialtas a leithéid a dhéanamh anois agus arís.  D'fhoilsíodh an tuairisc trí mhí go leith ó shin.  Is leor ama é sin chun déileáil le haon tuairisc agus aitheantas a thabhairt dos na moltaí atá inti.  Sa chás seo, tá sé in am don Rialtas cinneadh a dhéanamh ar cad go díreach a tharlóidh maidir leis na 36 moltaí a rinne a chomhchoiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">D'fhéadfainn bheith diúltach amach is amach faoin straitéis seo.  Déanfaidh mé iarracht é sin a sheachaint.  Bhíomar anseo go minic cheana.  Ní hé seo an chéad uair gur foilsíodh straitéis, nó go raibh an Rialtas ag maíomh go ndéanfaí rud éigin chun an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a tharrtháil.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an t-Aire anseo agus gur aithin sé go bhfuil géarchéim i gceist sa chomhthéacs seo.  Is í an fhadhb atá againn ná go bhfuil na deacrachtaí seo aitheanta le blianta fada, ach níl éinne faoi dheifir chun déileáil leo.  Tá iomarca ama caite againn ag plé leis an nGaeilge gan aon toradh air go dtí seo.  Dúirt an t-Aire gur éacht é go bhfuil an Ghaeilge againn go fóill.  Má chreideann sé é sin, agus gur ceist phráinneach í an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht a tharrtháil, caithfidh sé fuadar a chur faoi na moltaí sa straitéis 20 bliain agus i dtuairisc an chomhchoiste.  Is féidir roinnt dóibh a dhéanamh gan reachtaíocht — is athrú meoin atá i gceist.  Is féidir é sin a dhéanamh cuíosach éasca laistigh den Státchóras.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Ní gá dom ach a lua gur féidir linn níos mó a dhéanamh sa Dáil chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Tá sé sin ráite agam ó thoghadh mé i 2002.  Tá mé ag moladh ón uair sin go mbeadh na Billí a thagann os comhair na Dála ar fáil i nGaeilge ó thús, mar a tharlaíonn i bParlaimintí dátheangacha eile.  Cabhródh sé sin liom agus le haon Teachta eile atá ag iarraidh reachtaíocht a phlé trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Ní cheart go mbainfeadh fadhb ar bith leis an moladh sin.  Tarlaíonn sé anois is arís ach sa chuid is mó, ní tharlaíonn sé.  Mar thoradh ar sin, tá sé níos deacra dom mo chuid oibre a dhéanamh sa Dáil trí Ghaeilge amháin nó go dátheangach.  Bíonn orm casadh ar an mBéarla.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Roinnt blianta ó sin, scríobh mé leasuithe i nGaeilge ar Bhille a bhí i mBéarla.  Dúradh liom nach raibh na húdaráis sásta glacadh leo — bhí orm iad a aistriú ar ais go Béarla, in ainneoin nach rabhadar i mBéarla sa chéad dul síos.  Is é sin chomh seafóideach is atá an Státchóras, atá bunaithe le tréimhse fada de bhlianta.  Nuair a bunaíodh an Stát ar an gcéad dul síos, bhí post mar Aire Gaeilge le líonadh sa Rialtas.  Tamall ina dhiaidh sin, cuireadh post mar Aire Gaeltachta ina áit.  Measaim gur chóir go dtarlódh a leithéid d'athrú in aon Rialtas nua amach anseo.  Molaim gur cheart go mbeadh an phríomhchuspóir aige nó aici ná déileáil leis an nGaeilge agus an nGaeltacht.  Má tharlaíonn sé sin, léireoidh sé an phráinn a bhaineann leis an gceist agus cé chomh dáiríre agus atá an Rialtas ó thaobh tarrtháil na Gaeilge de.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Agus an méid sin á rá agam, ba chóir dom a lua gur trua go raibh an Teachta Gilmore agus, níos déanaí, an Teachta Shatter ag gearán go rabhamar ag déileáil leis an gceist seo inniu.  Dúirt an Teachta Shatter go bhfhéadfadh an Ghaeilge fanacht fad is a bhí rudaí níos tábhachtaí á dhéanamh againn.  Measaim nach féidir leis an nGaeilge fanacht.  Níl sé maith go leor go mbeadh a leithéid á rá ag aon Bhall den Teach ag an tréimhse seo.  Tá todhchaí na Gaeilge beagnach chomh práinneach le haon rud eile a bhí á phlé againn inniu.  Sa deireadh thiar thall, muna bhfuil féiniúlacht, ár gcultúr féin agus meas ar ár n-oidhreacht againn, ní fiú tráithnín sinn agus is féidir leis an IMF nó aon dream eile teacht isteach agus seilbh a ghlacadh orainn.  Ní Éireannaigh sinn muna bhfuil meas againn ar ár gcultúr, nó muna bhfuilimid sásta a chinntiú go bhfuil tarrtháil á dhéanamh againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Is ait liom roinnt de na dearcthaí atá léirithe sa Teach seo.  Dúirt Teachtaí áirithe go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ró-dheacair.  Tá sé deacair dóibh siúd atá níos aosta, teangacha nua a fhoglaim.  Tá sé éasca do roinnt daoine aon teanga a fhoglaim.  Is cuma le daoine óga faoi bhriathra rialta nó neamhrialta nuair atáimid ag iarraidh orthu an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Níl éinne ag iarraidh ar muintir na Fraince na briathra neamhrialta sa bhFraincis a athrú toisc go bhfuil sé deacair an teanga sin a fhoglaim.  Ba chóir dúinn díriú isteach ar conas an Ghaeilge a mhúineadh níos fearr ag an leibhéal is ísle.  Moladh maith atá sa tuairisc ón comhchoiste.  Rinne an gcomhchoiste obair mhaith faoi chúram an Teachta Tom Kitt agus molaim é agus na baill eile as sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Tá moladh an-tábhachtach sa tuairisc maidir leis an gcuraclam.  Deireann Gaeilgeoirí agus daoine óga atá ag díriú isteach ar an ardteist amach anseo go mbeidh an scrúdú ró-éasca dóibh de bharr na hathruithe atá déanta ar an gcuraclam agus nach mbeidh aon dúshlán ann dóibh mar a bhí i gcónaí ó thaobh na litríochta de agus araile.  Ba chóir go nglacfadh an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna  leis an moladh i dtaobh na hardteistiméireachta go sciobtha.  Agus mé ag caint faoin Roinn, ba chóir dom a rá gur seo ceann de na príomh fadhbanna maidir leis an nGaeilge ó bunaíodh an Stát.  Is fadhb i gcónaí í.  Déanann an comhchoiste an moladh seo ar son An Chomhairle Um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, COGG.  Tá an moladh seo níos tábhachtaí ná aon rud eile anseo, mar go dtí seo tá an Roinn tar éis cur i gcoinne nó tar éis constaic a chur in aghaidh gach céim chun tosaigh a theastaigh ó Ghaelgeoirí agus ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh maidir le hoideachas trí Ghaeilge.  In áit a bheith ag cothú éilimh do Ghaelscolaíocht, déanann an Roinn a mhalairt.  Is léir sin ó na cinntí atá glactha ag an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna le dhá bhliain anuas gan aitheantas cuí a thabhairt do Ghaelscoileanna nua nó do Ghaelcholáistí, nó fiú díriú isteach ar an gcruachás atá ann ó thaobh Gaelscolaíochta sa tír.  Tá gach Gaelcholáiste lán go doras agus tá éileamh i bhfad Éireann níos mó orthu ná gur féidir leo déileáil leis.  Is ceist mhor í seo.  Tá daoine sásta a bpáistí a chur chuig Gaelscoileanna agus Gaelcholáistí.  Má táimid dáiríre faoin nGaeloideachas, ba chóir dúinn glacadh leis an gcéim seo.  Caithimid a chinntiú go mbeidh na scoileanna ann ionas go mbeidh, ar a laghad, oiliúint ar fáil do pháistí na ndaoine atá sásta a bpáistí a chur chuig na scoileanna sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Rud eile atá tábhachtach ná an toil phoilitiúil.  Bliain i ndiaidh bliana, déanaimid ráitis sa Teach i leith na Gaeilge, go minic i lár seachtain na Gaeilge.  Molaim sin, ach go minic is mise an duine a lorgaíonn an díospóireacht sin.  Níl fadhb agam leis sin.  Ach sa deireadh, sin an méid a bhíonn againn.  Bíonn na ráitis againn agus chomh luath agus a bhíonn críoch leo, away linn ag déanamh ár obair fhéin arís, seachas díriú isteach ar na ceisteanna móra seo.  Táimid ag lorg reachtaíochta maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá an reachtaíocht seo á mholadh ag an Aire le blianta, ach níl an reachtaíocht sin os ár gcomhair go fóill.  Luaigh mé an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna agus an naimhdeas atá ansin i dtaobh na Gaeilge de.  Luaigh mé freisin an dea shampla gur féidir linne a thabhairt sa Teach.  Muna dtarlaíonn sin, ní fiú tráithnín an méid a deirtear sa Dáil uair sa bhliain.  Is fíor annamh a cloistear aon duine sa Dáil ag labhairt Gaeilge, seachas nuair a bhíonn díospóireacht againn ar cheist na Gaeilge.  Ní chloistear ach cúpla focal nuair atá daoine ag gabháíl buíochais leis an gCeann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Rinneadh tagairt do sheirbhísí trí Ghaeilge agus dúradh go bhfuil gá le hiad a bheith ar fáil.  Ba chóir go mbeadh Gaelgeoirí agus daoine a thugann tacaíocht don Ghaeilge ag lorg na seirbhísí sin agus go mbainfeadh siad úsáid astu.  Tá an ceart ag an Aire nuair a deireann sé sin.  Ní úsáidimid na seirbhísí atá ar fáil mar chuireann siad moill ar ár ngnó go minic.  Sin an fáth go gcasann daoine ar an mBéarla.  Go minic freisin, bíonn rudaí níos casta ná mar a bheadh agus an tseirbhís á úsáid trí Bhéarla, toisc go mbíonn an Ghaeilge ar fhoirmeacha chomh casta sin go bhfuil sí i bhfad níos measa ná aon Bhéarla ar fhoirmeacha, cé go mbíonn sin casta go leor.  Tá eagras i Sasana ar a dtugtar Plain English.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an rud céanna againn anseo ó thaobh na Gaeilge de.  Ba chóir go mbeadh daoine in ann aon rud atá á fhoilsiú againn a thuiscint agus go mbeadh sé ar fáil go héasca.  Sa lá atá inniu ann agus leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta sa teicneolaíocht, ba chóir go mbeimis in ann na seirbhísí seo a chur ar fáil i bhfad níos tapúla agus níos forleithne.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Díreoidh mé anois ar cheann nó dhó de na moltaí a dhéanann an comhchoiste, cuid acu a chuala mé cheana.  Maidir le comharthaí bóithre, rinneamar iarracht seo a mholadh don Aire Iompair cheana.  Mholamar athrú meoin ó thaobh comharthaí bóithre agus comharthaí Stáit de.  Mholamar go dtabharfar tús áite, nó comhchéim ar a laghad, don Ghaeilge.  I mo thuairim, ba chóir tús áite a thabhairt di.  Dúradh linn go mbeadh sin ró-chostasach.  Níl mórán acmhainní ag an tír faoi láthair, nó sin a deirtear linn.  Measaim go bhfuil bealach timpeall ar sin, ach sin scéal eile.  Níl acmhainní i gceist anseo.  Séard atá i gceist ná go mbeadh an meon nua i réim cibé uair atá athrú ag teacht nó aon uair atá aon chomharthaí nua á dhéanamh, seachas mar a tharlaíonn faoi láthair, gur athsmaoineamh nó afterthought a bhíonn ann.  Baineann sin le comharthaí áitiúla agus araile.  Fós sa lá atá inniu ann, bíonn orainn a mheabhrú do chomhairlí áitiúla go bhfuil orthu Gaeilge a chur ar na comharthaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Tá roinnt moltaí radcacha sa tuairisc agus tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an tAire leo.  B'fhéidir nach sroichfimid na spriocanna, ach mar adúirt Donncha Ó hÉallaithe liom i ríomhphost inné, tá sé rí-thábhachtach go mbeidh na spriocanna a leagtar síos inbhainte.  Measaim go bhfuil breall air agus é ag rá nach bhfuil sé indéanta, nó go mbeadh sé an-deacair, bogadh ó 80,000 daoine ag gabháil leis an nGaeilge lasmuigh den chóras oideachais go dtí 250,000 i dtréimhse 20 bliain.  Measaim gur féidir sin a dhéanamh.  Is léir ó thíortha eile gur féidir é a dhéanamh.  An rud is tábhachtaí ná go mbeidh an toil pholaitiúil ann agus go gcuirfear na hacmhainní ar fáil.  Tá súil agam nach mbeimid sa sáinn eacnamaíochta ina bhfuilimid faoi láthair thar an tréimhse 20 bliain atá le teacht.  Más i gceann cúig nó deich mbliana a tharlaíonn an t-athrú, beidh an mhaoin agus na hacmhainní ann.  Sin ráite, tá acmhainní ann faoi láthair, ach braitheann sé ar an Rialtas cá gcuirfear na hacmhainní sin nó cén togra a gheobhaidh tús áite.  Tá gá ann go mbeadh na  spriocanna insroichte.  Measaim go bhfuil gach rud insroichte chomh fada agus a cuirimid ar fad chucu.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Tá obair mhaith déanta ag an gcoiste agus tá obair mhaith déanta ag an Roinn ó thaobh na straitéise de.  Impím ar an Aire agus ar an Roinn go gcuirfear fuadar futhu.  Caithfimid deifir a dhéanamh déileáil leis seo nó ní bheidh an Ghaeilge nó an Ghaeltacht ann amach anseo.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_919">Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Teachta Michael Kennedy.  Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom a rá go raibh sé mar onóir dom a bheith mar Chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste Oireachtais um Ghnóthaí Turasóireachta, Cultúir, Spóirt, Pobail, Comhionannais agus Gaeltachta fad agus a bhí an coiste dul i gcomhairle le pobal na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta maidir leis an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Mar chuid den phróiseas comhairliúcháin tábhachtach seo, tugadh cuireadh do sé eagraíocht, Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhluadar agus Foras na Gaeilge ina measc, cur i láthair a dhéanamh os comhair an chomhchoiste Oireachtais ag tús na bliana.  Is fiú a lua gurb í an chéad uair riamh do TG4 obair an chomhchoiste a chraoladh beo ar an teilifís.  Ní hamháin sin, ach thaisteal toscaireacht de chuid an chomhchoiste siar go hIndreabhán i gConamara chun an straiteis a phlé le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Rinne an comhchoiste gach iarracht dul i gcomhairle le hionadaithe ó gach réimse de shaol na Gaeilge, i ngach cearn den tír, mar chuid den phróiseas comhairliúcháin i dtaca leis an straitéis.  Theastaigh ón gcomhchoiste a chinntiú go raibh ionchur ag na páirtithe leasmhara ar fad ins na moltaí a chuireamar le chéile i dtuarascáil don Aire le déanaí.  Bhí sé tábhachtach go ndeachaigh an comhchoiste chun na Gaeltachta chun dul i mbun cainte le pobal labhartha na Gaeilge go díreach, agus go raibh deis ag muintir na Gaeltachta a dtuairimí a chur in iúl dúinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">Táimid an-sásta gur baineadh leas as an gcomhchoiste mar fhóram poiblí chun plé a dhéanamh ar na gnéithe is tábhachtaí a bhaineann leis an teanga agus leis an straitéis, agus táimid an-bhuíoch gur ghlac na heagrais Ghaeilge agus pobal na teanga páirt chomh lárnach sa phróiseas comhairliúcháin.  Tá ardmholadh ar leith ag dul don bhfochoiste faoin gcathaoirleach, Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú, a chur an tuarascáil dheireanach le chéile ar son an chomhchoiste freisin.  Is mór agam go raibh comhairliúchán chomh hoscailte, iomlán againn le pobal na Gaeilge le beagnach bliain anuas, rud a chinntíonn go bhfuil na moltaí ar fad sa tuarascáil ceangailte isteach sa mhórphictiúr do thodhchaí na teanga sna blianta amach romhainn.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Táimid ag moladh go mór, mar sin, go nglacfaí leis na moltaí uile ón gcomhchoiste chun an straitéis a neartú, agus chun a chinntiú go mbaintear spriocanna na straitéise maidir le chur chun cinn na Gaeilge amach idir seo agus 2030.  Is fiú aird ar leith a tharraingt ar chuid de na moltaí sa tuarascáil áfach.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Caithfear an Ghaeltacht a chosaint go práinneach agus is gá dearbhú a chur sa straitéis nach mbainfidh beartas dátheangachais leis an nGaeltacht agus nach gcuirtear a leithéid i bhfeidhm sa Ghaeltacht riamh.  Braitheann inmharthanacht na Gaeilge ar bheocht leanúnach na bpobal Gaeltachta, áit a bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga an phobail; mar theanga cheannasach an teaghlaigh; agus mar phríomhtheanga an pháiste sna blianta tosaigh is tábhachtaí ó thaobh fhorbairt an linbh de.  Braitheann beocht leanúnach na bpobal Gaeltachta ar chumas forbartha agus ar chothú fhostaíochta freisin, agus ní mór é seo a dhéanamh trína chinntiú go gcuirtear an maoiniú agus na hacmhainní cuí ar fáil chuige seo tríd an straitéis.  Ó is gné chroí-lárnach de shlánú na Gaeilge é geilleagar Gaeltachta láidir a chothú, moltar i dtuarascáil an chomhchoiste gur cheart an ról príomhúil chun geilleagar agus bonneagar na Gaeltachta a fhorbairt a fhágáil faoi Údarás na Gaeltachta.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Molann an comhchoiste freisin gur chóir athstruchtúrú a dhéanamh ar an gComhairle um Oideachais Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta mar chuideachta reáchtúil.  Ba chóir go mbeidh cumhachtaí mínithe aici i ndáil le hionadaíocht a dhéanamh ar thuairimí agus ar mholtaí páirtithe leasmhara na Gaeilge maidir le beartas oideachais a cheapadh don Ghaeltacht agus do phobal na Gaeilge.  Géar-riachtanas is ea é go mhúinfí an Ghaeilge go héifeachtach ó thús go deireadh an chórais oideachais i ngach áit sa tír.  Tá géarghá le siollabas nua don Ghaeilge a fhorbairt ó leibhéal na naíonán beaga go leibhéal na hardteistiméireachta, mar shampla, siollabas a chuirfidh riachtanais fhorbartha teangeolaíochta cainteoirí dúchais, daltaí atá ag fáil a gcuid oideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge, agus daltaí inniúla Gaeilge eile san áireamh, agus go gcuirfí acmhainní ar fáil go leanúnach leis an gcúrsa seo a chur á fheidhmiú.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">Ní hamháin sin ach tá sé de cheart ag gach tuismitheoir oideachas lán-Ghaeilge a roghnú dá bpáistí agus molann an comhchoiste go láidir go gcinntítear soláthar dóthanach don Ghaeloideachas do phobal uile na tíre.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an rogha d'oideachas trí Ghaeilge mar chritéir ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna nuair atá suíomh nua á roghnú acu do scoileanna nua chun é seo a chinntiú.  Is sampla í Gaelscoil Ráth Tó i gContae na Mí.  Is í an t-aon scoil a d'oscail gan aitheantas ná tacaíocht airgid ón Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ar an 30 Lúnasa i mbliana.  Roimh oscailt Gaelscoil Ráth Tó, níor osclaíodh Gaelscoil sna 26 Chontae ón mbliain 2008.  Is léir ó liosta tinrimh na scoile go bhfuil an-éileamh ann i measc an phobail don Ghaelscoil agus ní chóir go mbeadh aon bhac ar thuismitheoirí ag iarraidh oideachais lán-Ghaeilge a thabhairt dá bpáistí i Ráth Tó ná in áit ar bith eile sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">Mar fhocall scoir, ba mhaith liom a rá gur tuar dóchais don todhchaí é an tacaíocht tras-phobal atá ann don straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge, agus an tacaíocht pholaitíochta tras-pháirtí atá bainte amach ag an gcomhchoiste sa tuarascáil seo i dtaca leis an straitéis.  Tá na moltaí ar fad a rinneamar sa tuarascáil ag eascairt as an bplé a bhí againn le heagrais Ghaeilge, le pobal labhartha na Gaeilge — sa Ghalltacht agus sa Ghaeltacht araon — agus tá siad aontaithe ag na hionadaithe ar fad ó na páirtithe éagsúla atá ar an gcomhchoiste.  Ní mór dúinn anois an deis a thapú chun na moltaí seo a chur i bhfeidhm sa straitéis.  Braitheann na moltaí ar fad a luaitear sa tuarascáil go mór ar a chéile agus de bharr seo, braitheann rath na straitéise ar na moltaí ar fad a ghlacadh agus a cheangal isteach sa dhréacht dheireanach den straitéis ina n-iomláine.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Tá súil agam go n-aontaíonn an Dáil liom, agus tá súil agam go nglacfar moltaí uile an chomchoiste san áireamh ina n-iomláine sa atraitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge ag an staid dheireanach seo den phróiseas comhairliúcháin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKennedy" eId="spk_510">
          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_928">Is onóir dom labhairt anseo inniu faoi straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge mar leas-chathaoirleach ar an gComhchoiste um Ghnóthaí Ealaíon, Spóirt, Turasóireachta, Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.  Sa choiste sin, rinneamar scrúdú ar an dréacht straitéis, chuamar i gcomhairle leis an bpobal agus chuireamar moltaí le chéile.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">Próiséas fiúntach agus tábhachtach a bhí ann.  Bhí sé an-tabhachtach, mar shampla, tuairimí an phobail a fháil mar ag deireadh an lae, beidh an straitéis ag brath ar thacaíocht a fháil ón bpobal.  Táim an-dóchasach go néireoidh leis an straitéis seo na spriocanna atá ann a bhaint amach.  Tá go leor ann le bheith dóchasach faoi, mar shampla, na Gaelscoileanna.  Tá ceithre Ghaelscoil i mo dháilcheantar féin i mBaile Átha Cliath Thuaidh agus tá an Ghaelscoil i mBaile Brigín ag lorg foirgnimh nua.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">As this is a bilingual issue, I will say a few words in English.  I welcome the all-party consensus we achieved on this strategy.  The aim to have as many citizens as possible speaking Irish is desirable from all perspectives.  We hear a great deal about Irish sovereignty at present.  I have visited Connemara and the Gaeltacht is the ideal place to promote or increase the number of people who speak Irish on a daily baisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The committee met a number of groups and it was very encouraging to meet so many people who were involved in promoting the Irish language.  Getting them focused through this 20 year strategy is vital and will be the key to success.  I believe we can achieve the objective of having 250,000 people speaking Irish each day, and this strategy is the way forward.  When I was in Connemara I was impressed by the level of input of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Keeping people living and working in their own area through the medium of Irish is the way forward, and providing Údarás na Gaeltachta with the funding and ability to keep going is the correct course.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">A few general points should be made about Irish people.  It is ironic that when they go abroad they suddenly renew their Irish identity and are prepared to use the cúpla focail in a restaurant, train or elsewhere.  We should instil some of that spirit in people at home, so they can take pride in having their native language.  In the current economic debate there is much talk about losing our sovereignty but the main things that identify Irish people are their language, music and art.  I believe the gaelscoileanna are the way forward.  There are four in my constituency and a group in Balbriggan is trying to found the first second level Gaelscoil in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Members of the Dáil should do more.  Lessons were available to Members who were anxious to brush up on their Irish which was availed of by Deputies Burke, Feighan and O'Shea, as well as myself.  It is regrettable that during this session they have not recommenced.  Will the Minister use his influence to have these lessons re-started which would benefit many Members?</p>

          <p eId="para_942">Tá áthas orm seans a bheith agam bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht seo.  Tá sé an-tábhachtach an cheist seo a phlé.  Molaim an coiste a bhí i gceannas ar an straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  An rud is tábhachtaí dom ná go bhfuil sé scríofa in Airteagal 8 den Bhunreacht "Ós í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta is í an phríomhtheanga oifigiúil í."  Tá sin sa Bhunreacht agus in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">Aontaím leis an Teachta Kennedy agus glaoim ar an Aire tús a chur athuair leis na ranganna a bhí ar siúl do Bhaill agus d'fhoireann na dTithe anseo chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge, agus úsáid na Gaeilge a chothú sa Pharlaimint.  Níl cúis ar bith nach mbeidís ar fáil, tá ranganna Fraincíse ar fáil ach níl ranganna Gaeilge.  Impím ar an Aire iad a chur ar fáil arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Tá sárobair á deanamh ag Raidió na Gaeltachta, TG4, na Gaelscoileanna, Conradh na Gaeilge, Gaeleagras agus na grúpaí go léir atá ag cur na Gaeilge chun cinn ar fud na tíre.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Since the foundation of the State, Irish has been its official language.  It is unbelievable that many of us, myself included, are still unable to use it go flúirseach.  It is unacceptable that lip-service has been paid to the language by successive governments and by the Department of Education and Skills.  We must and can improve in making Irish a more widely used language.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">A fortnight ago in Brussels, I was informed by an official there that there is a danger that, despite having fought hard over the years to make the Irish language a working EU language, its official status may be withdrawn soon.  Will the Minister ensure this does not happen?  It was gratifying to hear Irish MEPs using the language in the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The gaelscoileanna outside of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht have done tremendous work in promoting the use of Irish not only in schools.  One notices more that many towns have fograí as Gaeilge.  While it may not be seen as significant use, it is still important to make the effort to use it.  Organisations such as Conradh na Gaeilge and Gaeleagras have made great efforts over the years to have Irish more widely spoken.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Department of Education and Skills, however, is not fully behind the establishment of gaelscoileanna even when there are obvious demands for them.  The Department claims it is not feasible to have a gaelscoil in some areas.  Today, the Joint Committee on Education and Skills heard from delegations such as An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta and Conradh na Gaeilge, on Irish language education.  They pointed out that in many of the schools they have established, the annual intake of students is between 35 and 40 pupils.  Still, the Department will not provide sanction for these schools.  The commitment of the Department of Education and Skills to the Irish language comes into question when it stifles the efforts of parents and their children to use it.  It is unacceptable and the Minister must make this known to the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">The marks available for the leaving certificate's an scrúdú cainte have been increased to encourage caint trí Ghaeilge which is to be welcomed.  However, other changes to the examination mean top-class students from Gaeltacht areas are being brought down a level because of the test's shortcomings.  That is elementary stuff.  Likewise, they were given pictures months beforehand and then had to come in a talk about them.  The quality and demands involved in that kind of support for the Irish language needs a lot of improvement, particularly for those in the Gaeltacht areas who have to examine, analyse and present a case trí Ghaeilge at higher level for the leaving certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">While we have things like that we are neither advancing nor clearly supporting the language.  In actual fact, we are going backwards.  That is the terrible thing about it.  We may talk about the big controversy in Kerry concerning total immersion in Irish and all these irrelevancies that happen; we concentrate and focus on those, but to a degree they are not important.  It is important to deliver an educational system where those who have the ability to flourish trí Ghaeilge should be supported to the highest possible extent.  As long as we have any obstacle to that, and the Department of Education and Skills is reluctant or hesitant to embrace and encourage it, we will have problems.  The problems we have had in the past may not be the same now, but we are certainly not encouraging fully and wholeheartedly the concept of making Gaeilge an teanga náisiúnta.</p>

Má thagann mo chomhghleacaithe, roinnfidh mé mo chuid ama leo.  Is tábhachtach an díospóireacht í seo, go mórmhór inniu agus sinn ag caint faoi thodhchaí na tíre.  Pé rud eile nach bhfuil faoin ár smacht, is cinnte go bhfuil ár dteanga faoinár smacht.  Faoi mar a deirtear, "tír gan teanga, tír gan anam".</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Tá sé tábhachtach a rá go bhfuil teangacha ar fud an domhain faoi bhagairt agus faoi bhrú.  B'fhéidir nach dtuigtear é seo sa Dáil, os rud é go mbíonn an chuid is mó de na díospóireachtaí anseo i mBéarla.  Ta sé cinnte go bhfuil an Béarla in uachtar in a lán tíortha, seachas ar fud an domhain.  Tuigim go bhfuil thart ar 6,000 teangacha fágtha sa domhan.  De réir Indiana University sna Stáit Aontaithe, beidh 90% dóibh imithe faoin mbliain 2100.  Dá bharr sin, caithfear bheith ar an airdeall go bhfuil na coinníollacha ann chun an Ghaeilge a bhuanú, a fhorbairt agus a choimeád beo.  De réir obair ata déanta ag taighdeoirí, caithfidh ar a laghad 100,000 cainteoirí a bheith ag teanga ar bith ionas go mairfidh sí.  Má tá níos lú ná 100,000 cainteoirí i gceist, tá teanga faoi bhagairt agus de réir dealraimh, rachfaidh sí i léig.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, táimid ar an imeall.  Tá sé mar sprioc sa straitéis líon na gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge taobh amuigh den gcóras oideachais a mhéadú ó 80,000 go dtí 250,000.  Tá sé sin thar a bheith neamhréadúil sa tréimhse atá leagtha amach.  De réir mar a thuigim, níl bunús eolaíoch leis an bhfigiúr de 250,000.  Caithfimid bheith réadúil faoin ábhar seo.  Má táimid chun sprioc éigin a bhaint amach, b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn iarracht a dhéanamh líon na gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge taobh amuigh den gcóras oideachais a mhéadú faoi 5.7% gach bliain.  Mhéadódh sé sin an líon cainteoirí Gaeilge ó 80,000 go dtí breis is 100,000.  Dá dtarlódh ardú de 10% gach cúig bliana, bheadh 100,000 cainteoirí, ar a laghad, i gceist.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">B'fhéidir gur cheart dúinn caint ní hamháin faoi na cainteoirí laethúla ach freisin faoi na cainteoirí seachtainiúla.  Bíonn deacrachtaí ag neart daoine in Éirinn — go mórmhór iad siúd nach gcónaíonn i gcomhluadar Ghaeilge, ar nós an Ghaeltacht — an Ghaeilge a labhairt gach lá.  Mar sprioc níos réadúla, ba chóir dúinn líon na ndaoine a labhrann an Ghaeilge go seachtainiúil a mheas agus a mhéadú, chomh maith leo siúd a labhrann an teanga go laethúil.  Ní mór dúinn é sin a mheas.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Tá a lán rudaí maithe sa dréachtstraitéis.  Ba cheart neart fuinnimh a úsáid chun í a chur i gcrích.  Tá amhras orm maidir leis an moladh "údarás na Gaeilge" a dhéanamh de Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá Údarás na Gaeltachta oilte go maith ó thaobh cúrsaí gnó de.</p>

Is maith an rud é go bhfuil sé molta go bhfuil gá ann níos mó béime a chur ar an teanga labhartha.  Aontaím freisin gur cheart go mbeadh Údarás na Gaeltachta ag plé le cúrsaí pleanála agus tithíochta.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil an t-údarás an-éifeachtach agus é ag plé le deontais tithíochta agus, go háirithe, cúrsaí tionsclaíochta.  Tá an-chomhoibriú idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na comhairlí contae, i gContae na Gaillimhe ar aon nós.  Is maith an rud é go mbaineann moladh eile le work experience programmes a chur ar fáil do mhic léinn sna hollscoileanna agus sna hinstitiúidí teicneolaíochta.

Caithfidh mé seans a thabhairt don Teachta Mattie McGrath.  Ta súil agam go mbeimid in ann níos mó díospóireachtaí a eagrú sa Teach seo agus sa Seanad.  Tá sé sin molta sa straitéis freisin.

          <p eId="para_961">Cuirim fáilte roimh an tuairisc seo agus tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo againn inniu. Tá ról na straitéise fíor-thábhachtach don teanga, d'ár bhféiniúlacht agus d'ár gcultúr. I welcome the strategy and it is timely that we have the debate.  The Irish language is an important element of our heritage and culture.  It is unique to our nation. Tá na moltaí ar fad sa straitéis an-tábhachtach, ach tá suim faoi leith agam sna moltaí a bhaineann le hoideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge. Bunaíodh bord speisialta chun acmhainní agus tacaíocht a thabhairt d'oideachas den chineál sin.  I am particularly pleased with the establishment of a statutory body to provide resources and support for the Irish media and education sector. Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a  dhéanamh leis na Gaelscoileanna agus na naíonraí i dTiobraid Árann theas as an obair atá déanta acu chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.

          <p eId="para_963">Is rud tábhachtach é go mbíonn díospóireachtaí as Gaeilge sa Teach nó go mbímid ag caint faoin nGaeilge agus chúrsaí teanga.  De gnáth, bhíodh díospóireacht mar seo againn gach bliain thart ar Lá le Pádraig agus bhíodh na horáidí ag an am sin mar standard speeches for standard dates.  B'fhéidir gur rud maith é go raibh na díospóireachtaí sin againn, ach i ndáiríre, má táimid chun athrú a fháil maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge, tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeidh straitéis fad-téarmach againn, mar atá againn anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Tá rudaí maithe sa straitéis, ach tá rudaí áirithe eile inti nach aontaíonn Fine Gael leo.  Ba mhaith liom díriú isteach ar chuid de na rudaí sin.  Tá tuairim láidir ag Fine Gael go gcaithfimid féachaint arís ar an gceist faoi Ghaeilge a bheith éigeantach.  Measann Fine Gael go mba chóir go mbeadh rogha ag scoláirí i ndiaidh na meánteiste i dtaobh na Gaeilge agus nach ceart go mbeadh sé éigeantach í a thógáil.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht le Páidi Ó Lionáird ar an gclár "Seacht Lá" le déanaí agus chuala me é ag rá go mbeadh deireadh leis an nGaeilge murach an Ghaeilge a bheith éigeanteach.  Ní réitím leis sin ar chor ar bith, mar tá teipthe ar an bpolasaí sin.  Má theastaíonn uainn go léir go mbeadh Gaeilge á húsáid go forleathan mar ghnáth theanga laethúil, caithfimid féachaint ar an teanga le fealsúnacht eile.   Caithfimid daoine a mhealladh isteach chun Gaeilge a labhairt agus chun freastal ar an nGaeltacht.  Caithfimid iad a mhealladh isteach i ngnó cultúrtha na tíre.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">Tá sé de cheart agamsa labhairt faoi seo mar tógadh i dteach Gaelach mé agus ó d'fhás mé aníos, téim go dtí an Ghaeltacht gach bliain.  Tuigim fadhbanna na Gaeltachtaí agus creidim go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh na Gaeltachtaí ann i gcónaí.  Táimse i mo chónaí i mbaile mór i gContae Lú agus tá an tAire ina chónaí ar an gcósta thoir chomh maith, sa chathair.  Sa taobh seo tíre, ní bhíonn aon Ghaeilge ag an gcuid is mó de na páistí a fhreastalaíonn ar na scoileanna.  Ní hamháin sin, ach i gcuid de na scoileanna tá suas le 35% de na daltaí nach bhfuil an Béarla acu mar mháthairtheanga ach oiread.  Tá athruithe móra ag tarlú timpeall na tíre, go mór mór ar an gcósta thoir agus níl mórán Gaeilge ag cuid mhaith de an daltaí agus iad ag fágáil na scoile.  Muna dtarlaíonn athrú de shaghas éigin, leanfaidh an scéal sin ar aghaidh agus éireoidh sé níos measa.  Mar a deirimid i Fine Gael, má bhíonn an Ghaeilge bríomhar agus má mhealltar isteach daltaí, roghnóidh siad an Ghaeilge don ardteist.  Ní tharlaíonn sin faoi láthair.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Tá cultúr saibhir ag baint leis an nGaeilge agus ba chóir modhanna múinte níos fearr a úsáid, go háirithe sna bunscoileanna.  Ba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó béime ar an nGaeilge nuair a thosaíonn páistí ar scoil.  Dúradh ag an gCoiste um Oideachas agus Scileanna inniu go raibh an Ghaeilge ag teacht isteach ró-dhéanach sa churaclam do pháistí.  Tá athrú pholasaí ag teastáil maidir leis sin.</p>

          <p eId="para_975">Tá ceist againn freisin faoi imeall na Gaeltachtaí.  Chuala mé go bhuil na Gaeltachtaí roinnte anois idir zones A, B agus C agus i zone C tá cónaí ar na daoine nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt acu go laethúil ach ar feadh céatadáin níos lú ná 39% den am.  Chun an fhírinne a rá, sílim go bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt níos lú ná 10% den am i gcuid den Ghaeltacht.  Caithfimid díriú ar dhúichí nach Gaeltachtaí iad ar chor ar bith.  Tá cuid mhór de chathair na Gaillimhe sa Ghaeltacht, ach ní chloistear aon Ghaeilge san áit sin.  We must look at these issues and face them head on.  Caithfimid níos mó cabhrach a thabhairt do dhaoine, do theaghaigh agus do na scoileanna ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge á labhairt go laethúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">We need to change the way we do things.  The policy is a failure.  The Gaeltacht is getting smaller, year after year.  While more people are opting to speak Irish, we must examine our Gaeltacht policy.  We must get rid of our compulsory Irish after the junior certificate.  We must offer people choice after the junior certificate rather than having it compulsory.  Students love the subjects they want to do, not the ones they have to do.  That is the challenge we face.  I am not happy with what I heard in a debate on "Seacht Lá" on TG4 the other day where the person was saying as a statement of fact to Deputy McGinley that it would kill the Gaeltacht.  I challenge his view.  That old thinking is destroying the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  It is old hat at this stage.  It just does not work anymore.  We must change the way we do things.

          <p eId="para_978">Tá áthas orm an Teachta Feighan a fheiceáil anseo mar aontaím leis an Teachta O'Dowd nuair a labhair sé faoi na seantuairimí atá ag roinnt daoine.  Cuireadh dearcadh in iúl dúinn i rith an tsamhraidh maidir leis an Teachta Feighan, agus dá mbeadh an dearcadh sin go forleathan, ní bheadh Gaeilge ar bith ann a thuilleadh.  Caithfimid an dearcadh sin a chaitheamh amach agus caithfidh gach duine fáilte a chur roimh an iarracht atá déanta ag an Teachta Feighan agus an spreagadh a chuireann sé in iúl don bpobal.  Tá sin an-tábhachtach, beidh a lán daoine ag breathnú ar an Teachta agus ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim mar gheall air.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an straitéis agus fáilte a chur roimpi.  Céim shuntasach í maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.  Tá a lán oibre déanta ag an Aire, ag an Rialtas agus ag an Roinn agus tá macnamh le feiceáil inti.  Níl aon amhras ach gur straitéis chuimsitheach í.  Tá an straitéis leagtha amach go soiléir agus is féidir é a chur chun cinn go mall éifeachtach mar is straitéis fhada í.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">Beidh aonad straitéise sa Roinn agus tugaim tacaíocht dó.  Ní bheinn ag iarraidh a fheiceáil an Roinn díbeartha ón Rialtas.  Beidh sé d'fheidhm ag an aonad seo straitéis na Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm agus beidh daoine istigh ann ag obair go speisialta air seo agus is an-tacaíocht agus an-chabhair don Ghaeilge í an straitéis.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">Tá áthas orm go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar ábhar éigeantach sna scoileanna mar tá an-tábhacht ag baint leis sin.  Tá tábhacht freisin ag baint leis na naíonraí; tá a fhios againn go léir an tábhacht a bhaineann le Gaelscoileanna ach tá an rud céanna fíor ó thaobh na naíonraí freisin.  Tá naíonraí i mo dháilcheantar agus d'fhreastal mé ar naíonra Gaelach agus tá an-mhaitheas ag teacht astu.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Is deas a fheiceáil go mbeidh níos mó teagmhála idir an Roinn agus na húdaráis áitiúla sa Ghaeltacht.  I mo dháilcheantar féin, i mBaile Ghib, beidh seo an-tábhachtach mar tá muintir na háite chun cosáin, soilse agus mar sin a chur ar fáil.  Dá mbeadh comhoibriú idir an Roinn agus an chomhairle chontae, bheadh níos mó dul chun cinn ann.  Tá a fhios ag an Aire cad tá ag teastáil ó Chumann Lúthchleas Gael Wolfe Tone sa Ghaeltacht i mo dháilcheantar agus tá áthas orm gur thug sé cuairt are an gceantar sin i mbliana.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Tá a lán Gaelscoileanna i mo dháilcheantar fosta, i nDún Búinne, i nDún Seachlainn, i gCill Dhéagláin, agus tá Gaelscoil an Bhradáin Feasa ann freisin, scoil ar fhreastal mé ar an bhord bainistíochta.  Níor thug an Rialtas nó an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna aitheantas do Ghaelscoil Rath Tó.  Tá tábhacht ag baint leis an nGaelscoil sin, atá ag múineadh na ndaltaí ansin, agus tá cás déanta ag an scoil aitheantas a fháil.  Dá rachadh an tAire i dteagmháil leis an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna, bheinn sásta.  Tá tábhacht ag baint le meánscoil in oirthear na Mí, in aice le Gaelscoil an Bhradáin Feasa agus tá an Roinn Oideachais ag labhairt faoi sin faoi láthair.</p>

          <p eId="para_984">Tá sé suntasach an méid Baill a ghlac páirt sa dhíospóireacht seo.  Léiríonn sin go bhfuil ard leibhéal suime sa Teach.  Gabhaim buíochas don gCathaoirleach as ucht an deis a thabhairt dom cúpla focal a rá.  Tréaslaím leis an Aire agus leis an iar-Aire, an Teachta Ó Cuív, de bharr na cinnireachta praiticiúla a thug siad don straitéis.  Molaim na baill ar fad den chomhchoiste, roinnt mhaith acu a labhair anseo cheana, mar gheall ar an obair dhíograsach a rinne siad ar an tuarascáil a foilsíodh i mbliana.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">Is iomaí díospóireacht a tharla sna Tithe seo tríd na blianta ar stádas agus ar thodhchaí na Gaeilge.  Cé go raibh fiúntas iontu ar fad, tá céim mhór chun tosaigh á glacadh againn le foilsiú na dréacht-straitéise.  Déanaim chomhghairdeas leis an Taoiseach agus le baill an choiste Rialtais a rinne dianobair ar an straitéis.  Léiríonn an obair ar fad a rinneadh le dhá bhliain anuas go bhfuil dáiríreacht nua i dtaobh stádais agus neartú na Gaeilge le feiceáil sna Tithe anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">S'é an aidhm atá ag an straitéis ná líon na ndaoine a úsáideann an Ghaeilge go laethúil a mhéadú ó 75,000 go dtí 250,000 i gceann 20 bliana.  Cuirtear béim ar an dátheangachas lasmuigh den nGaeltacht agus moltar go láidir an Ghaeilge amháin a fhorbairt mar phríomtheanga na ndaoine sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Sa chomhthéacs sin, moltar sa straitéis go dtabharfaí dualgais nua agus cumhachtaí nua d'Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh ról lárnach ag an údarás i gcúrsaí pleanála, tithíochta agus infheistíochta ginearálta sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">Mar dhuine, áfach, a rugadh agus a chaith mo shaol i gCill Dara, tá suim faoi leith agam sa straitéis agus an tionchar a bheidh aici ar thodhchaí na Gaeilge i gceantair cosúil le m'áit dhúchais féin.  Tá sé i gceart go gcuirtear béim ar an oideachas, an tumoideachas ach go háirithe, sa phlean nua.  Is maith is cuimhin liom agus mé i mo dheagóir i gCill Dara sna 1970í an t-iontas agus, uaireanta, an naimhdeas a mhothaigh mé ó mhuintir na háite agus mé ag dul timpeall le slua daoine óga ag labhairt na Gaeilge agus ag gníomhú go fonnmhar ar son Ógras, eagras na n-óg Chonradh na Gaeilge.  In ainneoin ár neamhurchóideachas agus ár n-idéalachas ag an am, níor chreid duine ar bith againn go dtiocfadh an lá chomh luath sin is go mbeadh cúrsaí mar atá anois i gContae Chill Dara, le sé bhunscoil agus Ghaelcholáiste ag feidhmiú.  I gCill Dára, tá 1,623 dalta ag fáil bunoideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge agus 200 eile ag freastal ar an scoil dara leibhéal nuabhunaithe.  Is dul chun cinn iontach é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">Is é an fás iontach sin ar líon na nGaelscoileanna ó cheann ceann na tíre a thugann dóchas dom mar gheall ar an teanga.  Is ceart agus is cóir don Rialtas agus don Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna leanúint ar aghaidh leis an tacaíocht atá curtha ar fáil do thuismitheoirí ag a bhfuil an suim agus an fuinneamh scoileanna nua a bhunú.  Caithfimid a thógáil san áireamh gurb ó na tuismitheoirí don chuid is mó a thagann an iarracht na scoileanna seo a bhunú.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">Ní leor na Gaelscoileanna amháin a lua.  Tá gá ann stádas agus caighdeán na Gaeilge a neartú agus a fheabhsú sna gnáthscoileanna náisiúnta agus sna meánscoileanna.  Tá sé ceart go n-aithníonn an straitéis an gá atá ann le cúrsaí rialta do mhúinteoirí na Gaeilge ag gach leibhéal.  Moladh sa straitéis go mbeadh scoláireachtaí Gaeltachta ar fáil do mhúinteoirí atá cáilithe cheana féin.  Tá sin tábhachtach, ní hamháin i gcomhthéacs chaighdeán na Gaeilge sna scoileanna, ach ó thaobh an mheoin atá á léiriú ag múinteoirí dá ndaltaí i leith na Gaeilge.  Is é meon na múinteoirí agus na dtuismitheoirí a imríonn an tionchar is mó ar pháistí agus iad ag tabhairt fúthu an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim.</p>

          <p eId="para_992">Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe a thug deis dom cúpla nóiméad a chaitheamh ag plé leis an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta O'Shea, táimid i bhfábhar na moltaí.  Agus é sin ráite, tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuilimid dáiríre mar gheall orthu.  I mo thuairim, d'fhulaing an Ghaeilge mar nach raibh daoine dáiríre faoi straitéisí agus tuarascálacha a foilsíodh roimhe seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Tá mé mar Bhall den Teach seo le 25 bliain anuas.  Cé go bhfáiltím roimh an duine atá in Áiléar na n-Iriseoirí faoi láthair, is léir go bhfuil laghdú suntasach tagtha ar spéis na meáin i gcúrsaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Is féidir leis an Áiléar folmhú i gcúpla soicind nuair a thosnaíonn Teachta ag labhairt Gaeilge.  Tá feachtas fiachmhar frith-Ghaeilge agus frith-Ghaelach sna sceacha i gcónaí.  Dúirt duine éigin nár éirigh leis an sean-straitéis, a bhí out of date.  Sílim gurb é an rud sean agus díchéillí ná an meon atá acu siúd a cheapann go gcuireann líofacht sa Ghaeilge, nó aon teanga eile, constaic dá laghad ar ár n-eolas faoi chúrsaí éagsúla.  Léiríonn a leithéid de thuairim aineolach an dearcadh atá acu siúd a ghlacann páirt sa bhfeachtas frith-Ghaeilge.  Cén fáth nach bhfuil rud dearfach á dhéanamh acu siúd atá buartha faoin éiginnteacht a luaitear i leith na Gaeilge?</p>
          <p eId="para_994">Tá sé ráite go bhféadfaí an t-ábhar Gaeilge a roinnt i dhá leath, agus béim a chur ar ábhar amháin úsáid agus líofacht na Gaeilge agus ábhar eile ar litríocht na Gaeilge.  Is moladh dearfach é sin.  Ní aontaím leo siúd a deireann go gcuireann caiteachas ar an nGaeilge, an teanga féin nó aon rud Gaelach constaic dá laghad ar aon rud nua-aoiseach i saol na hÉireann.  Is cuimhin liom go soiléir go raibh an meon sin ann nuair a bhí mé ag iarraidh Teilifís na Gaeilge a bhunú, nó Raidió na Gaeltachta a leathnú.  Má ghlactar leis go bhfuil tábhacht ag baint lenár n-aitheantas, ár samhlaíocht, ár stair agus ár litríocht, tá an Ghaeilge lárnach sa chomhthéacs sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Ag an bpointe seo, tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil sraitheanna nua de dhaoine ag teacht as na gaelscoileanna. Thóg a lán daoine eile an dara sheans a thugadh dóibh i leith na Gaeilge nuair a rinneadh forbairt ar Teilifís na Gaeilge agus Raidió na Gaeltachta. Tá sé tábhachtach na daoine sin a spreagadh chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid agus an t-eolas atá acu a chur i gcrích.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge in úsáid i bhfad níos mó i ghnáthchomhráití san áit seo agus i ndíospóireachtaí sa Teach seo agus sa Seanad.  Má tá mé chun labhairt faoi thábhacht na fírinne, caithfidh mé an fhírinne a rá.  Cé go bhfuil go leor de Baill an Oireachtais in ann an Ghaeilge a labhairt, tá laghdú tagtha ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo, sa Teach eile agus sna coistí.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">Cé go bhfuil Teachtaí ar gach taobh den Teach i bhfábhar na moltaí atá déanta, ní bheadh sé ar leas na teanga dúinn a cheapadh go bhfuil aon rud bainte amach againn go dtí go gcuirfí na moltaí sin i gcrích.  Ba cheart go mbeadh eagrais sa Ghaeltacht chun seans a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá ag déanamh iarrachta leis an scolaíocht Gaeilge.  Ba chóir an t-údarás a threisiú agus a leathnú, in ionad an Roinn Fiontar, Trádála agus Nuálaíochta a chur ina áit.  Tá mé buíoch go raibh seans agam cúpla focal a rá ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil do gach éinne a ghlac páirt sa dhíospóireacht seo.  Chun an fhírinne a rá, is annamh a bhíonn díospóireacht den tsaghas seo againn.  Is cuma cé a bheidh sa suíochán seo — tá súil agam go mbeidh seans aige nó aici, agus ag gach éinne eile sa Teach, an straitéis agus ceisteanna na Gaeilge a phlé go minic mar ghnáthpháirt d'obair na dTithe.  Is é seo an chéad uair a bhfuil straitéis don Ghaeilge ullmhaithe againn.  Tá mise agus mo chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas lán-dáiríre ina taobh.  Tuigim go bhfuil formhór na mBaill lán-dáiríre faoi freisin.  Ní theastaíonn uaim, nó éinne eile, cuir isteach ar aon ghné den tuairisc nó na moltaí atá inti.  Tógfaidh mé an chéad chéim eile i gceann cúpla seachtain, nuair a chuirfidh mé an straitéis roimh an Rialtas.  Beidh sí foilsithe go luath ina dhiaidh sin.  Níos tábhachtaí fós, cuirfimid tús len í a chur i bhfeidhm go luath sa bhliain nua.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">D'ardaigh Teachtaí áirithe roinnt rudaí tábhachtacha.  Níl sé ar intinn ag an Rialtas aon athrú a dhéanamh ar an bpolasaí maidir le múineadh na teanga.  Beidh ar dhaltaí an Ghaeilge a staidéar agus scrúdaithe a dhéanamh suas go dtí leibhéal na hardteistiméireachta — is é sin an polasaí i leith an Ghaeilge éigeantach.  Tá neart fianaise chun an meon a léirigh an Teachta O'Dowd agus Teachtaí eile a dhiúltú.  Beidh seans againn é sin a phlé uair éigin eile.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh seans agam reachtaíocht nua a thabhairt isteach i lár na bliana seo chugainn, nó b'fhéidir níos luaithe má aontaíonn an Teach, chun cúraimí a thabhairt d'údarás na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta.  D'fhéadfainn tuilleadh eolais a thabhairt mar fhreagra ar an Teachta de Búrca, a d'ardaigh an méid atá á dhéanamh ag na hinstitiúidí chun ardscileanna a thabhairt do dhaoine ionas go mbeidís in ann déileáil leis an dualgas atá orainn an Ghaeilge a chothú mar theanga labhartha agus mar theanga oibre san Aontas Eorpach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí uile.  Is léir go bhfuilimid ag fulaingt trí ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta faoi láthair.  In am an ghátair, is fiú breathnú ar na hacmhainní atá againn mar phobal chun cuidiú linn teacht tríd an anachain.  Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó hUigínn gurb í an Ghaeilge ceann de na hacmhainní is luachmhaire atá againn mar phobal.  Tá an teanga ar cheann de na nithe a dhéanann idirdhealú idir pobal na hÉireann agus aon phobal eile ar domhan ó thaobh féiniúlacht chultúrtha de.  Ná bíodh sé le rá ag sliocht ár sleachta gur chinn pobal na hÉireann dá ndeoin féin a dteanga dhúchais a thréigean.  Tá an Ghaeilge tagtha slán in ainneoin na gcéadta bliain de chogaí agus ghortaí sa tír seo.  Is fúinne atá sé mar shochaí a chinntiú go mairfidh an teanga tríd an ngéarchéim eacnamaíochta seo.  Is í aidhm pholasaí an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge ná úsáid na teanga a mhéadú mar theanga phobail ar bhonn céimnithe.  Aithníonn an Rialtas an buntáiste mór dá saoránaigh líofacht Béarla — an teanga is mó úsáide i ngnóthaí idirnáisiúnta — a bheith acu.  Tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh a chinntiú go gcoinneofar an buntáiste seo trí shochaí dhátheangach a fhorbairt ina mbeidh an oiread daoine agus is féidir in ann Gaeilge agus Béarla a úsáid chomh héasca céanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">Ar ndóigh, is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge.  Is cúis imní don Rialtas an baol ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus saineolaithe teanga ag tuar nach bhfuil ach idir 15 bliana agus 20 bliain fágtha ag an nGaeilge mar theanga theaghlaigh agus phobail sa Ghaeltacht.  Dá bhrí sin, tá sé riachtanach gníomhú láithreach bonn sa chaoi is gur féidir leis an Státchóras obair as lámha a chéile le pobal na Gaeltachta chun an teanga a shlánú sa Ghaeltacht.  Ar ndóigh, is faoi phobal na Gaeltachta atá sé freisin beart a dhéanamh de réir a mbriathra ar mhaithe leis an teanga a chaomhnú.  Mar a dúirt go leor Teachtaí, léiríonn suirbhéanna éagsúla go bhfuil sciar suntasach den daonra lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht báúil don Ghaeilge.  Is gá teacht i dtír ar an dea-mhéin sin agus spéis an phobail i gcoitinne inár dteanga dhúchais a spreagadh.  Chomh fada is a bhaineann sé leis an gcóras oideachais, tá gníomhartha fiúntacha tógtha ag an Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna ar mhaithe le múineadh agus foghlaim na Gaeilge.  Creidim gur féidir tógáil ar na céimeanna sin trí chur i bhfeidhm na straitéise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Le comhoibriú idir an Stát agus an pobal, tá súil agam go mbeidh borradh suntasach ar staid na teanga nuair a thiocfaidh deireadh le tréimhse na straitéise i gceann 20 bliain.</p>

        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
          if his attention has been drawn to a Human Rights Watch report entitled Development Without Freedom: How Aid Underwrites Repression in Ethiopia, which urges foreign donors to examine the ways in which the Ethiopian Government uses donor supported resources and aid as a tool to consolidate the power of the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1004">Ethiopia has been a priority country for Ireland's aid programme since 1994, with a clear focus on hunger and basic services for the poorest communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">Human Rights Watch recently produced a report on development in Ethiopia.  It stated that the Government has demonstrated a real commitment to economic development and has introduced the technical framework of democracy, but that civil and political rights are deteriorating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">It specifically alleged that programmes and services supported by aid donors have been manipulated for party political purposes, and referred to two programmes funded by Ireland with other donors.  The productive safety net programme provides some of the most vulnerable people in Ethiopia with predictable cash or food transfers in return for work.  It is protecting the lives of over 7 million people annually.  The protection of basic services programme funds services at regional level, notably in health and education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">We take very seriously any allegation of misuse of funding provided under the aid programme.  Irish Aid, working with other aid donors, has examined the report in detail.  Our shared assessment does not support the allegation of widespread, systematic abuse of development assistance.  However, we are concerned about any allegation of misuse of aid at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">In recent days, our ambassador has raised the allegations in the report directly with the Minister for Finance and Economic Development and emphasised the real concern in Ireland that they need to be investigated.  The Minister stated that his Government is ready to investigate any allegation brought to its attention and to discuss how existing safeguards can be strengthened.  We are following up at all levels so effective action is taken to provide the assurance that there is no misuse of aid and all assistance is delivered without interference to the most vulnerable communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">Irish Aid programmes are subject to rigorous reviews and ongoing monitoring to ensure they are delivered effectively and in line with our commitment to the fight against poverty and hunger.  These measures are kept under continuous review to ensure our assistance to Ethiopia is reaching the people most in need, whether it is provided directly by Irish Aid or channelled through our NGO partners.</p>

Does he accept that Human Rights Watch is a respectable organisation and one needs to pay serious attention to any report it produces?  This report, Development without Freedom: How Aid Underwrites Repression in Ethiopia, is 105 pages.  The African director of Human Rights Watch, Rona Peligal, states: "The Ethiopian Government is routinely using access to aid as a weapon to control people and crush dissent."</p>

            <p eId="para_1012">I am just quoting from the report.  It makes all sorts of allegations.  Farmers are described as being denied access to agricultural assistance, micro-loans, seeds and fertilisers because they do not support the ruling party.  Rural villagers reported that many families with opposition members were barred from participation in the food for work or safety net programme.  There are all types of allegations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">I am not in a position to say whether these allegations are right, but they are very serious.  The Minister of State is right in saying our programme in Ethiopia has been very good, but the allegations are very serious.  Perhaps with his support the author of this report might be requested to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs so he or she may be questioned.  I am not certain who the author was, and these are just quotes from the report.  We could then have an opportunity to put these allegations to the person in question to see whether they can be substantiated.</p>

            <p eId="para_1014">The Deputy is right in saying the allegations are very serious if they were true.  The essential point, however, is that our assessment from working with other donors who have conducted studies in the field do not substantiate these allegations.  Indeed, the report, which I have here, makes allegations about Goal, an Irish NGO, saying that it collaborated in this practice.  I understand Goal has said the allegations are utterly erroneous and has denied them.  However, the development assistance group in Ethiopia carried out a study of the programmes referred to in the Human Rights Watch report, post-report, and could not substantiate any evidence of widespread or systematic distortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">That is not to say allegations of this nature should not be taken seriously.  However, I take strong issue with those who would use this report to misrepresent in the media the nature of our excellent work in Ethiopia and to characterise our programmes as just giving blank cheques to the Government, when everybody in the development community knows this is simply not the case.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, and I have both visited Ethiopia and seen firsthand the efficacy of the programmes, and all the evaluations and audits that are in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">I have not been to Ethiopia, nor have I spoken to the ambassador, and I am not making allegations but rather quoting from a report compiled by a respected organisation.  In view of what the Minister of State had to say about Goal, perhaps when we ask the author to come before the committee as regards the report we might ask John O'Shea to come in as well and let him stand over what is being said about Goal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">I am only interested in what the report actually said.  It called on donor country legislatures and audit institutions to examine development aid to Ethiopia to ensure it is not supporting political repression.  That is what I am interested in.  I am not denying the good work being done.  I just want to see that this matter is cleared up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1018">Of course I support the Deputy's point and obviously it is a matter for the joint committee of which the Deputy is a member to offer that invitation.  However, the essential point remains that our moneys are spent in a way that is rigorously monitored and reviewed.  There are very strong safeguards in place which I have inspected over there.  There are regular audits and independent evaluations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">We work in partnership with Government and local systems, because that is international best practice in terms of creating capacity and sustaining development in such countries.  However, to use this report to characterise the nature of our programmes in a manner that is simply not in accordance with the facts is something I disagree with.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
          his views on the large number of trades unionists killed in Colombia and the failure in recent years of the European Union in its negations with Colombian Governments to make the protection and freedom of trades unionists and human rights protectors a condition of any beneficial relationship with the EU.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_544">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1022">I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which human rights defenders, including trade union activists have been treated in Colombia.  Every death is a tragedy.  Despite the Colombian Government's efforts and some progress achieved, the Colombian state institutions have not yet been able to fully address the issue of violence against human rights defenders.  It is, however, important to recognise the progress that has been made, which is acknowledged in reports issued by the International Labour Organisation and various UN special rapporteurs.  Colombia has made substantial changes to its legal system, including reforming the legislation regulating strikes to bring it in line with international standards.  The Government has also recognised the need for greater efforts to protect vulnerable population groups, including trade unionists.  Measures taken in this area include the increase of resources for official protection programmes, enhanced risk assessment capacities and the toughening of criminal sanctions for attacks on trade unionists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">At the insistence of Ireland and other member states, the EU-Colombia free trade agreement, which was concluded in May of this year, contains robust and enforceable provisions on human rights, labour standards and sustainable development.  Specifically, the first article of the agreement contains a human rights clause permitting the immediate and unilateral suspension of concessions in case of human rights violations.  Such provisions make the agreement a powerful instrument to further the cause of human rights in Colombia.  This agreement should not be seen as an end point, but rather as a first step.  The provisions for human rights and sustainable development in the agreement ensure continued EU engagement with Colombia in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">I welcome the human rights commitments made by the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, since his inauguration on 7 August.  In particular, I am encouraged that the president has tasked his vice president, Angelina Garzón, with particular responsibility for taking forward his Government's programme in this important area.  I have written to Foreign Minister María Ángela Holguin Cuéllar to indicate my continuing interest in human rights dialogue with the Colombian Government.  The Government will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico and in co-operation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_545">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1025">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply.  I recently visited Colombia with Deputies Kitt and Breen and Senator Daly and put to the vice president a number of the points raised in my question.  We also had an opportunity to follow up on these points at a meeting today with the Colombian Republic's ambassador to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, who is on a visit to Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">I put it to the Minister that the transition from the Uribe Government to the Santos Government represents an opportunity for the advancement of human rights.  Would the Minister agree that this must be delivered?  In other words, in terms of the number of people being charged with crime, there must be substantial progress in relation to impunity.  There must be protection for people who have been displaced from their land, some 4 million hectares in total.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">I referred specifically in my question to the position of trade unionists.  The vice president of the CUT was assassinated during President Uribe's time.  During the first 75 days in office of the Santos Government, a number of trade unionists have been killed.  The Minister referred in his reply to the International Labour Organisation, ILO.  The ILO standards in regard to either consultation or conditions at work are not being observed by the extractive industries in the areas which our delegation visited.  I have raised all of these issues with the Colombian ambassador.  The Minister states that there is an enforceable human rights clause in the Colombia-EU agreement.  Perhaps he will say if it is a stronger clause than was contained in the EU-Israel agreement, which has not been enforceable.  What is the substantial difference between the two agreements and how will the Colombia-EU agreement ensure transparency and enforceability in relation to human rights?</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">I welcome the visit by Deputies Higgins, Kitt, Breen and Senator Daly to Colombia.  I applaud Deputy Higgins on that initiative.  It is important that Oireachtas representatives visit such locations to see and hear at first hand from a variety of different perspectives.  This adds value to our consideration of the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">I agree with the basic points made by Deputy Higgins in regard to impunity and the need to view the transition to a new Government and new leadership as an opportunity to deliver on commitments given.  The Deputy will be aware from previous responses to questions on this matter that I met last February with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navanethem Pillay, at which time I specifically asked for her perspective in respect of Colombia and progress on human rights issues in that regard.  The response I received was positive.  All of this is in a relative context in terms of where we are coming from in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">On the human rights clause, it is a strong clause.  Obviously, much depends on the will of the European Union to, in given situations, invoke its rights to suspend an agreement because of a violation of human rights.  The EU has acted in previous situations, in particular in regard to Sri Lanka where the GSP plus arrangement was suspended because of violation of human rights issues.  Also an investigation was undertaken in regard to El Salvador in terms of its non-compliance with ILO conditions.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_547">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1031">The Minister and I could agree on much of this.  The fundamental issue arises from the EU representative in Bogota who was not clear in his reply to the specific question as to how the human rights clause might be made transparent or enforceable.  The issue that arises for the EU and Ireland is whether we can have an economic agreement first and that human rights will follow, which is a residual theory of human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">As a delegation, we were interested in and in agreement on the need for the human rights requirement to be up-fronted.  In other words, that the process of establishing human rights becomes something that happens on the same day as does economic development.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1034">That was my question.  This is about the placing of human rights and the economic change in ratio to each other.  We believe that if the European Union pressed, it could have a transformational effect in making human rights development and economic opportunities coterminous rather than human rights being residual by assumption to economic development.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_550" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1035">I do not accept that human rights are residual.  The Deputy's point is well made.  I, too, have made the point that the agreement represents an opportunity to up-front the human rights dimension and to get greater delivery.  The agreement includes a number of binding commitments to implement core labour environmental conventions.  It also foresees a mechanism for the monitoring of the implementation of labour laws, which includes civil society institutions.  I believe this represents a significant new step.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">We believe that with this addition, the agreement will contribute to the improvement of the situation of human rights in Colombia and, in particular, to labour rights.  Obviously, this will require vigilant monitoring of the situation.  Ireland has been to the fore at the EU in insisting on this clause because of the concerns raised domestically by members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs here.</p>

          his views on the proposed referenda on whether Southern Sudan secedes from Sudan and also whether the Abyei region decide to be part of Northern or Southern Sudan and if he has satisfied himself that the necessary security arrangements will be in place to enable these referenda to take place.

            <p eId="para_1038">The north-south peace process in Sudan is at a critical juncture as the country prepares for a referendum on self-determination for the south and a separate referendum on the status of the district of Abyei on 9 January 2011.  The referenda are envisaged by the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, CPA, which brought an end to the north-south conflict in Sudan.  Ireland and the EU believe that full implementation of the CPA is fundamental to securing peace and stability in Sudan as a whole and in the wider region.  This is a position shared by a wide range of countries, including the United States and the member states of the African Union.  The three-member panel appointed by UN Secretary General Ban to monitor the referendum visited Sudan in November for the second time for the start of the voter registration and expressed the belief that,  notwithstanding the difficulties given the size of Sudan and the scale of the process, voter registration can be completed successfully.  For this to happen, leaders from northern and southern Sudan will need to respect the agreement reached and act to curb any acts of violence in the run-up to the election.  The security situation is a matter of concern but every effort is being made by the international community to ensure that the referenda take place in a secure environment.  The EU and other actors will monitor the security situation closely in the weeks ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">The UN continues to play a lead role in co-ordinating international assistance in the electoral preparations to the Sudanese authorities through the UN mission in Sudan.  The EU Special Representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, is also playing an active role in encouraging both sides to fulfil their obligations under the CPA.  The EU will deploy an election observation mission to Sudan, to cover the voter registration process and the referendum.  Preparations for this mission have already begun.</p>

What efforts are being made by the UN Security Council to provide additional troops to maintain order and to ensure polling booths and all the paraphernalia required for the holding of a referendum are in place?  Given this one opportunity to make a democratic decision, it would be a shame if the result was undermined by a lack of credibility in the process.  Are preparations being made to provide the necessary security arrangements to ensure people entitled to vote will be able to do so in safety?</p>

            <p eId="para_1041">There has been significant international engagement with this issue for some time, particularly at the UN, which is leading the efforts to co-ordinate works on the ground.  The US has been very involved as well through President Obama's special envoy whom we met some time back.  He gave us a good appraisal of the situation, albeit that was more than 12 months ago.  The EU is concerned about ensuring the referenda go ahead peacefully and conflict is avoided.  People are satisfied that this can happen but they are vigilant, given the history and potential for difficulties.  The Union will appoint an election observation team and so on and, together with the UN, it will keep the security situation under constant review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1047">On 22 July the International Court of Justice, ICJ, delivered its advisory opinion on the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo.  The court's advisory ruling held, by a majority of ten to four, that the declaration of independence did not violate international law, Security Council Resolution 1244 or the Constitutional Framework for Provisional Self Government of Kosovo.  However, the court did not rule on the legal consequences of the declaration or the existence of a right to secession as such, as the General Assembly, in seeking its opinion, did not ask it to deal with these issues.  Serbia subsequently put forward a draft UN General Assembly resolution on the issue, the text of which would not have been acceptable to most EU members, including Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">Despite differences within the EU on Kosovo's independence, agreement was reached on a common EU compromise UN resolution text.  Ireland was prominent within the EU in arguing for a common position and in efforts to convince Serbia to support the draft resolution.  Following discussions between President Tadic and High Representative Ashton, Serbia accepted the EU text.  On 9 September, the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution co-sponsored by the EU27 and Serbia by consensus.  The substantive paragraph in the resolution dealt with the EU's facilitation of dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade to promote co-operation and achieve progress on their paths to the European Union.  The successful outcome of the negotiations with Serbia on the text of the resolution represented a significant advance.  Despite initial signals that Belgrade would stick to its own text, the Serbian Government ultimately demonstrated willingness to compromise on this issue, in spite of considerable domestic political opposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Preliminary confidential discussions have been taking place in Brussels on the parameters and format of the EU-facilitated dialogue.  While both sides have expressed their commitment to the process, careful preparatory work needs to be undertaken given the sensitive nature of the issues involved.  It is also possible that the unforeseen general election in Kosovo on 12 December may have some impact on the timing of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">The EU is continuing to work with the parties with a view to early commencement of the dialogue between both sides.  Acceptance by both parties of the need to engage in a dialogue was significant.  As we know from our own experience, a willingness to engage in dialogue is an essential first step to moving any such process forward.  We will continue to support the EU-facilitated dialogue, which can be a catalyst for peace, security and stability in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he happy that procedures are in place whereby the EU will be seen actively to pursue the course for a peaceful resolution?  Has a timescale been set in light of Serbia's application to join the Union?  What effects could this have on the future membership of Kosovo?  Has an effort been made to speed up these discussions?</p>

            <p eId="para_1052">We are clearly at an early stage in the process and, therefore, a specific timeframe has not been set.  The very fact that both parties have indicated a willingness to engage represents significant progress, which is positive.  We must not lose sight of the fact that there is still tension, particularly in the predominantly Serb areas of northern Kosovo.  Dialogue is extremely important to prevent that tension from escalating into conflict.  Careful preparatory work has to be put into ensuring the dialogue is effective and leads to outcomes but, at this stage, we do not have specific timeframes for the conclusion of discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">The Deputy raised the issue of the EU membership perspectives.  Our view, as a country, has been that we support in principle the membership perspective of all countries in the western Balkans as a significant contributor, ultimately, to stability in the region.  Full co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, ICTY, is a prerequisite for that and the achievement of the norms and values and other issues related to joining the EU will also be essential.</p>

It is important that the progressive forces in both countries are allowed to win the day and that the process is not allowed to drag on too long but we know from our own history that in situations such as this, where there have been significant difficulties and so on historically, the very fact that dialogue has commenced is a good sign.  It is important that we, at EU level, do everything we can to create the environment to ensure these talks are productive.</p>

The Government is also committed to working with our friends in Congress to enhance Ireland's bilateral visa arrangements with the US through the establishment of a two-year renewable E-3 visa facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the United States and Ireland experience arising from their position.  I urge anybody who might be tempted to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of their plight.  My Department and the embassy in Washington DC, in particular, has continued to work proactively on the issue with the US Administration, which is what was asked in the question.  It also worked with congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates, which I met in September.  These groups included the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">We have been encouraged by President Obama's continued commitment to resolving this issue, and it is a view he shared when the Taoiseach and I met him in Washington in March.  President Obama has since reiterated that commitment on a number of occasions.  Earlier this year, President Obama welcomed what he described as the strong outline proposal for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Following active engagement with our friends in Congress, this proposal included provision for a path towards the regularisation of the status of the undocumented, including the Irish.  It also specifically contained provision for an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens which was subsequently included in an immigration reform bill introduced by Senator Menendez.  Although this was only the first step in a lengthy legislative process, it represented an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.  However, the outcome of the congressional elections on 2 November presents significant new political challenges for immigration reform legislation.  Given that the outgoing Congress will continue in place until January, it will be some time before new committees are established and the long-term prospects for reform are clearer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead.  Since 2006 the Government has provided a total support of $325,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and in September of this year, I met with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform to discuss the prospects for reform. The Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid, last evening announced that he will introduce the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, DREAM, Act as a stand-alone bill after the Thanksgiving recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">Although many advocates are optimistic about the prospects for passing DREAM, friends on the Hill indicate there is currently no concrete evidence of renewed bipartisan support for the bill, or that some Democratic senators who have not supported DREAM in the past will vote for it on the next occasion.  Over the next two weeks it will be possible to better determine the level of support for DREAM now that it has become once again a concrete proposal.  It will also be possible to better judge, after discussing further with our friends on the Hill, the prospects for other immigration measures such the E-3 type visa for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">Senior officials of my Department had talks in Washington as recently as last Monday on the issue of Irish immigration to the US.  They discussed the issue of the undocumented, the conditions in which Irish citizens are held prior to deportation, the operation of the existing working holiday visa programmes and possibilities for the political agreement on the immigration issues following the 2 November elections in the US.</p>

I have been deeply involved, with others in Fine Gael and other parties, in the matter.  We have gone to much trouble to do our best on Capitol Hill over the past couple of years and the Minister is speaking to the converted when he says it is a difficult process.

            <p eId="para_1068">I know of the Deputy's long-standing commitment to this and accept what he is saying.  I have met people who could not come home for the funerals of loved ones and it is a difficult position to be in.  I indicated in my reply and to the immigration reform movement that there is an obligation on us, with every opportunity for discussion, to tell people not to go to the United States unless everything is in order and not to be in breach of visas.  It may seem initially attractive and people may think they will get by or get on but all of us involved in this for some years know the distress and significant stress that can be placed on some people, even those who have been in the US for ten years.  It is not worth it in terms of quality of life and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">We cannot give advice to people in those positions.  Many people have returned to Ireland but have not made it back to the US, with all the consequent chaos and dislocation brought to their lives.  Senior officials in my Department had talks in Washington as recently as last Monday on the issue of Irish immigration into the US, and the Deputy knows we brought about the work holiday agreement for 12 months, which is a first.</p>

            <p eId="para_1071">It is very limited and restrictive in terms of implementation.  The talks on Monday were with a view to bringing more flexibility into the issue.  In our talks with immigration centres, it emerged that people on that agreement could eventually go to a better quality visa in the United States.  I foresee a long hard slog in this respect with regard to refining existing arrangements and expanding them somewhat at some levels; this may apply to existing bilateral agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">In our talks with ILIR it was clear that given the electoral outcomes and political context in the United States, the issue will continue to be difficult.  With the E-3 visa, the bilateral aspects come back into prime focus, as we see if we can develop that bilateral track with new representatives in Congress.</p>

            <p eId="para_1076">Before those elections we were not that close either, if we are to be honest.  By this I mean the domestic political context in the United States is making it very difficult for legislators, even those who are for this reform by instinct.  They must consider the security of their own seats, for example, and the issue is as basic and straightforward as that.  Many people who are advocates for reform have had to fight very hard to survive the recent electoral contest.  The economic context is not good in the context of facilitating reform of immigration law because there are record levels of unemployment in the United States because of a significant recession.  This dampens the appetite in communities and society for facilitating such reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">It is a challenging issue and I have not seen anything in the elections that will change the matter.  Much will depend on who will head the key committees, as Senator Schumer was a good leader with a good track record who was interested in promoting the issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1083">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 30, 36 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">The launch of direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations on 2 September was a very important step towards peace in the Middle East, achieved after long effort by President Obama and his Administration.  Unfortunately the talks were very quickly suspended again when the partial Israeli moratorium on settlement construction expired on 26 September.  President Abbas had always made clear that he could not continue in negotiations while settlement construction continued, and the three negotiating sessions which had taken place by that time were not nearly enough to develop confidence on either side that the negotiation process was going to achieve results.  I have made clear, here in the Dáil and in my address to the UN General Assembly on 27 September, our deep disappointment at this breakdown, which was clearly foreseen and could and should have been avoided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">The United States, with the strong support of the European Union but essentially in private discussions with the parties, has worked intensively to get the talks back on track.  Secretary of State Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu met for seven hours in Washington last week and are widely reported to have agreed terms under which Israel will renew the moratorium for a period of three months in order to allow the negotiations to proceed.  The United States is thought to have offered unspecified political and security assurances to Mr. Netanyahu in return.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">Neither Israel nor the Palestinians have yet reacted officially to these terms and some more discussions may be needed.  The Arab League foreign Ministers are likely also to be involved.  However, there seems to be a genuine prospect now that negotiations will recommence in earnest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">It is crucial to stress that negotiations are necessary but not sufficient.  If a period of a few months is to be won for talks, at some political cost, then it is absolutely essential that both sides seize that opportunity and engage genuinely and substantively from the outset.  The goal has to be that, before the renewed moratorium expires, the two sides can see clearly and with confidence that this process has a real chance of delivering a comprehensive settlement that will ensure the peaceful two-state solution, which is the only way they can live in peace together in the future.  Surely, that prize must be worth any effort, any political capital and the greatest possible restraint on both sides.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_575">
            <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1088">I share the Minister's concern about the breakdown of the talks and sincerely hope every effort will be made to resume them as quickly as possible.  I also share his view, as does the Fine Gael Party, that the only solution to this impasse is a two-state solution, which means we have to recognise the feelings on both sides.  Since I took over this brief, I have learned a little about the feeling in Israel as well as in Palestine.  I am sure the Minister is aware there are views in Israel that are direct opposites when it comes to trying to reach a solution, just as there are between Hamas and Abbas' Fatah.  Sensitivity is very important in all of these debates and discussions.  I do not believe being seen to take one side against the other is helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">Does the Minister agree one of the ways to bring people to understand the sense of coming to an agreement is through economic prosperity?  Therefore, the opening up of the Gaza Strip for economic investment, job creation and, in particular, foreign investment is one way of getting the people to realise the benefit of having a peaceful solution to a given problem.  This is now recognised in Northern Ireland, where, as a result of the peace process, we now have foreign inward investment which stabilises the community.  Does the Minister agree that every effort should be made to try to bring about the opening of the Gaza Strip to allow inward investment and increase trade, which would be a way to finding a solution to this problem?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_576" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1090">Absolutely.  We are, of course, aware of the different political perspectives towards the talks within Israel, as well as the different perspectives within Palestinian society and between different groups.  This is one of the reasons we have been strong advocates for Palestinian reconciliation.  In my meetings with the Egyptian Foreign Minister and the Arab League at the UN Assembly, we pushed strongly for renewed momentum in the Palestinian reconciliation process, which is essential ultimately to the delivery of a comprehensive settlement.  I had a sense over some time that this momentum had gone somewhat cold.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">In terms of the Israeli perspective, the Quartet's envoy, Mr. Tony Blair, has consistently been at pains to point out that Mr. Netanyahu represents the best shot at leadership within Israel in regard to actually delivering a deal, particularly within the centre to centre-right perspective within the Israeli political system.  We are sensitive in our commentary, although we do not pull our punches either and when we believe something that has happened is wrong, we say it.  Our experience in Northern Ireland tells us certain measures are confidence building and can aid peace, and we need to say that.  The Deputy was correct to point out that the opening up of the Gaza Strip is very important for the normalisation of economic activity, for example, to facilitate exports from Gaza, which are currently not facilitated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">I have just received a letter from Mr. Guido Westerwelle, the German Foreign Minister, apprising me of his experience on his recent visit to Gaza, where he met with businessmen.  In his letter, which he circulated to other Ministers, he again reiterates much of what we have seen ourselves.  There is a need for Israel and everybody involved to agree we need to enable business, manufacturing and infrastructure works to restart in Gaza.  Infrastructure works have been too slow in coming on stream, particularly the water works, which is an iconic project that would do so much to improve the quality of life for all concerned in Gaza.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_577">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1093">I was interested in the Minister's reference to the German Foreign Minister's letter.  There is also a more recent comment by somebody who is perhaps much closer to us all, Mr. John Ging, who has said that what happened in Gaza through the widely-reported easing of some restrictions has made little difference and has not made possible the completion of the construction projects in which UNRWA was involved.  Neither has it made possible significant advances in regard to infrastructure.  In fact, it was small, inadequate and sporadic, and had the effect of relieving the Israeli authorities of international pressure in regard to access to Gaza.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">My second point is in regard to the question of the moratorium on settlements in the West Bank.  I understand — perhaps the Minister can assist us — in regard to the recent agreement with the Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, and others that the moratorium has been given at the price of there being no future moratoriums and that this would be the last moratorium.  At the same time, licences for building have been issued and this has been accompanied by evictions in east Jerusalem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Finally, the Minister agreed with me at one stage that it would have been of assistance if a secretariat was appointed to the work of the peace process and the Quartet.  I happen to have little confidence in Mr. Blair's achievements but surely the US talks are emphasising once again that when the United States becomes active, the Quartet becomes inactive.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_578" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1096">I am aware of the comments of Mr. John Ging.  I am deeply disappointed at the lack of progress in regard to the Gaza situation because, as the Deputy may recall, at the time of the flotilla crisis and the appalling loss of life, there was a significant meeting of Foreign Ministers which was addressed by Mr. Tony Blair and by Commissioner Georgieva in regard to development and the need to see delivery on the ground.  We were given significant assurances, particularly in terms of infrastructural works.  While there has been an alleviation, there has been little in terms of the volume of goods coming in on a humanitarian basis.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1098">However, as Deputy Barrett said, the real issue is that we need significant infrastructural investment, much of which is guaranteed by international organisations and countries.  Some countries, such as Germany and France, have provided significant up-front funding to do very significant infrastructural work.</p>
          </speech>

            <p eId="para_1100">And Saudi Arabia and others.  It is extremely frustrating that this has not happened because it undermines confidence among Palestinians and, in particular, among moderate Palestinian and Arab opinion that people are serious about a resolution.  That is a significant by-product of all of this, apart altogether from the imperative of the humanitarian situation and the need to get infrastructure up and running.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1101">I read that part of the deal being discussed between Secretary of State Clinton and Mr. Netanyahu was that the US would supply 25 fighter jets worth $3 billion.  The point the Minister has just made highlights the fact the Germans and the EU want to invest in infrastructure rather than in items of war.  Does the Minister agree it is important that the EU takes a lead role in these negotiations?  With due respect to the US, it is wrong that it should be seen to take control.  We can show there will be EU investment in this region if peace can be brought about.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1104">At the conference at Sharm el-Sheikh almost two years ago huge volumes of aid were promised for Gaza which have not materialised because of the obstacles put in the way of the aid.  To be fair, the United States has been a significant donor to the Palestinian Authority and to the establishment of the authority's mechanisms and systems of government.  The Deputy is correct in the sense that the main reported — I stress this word — elements of the US assurances relate to the supply of fighter jets at a lower cost as well as US political and security support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">Israel has long sought a long-term security presence along the River Jordan and it is unclear whether that has been agreed to.  Israel's paramount issue has always been around the security of the state following any comprehensive settlement.  This informs the United States response on those issues.  The reassurances the US can supply to Israel on the security front therefore may be potentially helpful in terms of getting the talks process under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">Deputy Higgins's remarks were correct.  It has been reported that they would not ask for a further extension after three months and the United States has promised that it would not call for such a further extension.  The EU remains of the view that these settlements are illegal and contravene international law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">With regard to taking the lead role, the European Union was pleased that President Obama's Administration prioritised the Middle East from day one of assuming office.  One criticism of earlier Administrations was that they waited too long into the first term before giving the Middle East the priority it required.  The United States is a remarkably important broker in the Middle Eastern situation and has influence.</p>

            <p eId="para_1110">The Quartet always mystifies me.  What has effectively taken place in the long drag of non-achievement in the Middle East is that when the United States becomes active, everyone else goes silent and when talks fail in the United States, nothing takes place.  There must be continuity of action at EU level.  For example, there is little activity in the Russian part of the Quartet and only moderate or occasional interest from the UN component.  This leaves only the European Union and the United States.  If the European Union took the positive step of establishing a secretariat for the peace talks, it would provide an insurance policy or a second strand to provide for the possibility of the US talks going wrong.  The idea of a stop-go approach makes no sense.  The peace centre in Israel has evaporated.  It is probably difficult to get elected to the Knesset if one is not a hawk.  Equally, the talks between Hamas and Fatah for reconciliation in the West Bank and Gaza have not made sufficient progress.  This is the reason continuity would be served by a permanent secretariat.</p>

            <p eId="para_1111">I accept that there has been a clear lack of continuity in the various talks which have taken place throughout the years.  We have had this discussion before.  The situation of such a secretariat or where it would be located would require the agreement of both parties but it would represent an important value-added contribution to the process.  Previously, it has been explained to me that the initiative of one Israeli Prime Minister may, in essence, die if that Prime Minister moves on and is replaced by another.  The bones of an agreement are well known to all sides.  Political will is required.  We have been assured of the positions of those involved by many interlocutors during the past 12 months.  The US Secretary of State, Ms Clinton, made it clear at the General Assembly, when she met EU foreign ministers, that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu were both personally committed to a deal.  This has been put to us emphatically by several people and I must take this in good faith.  Ultimately, that is the only guarantor because it is not possible to get a deal if the political will is not present.  People know the parameters of a deal.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1122">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18, 21, 25, 29, 40, 117 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">I welcome the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from her arbitrary house arrest.  Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained, in one form or another, by the Burmese authorities since leading her political party, the National League for Democracy, to victory in the 1990 elections.  During that time, she has come to symbolise the desire of the Burmese people for democracy and freedom.  Despite the repeated infringements of her human and political rights by the regime, she has responded with dignity and remains unflinching in her commitment to non-violence, insisting on the use of political means to achieve positive change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">In welcoming the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, I join the many people in Burma and throughout the world, including here in Ireland, who have campaigned for her release from unfair and unwarranted detention.  The Irish people hold a particular affection for Aung San Suu Kyi and her campaign has received strong support across Ireland.  Some 11 years ago she was awarded the freedom of the city of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">There have been no reports to date of any conditions attached to her release.  Based on past experience, we must remain cautious.  I am reminded of her previous releases in 1995 and 2002 which merely led to her being re-arrested after her popularity was perceived as a threat by the Burmese authorities.  Only the continued full and unconditional freedom of Aung San Suu Kyi is acceptable to Ireland, our partners in the European Union and the broader international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Unfortunately, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi does not, of itself, ensure real reform or change in Burma.  We must not forget that more than 2,000 other political prisoners are still detained.  The release without delay of all political prisoners would allow for the initiation of an inclusive and comprehensive dialogue aimed at national reconciliation, a dialogue which must involve all opposition and ethnic groups.  Burma's ethnic minorities continue to suffer appalling human rights abuses and discrimination perpetrated by the regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">The welcome news of Aung San Suu Kyi's release should not distract the international community from the flawed parliamentary elections which were held in Burma on 7 November.  It is deeply regrettable that the Burmese authorities failed to avail of this opportunity to take a genuine step on the path towards a representative and democratically elected civilian government.  Instead of a free, fair and inclusive process, the elections lacked any real credibility.  From the outset, the restrictive electoral laws enacted by the authorities made it inevitable that the regime would control every aspect of the election's preparation and outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">The continued detention of political prisoners during the election period significantly impaired the ability of Opposition political parties to contest the elections.  Notwithstanding this, some ethnic groups participated in the electoral process to try to take advantage of the possible opportunity afforded by the elections to secure representation in local and national legislatures.  Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of Opposition candidates, reports of the election results indicate that, as expected, the regime has ensured the vast majority of seats have been won by its supporters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">At the Asia-Europe summit in October, which the Taoiseach attended, there was an agreed statement on Burma.  In that statement, the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, leaders encouraged the Burmese Government to take the necessary measures to ensure the November elections would be free, fair and inclusive and mark a step towards a legitimate, constitutional, civilian system of Government.  They also sought the release of political prisoners and expressed their support for the United Nations good offices mission.  The statement was a significant, positive step forward for this particular forum, which includes Burma and its regional neighbours.  Unfortunately, the Burmese authorities chose to ignore not only the wider international community represented at the summit but also their closest neighbours, and pushed ahead with the deeply flawed elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">Ireland continues to support the good offices mission of the UN Secretary General and I once again call on the Burmese authorities to co-operate constructively with the mission and with the special rapporteur for human rights.  Ireland and its European Union partners will continue to engage closely with the problem of Burma.  European Union foreign ministers are scheduled to have a full discussion on Burma at the foreign affairs council next Monday.  This occasion will provide an opportunity to assess the election's outcome, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and potential political developments.  A meeting between ambassadors and representatives of the European Union and Aung San Suu Kyi took place in Rangoon on Tuesday, 16 November.  The report of the meeting will be helpful to Ministers at our discussions next Monday.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">Despite my continued misgivings about the motivations of the Burmese authorities, I hope the release of Aung San Suu Kyi can provide a catalyst for genuine political change in Burma.  I believe that while maintaining sanctions and restrictions against the Burmese regime, we should also stand ready to respond positively to genuine progress towards democratisation and respect for human rights.  The European Union can make an important contribution to the evolution of a democratic and free society in Burma.</p>

            <p eId="para_1132">It is now time for the Government to acknowledge that one of the Minister's predecessors made a mistake in facilitating the Burmese presence at ASEAN, the assumption being that moral suasion would work on Burma.  It singularly did not.  I appreciate the reference in the Minister's reply to the 2,000 prisoners still being held in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">With regard to the discussions that the European Union and Ireland have from time to time with the Chinese authorities, has there been any significant shift in the Chinese support for the military regime?  The Minister made reference to ethnic minorities.  Is the Minister concerned about the major increase in the number of refugees who have poured over the Thai border and are now in camps, and the use of military action by Burma against these fleeing minorities?</p>

            <p eId="para_1134">Ireland has been particularly strong in supporting Burma at home and internationally, and I commend those who have been supportive of the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi in particular, including Mr. Kilgallen and others who have been effective in keeping the issue alive in Irish public opinion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">We have raised the issue of Burma and acted bilaterally with its neighbours, and we believe they can play a constructive role in promoting political and human rights progress in Burma.  We have worked on this agenda in our meetings with these countries in international forums and in our political consultations with China, India, the EU, ASEAN and ASEM.  We believe ASEAN not only has a role to play but has an obligation and a responsibility in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">During my visit to China this summer, I raised the issue of Burma directly with the Chinese foreign Minister and articulated our view of what should happen.  It is difficult to detect any shift in the approach of Burma's neighbours.  Behind the scenes one senses that there has been engagement and dialogue, but not with any great impact in terms of results, because the elections were clearly flawed——</p>

            <p eId="para_1139">I join with others in congratulating Aung San Suu Kyi on her release and commend the dignified way in which she has behaved since.  However, any country that is still holding 2,000 political prisoners has little intention of changing its ways without the application of extreme pressure in various ways.  We should begin by encouraging the international community to condemn out of hand the sham elections that were recently held and seek the opening of discussions with Aung San Suu Kyi and the minority ethnic groups on the border.  Ireland, because of our neutrality and because we are small and not a threat to anybody, has a tremendous opportunity to lead the way at European level to force ongoing discussion and pressure on regimes such as that of Burma to open up and give democracy a chance.  Now that there is a ray of hope, we should not let this opportunity slip.  I would appreciate a commitment from the Minister that he will personally keep this high on the agenda at every European Council meeting so that we are seen to be leading the charge.  As a small country, we can do a lot if we take up this cause and seek the release of the 2,000 people who are being held because of their political views.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_1140">Absolutely.  We have taken a leading role in keeping the issue of Burma alive in international forums as well as domestically.  We were clear in our opposition to the elections and also to the constitutional provisions that were designed by the military regime to maintain its stranglehold on Burmese political life.  The military were allocated 25% of the seats in Parliament, and it was stipulated that no changes could be made to the constitution unless more than 75% of members of Parliament supported such a change, which is virtually impossible to achieve.  That is what one is up against.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">We have been supporting civil society organisations working on long-term development projects globally.  In Burma, this funding has enabled Trócaire, for example, to run programmes to strengthen civil society in Burma and support some 500,000 Burmese refugees and internally displaced persons in the Thai border area.  Irish Aid also supports the UNICEF programme in Burma, providing basic health care for women and children and protection for vulnerable groups.  My Department has also supported and funded a number of initiatives of the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, including the Second and Fourth Congresses of the Members of Parliament Union Burma, which were held in Dublin.  We provided financial support to enable that to happen.  A consultation meeting was organised with a range of opposition and ethnic groups in Dublin in January of last year — I met those concerned at the time — and a similar follow-up meeting took place in Jakarta in August.  We have also been a strong supporter of Burma Action Ireland, as I said earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">As part of our refugee resettlement and integration programme, Ireland welcomed a group of 97 refugees from the Burma-Thailand border in 2007, and 78 Burmese Rohingya refugees from camps in Bangladesh.  All in all, we have played a constructive and significant role in dealing with Burma, and we remain committed to this.</p>

            <p eId="para_1144">Human rights-related concerns are the subject of a dedicated regular bilateral dialogue with the Colombian Government, which was launched in April 2008.  The third session of this dialogue took place in Bogotá in May 2010 and the next round of discussions is expected to take place in the first half of 2011.  Following the inauguration of Juan Manuel Santos as President of Colombia in August, Vice President Garzón visited Brussels in October and met with Commissioners De Gucht, Reding and Piebalgs as well as representatives of the European Parliament.  During these meetings, a broad range of issues was discussed, including human rights, security policy, the EU-Colombia free trade agreement, social policies and the fight against drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">Vice President Garzón, who has been given specific responsibility for dealing with the Government's programme in this area by President Santos, reiterated the importance attached by President Santos's administration to addressing human rights issues in Colombia.  Vice President Garzón stressed the Government's willingness to work with civil society on human rights.  The vice president also outlined the content of the Government's land reform Bill, which aims over the next four years to return 2 million hectares to farmers who were forced off their land by illegal armed groups, and a victims' law Bill which would provide reparation for more than 4 million victims of Colombia's long-standing armed conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">On the question of security policy, Vice President Garzón emphasised the Colombian Government's continuing commitment to fighting against illegal armed groups, drug traffickers and organised crime organisations within a framework of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">Vice President Garzón stressed the importance of the EU-Colombia free trade agreement in contributing to Colombia's social and economic development, particularly with regard to increasing employment and alleviating poverty.  Finally, the fight against drugs was discussed, with a particular focus on the links between terrorism, drugs and organised crime.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">Vice President Garzón is a former trade union leader and in our meetings with him a few weeks ago he stressed labour rights as well as human and other rights.  While people have disappeared and children have been inducted into narco-terrorist gangs and so forth, of the 70,000 people who have been killed in the past two decades the largest proportion is of trade unionists and trade union membership is now 50% of what it was 20 years ago because of the attempted terror directed at the right to organise.  I understand a group from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will visit Colombia on 9 December and will no doubt stress this point.  On the relationship of the European Union with Colombia, will the European Union seek to require of multinationals with head offices in European countries that they comply with ILO regulations in terms of the environment, consultation, work practices and rights?  I am referring to European Union companies involved in the natural resources area, in particular in the extractive industries.</p>

            <p eId="para_1149">This matter was raised during the discussion of Priority Question No. 1.  Front Line and the International Office for Human Rights Action in Colombia informed us late yesterday of the arrest of Mrs. Carolina Rubio Esguerra by the Colombian criminal investigation unit on her return to Colombia following her visit to Brussels, which is of concern.  During her visit to Brussels she had attended the general assembly meeting of OIDHACO which is a network of European and international non-governmental organisations that seeks to contribute to the construction and strengthening of democracy, rule of law and peace with social justice.  It does not augur well in terms of that situation.  We have articulated our concern with the ambassador and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_1151">I appreciate that.  It is important that multinationals and particularly European multinationals would conform to the ILO provisions.  We will certainly continue to raise that issue with the European Union in the context of the agreement, which still needs to go through a ratification process through the European Parliament and so forth.  As I said in an earlier reply, the European Union initiated an investigation in El Salvador over the failure of the Salvadoran authorities to incorporate ILO provisions in its domestic employment law so the Deputy can take it that the matter will be pursued in the case of Colombia also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1152">Earlier I made a point on Colombia to which the Minister replied.  The pressure that will be brought to bear on the economic benefits, which are real, between the European Union and Colombia may override, if one likes, the necessary progress that is made on human rights defenders and trade unionists.  Unfortunately the former president, Mr. Uribe, in his visits to the European Union has been presenting himself as the person who is the victor over terrorism and the person who brought peace and stability.  His legacy is one that has left narco-terrorist gangs in several parts of Colombia.  I wish President Santos well if he is different, but as a former cabinet member of the previous president he needs to establish credibility and deliver on the human rights agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_1153">We are in agreement that it is all about delivery.  From a European perspective it is about vigilant monitoring of the situation there.  There is always a need for balance and this is the challenge.  One could do nothing and things would not progress at all, but on the other hand the conclusion of a trade agreement can provide leverage and a catalyst to ensure continued progress.  It is imperative that we do not allow human rights issues to slip down the pecking order in terms of priority.  However, economic development and progress can help to normalise societies.  That is the challenge facing all concerned in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1158">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment today.  As Members know, dementia is an umbrella term for a group of conditions which cause brain cells to die.  Alzheimer's disease is the most commonly known form of dementia and is a condition which has a potentially devastating impact on the cognitive, emotional and physical life of the affected person and poses enormous challenges for their families.  Dementia is progressive in its nature, but thankfully in some cases the progression can be slow and because of this the person can often live independently and with dignity in his or her local community with a range of supports.  It is also important to note that while dementia is usually a condition of older age it is not part of the normal aging process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">The Alzheimer Society of Ireland reported recently in its pre-budget submission that there are currently 44,000 people with dementia in this country and they predict that this will rise to more than 100,000 over the next 25 years.  There are estimated to be approximately 50,000 carers of people with symptoms of dementia at present but when one adds in the number of other family members who assist and whose lives are affected by this condition, it represents one of the most serious challenges to the health care system in this country and is worthy of detailed consideration and prioritisation by the Members of Dáil Éireann and the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">I attended the launch of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland pre-budget submission some time ago and I was struck particularly by the testimony of the daughter of a person with dementia.  She described in heartrending detail the progression of the illness which her mother endured and how it came to affect her own health in a serious way as well.  That presentation prompted me to request this debate today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The Government should give serious consideration in the forthcoming budget to the following four key points made by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  First, protection should be given to the current funding level of €14.61 million for the community services provided by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland nationally.  This would help to sustain the basic level provision of day care service, carer support groups, social clubs for carers and persons with dementia, and the Alzheimer's disease national helpline to current service users.  Second, the current levels of service should be extended to the 1,000 people on waiting lists throughout the country at an additional cost of € 4.6 million.  Third, the 4,400 younger people with dementia who currently have little or no support structure or services should have a regional case management service to assist, post-diagnosis, in accessing entitlements, services and information.  This would cost €350,000.  Fourth, a public campaign promoting risk reduction and prevention of dementia in the general public should be organised and supported.  This would cost €250,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">I believe that there are compelling reasons to designate dementia as a national health priority.  A national dementia strategy would enable the formulation of a strategic and fully co-ordinated response to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers.  It is an extremely worthwhile objective and I ask that the Government consider this matter carefully and sympathetically when framing budget 2011.</p>

          <speech by="#AineBrady" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_610">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_1163">Dementia is a most distressing condition, both for those suffering from it and their families.  It presents a significant and growing challenge to health and social services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">Alzheimer's disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia.  People are living longer and, as a consequence, are more likely to develop some form of dementia.  While dementia is not solely related to age, the prevalence is higher in older people and increases with age.  It is estimated that approximately 5% of people over 65 years of age have some form of dementia, with this figure rising to 20% for people over 80 years of age.  Research and published work on dementia have outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in its effective management.  This work also emphasises the need for co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services which respond to the individual needs of people with dementia, and of those who care for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">There is an intimate link in Government policy between the care of older people and that of people with dementia.  It stresses the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers.  Recent years have seen dramatic changes in both the concept and practice of services for older people.  Enormous strides have been made in developing a comprehensive, community-based service.  This will continue to focus on helping people to remain in their own homes and communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">There has been an unprecedented level of investment in this sector.  The Government has provided over €200 million in additional funding for new service developments in recent years.  This year, therefore, the Health Service Executive will invest in the region of €211 million for mainstream home help services and approximately €130 million for home care packages.  This commits the executive to providing almost 12 million home help hours to over 54,000 people; to deliver home care packages to over 9,500 people at any one time or to some 13,000 clients over the course of the year; and to maintain over 21,000 day care or respite places, benefiting an estimated 80,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">On 1 July 2009, the new regulatory regime for residential care settings for older people came into force.  On that day the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, commenced an independent system of registration and inspection of all nursing homes.  The Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres) Regulations 2009 underpin the National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.The standards include supplementary criteria for dementia specific residential care units which should be read in conjunction with the general standards.  Since the commencement of the regulations the authority has inspected all designated centres for older people, some 600 centres and published approximately 550 inspection reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">The demographic make-up of Irish society is changing.  Our population is ageing.  The number and proportion of people diagnosed with dementia can be expected to increase, and with it demand for services.  In recognition of this, the Department of Health and Children has started the process of developing a policy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services.  The policy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">One of the first issues to be addressed is the need for comprehensive data on the prevalence of dementia in Ireland, on dementia specific services and on demographic trends.  Officials from the Department held discussions with relevant stakeholder groups and the Health Service Executive earlier this year on the first stage of the process.  Arising out of these discussions an advisory committee was formed to oversee a project to provide a comprehensive research evidence base to inform the development of the policy.  I expect this project to be completed and submitted in 2011. Following this, formal work on the national policy will commence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">In addition, the HSE is currently exploring the potential for changes in care pathways for people with dementia, and will make recommendations for the future provision of dementia care across all health and social services.  An audit is under way within the HSE of the current specialist dementia care services available both in residential or hospital settings and community services and it is hoped to have it completed by the end of this year.  This work will also feed into the overall dementia policy formulation.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_611">
            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_1171">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue.  Last Monday night, I attended a meeting in the Devon Inn Hotel in Templeglantine which was attended by more than 200 local people.  The meeting was in response to a number of fatalities that have occurred on the stretch of road down the hill at Barna.  Only two weeks ago, a young 20 year old student, Liva Eglite, was killed on the road and in September three local men who were travelling in a taxi were also killed.  Another person was killed since May this year, which comprises five fatalities on this stretch of road.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">With regard to the alignment of the road, it is over 21 years since a section of the road which goes down the hill was upgraded.  The road led into a bridge and the bridge was removed.  There is now a double lane of traffic going up and down the hill.  However, it leads into a bottleneck and it is at this section that all these fatalities occurred.  There is grave concern about the safety of the N21 at Barna.  The public meeting highlighted that concern and the fears of local people with regard to the lack of activity and commitment to addressing that safety hazard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">Representatives of the National Roads Authority, NRA, and Limerick County Council were invited to the meeting but did not attend.  These public servants did not attend to answer the public's concerns.  I corresponded by e-mail with the National Roads Authority about this.  The reply I received thanked me for the invitation but respectfully informed me that its representatives would not be attending my meeting.  In fact, the meeting was arranged by the general public and I was asked to attend, like every other public representative in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">I understand Limerick County Council has submitted a plan for a re-alignment scheme for the road to the NRA.  I call on the NRA to ensure this is made a priority.  I also ask the Minister to use his influence to ensure the proposals are acted on before any more deaths or serious injuries occur on that road.  The NRA has responded to the council's proposal by stating that it will only be considered as part of works to be carried out in 2011 and that it would be subject to the overall budgetary constraints under which the authority must operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">While I am fully aware of the budgetary situation we face, this issue must be a priority.  It is a matter of life and death and has caused terrible tragedies for families both from the area and outside it.  I do not say that lightly, but in the interests of safety.  The re-alignment and upgrade of this stretch of road must be made a priority.  Otherwise, we will be discussing this again in 12 months with more fatalities having occurred.  That road has claimed lives each year.  The local law abiding, decent people were so concerned that they have initiated a public campaign about it.  I hope the Minister will give it the attention and concern it deserves and that the NRA will respond to the political direction of the Minister and the Government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_612" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1176">I am taking this matter for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and thank Deputy Ferris for raising it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">The Minister for Transport has responsibility for overall policy and the provision of Exchequer funding for the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  Section 17 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended states the National Roads Authority, NRA, has a general duty to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  Section 19, which is even more specific, provides for the NRA to prepare or arrange for the preparation of construction of improvement works on these roads and to allocate funding to such works.  The Minister, therefore, has no direct role or function in the matter of providing funding or issuing directions to the NRA to work on specific sections of our national road network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">The NRA has an ongoing annual programme of safety improvements to the national roads network based on accident statistic data.  It funds an extensive programme of engineering works with the aim of improving road safety and dealing with known collision clusters, formerly known as black spots, on national roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">Over the past five years, an annual average of 120 locations have been the subject of remedial measures.  It is proposed to complete over 150 schemes this year.  Prioritisation of safety related works is determined on a national basis by the NRA; again, the Minister for Transport has no role or function in the specifics of this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">Since 1997 the Government has provided in excess of €15 billion to develop the national road network.  In that time, the NRA has made considerable progress in bringing the network up to standard.  The NRA is reviewing its investment plans for the national roads network.  The review is being carried out based on a commitment in the renewed programme for Government and taking into account available capital resources.  As the House will appreciate, progress on particular road schemes will be dependent on the availability of funds within a significantly reduced capital budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">Road safety is a key priority for the Government and this commitment is underpinned by the road safety strategy, 2007 to 2012.  The strategy's primary aim is to reduce road deaths to no greater than 60 fatalities per million of population by the end of 2012, which equates to an average of 21 road deaths per month or 252 deaths per year.  In 2009, there was a total of 241 fatalities, an average of 20 per month.  The emphasis now is on taking steps to ensure the good progress is continued for each of the remaining years of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">Responsibility for oversight of the implementation of the strategy rests with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and involves participation from several Departments, the Garda Síochána and other agencies.  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006, responsibility for the collection of information on road collisions lies with the RSA.  Based on its statistics, the authority states road collisions are rarely caused by any one single factor.  In most cases, collisions are caused by several factors, including human error in dealing with the driving conditions around which the collision occurred.  According to the RSA road collision facts 2008, driver error is responsible for 90% of collisions, pedestrian error accounts for 6%, and road conditions account for 3%.  It is obvious the personal responsibility of drivers plays a major role in road traffic collisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The RSA and the Garda Síochána recently rolled out the privatised safety cameras initiative to target speeding on all roads at all times of the day and night.  The Minister for Transport understands the section of the N21 in question will be receiving ongoing attention from the new cameras at the direction of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">There is, of course, no acceptable number of road fatalities.  The strategy, however, appears to be working.  Road deaths dropped by nearly half between 1999 and 2009, inclusive.  According to the third report of the European road safety performance index programme, run by the European Transport Safety Council, Ireland is now ranked sixth out of 27 EU member states in road deaths per million population.  This compares well to our eighth position in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">Unfortunately, there will be times when, no matter how good the roads are and no matter how strict the enforcement, the behaviour of the driver will be the determining factor as to whether an accident occurs and how serious it will be.  As we get nearer to Christmas, and at a point where our accident statistics indicate we have reduced fatalities by a further 6% as against this time last year, I ask all drivers to slow down, take care and help to prevent further needless tragic loss of life.</p>

          <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_613">
            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_1186">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this matter.  I originally tabled it last week.  Since then various statements have been released by Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, KPMG and the Irish Bookmakers Association, IBA, each asserting different positions on the report on HRI's expenditure.  For this reason, I will not focus on this but rather wider issues concerning HRI and betting tax generally which should be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">HRI has refused to release information requested from it under the Freedom of Information Act.  As stated in a response to a parliamentary question I tabled, HRI is subject to all the provisions of the freedom of information legislation.  I know HRI rejected the original application for information stating the amount of information requested was deemed to be too large.  I would like to see an effort made to attempt to facilitate the revised request from the IBA.  Any disputes about spending figures etc. would be resolved by the release of this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">Reports in the media today detailed suggestions for betting tax to be increased from 1% to 2% so the revenues raised can be used to fund the two activities, horse racing and breeding.  The author of this report was Colm McCarthy, author of the bord snip nua report in which he recommended reducing funding the horse and greyhound fund by €16.4 million to €51.7 million.  He stated this was still a substantial amount of Exchequer funding for the sector.  Is there a possible conflict between these two stances?</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">I appreciate the value of the racing and breeding industry to Ireland and our economy.  However, now is a time when organisations such as HRI must be able to prove a return for State financing.  The Irish Sports Council which supports over 62 sports receives 24% less funding from the taxpayer than the horse and greyhound racing industries.  Prize money in Irish horse racing is 60% higher, on average, than that offered in England.  While I understand the arguments placed by both sides, we must have a clear picture of how State grants are spent by HRI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">We must ensure best value for money is achieved rather than indiscriminately granting greater funds though proposed tax increases, without ensuring this funding is being used to its best advantage.  For example, many of the country's horse racing tracks appear to have not benefited from State funding.  The all-weather racing track in Dundalk remains closed for half of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">HRI claims substantial prize money must be offered for Ireland to remain an attractive place for top-tier breeders to enter competitions.  However, is HRI achieving best value for money?  Could savings be made in areas such as salaries and administration, which could then be passed on to the prize money fund, rather than throwing money indiscriminately at HRI?</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">It is inherently unfair that a person who bets on soccer, rugby or boxing makes a contribution to HRI but not to the sports in question.  This practice discriminates against other sports, much in need of funding.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_614" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1193">HRI is a commercial State company established under the Horse and Greyhound Act 2001, with a board appointed in accordance with the Horse Racing (Membership) Act 2001 whose duty it is to direct the affairs of the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">Horse racing and breeding is a significant industry in rural areas, supporting approximately 16,000 private sector jobs, often in areas where alternative employment opportunities are limited.  The industry has a regional spread with 26 racecourses, over 770 trainers and some 9,500 breeders spread across the country.  Each of these generates direct employment and supports a diverse network of local suppliers including vets, farriers, feed merchants, transporters, grooms, jockeys etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">Last year, almost 1.25 million people attended Irish race meetings; racing accounts for approximately 80,000 tourist visits every year.  The Punchestown and Galway festivals are worth €45 million and €60 million each to their respective local economies.  Ireland is the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world with exports of thoroughbred horses to over 35 countries worth €175 million in foreign earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">The industry's value to the economy is estimated at €1.1 billion per annum and the industry generates significant foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">Government support for the horse and greyhound industries is provided under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, which was established under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Act 2001.  The Act provides that 80% and 20% of the moneys paid into the fund each year are distributed between Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon, respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">Since 2008, there has been a significant reduction in the amount of public funds allocated to the horse and greyhound fund, falling from €76.3 million in 2008 to €68.1 million in 2009 and €59.3 million this year — a 23% reduction in two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">An independent review of the fund was completed in 2009 and concluded that, while not all aspects of the total contribution of the sector can be definitively quantified, there is adequate direct and indirect evidence to support a strong argument that the horse and greyhound racing industries contribute a major source of direct and indirect employment, give rise to considerable domestic and exports earnings and constitute a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">Funding of both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon supports two important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding and training enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  These industries generate substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy, including farm incomes.  Furthermore, bloodstock breeding is a sustainable and environmentally sound activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">Some recent commentary has focused on the value of prize money at Irish race meetings.  In that regard, it is worth making the point that the value of Irish prize money has been declining in the past two years, from a peak of €60.4 million in 2008 to an anticipated €47.7 million this year — a fall of 21% in two years.  Prize money in 2010 will fall back to below the 2004 figure.  It is also worth noting that for the five flat race classics this year, Horse Racing Ireland's contribution to the total prize fund of €2.5 million was only €20,000 with the balance funded entirely by owners and sponsors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">Prize money is regarded as the lifeblood of racing.  A report commissioned by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association identified that in 2008, €289 million was spent on training fees to win available prize money of €60 million and in the decade between 1999 and 2009, expenditure on training fees and stable staff employment averaged about five times the total prize money available.  The policies pursued in relation to prize money in Ireland over the last decade are regarded as having ensured that some of the best horses in the world have been kept in training in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">Horse Racing Ireland is subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and at no time since its establishment has its efficiency or effectiveness been called into question.  In addition, it has outsourced its internal audit function, which operates in accordance with the framework of codes of best practice, as set out in the code of practice on the governance of State bodies and which reports directly to the company's audit committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">In response to recent allegations made about it by the Irish Bookmakers Association, HRI strongly rejected the claims made.  Having met to consider those claims earlier this week, the board of HRI found them to be "wholly inaccurate and based on a flawed understanding of the racing industry and, in particular, the restructuring which took place following the enactment of the Horse and Greyhound Act in 2001."  Indeed, the authors of the report on which the Irish Bookmakers Association's claims were based, acknowledged that their analysis "did not, nor was it required to, take account of the restructuring of the horse racing industry in 2001, resulting in the transfer of certain administrative functions of the Turf Club to the newly formed HRI".</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">Contrary to the IBA's claims that Horse Racing Ireland's costs are out of control, HRI makes the point that its costs increased by 35% between its first full year of operation in 2002 and 2009.  Over that same period, there was a 28% increase in the number of race meetings.  HRI also makes the point that, since 2008, its administrative costs have reduced by 28% and the number of permanent employees in the HRI group — including the Tote, the four race courses it owns, and Irish Thoroughbred Marketing — has been cut from 176 to 143 in the same period, which is a reduction of 19%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206">In a recent letter to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the chairman of HRI assured the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, that the "board takes its responsibilities in relation to governance and cost control very seriously".</p>

          <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_615">
            <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
            <p eId="para_1207">I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  At a time of high unemployment and emigration we should examine every single possibly of increasing employment.   The closure of the sugar beet industry occurred a number of years ago and there were reasons for that.  Last week, however, the European Court of Auditors issued a report which, to say the least, raised questions about how the decisions were taken.  Ireland ended up as the only member state with just one factory to close and consequently our 80-year-old industry was shut down.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">A number of people have approached me recently to suggest that we should examine the possibility of re-establishing the sugar beet industry here.  This time, they suggest, that such a plant could be linked to the production of ethanol, electricity and a district heating system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The European Court of Auditors' report was highly critical of the initial decision, saying that the information was out of date.  The report also said that overall sugar production has become less competitive as a result of the reforms and that price cuts have not been passed on to consumers.  The Minister of State may be interested to note that the Siúcra brand is now owned by a German company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The price of sugar on world markets has never been higher, as there is a global shortage.  This presents an opportunity for Ireland given the current huge unemployment and mass emigration.  Let us therefore examine this proposal and discuss it to see what the potential is.  For instance, the EU biofuels directive advocates that member states replace petrol and diesel transportation with biofuels.  To that end we should produce more ethanol.  There is a major opportunity to do this if we linked ethanol production with sugar production.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">The report of the European Court of Auditors also said that the Greencore plant was large, modern and potentially efficient.  The ECA report also maintained that sugar production is now controlled by a very small group, with some 75% of EU production currently accounted for by six industrial groups.  There are all sorts of reasons Ireland should reopen this debate on sugar beet production.  This is especially so if we can prove that the original closure decision was flawed.  The ECA report maintains that it was based on outdated information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">The ECA report said that there was no follow up on the impact of the closures of this industry on local communities.  There are many recommendations in the report that should be followed up.  The Government should establish a study group on this matter and invite experts to make submissions to it.  Let us have an open discussion on this suggestion to ascertain its feasibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">Other things could flow from this proposal also and the last debate on horse racing was relevant in this respect.  The importation of pulp for animal feed is all important now, although there was a time when we were self-sufficient in that regard.  That is another reason we should reopen the debate on sugar beet production.  There are many other reasons we should examine this plan, so I will be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">Last year, we imported €99 million worth of sugar, and in 2008 we imported €77 million worth.  Surely that is a reversal of what we should be doing.  Up to a few years ago, we used to export a small quantity of sugar and were self-sufficient in supplies.  Meanwhile, the ECA report stated that no reductions in bulk sugar prices have not been passed on to consumers.  Nobody has benefited therefore and the country has lost out hugely.  Farmers have lost out, as have contractors, former sugar plant workers, consumers and the economy generally.  There is an opportunity here for us to resume sugar production.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">We currently import ethanol from Brazil, so any plan to resume domestic production would be a win-win situation.  The Government should examine this matter.  It should go back to Europe and explain that this decision was flawed initially.  For the good of the nation, let us revisit the decision and see if a resumption of sugar production is feasible.  I am not calling for it to be done immediately, but I want a study to be undertaken to see if it would be feasible for the sugar beet industry to be reopened and remodelled to include ethanol, electricity and pulp production, as well as possibly providing a district heating system through surplus heat from such a plant.</p>

            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_1216">I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I am pleased to address the House on this matter.  As part of the reform of the EU sugar regime in 2006, a temporary restructuring scheme was introduced by the EU Commission with the aim of reducing EU sugar production in order to comply with WTO and other international obligations.  The scheme provided an incentive for sugar processors to renounce sugar quota and dismantle the associated sugar processing plant and it provided compensation for affected stakeholders.  Greencore plc, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the entire Irish quota allocation, decided to avail of this restructuring scheme.  Accordingly, the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining Irish sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">This brought the Irish sugar industry to an end.  As a result of the restructuring scheme, the overall EU sugar quota was reduced by almost 6 million tonnes, of which the Irish quota contributed some 200,000 tonnes.  At the time of the reform negotiations, the Government made strenuous efforts to have the Commission's reform proposals modified in such a way that an efficient sugar industry could have been retained in Ireland.  In the end, there was insufficient political support among our EU partners for the Irish position and our efforts had to be directed at achieving the best possible compensation package.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">The sugar reform package was secured as a whole.  Restructuring aid, diversification aids and the single payment was worth approximately €226 million to Irish beet growers and contractors.  The restructuring and diversification aids were paid to stakeholders concerned in 2007 and 2008.  Greencore plc received €127 million, giving a grand total of €353 million of aid to Ireland under this package.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">Following the restructuring of the EU sugar industry, sugar production is now concentrated in 18 member states, as opposed to 23 before the reform, which enjoy favourable agronomic conditions and over 75% of production is accounted for by seven of these member states, namely France, Germany, Poland, UK, Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.  There is no mechanism under the current regulations that allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the sugar industry.  Any proposal to review the EU sugar quota regime is a matter for the EU Commission in the first instance and any proposal to re-establish a sugar factory in Ireland would, subject to the availability of quota, be a matter for commercial decision by interested parties.  At the time of the closure of Mallow, Greencore plc was approached about the possibility of producing ethanol there but it was not considered to be a viable proposition.</p>

            <p eId="para_1221">Responsibility for ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities rests with the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As regards the Irish United Nations Association (IUNA), following a review of Departmental expenditure in 2009, and taking into account also the recommendations of the McCarthy Report that in the current very difficult budgetary circumstances funding for IUNA should cease, no allocation for grant-in-aid to IUNA was made for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">I do not envisage providing funding to IUNA in the future.  This position has been communicated to IUNA by my Department and the Association is proceeding on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">While a matter for IUNA, I would take the view that the immediate priority for the Association should be reform of its structures and procedures, in line with the recommendations set out in the review and audit of the Association undertaken on behalf of the Department in 2007-2008. I would encourage the Association to seek to engage with private donors to secure alternative sources of funding, following on from implementation of the necessary structural and procedural reforms recommended in these reports, including efforts to expand its membership base.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1227">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 23 and 26 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">The political and human rights situation in Sri Lanka remains a serious cause of concern.  The response of the Sri Lankan Government falls short of addressing the outstanding issues or the legitimate calls from the international community and respected human rights organisations for action.  The Sri Lankan Government needs to initiate a sustainable peace and reconciliation process which addresses all outstanding issues including the rights of the Tamil population.  The international community also has a role to play in supporting and monitoring the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">In August this year, the Member States of the European Union, including Ireland, suspended special duty-free access given to Sri Lankan exports under the Generalised System of Preferences.  The suspension came after the Sri Lankan authorities failed to deliver a written undertaking on three human rights conventions dealing with torture, children's rights and civil and political rights.  The estimated cost of the suspension to Sri Lanka is €360 million a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">While the Sri Lankan Government established a ‘Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission' in May 2010, there has been broad international agreement that this inquiry fails to meet the needs of the victims of the conflict.  A number of shortcomings have been highlighted including the Commission's restricted mandate which prevents it from investigating war crimes allegations, particularly those committed by the Sri Lankan army.  There are also concerns regarding its lack of independence and the absence of provisions to protect witnesses who may wish to testify.  The result is that many groups, including international human rights organisations, have refused to co-operate with the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">Despite the end of the war, foreign media still require permission from the Sri Lankan Government to report from former battle zones.  The failure to grant access to foreign media seeking to cover the Commission hearings held outside of Colombo further call into question its credibility.  If the Sri Lankan Government is genuine in its intent to further peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka and to address the outstanding issues of the Tamil population, it is vital that the Commission is completely open and transparent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">The Permanent People's Tribunal is an independent international opinion tribunal which held a discussion on Sri Lanka in Dublin in January 2010.  The Tribunal was an NGO-led exercise in which many leading international human rights activists participated.  After considering the evidence presented, including testimony from witnesses and victims, the panel concluded that the Sri Lankan Government and military were guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity during the civil war.  The conclusions drawn supported the widely held view that serious breaches of international humanitarian law occurred during and after the final stages of the civil war.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">While in general I support the recommendations made by the Tribunal, I was disappointed that the Tribunal considered only the actions of the Sri Lankan Government and military and did not also examine the actions of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam forces, leaving its work open to criticism by the Government of Sri Lanka and others as biased.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">A key recommendation made by the Tribunal was the call for an UN-led inquiry into war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated during the war.  Other recommendations included the need for Internally Displaced Persons and detainees to be allowed to return to their homes without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">Regrettably, intensive efforts by the European Union last year to secure the agreement of the UN Human Rights Council for the establishment of an international inquiry were unsuccessful.  However, I remain firmly of the view that an impartial inquiry of this kind could contribute to national peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">More recently, a panel of experts was established by the UN Secretary-General to investigate the reports of violations of international humanitarian law in Sri Lanka.  While weaker than a full commission of inquiry, I believe its work can form an important element in the overall response of the international community to Sri Lanka's post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">Disappointingly, the Government of Sri Lanka has reacted with hostility to the appointment of the panel of experts, describing it as an unwarranted and unnecessary interference in the affairs of a sovereign nation.  Once again, I take this opportunity to call on the Sri Lankan Government to co-operate fully with the UN investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">I will continue to follow the situation carefully and work to ensure that Sri Lanka remains a priority at European Union level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1245">Shawan Jabarin is the Director of Al-Haq, an important and respected Palestinian human rights organisation which is supported by Irish Aid. Through our Mission in Ramallah my Department has regular contacts with Al Haq and with Mr. Jabarin personally.   He has been consistently refused permission to leave Palestine since June 2006, when he returned from a fellowship at the Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway. Ireland and other EU partners have made representations to allow him to travel to human rights events in Europe, but without success. The Israeli authorities have insisted that they have serious security concerns in relation to Mr. Jabarin, and this view has been upheld by Israeli courts, although the evidence on which it was based has remained secret.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">On this occasion Mr. Jabarin has been refused permission to travel to the tenth anniversary event of the Irish Centre for Human Rights, which takes place tomorrow, and I understand he intends to participate by video link.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_621">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1248">On 26 October, the Iraqi High Tribunal sentenced to death five representatives of the former regime, of which Iraq's former deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz is perhaps the best known. I have consistently and clearly set out the Government's firm opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances. Ireland was supportive of a prompt expression by the EU of its opposition to these planned executions. On 11 November 2010, the EU (Denmark as EU local Presidency in Iraq) met the Iraqi Minister for Human Rights, Mrs Wijdan Mikail Salim, to express its concern at the decision of the High Tribunal and its concern at the executions carried out in Iraq since the end of the <i>de facto</i> moratorium. The EU called on Iraq to halt these planned executions, convert their sentences, and to resume the <i>de facto</i>   suspension of the death penalty pending its legal abolition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">In expressing its grave concern at these planned executions, the European Union fully acknowledged the serious nature of the crimes involved, and expressed its sincere sympathies to the surviving family and friends of the victims. The EU also pointed out that it repeatedly condemned the systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law committed by Saddam Hussein and the members of his regime. However, the European Union stated that it does not believe the atrocities under Saddam Hussein will be mitigated by the death of Tariq Aziz and his co-condemned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">It is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in Iraq that the Iraqi authorities take the step of ending capital punishment. These sentences represent a potentially negative development at a time when, in spite of serious challenges, Iraq is making progress in the journey to becoming a stable democracy. On the same day as the EU's meeting with Mrs Salim, Iraq's newly convened parliament appointed a Sunni Arab member of the opposition al-Iraqiyya coalition as Speaker under the deal which also sees outgoing President Talabani and Prime Minister Maliki re-appointed to their positions. I firmly believe that the death sentences are at odds with much-needed national reconciliation in Iraq epitomised by the new power-sharing deal, and contrasts with the growing number of States supporting the resolutions on the moratorium on the use of the death penalty, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 2007 and 18 December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">Ireland, together with its EU partners, remains firmly opposed to the use of capital punishment under all circumstances, seeking a global moratorium on the death penalty as a first step. The EU considers capital punishment to be cruel and inhuman, failing to provide deterrence to criminal behaviour, and representing an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1253">As the incident to which the Deputy refers is now the subject of legal proceedings in another jurisdiction, I will not comment on any elements which are <i>sub judice</i>, but will limit my reply to the response of my Department in providing consular assistance to the Irish citizens concerned.  My Department has been in contact with the London-based organisers of the Road to Hope convoy since early November, on the basis that eight Irish citizens were participating in the initiative, which also had mainly UK and some other country nationals on board.  The Consular Assistance Section has co-operated closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London, and kept our relevant Embassies updated on the nature, composition and proposed route of the convoy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">I am informed that the convoy experienced delays and difficulties along their intended route when they were unable to cross the closed land border between Libya and Egypt and, as a result, has been held up at the port of Derna in Libya since late last month. The Consular Assistance Section has been assured by the convoy organisers and by the British Foreign Office that there is no consular concern associated with the convoy group at Derna.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">I am also informed that the organisers had made attempts to engage a private company to charter a vessel to enable the convoy to reach its intended destination and that these negotiations, apparently, broke down. The Department's Duty Officer received notification overnight on 10-11 November of an alleged incident at the port of Derna, which led to a number of those in the convoy, including two Irish citizens, departing on the vessel with destination unknown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Our Consular Assistance Section immediately made contacts with colleagues in the British Consular Service and with the convoy organisers in London in order to establish the facts of the situation. Having been informed that the vessel's likely destination was Greece, our Embassy in Athens contacted the relevant Greek authorities to confirm our interest in the wellbeing of the Irish citizens on board. Similarly, our Embassy in Rome, accredited to Libya, made contact with the Libyan authorities on behalf of the Irish citizens involved and those remaining in Libya.  When the vessel arrived in Greek waters, our Embassy in Athens sought consular access to our citizens at the earliest possible opportunity and made representations that they be treated in accordance with international obligations. The Embassy kept in close contact with all the relevant Greek authorities over the course of the incident: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Port Authorities, Coast Guard, Ministry for Shipping, and Ministry for Citizens' Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">Our Embassy was present at the port over the weekend while the vessel was processed. Consular access was allowed once Greek security and immigration procedures had been fulfilled. Our Embassy made several requests regarding food and water, access to legal advice and representation, and access to an interpreter on behalf of our citizens and also provided food, water, and essentials to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">Our Embassy also attended a hearing involving our two citizens on 14 November. This was a preliminary hearing by the Prosecutor in the case and I understand that they were charged with damage to the ship. They were advised by the Prosecutor that, after a preliminary review of the case, that they were being released on unconditional bail with the only stipulation that they appoint legal representation in Greece to deal with the case, as the enquiry would continue in their absence, and that they were free to leave Greece whenever they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Our Embassy has provided emergency travel documents to both citizens to enable them to return home, if they so wish and has remained in contact with them since their release to provide assistance and local advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">I can assure the Deputy that throughout the duration of the incident, all possible consular assistance has been provided to the two citizens involved, and I am satisfied that, through my Department's interventions with the relevant authorities in several countries, the wellbeing of our citizens was assured in difficult circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">I am aware of reports that there have been abuses perpetuated by British soldiers in prison facilities in Iraq. I welcome the fact that these serious allegations have been brought to UK courts of law for detailed consideration as to whether further actions such as judicial review or prosecution of alleged perpetrators are merited.  Of particular importance is a case being brought by lawyers acting for more than 140 Iraqi civilians who allege they suffered torture and degrading treatment at the hands of British soldiers and interrogators between March 2003 and December 2008 in the British-controlled detention facilities in Iraq. There was a hearing in this case last week and judges are due to give their ruling later this year on whether a judicial review of this matter should be opened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">Separately, I understand that the director of military prosecutions in Britain is currently considering whether three UK soldiers may face charges relating to alleged abuses of prisoners in Iraqi prisons. The UK government has not released the names of the soldiers or precise details of the alleged abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">These cases follow the Inquiry into the killing of the Iraqi national, Baha Mousa, which the UK government instituted in 2008 and which is due to report next year. This relates to the 2007 conviction of a British corporal on war crime charges in connection with the death of Baha Mousa during detention by British forces in Basra in 2003. A further inquiry into the actions of British soldiers in Iraq, the al-Sweady Inquiry, is due to start hearing evidence in 2011. The al-Sweady inquiry is a public inquiry into allegations that Iraqi nationals were detained after a gunfight with British soldiers in Iraq in 2004 and were then unlawfully killed at a British camp called Camp Abu Naji, as well as further allegations that others had been mistreated at that camp and later at a detention facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">I believe that it is right and proper that these serious allegations are investigated by the UK government and the judiciary in the most thorough manner possible.  At a time when the EU and its allies are attempting to counter the insidious phenomenon of terrorism, it is imperative that member states maintain the highest standards and be scrupulous in our own actions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1267">There are currently two Irish Embassies in South America — in Argentina and Brazil. The Embassy in Buenos Aires is accredited to Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay on a non-resident basis.  The Irish Embassy in Mexico is also accredited to a number of other countries in South and Central America, namely Colombia, El Salvador, Peru and Venezuela.  The diplomatic network is supported by Honorary Consuls in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.  Our diplomatic missions work in close cooperation with the State Agencies on an ongoing basis to identify new trade and investment opportunities for Irish companies in the region, particularly in high growth and emerging markets.  Ireland exported goods and services to the value of €1bn to South America last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">Ireland has worked as a development partner in South America for over thirty years.  Since 2007, Irish Aid allocated over €7.3m to NGOs active in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">The importance Ireland attaches to relations with countries in South America is also symbolised by the cultural programmes put in place to mark the bicentenary celebrations of the independence of Argentina and Chile this year, including the recent Naval Service visit to both countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">The size and scale of our diplomatic network is kept under review by the Government on an ongoing basis in the light of national priorities and available resources.  As always, any decision to open a new Mission must be based on a clear anticipated significant return for the State.  This is all the more important in the context of the current budgetary pressures to which all Departments, including my own, are subject.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1272">At its meeting on 28 and 29 October, the European Council asked President Van Rompuy to undertake consultations with Member States including on the question of creating a permanent crisis resolution mechanism and the possibility of limited Treaty change required to that effect. I understand that bilateral consultations will begin later this month between President Van Rompuy's office and individual Member States. The European Council has agreed to revert to the matter at its next meeting on 16 and 17 December, with a view to taking the final decision on both the outline of a crisis mechanism and on a limited Treaty amendment, so that any change can be ratified by mid-2013 at the latest.  Ahead of the October European Council meeting, proposals were also made by a small number of Member States, most prominently France and Germany, that the Treaties should be amended to provide for the suspension of the voting rights of a Member State in serious violation of the basic principles of Economic and Monetary Union. This was a particularly controversial proposal and I understand that there was little enthusiasm for it at the October European Council meeting. Nonetheless, the President of the European Council intends, as a subsequent and completely separate exercise to the consultations I have describe above, to consult with Member States on this matter. No timeframe or deadline has been placed on this process. We will await President Van Rompuy's separate report to the European Council on this issue at a future date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">With regard to the necessity for a referendum on any possible Treaty amendment, clearly it is far too early to pronounce on that matter. We will have to examine very carefully whatever emerges from the process which is now underway. The October European Council explicitly stated that what is being sought is limited Treaty change. When we have a concrete proposal for an amendment to the Treaties, we will carefully assess whether it has any constitutional implications for Ireland. At that stage, whatever steps are required to enable Ireland to ratify an amendment will be put in train.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">It is worth bearing in mind that not all aspects of Treaty change have required the referendum route for ratification in Ireland. Amendments to allow the accession of new Member States have, for example, been dealt with here through Oireachtas approval.</p>

            <p eId="para_1277">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 50 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">Colombia was one of sixteen countries to be reviewed at the session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council, which took place in Geneva between 1 and 15 December 2008.  Ireland participated actively at the session, putting questions and recommendations to seven countries, including Colombia. The questions and recommendations of participating States, including those from Ireland, are reflected in the outcome reports that were adopted by the UPR Working Group and can be viewed on the website of the Human Rights Council: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspx</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">In relation specifically to the examination of Colombia, the Irish Delegation raised issues and made recommendations regarding human rights defenders, victims of gender-based violence and extrajudicial killings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">Ireland welcomed Colombian government assurances on the protection of Human Rights Defenders and the development of a Protection Programme for Human Rights Defenders. Ireland recommended also that Colombian legislation on Human Rights Defenders be implemented in full.  Ireland recommended that the Colombian government implement the May 2008 Constitutional Court ruling that the witness protection programme be revised to deal with gender-based violence.  Ireland recommended also that the Colombian Government implement urgently the recommendations of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">In welcoming Colombian government efforts to end the incidence of extrajudicial killings in Colombia, Ireland further recommended that the new National Plan of Action on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law be used to address comprehensively the issue of extra-judicial killings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Then Foreign Minister Bermudez subsequently wrote to me in 9 December 2009 outlining in detail the steps that Colombia had undertaken, particularly in response to Ireland's recommendations at the Human Rights Council.  In my response to Foreign Minister Bermudez' letter, I acknowledged the progress made but equally stressed the need for further serious efforts by the Colombian Government in order to meet its human rights commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The State being reviewed has the primary responsibility to implement the recommendations contained in the final outcome. The UPR ensures that all countries are accountable for progress or failure in implementing these recommendations. When the time comes for the second review of a State, that State must provide information on what they have been doing to implement the recommendations made during the first review four years earlier. The international community may assist in implementing the recommendations and conclusions regarding capacity-building and technical assistance, in consultation with the country concerned.  In the case of Colombia, the European Union monitors the human rights situation closely, including through a dedicated human rights dialogue, and as part of that process it will keep under review Colombia's progress on UPR recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">On 7 August, President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón was inaugurated as President of Colombia.  During his inaugural address, President Santos emphasised that human rights would be a key issue during his term of office.  Specifically, the President stated that it was his firm position that respect for life was a sacred mandate, that respect for the freedom and integrity of people was an inescapable obligation and that advocacy of human rights was the firm and irrevocable commitment of his government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">President Santos has stated that Colombia's Ministry of Justice will be re-established as the Ministry of Justice and Rights with a view to strengthening the state's policy in support of justice and protecting fundamental rights.  I am encouraged that President Santos has tasked his Vice President, Angelina Garzón, with particular responsibility for taking forward his government's programme in this important area.  Furthermore, I have written to Foreign Minister María Ángela Holguin Cuéllar to indicate my continuing interest in human rights dialogue with the Colombian government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">I welcome the introduction by President Santos of a Land Reform Bill which aims to return two million hectares over the next four years to farmers who were forced off their land by illegal armed groups and a Victims' Law Bill which would provide reparation for more than four million victims of Colombia's long-standing armed conflict. The legislation includes provisions for medical care, education and humanitarian aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">The Government will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Colombia through our Embassy, which is based in Mexico, and in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1290">The European Union is committed to the elimination of anti-personnel landmines worldwide and is one of the leading donors for the clearance and destruction of landmines. The EU is also a major contributor to providing humanitarian support for the victims of landmines.  The Second Review Conference of the Anti-Personnel Landmine (Ottawa) Convention was hosted by Colombia in 2009, and in June 2008, the EU adopted a new Joint Action in support of the universalisation of the Ottawa Convention, and towards preparations for its Second Review Conference.  The Joint Action offers specific assistance to States Parties (including Colombia) especially in relation to demining, victim assistance and stockpile destruction. In addition, the EU provides assistance in crisis situations through facilities such as the Humanitarian Aid Instrument and the Instrument for Stability. Member States and the European Commission have committed €1.8 billion in global assistance for the period 2002 to 2009 making the European Union the largest contributor to mine action worldwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">As the Deputy is aware, Colombia is one of the most mine-affected countries in the world and landmines kill or injure an estimated 1,100 people each year. In 2007, Colombia established the Presidential Programme for Mine Action which is responsible for the coordination and regulation of comprehensive mine action efforts in Colombia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">The EU provided €2m in support for projects in mine risk education and victim assistance in Colombia after a call for local proposals in 2006.  A separate EU programme from 2005 — 2010 provided €2.5m towards institutional strengthening of the Colombian National Mines Action capacity, particularly in areas such as humanitarian demining, mine risk education and victim assistance. A new project, entitled ‘Strengthening Mine Action in Colombia' is expected to be launched in January 2011 for the period to 2015/16, with the EU providing €6m of the project's total of €7m.  Its specific objectives will include effective decontamination from landmines, improvised explosive devices, and unexploded ordnance, and the release of land to rural populations.  Such assistance is just one element of the EU's overall strategy of support for Colombia which is implemented, <i>inter alia,</i> through bilateral, Andean sub-regional and Latin American dialogue as well as through other EU Instruments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1300">I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">Ireland and the European Union regard all Israeli settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories as illegal. However, without prejudice to that position, the partial freeze on new settlement construction in the first half of this year, limited as it was, was an important element in creating the atmosphere to allow substantive political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians to begin. Despite almost universal international calls on Israel to renew this construction freeze when it expired on 26 September, so as to allow the talks to continue, the Israeli Government did not do so, and instead allowed construction to resume. I made clear my profound disappointment at this decision in my address to the UN General Assembly on 27 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">The settlement enterprise, some of which is in private hands and some the direct action of the Israeli Government, is aimed at changing the demographic balance on the ground, and creating facts which will dictate the shape of any future negotiated peace. It also involves the progressive expropriation of Palestinian lands, expulsion of families, and destruction of their homes. In the weeks since the moratorium ended, settlers have gone ahead in establishing new house starts or foundations for new building, which may not be covered by any renewed freeze. At the same time, there have been a number of highly publicised announcements of construction permits, building plans and other planning stages. These are part of the ongoing and relentless process of settlement expansion, the details and stages of which are kept deliberately opaque and unclear, including, many observers believe, to public opinion in Israel.  The effect of these developments on both Palestinian public opinion, and the ability of their leaders to command support for serious negotiations with Israel, is clear to everyone, and it must be a matter of the greatest concern that the Israeli Government does not appear to recognise this, or accord it sufficient importance. I would appeal to all sides, and particularly the Government of Israel, to recognise that the greatest possible restraint should be the highest priority at this time. I would expect broad endorsement of this message when the Foreign Affairs Council meets in Brussels next week to discuss, inter alia, the latest developments in the MEPP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">At this moment, there are hopes that a renewed settlement construction freeze may be agreed shortly. Ireland and the EU have made clear our strong support for the efforts of the United States to bring this about. I have dealt with these developments in more detail in response to earlier questions on today's Order Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_1306">I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">Unfortunately, no part of the world is totally free from human rights abuses. Ireland, both bilaterally and in association with the European Union and other like-minded partners, makes frequent and numerous interventions with regard to human rights concerns in the countries which have the most serious human rights abuses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including official channels, reports of the United Nations Treaty Monitoring Bodies, reports of Independent Experts and Special Rapporteurs appointed by the United Nations and international and Irish non-governmental and civil society organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question. We do this bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council.  The 65th Session of the UN General Assembly is currently taking place in New York. Ireland is playing an active role in negotiating draft resolutions on Iran, Burma and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">We support the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. At these UN bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries, as circumstances require.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">Ireland has engaged proactively with the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review mechanism since its creation in March 2006. At the latest session of the UPR, which took place in Geneva, from 1-12 November 2010, Ireland made a number of interventions, raising issues such as gender based violence, gender equality, fair judicial proceedings, ending criminal sanctions on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, ratification and implementation of the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the death penalty and the protection of human rights defenders within the States under review.  Ireland asked questions of or made recommendations to Honduras, Lebanon, Liberia, Malawi, Mongolia and the United States of America.  Member States are expected to report to the Human Rights Council on their follow up to their examination under the Universal Periodic Review process, including whether or not they have implemented their UPR recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">The risk of human rights violations is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak. Development is essential to allow people the full enjoyment of their human rights, and this is a key concern for Ireland's development co-operation programme. Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote human rights, including strengthening government systems and in-country human rights institutions, in particular through legal training. Support is also provided for legal aid programmes targeted at victims of human rights abuses. Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance in several programme countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_1318">I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 120 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">Haiti is facing a severe cholera outbreak which has claimed nearly 1000 lives and continues to spread. The situation is made all the worse by the fact that hundreds of thousands are living in makeshift settlements with poor sanitation and hygiene following the January earthquake, which killed 230,000 people and left 1.5 million homeless. I saw the desperate situation for myself when I visited Haiti earlier this year. It has been further compounded by the widespread flooding which followed Hurricane Tomas earlier this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">In effect the Haitian authorities and the international humanitarian community are now reacting to three emergencies at once.  Ireland and the European Union have responded to the cholera outbreak by providing additional resources to combat the disease, which is primarily waterborne. The Government has provided €500,000 to Plan Ireland and Goal for the provision of clean water, sanitation and hygiene equipment to those left homeless by January's earthquake and now at most risk of infection in the temporary camps. The funds will also support the training of local health staff and communities on cholera awareness and prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">In addition I have ordered the dispatch of forty metric tonnes of tents and tarpaulins from pre-positioned stocks in Panama in order to provide cover to those left without shelter by Hurricane Tomas and subsequent flooding.  These will be distributed by Concern and the International Organisation for Migration. Ireland has now allocated a total of €7.6 million in earthquake, hurricane and cholera assistance to Haiti since the beginning of this year, including €1 million in the form of debt relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">At EU level, the European Commission mobilised its Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) on 5 November to coordinate assistance from Member States in response to both the hurricane and cholera outbreak.  The Commission allocated €5.8 million to support health interventions in the affected areas of the country and contingency planning in those areas which have not yet been affected.  In addition, the EU Delegation in Port-au-Prince is working with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to identify other possible support, such as the provision of supplies for the country's central pharmaceutical store.  The Commission has deployed its regional health expert from Managua to track the evolution of the epidemic and to provide further advice.  This expert will work closely with a mission being carried out by the European Centre for Disease Control in Stockholm which will examine the causes of the cholera outbreak and help formulate a strategy for EU support to the epidemiological surveillance system in Haiti.</p>

            <p eId="para_1324">The European Commission adopted its 2010 Enlargement Package on 9 November. Commissioner for Enlargement and External Relations Stefan Fuele emphasised the importance of the EU's Enlargement policy and stressed the significance of credibility in the process, in terms of conditionality and the efforts of candidate counties.  Regarding Croatia, the Commission confirmed that the accession negotiations have reached their "final phase".  Emphasis was placed on work still to do in terms of fundamental rights and judicial reform if Croatia wanted to avoid a Cooperation and Verification Mechanism after accession.  The situation will be further assessed in the first quarter of 2011. The Commission's Progress Report on Turkey acknowledged Turkey's continuing reform process with reference to the constitutional reform package. The report suggested that the rate of progress could be better.  Fulfilling obligations regarding the Ankara Protocol and progress towards bilateral relations with Cyprus are seen as urgent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">Iceland's screening is to start later this month.  Screening involves the Commission working with the Icelandic authorities to examine Iceland's laws, compare them with those of the EU, and determine what differences exist.  This is in order to identify areas that may need adjustment so as to be in line with the EU system.  The Commission stressed the importance of ensuring Iceland's citizens were kept properly informed about the implications of EU membership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">Regarding potential candidate countries of the Western Balkans, Commissioner Fuele announced that negotiations for accession to the European Union should be opened with Montenegro and Albania once they have achieved the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria and in particular the Copenhagen political criteria requiring the stability of institutions guaranteeing notably the rule of law.  The Commission recommended that the Council grant Montenegro the status of candidate country.  No such recommendation was made in regard to Albania, in relation to which the Commission made an additional reference to the need to guarantee democracy.  The Commission reaffirmed its opinion on Macedonia, namely that a solution is necessary to the name issue. Serbia was deemed to be well-placed to fulfil the requirements under the SAA and was continuing to cooperate with the ICTY, which is seen as an essential condition for membership. While regional cooperation was highlighted as a Serbian strength, a more positive attitude towards cooperation with Kosovo was urged, in particular in relation to regional economic cooperation. On Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission said that there was a need for a government to be formed quickly and for reforms, notably aligning the constitution with the European Court of Human Rights.  There was also a need to move forward on the conditions to allow the Office of the High Representative to be removed.  Kosovo was deemed to have made progress in a number of areas but still faced major challenges, notably in regional cooperation.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_633">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1328">Last May the European Commission adopted its draft budget for 2011 proposing a 5.9% increase in payment appropriations over 2010. The Council's position, adopted in August, approved 2.91% in payment appropriations. The European Parliament in October reversed the funding reduction by the Council and set a 2011 budget at close to the Commission's initial draft budget. As no agreement was reached at that stage a Conciliation Committee (consisting of representatives of the Council and the European Parliament) was established at the end of October with a view to finding agreement between the two sides.  There was some discussion at the last European Council meeting on 28-29 October 2010 on the issue of the EU's 2011 budget. EU leaders agreed at that meeting that "it is essential that the European Union budget and the forthcoming Multi-annual Financial Framework reflect the consolidation efforts being made by Member States to bring deficit and debt on to a more sustainable path". En marge of the October European Council meeting a group of thirteen EU Heads of State and Government (UK, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Estonia and Malta) wrote jointly to President Van Rompuy and Prime Minister Leterme (as Presidency of the Council) in which they made clear that the maximum increase acceptable to them is 2.91%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">The conciliation process between the Council, led by the Belgian Presidency and the European Parliament continued to seek agreement right up to the deadline for the conclusion of the process which was 15 November 2010. Regrettably, agreement was not reached between the two sides. The 2.91% increase in payment appropriations for the 2011 budget was broadly agreed between the Council and the European Parliament, however the Parliament sought a political declaration which would have given an indication of how it might be involved in practice in the next Multi-annual Financial Framework (MFF) and in relation to Own Resources. A number of Member States were unprepared to go beyond the letter of the Treaty provisions with regard to the European Parliament's role in the forthcoming MFF; the Parliament maintained their insistence on a political declaration as mentioned, and the result was that agreement was not reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">What now happens is that the Commission must present a new budget proposal. If agreement is not reached on a new budget proposal by 1 January 2011, then the EU would proceed on the basis of "provisional twelfths" (one twelfth of the previous year's budget being released each month). This would be a less than ideal outcome as it would have consequences for ongoing regular expenditure and may effectively halt expenditure on new projects, if funds were unavailable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Throughout this extended process, Ireland has sought to support the Belgian Presidency in their efforts to reach agreement with the European Parliament. We regret that the conciliation process has not yielded a positive outcome on this occasion. We will continue to work with partners with a view to seeking agreement on an EU budget for 2011 at the earliest possible juncture.</p>

            <p eId="para_1333">The continued captivity in Gaza of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was kidnapped from Israel by Palestinian militants in June 2006, represents a deplorable situation for the soldier and his family, which I have repeatedly condemned. I would once again appeal for his release and his return to his family in Israel.  It is also deplorable that the Red Cross has been refused access to him, his family cannot send letters to him, and they receive only periodic confirmation that he is still alive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">Efforts have been going on behind the scenes for some time, brokered by Egypt, to facilitate a deal between Israel and Hamas on a prisoner exchange that would allow for Sergeant Shalit's overdue release. Unfortunately, while there was hope earlier this year that a deal was imminent, these negotiations have not yet led to a positive outcome. I do not intend to try to intervene actively in these highly sensitive contacts, which could only confuse the clear lines of communication which have been established, but I hope very much for their successful outcome.</p>

         the action the EU is taking in order to deal with the suffering of the Saharawi people who remain denied their promised independence for over three decades 
        [43137/10]

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1336">The European Union is taking action in a number of ways to assist the Saharawi people. EU member states provide funding and assistance to Saharawi refugees through the EU's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection office (ECHO). ECHO has provided over €155 million assistance to Saharawi refugees since its inception in 1993, making it one of the most important donors to the Saharawi camps. In 2009 it contributed €11 million euro to improve living conditions for the Saharawi refugees. Food aid is a major component of this funding, accounting for €5.5 million of the annual allocation. Other work funded by ECHO includes ensuring access to safe drinking water, public-awareness campaigns in hygiene, improving sanitation, training local hospital personnel, distributing essential drugs and providing building materials so that the refugees' shelters better resist flash floods and harsh weather conditions.  In addition to providing relief on the ground, the EU is also urgently engaged in trying to find a political solution to this ongoing and long-standing dispute, in particular by actively supporting the efforts of UN Secretary General Ban's Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, to address this situation. Representatives of the Polisario Front, Morocco and Algeria, together with other interested states, met in New York last week to discuss this issue. I welcome the renewed impetus to political dialogue resulting from this meeting and from the agreement reached to hold further discussions between the parties in December and January. The agreement reached at last weeks' meeting to reactivate the family reunion visit scheme is also a welcome development and important confidence-building measure. It is my hope that the two sides capitalise on this opportunity to engage in constructive dialogue and do not allow themselves to be deterred by the recent worsening of relations, in particular following the recent violence resulting in a number of deaths which occurred after Moroccan security forces broke up a peaceful protest camp established by Saharwi activists on the outskirts of Laayoune.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">Ireland has consistently supported the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara as well as the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination. My Department is in regular contact with the Polisario Front and officials last week met the Polisario Representative to Ireland to discuss developments in Western Sahara. The critical blockage remains Morocco's refusal to allow a referendum in the territory which would include an option of independence for the people of the Western Sahara. This has been provided for in a number of UN peace plans, and it is difficult to see that there can be any genuine self-determination without such a referendum.  Ireland will continue its dialogue with both Morocco and the Polisario, through their representatives based here in Ireland, to encourage support for the UN Secretary General's good offices mission and the efforts of Personal Envoy Ross to achieve some measure of political progress and increased confidence between both sides.</p>

            <p eId="para_1339">The G20 grouping brings together the 19 leading industrialised and emerging countries and the European Union.  The fifth Summit meeting of the G20 was held in Seoul on 11-12 November.  It was attended by the leaders of the G20, the IMF, the World Bank, the UN, the World Trade Organization, the OECD, the African Union and other regional groupings.  On this occasion, the Heads of Government of Ethiopia, Malawi, Singapore, Spain and Vietnam were also invited to attend.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">The Seoul Summit was very clearly focused on the global economic crisis.  It agreed on the need to put jobs at the heart of the recovery, to provide social protection and decent work and to ensure accelerated growth in low income countries.  It was the first G20 Summit to include development on the agenda, and the participants agreed the Seoul Development Consensus for Shared Growth, to complement the commitments made in September at the UN Review Summit on the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">The Development Consensus focuses on working in partnership with developing countries to help them build the capacity to achieve and maximise their growth potential.  It includes a set of concrete measures in a Multi-Year Action Plan to promote key development outcomes in areas such as food security, economic growth and job creation. The action plan is based on the core principle that enduring and meaningful poverty reduction cannot be achieved without inclusive, sustainable and resilient growth. A high-level panel will monitor the implementation of the action plan and report back to future G20 Summits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">The G20 leaders also committed to bringing the Doha Development Round to a successful and balanced conclusion and to working towards a modernised International Monetary Fund with greater representation of dynamic emerging and developing countries.  They reaffirmed their commitment to fight climate change and looked forward to the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness to be held in South Korea in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">I warmly welcome the inclusion of development issues on the agenda of a G20 summit and the establishment of a Multi-Year Action Plan to complement and strengthen international commitment to the achievement of the MDGs.  I particularly welcome the strong focus on food security in the action plan. The acknowledgement of the need for increased investment and financial support for agriculture, the commitment to promoting better access to markets for smallholder producers and the endorsement of the Rome Principles for enhancing global policy coherence are wholly consistent with our priorities for hunger and the recommendations of the Government's Hunger Task Force published in 2008.  The Government has made the fight against hunger a cornerstone of our aid programme.  We will continue to take an international leadership role on the global hunger crisis, and will work closely with our partners in Africa, our EU partners and the US and other G20 states in order to coordinate effective action to tackle the scandal of hunger in the world today.</p>

It is deeply regrettable for Iraq as a whole that its Christian community has decreased significantly in recent years because many Iraqi Christians have felt forced to emigrate from their home country due to fears for their safety. Iraq has had a Christian community since the early days of Christianity. Those that perpetrate these outrages are attempting to undermine Iraq's identity as a pluralistic state in which Christians, Muslims and people of other religions can peacefully co-exist. The EU is determined to support Iraq's leadership in ensuring that stability and security returns to Iraq for all Iraqis.  Groups such as Al Qaeda in Iraq who seek to destabilise the country with such attacks have taken advantage of the power vacuum since the March 2010 elections. I therefore welcome the fact that Iraq's Parliament finally reconvened on 11 November and the agreement on the formation of a new power-sharing government which has now been reached. I am encouraged that the first act of the newly convened Iraqi parliament was to appoint a Sunni Arab member of the opposition al-Iraqiyya coalition as Speaker under the deal which also sees outgoing President Talabani and Prime Minister Maliki re-appointed to their positions. I hope that Prime Minister Maliki will be able to assemble a representative Cabinet without undue delay which can begin immediately to address effectively the issue of security in Iraq. Ireland, together with its EU partners, is determined to do everything possible to assist and support the new Iraqi government's efforts to improve security for all Iraqis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1349">On 3 September last, the Foreign Ministers of Sweden and Finland proposed setting up an EU Institute for Peace, which would engage in conflict resolution activities worldwide and develop the EU's capacity to engage in mediation activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">The announcement of this proposal coincided with a period of intense efforts to establish the European External Action Service (EEAS) and has served a useful purpose in focusing attention on the role the EU wishes to play in conflict resolution and mediation activities. Ireland places strong emphasis on the need for the EU to be active in international efforts to resolve conflict and to reduce the drivers of conflict.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1361">I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 125 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States remains an important priority for this Government.  The Government is also committed to working with our friends in Congress to enhance Ireland's bilateral visa arrangements with the US through the establishment of a two year renewable E-3 visa facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation.  I would urge anybody who might be tempted to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of their plight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">My Department, and the Embassy in Washington in particular, has continued to work proactively on the issue with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates, including since the Congressional elections held on 2 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">The Government is encouraged by President Obama's continued commitment to resolving this issue- a view he shared when the Taoiseach and I met him in Washington in March. President Obama has since reiterated that commitment on a number of occasions.  Earlier this year, President Obama welcomed what he described as the strong outline proposal for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez.  Following active engagement with our friends in Congress, this proposal included provision for a path towards the regularisation of the status of the undocumented, including the Irish.  It also specifically contained provision for an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens which was subsequently included in an   immigration reform bill introduced by Senator Menendez.  Though this was only the first step in a lengthy legislative process, it represented an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">However, the outcome of the Congressional elections on 2 November presents significant new political challenges for immigration reform legislation.  Given that the outgoing Congress will continue in place until January, it will be some time before new committees are established and the long term prospects for reform are clearer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead.  Since 2006 the Government has provided a total support of $325,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and in September of this year, I met with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres and the Irish Lobby for Immigration reform to discuss the prospects for reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">The Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid (D-Nevada), last evening announced that he will introduce DREAM as a stand-alone bill after the Thanksgiving recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">Although many advocates are optimistic about the prospects for passing DREAM, friends on the Hill indicate there is currently no concrete evidence of renewed bi-partisan support for the bill, or that some Democratic senators who have not supported DREAM in the past will vote for it on the next occasion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">Over the next two weeks it will be possible to better determine the level of support for DREAM now that it has become once again a concrete proposal.  It will also be possible to better judge, after discussing further with our friends on the Hill, the prospects for other immigration measures such the E-3 type visa for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">Senior officials of my Department had talks in Washington as recently as last Monday on the issue of Irish immigration to the US.  They discussed the issue of the undocumented, the conditions in which Irish citizens are held prior to deportation, the operation of the existing working holiday visa programmes and possibilities for the political agreement on the immigration issues following the 2 November elections in the US.</p>

            <p eId="para_1373">I condemn those responsible for the planting of explosive devices in Northern Ireland and all other forms of attack against the PSNI and local communities. Such attacks have no agenda beyond that of trying to destabilise and undermine the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">I extend best wishes for a speedy recovery to the 3 PSNI officers who were injured in a particularly sinister attack as they were attending the scene of a robbery in west Belfast on the night of Friday 5 November.  I also welcome the ongoing extensive cooperation between An Garda Síochána and their PSNI colleagues in countering these and other activities. Such cooperation has resulted in severable notable security successes this year and I pay tribute to those involved.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform and Minister David Ford have met several times over recent weeks, while the Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable are in full agreement that levels of cooperation between the two police services have never been greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">Implications for the peace process from discoveries of explosives arise only to the extent that they reinforce the collective determination of the two Governments and our Northern Ireland Executive colleagues that the would-be wreckers of peace cannot and will not succeed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1378">I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 130 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">I have continued to follow closely developments in relation to the blockade of Gaza following the announcement by Israel in June of a significant easing of the terms of the blockade.  The move to a transparent negative list of items not allowed to enter Gaza has largely resolved the problem of uncertainty and lack of consistency in relation to the type of goods allowed through.  I remain seriously concerned about four issues, however: overall volume of goods, restrictions on construction materials, refusal to permit exports and normal movement of persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">There has been a significant and progressive increase since June, of about 50%, in the volume of goods transported into Gaza.  However, the level now reached is still only about one-third of the level of routine shipments before the blockade was imposed, and the increase has consisted of  goods from Israel which have largely displaced the very expensive goods smuggled in from Egypt through the tunnel economy, which has greatly contracted.  The actual availability of goods in Gaza has therefore only marginally increased, and many remain too expensive for large numbers of people in Gaza.  Much more needs to be done.  I am concerned that the progressive increase in shipments seems to have plateaued in recent weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">Since all shipments into Gaza remain subject to Israeli security checking, the physical capacity of the crossing points is a significant constraint on supplies to Gaza, and most of the crossing points used before 2006 have been closed or are no longer in use.  I am aware of Israeli work to increase the capacity of the crossings, and permit a greater flow of goods, but also that the existing crossings are not yet being operated at maximum capacity.  It is clear that more needs to be done, and more quickly, if the shortages that affect the lives of ordinary Gazans are to be ended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">Supplies of construction materials have also increased marginally, but are subject to stringent and not fully transparent controls.  Some materials have been allowed in for specified projects controlled by UNRWA or the Palestinian Authority, including some repairs to housing and some critical infrastructure such as the sewage plant.  But the volume remains hopelessly inadequate to cope with the deterioration in infrastructure and the extensive damage to housing and other property caused by Israeli military action.  The inability of families to repair their homes, the inability of UNRWA to repair or construct sufficient schools for Gaza's children, and the serious and growing problems in the water and sewage systems, are of great concern to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">Finally, looking further ahead, there has been no provision at all by Israel to allow exports to resume from Gaza or for normal movement of persons.  This prevents any resumption of economic life in the territory, except for what can be smuggled out through the tunnels which are a source of revenue for militant groups. Gazans remain in a state of complete dependency and mass unemployment, which unfortunately are ideal conditions in which militant groups thrive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">While the political focus has been on the efforts to resume negotiations towards a comprehensive settlement, which is the only long-term solution to the problems of the blockade, I have continued both bilaterally and in discussion with my EU colleagues to ensure that attention remains on the problems of Gaza.  While there has been some progress, it is very clear that much more needs to be done, and more quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">Ireland believes strongly in the need for reform of the United Nations aimed at improving the performance and effectiveness of the Organisation so that it can continue to provide necessary leadership to develop effective multilateral responses to the major global challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The reform task includes, in particular, reform of the major UN organs so that they are fit for purpose and adjusted to twenty-first century realities.  The case for reform of the UN Security Council is particularly urgent. Its current composition is outdated and must be expanded to include, for example, greater representation from Africa and from countries making a significant contribution to the Organisation.  The General Assembly, which is currently wrestling with this most difficult of reform issues, needs to be creative and consider all options and interim models which might command broad consensus.  Securing early agreement on reforming the Council's working methods and improving its transparency should also be a priority in the current inter-governmental discussions underway in the General Assembly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">In this regard, it is to be hoped that recent moves by some UN members to further crystallise their views in relation to Security Council reform, including U.S. President Obama's announcement of support for India securing permanent membership of the Security Council as well as UK Foreign Secretary Hague's announcement of support for Brazil becoming a permanent member, is indicative of renewed impetus for meaningful progress on Security Council reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">A further reform priority for Ireland, together with our EU partners, concerns UN budgetary management.  The current extremely difficult budgetary environment that so many countries are facing makes clear the need to adopt a critical attitude towards UN expenditure and ensure that the Organisation makes the best use of the resources with which it is provided. Ireland, and our EU partners, have been to the forefront in advocating that the whole system for apportioning expenses within the UN needs to be urgently reviewed and reformed.  At present, EU Member States collectively contribute almost 40% of the UN's Budget, even though our share of global GDP only amounts to just over 30%.  This is not a sustainable position and needs to be urgently addressed in the review of this issue which has now been mandated by the General Assembly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">I would also highlight Ireland's continuing strong support for reform of the UN's development architecture, where we have provided over €6 million to date in support of UN System Wide Coherence and the Delivering as One programme.  Under Ireland's co-chairmanship (with Tanzania) at the close of the 2007-2008 UN General Assembly, a consensus resolution was passed which gave broad support to the Delivering As One approach and helped to advance its agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">The Delivering as One approach is now yielding significant positive results in terms of greater coherence in UN development activities and improved delivery of services. I warmly welcome in this context the recent establishment of a new consolidated UN agency promoting gender equality, UN Women.</p>

            <p eId="para_1393">EU relations with Colombia are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  In 2007, negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched.  Such Agreements cover all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, economic cooperation and trade.  However, as not all member states of the Andean Community were in a position to proceed with free trade negotiations, the decision was taken to commence negotiations on a multiparty Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community — Colombia and Peru — within the overall framework of the Association Agreement.  The negotiations were carried out by the European Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council and they concluded on 1 March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">The Agreement includes a human rights clause committing both EU Member States and Colombia to the implementation of their human rights responsibilities.  This clause constitutes an essential element of the Agreement; that means that the concessions it contains may be unilaterally suspended in the event of violation by any of the signatory countries.  The FTA also foresees a monitoring mechanism to ensure that both sides adopt and correctly implement environmental and International Labour Rights (ILO) conventions.  While the details of this mechanism have yet to be agreed by both sides, it envisages the establishment of a body which would follow up on the implementation of the human rights, labour and environment clauses of the Agreement.  The involvement of civil society institutions in the monitoring process is anticipated. This will help to ensure public confidence in the implementation of these important aspects of the FTA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1397">The vision and approach for the Alliance of Civilisation was articulated by a High-Level Group appointed by then UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, which reported in November 2006. The High Level Group identified education, youth, media and migration, as the main fields of action for the Alliance, and outlined a range of practical initiatives by which the Alliance could develop its work in these areas.  In April 2007, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed Mr. Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal, as High Representative for the Alliance of Civilisations, to set the Alliance's agenda and to ensure its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">The activities of the Alliance of Civilisations are implemented at local, national, regional and international levels, with the objective of promoting cross-cultural understanding and respect. Recent activities of the Alliance have included: educational and research initiatives on Religions and Beliefs; disbursement of the Youth Solidarity Fund to provide seed funding to youth organisations advancing intercultural and interfaith dialogue; Journalist training and Media Literacy initiatives; and, a series of events on Migration and Integration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">The Third Annual Forum of the Alliance of Civilisations was held in Rio de Janeiro from 27-29 May 2010. Minister of State for European Affairs, Mr. Dick Roche, T.D. participated as Ireland's representative and delivered Ireland's national statement at this Forum, which was attended by over 7,000 delegates, including Ministers and Heads of Government of the Group of Friends, youth delegates and NGOs from all regions of the world. Key outcomes of the Forum included the creation of the UN University International Institute for the Alliance of Civilizations, which will be based in Barcelona; the negotiation or conclusion of co-operation agreements by the Alliance with a range of international bodies; and, the launch of the third Youth Solidarity Fund and the second Fellowships Programme of the Alliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">Ireland is a strong supporter of the Alliance of Civilizations and of the fundamental principle of mutual respect across cultures that brought it into existence. In 2009, during the course of UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon's visit to Ireland, we were pleased to underline this support with a donation of $20,000 to the Voluntary Trust Fund for the Alliance. The Department of the Taoiseach serves as the national focal point for coordination of activities pursued in implementation of the agenda of the Alliance of Civilisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">I look forward to Ireland's continued participation as a member of the Group of Friends, in contributing to the important work of the Alliance of Civilisations, as the leading UN Forum dealing with intercultural dialogue and co-operation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1403">Recent events in Yemen highlight the fragility of the state and the challenges it faces in combating terrorism.  The mail bombs discovered last month in aircraft in the UK and Dubai coupled with the assassination of approximately 100 government officials in recent months underscore the serious nature of the threat posed by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  The stability of the country is also threatened by the al-Houthi rebellion in the northern province of Sa'ada and the secessionist movement in the southern part of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">The Government of Yemen declared a ceasefire with the Houthi rebels in February 2010.  The ceasefire calmed fighting in the northern province but the situation remains tense and the number of internally displaced persons has created a significant humanitarian problem in the areas affected by the fighting.  The Government, through Irish Aid, allocated humanitarian assistance of €200,000 in 2009 through the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to assist those displaced by the violence.  The secessionist movement in the southern part of the country, initially a peaceful popular protest movement, has started specifically targeting security forces and security installations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">The current security tensions are exacerbated by the worsening socio-economic situation in Yemen, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach aimed at achieving progress across a range of fronts in Yemen.  The Friends of Yemen group, which consists of large donors to Yemen including the EU, has met twice, to date, with the aim of coordinating international support to Yemen.  At its most recent meeting in New York on 24 September, the Friends of Yemen agreed to support a range of economic and political reforms within Yemen, including a counter-radicalisation strategy, designed to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">The Government supports the EU's comprehensive approach to Yemen encompassing security, counter-terrorism, political dialogue, humanitarian and economic assistance. The EU emphasised the need for Yemen to continue with its programme of domestic political and economic reforms in Council Conclusions in January this year. I echo High Representative Ashton's statement in July this year welcoming the agreement on national dialogue.  The national dialogue process offers the key to unlocking progress on many issues including economic and political reform and national reconciliation.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1408">The practice of female genital mutilation is a clear violation of the human rights of women and girls.  It has serious social, health and psychological consequences, and it infringes on children's rights to special protection.  The World Health Organisation estimates that between 100 million and 140 million girls and women worldwide are currently living with the consequences of female genital mutilation. In Africa alone, it is estimated that three million girls are at risk annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">Ireland is playing an active role in global policy development, funding and research to address this appalling practice.  We recognise that it is a form of gender-based violence, and that it must be an important element in our comprehensive approach to tackling such violence through the overseas aid programme.  The Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid includes a firm commitment that Ireland will build its support for measures focused on preventing and responding to gender-based violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">Irish Aid, the Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs which manages the Government's aid programme, is a founding member of the Joint Consortium on Gender Based Violence, which brings together representatives from Government Departments and Irish development, humanitarian and human rights Non-Governmental Organisations to promote a coordinated response to all forms of gender-based violence, including female genital mutilation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">Internationally, we are cooperating with United Nations agencies in a concerted effort to end the practice of female genital mutilation. €650,000 has been allocated in 2010 as core funding to UN-Women, the new UN body which will have a key role to play in global efforts to build gender equality and combat gender based violence, including female genital mutilation.  This year, the Government is also providing core funding of €8 million to the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF) and €3 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to support their work on child protection, gender equality, reproductive health, maternal mortality and HIV and AIDS.  These agencies operate a joint programme to counter female genital mutilation with the aim of ending the practice in seventeen countries by 2012.  Ireland contributed €0.5 million to this specific programme in 2007.  In 2009 a total of over €4.4 m was provided in support of programmes to combat gender–based violence, including support for the UN Trust Fund for actions to Eliminate Violence Against Women.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">Progress is being made towards ending the practice of female genital mutilation, but detailed international coordination and consultation remains essential.  On 6 February 2010, the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation, UNICEF and the UNFPA reported that there has been success in reducing the incidence of the practices in several countries where it was once prevalent.  They noted that it is important to focus on encouraging change from within societies, and that where communities have chosen to make public declarations against the practice, for example in Senegal, declines of up to 65 per cent have been recorded.</p>

The DPI works across all communications media, and the United Nations website and the UN News Service (including UN Radio) run by the DPI serve as key sources in providing information and news on the UN.  The DPI also oversees a network of sixty three regional and national UN Information Centres which serve as direct points of access and information about the United Nations and which forge local partnerships with public authorities, media, educational institutions, and civil society to carry out communications campaigns to promote the work of the UN.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">Through the website of the UN News Service, the DPI offers timely broadcast-quality video covering all areas of the work of the United Nations, for use by global news providers.

            <p eId="para_1418">Elections took place during May 2010 in Ethiopia to the House of People's Representatives and the State Councils.  The ruling EPRDF party and its partners won 544 of 547 seats in the House of People's Representatives in a first past the post electoral system.  I welcome the publication on 8th November last of the final report of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM).  Ireland joins with other members of the EU in thanking the Mission, which included a number of Irish Election Observers, for providing an impartial and independent evaluation of the electoral process in Ethiopia.  We have taken careful note of the assessment and recommendations contained in its final report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">While I welcome positive aspects of the Mission's assessment of the elections including the high turn-out, the peaceful, orderly nature of the polling as well as the generally competent organisation of the elections, I am concerned at the assessment that the process fell short of international commitments.  In particular, I share concerns that the electoral playing field was insufficiently balanced, that political space was constrained and that more could have been done to build the confidence of opposition political parties in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">When I visited Ethiopia in early July, I had the opportunity to discuss political developments with leading Ethiopian Government figures, including Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, as well as with representatives of the main opposition parties.  A theme during all of these meetings was that of how best political dialogue and engagement with civil society can be developed in the post-electoral period and how the international community can support the acceleration of the process of democratisation.  I urged that positive steps be taken to build confidence in the democratic institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The EU Election Observation Mission has put forward constructive recommendations in this regard in its recently published report.  I encourage the Ethiopian Government to draw on these recommendations as I am convinced that Ethiopia's undoubted development achievements can best be protected and built upon by accelerated progress in the process of democratisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">Ethiopia is one of the priority countries for Ireland's aid programme, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  Our development assistance, together with support from other international partners, including the EU, and increased expenditure by the Government of Ethiopia is making a marked difference to the lives of the people of the country.  However, the needs remain great.  Encouraging stronger advances in democracy as well as in other areas of Ethiopia's development are central to our dialogue with Ethiopia.  As noted by the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, in her statement on the publication of the EU EOM's report, the European Union attaches great importance to the promotion of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law.  Ireland and the European Union will maintain and strengthen our dialogue with Ethiopia on these shared values in the period ahead</p>

            <p eId="para_1424">G20 leaders met in Seoul, Korea on 11 and 12 November. The meeting was an important stock-taking opportunity and enabled G20 members to follow-up on commitments made previously on a coordinated global response to the financial crisis.  Discussion at Seoul centred on the global economy and the framework for growth, IMF governance and financial regulation.  At the Summit, G20 leaders agreed on the Seoul Action Plan, a comprehensive policy plan spanning five policy areas (Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies; Trade and Development Policies; Fiscal Policies, Financial Reforms; and Structural Reforms) to further promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">There was agreement to move towards market-determined exchange rate flexibility, reflecting economic fundamentals with indicative guidelines to be agree by June 2011.  The need for vigilance against volatility was agreed, as was a commitment to refrain from protectionism.  The G20 Summit expressed its strong commitment to bring the Doha Round of world trade talks to a successful, ambitious, comprehensive and balanced conclusion, and recognised 2011 as a critical window of opportunity in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">While US efforts to secure G20 agreement a 4% target for deficits and surpluses were unsuccessful, summit participants did agree to engage in further discussions with a view to having indicative guidelines adopted at the G20 summit in France next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">G20 leaders endorsed their finance ministers' agreement to increase the voting strength within the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of the emerging economies of China, Russia and Brazil.  It was further agreed that the IMF should have an enhanced role in the surveillance of systemic risks and vulnerabilities.  The G20 member countries also enhanced its Flexible Credit Line (FCL) and created a Precautionary Credit Line (PCL) as strengthened financial safety nets aimed at coping with future crises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">The Summit also endorsed the Basel III agreement on the capital requirements applying to banks and tasked the Financial Stability Board to bring forward recommendations to strengthen its role and capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">The Summit agreed on the Seoul Development Consensus for Shared Growth and its Multi-Year Action Plan on Development. Under the Seoul Consensus, nine key pillars (infrastructure; human resource development; trade; private investment and job creation; food security; growth with resilience; financial inclusion; domestic resource mobilisation; and knowledge sharing) where it is believed actions are necessary were identified.  A Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion was also launched in Seoul and a progress report is to be prepared for the 2011 G20 Summit in France.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">G20 leaders also set out a series of commitments concerning fossil fuel price volatility, the protection of the global marine environment and climate change and green growth.  The G20 leaders endorsed the G20 Anti-Corruption Action Plan to create a transparent and fair business environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">The resolutions and policies agreed at G20 summits affect international financial, trade and economic conditions, and so have a direct impact on Ireland.  Although supportive of the G20 reform programme, Ireland is not a member of the G20 and our position on G20 proposals is primarily articulated through the EU.  The October European Council agreed the EU position for the Seoul G20 Summit, and the Irish government was in full agreement with the position agreed by EU heads of state and government at that European Council meeting.  The EU was represented at the Seoul G20 meeting by Presidents Van Rompuy and Barroso.</p>

            <p eId="para_1433">Significant support is given to schools by way of language support provision.

            <p eId="para_1434">Following on from the Government decision in Budget 2009 in relation to language support provision my Department published Circular 0015/2009 which sets out a structured and transparent process for the allocation of up to 4 language support teachers to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">Additional support is available for those schools which have at least 25% of their total enrolment made up of pupils that require language support.  Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the Staffing Appeals process.</p>

The overall education of pupils with a requirement for English as an additional language remains the responsibility of the mainstream class teacher.  All pupils including migrant pupils (irrespective of their English language proficiency) are counted for the regular pupil teacher ratios in schools.  Schools have flexibility in relation to how they deploy their EAL teachers to meet the needs of pupils that require language support.</p>

It should be noted that a prefab unit may consist of one or more classrooms and/or ancillary accommodation and that expenditure incurred on the maintenance or upkeep of rented prefab units is generally included in the rental contract between the prefab provider and the school authorities.  Two recent policy changes implemented by my Department have reduced the annual rental costs for prefab units, including in County Donegal.  The first is to provide devolved grant aid for the purchase (rather than rental) of additional accommodation where the need for such accommodation is likely to exist for more than three years.  The second is to offer schools being approved for devolved grant aid for additional accommodation the option to use their capital grant aid to build a permanent classroom(s) rather than purchase a prefab.  These policies are having the effect of reducing the usage of prefabricated accommodation and, particularly, the incidence and cost associated with the long term rental of prefabs.</p>

            <p eId="para_7222">I assume the Deputy is referring to the outcome of the work carried out by the Van Rompuy Task Force.  In March 2010, in the light of the global economic and financial crisis and the deterioration in public finances across the EU, the European Council mandated a Task Force under President Van Rompuy and comprising representatives of the Member States, the European Commission and ECB to develop proposals for improved budgetary discipline. I represented Ireland on the Task Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_7223">The European Council on 28-29 October endorsed the Report of the Task Force which includes recommendations aimed at strengthening fiscal discipline and broadening the EU's surveillance of macroeconomic developments.  In relation to compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, the report proposes that a greater emphasis be placed on the debt criterion and that stronger enforcement measures be put in place.  In the case of the euro area, financial sanctions could be imposed in the event that a Member State were to persistently fail to take action on foot of Council recommendations issued under the Pact.  The report also calls for national budgetary frameworks to be strengthened to underpin Member States' EU obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7224">I consider that the Task Force recommendations are a major step forward in economic governance at EU level and are to be welcomed.  The necessary work is now being put in train at EU level to implement the recommendations, many of which will require EU secondary legislation, in the light of discussion of the related legislative proposals from the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_7225">As the Deputy will be aware, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the overall framework for Member States' budgetary policies.  I would like to emphasise that notwithstanding the present difficult challenges the Government remains committed to pursuing budgetary and economic policies consistent with our EU obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_7226">The Deputy may also be referring to media reports regarding Greece.  I would draw the Deputy's attention in this regard to the statement  issued following the meeting of Eurogroup Finance Ministers on 16 November 2010.  The Eurogroup, the European Commission and the ECB welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Greek government to comply with the agreed adjustment programme and acknowledged that the required adjustment  is broadly on track.  The statement noted a recent report from Eurostat to the effect that there is however, as expected, a substantial revision in government deficit and debt data for 2009 which is expected to affect the 2010 deficit figures.  In this regard, it welcomed the efforts by the Greek authorities to correct deficiencies in the administrative and accounting systems in parallel with improvements in the statistical system. The statement welcomed the strong commitment of the Greek government to undertake the required budgetary measures in the budget for 2011 and expressed confidence that the significant progress made during the course of this year will continue, allowing the consolidation of the Greek budget to remain on track.</p>

            <p eId="para_7228">My Department does not produce estimates of the size of the informal economy nor of the estimated loss to the exchequer arising from such activities. Internationally, a considerable amount of research has been undertaken in this area but, by definition, it is always difficult to quantify the scale of the informal economy. Having said that, the Central Statistics Office in compiling estimates of national income, and in line with best international practice, makes adjustments to the figures in order to control for informal activity in some sub-sectors of the economy. This is done at a very detailed level, with the result that an overall economy-wide estimate is not available.</p>

        <b>Deputy Phil Hogan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         the revenue which would have been saved in a full year if he implemented the findings of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration as indicated during the last budget and adjusted salaries down by an 8% cut for assistant secretaries and 12% for deputy secretaries in Departments in conjunction with the termination of the performance-related bonus scheme; the amount saved in a full year from the amended salary reductions for the same category of public servants implemented following the budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_7380">As the Deputy is aware the Government decided in 2009 that the performance related award scheme for Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries would be terminated, which resulted in an annual saving of around €2m. In applying the reductions in pay in January 2010, I considered that account had to be taken of the reduction in remuneration for Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries and related grades arising from the termination of the scheme. Otherwise, the total reduction in remuneration for these grades would have been greater than those for other public servants including higher paid groups at the level of Secretary General or above. I decided that the reductions should comprise both a reduction in the salary scale and the termination of the scheme of performance-related pay previously payable to the grades. The resulting significant reductions in remuneration amounted to 11.8% in the case of the grade of Assistant Secretary and 14% in the case of the grade of Deputy Secretary. These reductions are higher than those applying to other groups at the lower salary levels and significantly higher than the minimum reduction provided for under the legislation of 5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_7381">The additional amount saved in a full year through the reductions that were applied to these grades is estimated at around €0.6m.  Applying the reductions set out in the Review Body Report would have resulted in an additional saving in the region of €1m.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_7847">‘A Vision for Change' — The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, will be implemented over a 7 to 10 year period and progress has been achieved to date including, shorter episodes of in-patient care, improved child and adolescent mental health services, fewer involuntary admissions and the involvement of service users in all aspects of mental health policy, service planning and delivery.  Work is also advancing on the mental health capital programme which will provide the infrastructure necessary to enable us to migrate from a traditional, institutional based model of care, to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_7848">There are substantial resources already invested in mental health and the immediate priority is to reconfigure and remodel these resources.  As bed capacity in the old institutions reduces, staff will be redeployed to the community.  At the end of 2009 there were one hundred and twenty-four adult community based mental health teams in place and further teams will be developed as resources allow.  The 2010 Employment Control Framework for the health service provided an exemption from the moratorium and allowed for the filling of 100 psychiatric nursing posts.  In addition, 90 posts have been reconfigured and are being targeted towards priority areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7849">‘A Vision for Change'  identified gaps in the child and adolescent mental health service and made several recommendations relating to the development of such services.  The Health Service Executive has prioritised the development of mental health services for children and adolescents and significant progress has been made in this regard.  There are now 55 multidisciplinary teams in place and a further 8 teams are in development.  During 2009, bed capacity for children and adolescents almost doubled, bringing the total number of in-patient beds to 30.  Bed capacity will increase further this year with the opening of two purpose built, child and adolescent, 20-bed units in Bessboro, Cork and Merlin Park, Galway.  This additional capacity, together with the Mental Health Commission Code of Practice, which requires that no child under 17 is to be admitted to an adult unit from 1 December 2010, and no child under 18 is to be admitted to an adult unit from 1 December 2012, will ensure that the admission of children to adult services will be significantly reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_7850">The financial difficulties facing the country do not in any way dilute the Government's commitment in the area of mental health, and in this regard I accept that the impact of any cuts on frontline services must be minimised, and that we must ensure going forward that the needs of service users remains the highest priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_7851">The question relating to the number of patients that have been moved from institutional care settings to community-based accommodation is a service matter, and, accordingly, has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_7865">The Government decided in July 2005 that the best option for improving geographic access for patients in the North West to radiation oncology services in the short term was to facilitate access to Belfast City Hospital and accordingly, a Service Level Agreement is in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to BCH. This is in addition to the services available at St Luke's Hospital, Dublin and at University Hospital Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_7866">The Government also decided in 2005 to explore the scope in the medium term for developing a joint venture based on a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast City Hospital. In April 2008, Minister McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&amp;PS), Northern Ireland announced the provision of a satellite centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin.  It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland.  It also recognises the potential for cross border co-operation in the development of this resource.  I welcomed the announcement by Minister McGimpsey and officials from my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland continue to hold discussions in this regard.   Following discussions at the North-South Ministerial Council with Minister McGimpsey, I understand that the facility is now expected to be operational by 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_7867">My Department and the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme have nominated representatives to the Cross Border Sub Group, the Project Board and the Service Design and Workforce Planning Subgroup for the development. I have committed to providing a capital contribution to the development, in recognition of the fact that approximately one third of the patients who will attend the Altnagelvin Centre will be from Donegal and the surrounding areas. In addition, the Health Service Executive's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) will contribute on an agreed basis to the operating costs in respect of patients from the Republic of Ireland who attend this service.  It remains the position that the Business Case for the development has now been finalised and is under consideration by Minister McGimpsey.</p>
            <p eId="para_7868">I met with the group referred to by the Deputy last year during which a number of issues were discussed, including the development at Altnagelvin. My Department has also been in correspondence with them within the past year. I have recently received a further request to meet the group and am currently considering it in the context of my other commitments during the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_7886">The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland which are registered with the Gardaí for this purpose.  Since 2004 the vetting service has been, and continues to be, extended to organisations working with children and/or vulnerable adults.  Over that period there has been a substantial increase in the numbers of vetting applications received by the GCVU.  In 2007 it received 187,864, rising to 218,404 in 2008.  In 2009 it received over 246,000 applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7887">The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that at the end of October there were over 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed and that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 12 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_7888">The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis.  In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_7894">Following my request to the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to assess the need to establish a dedicated Missing Persons Unit within An Garda Síochána, including a response similar to AMBER alert, and to report their findings to me, the Inspectorate published its report last year.  One of its main recommendations was that an emergency alert system for missing children, similar to the AMBER alert system in place in other countries, should be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_7895">Such systems are deployed where a set of clear criteria are met — that a child has been kidnapped; the child is at imminent risk of serious injury or death; there is sufficient information to describe the child; and the circumstances are such that an alert can be useful.</p>
            <p eId="para_7896">In April, 2009 I gave the go ahead for the implementation of this recommendation.  An Garda Síochána is committed to its implementation and has commenced work on developing the most appropriate structure to give effect to the recommendation, taking account of progress at international level in the development of alert systems for missing children.</p>
            <p eId="para_7897">I am informed by the Garda authorities that an Assistant Commissioner has been appointed to oversee the introduction of such an alert system in this jurisdiction.  The development of such a system is complex and requires a multi-agency approach.  It will provide An Garda Síochána with access to on-air broadcasters and other means of communication during the critical period immediately after a child abduction.  This will require the co-operation of a range of agencies, including Government Departments, phone service providers, electronic and print media, television and radio service providers and the public.</p>

            <p eId="para_7904">The Deputy will be aware that there has been a significant increase in the number of  outlets offering to buy gold for cash in towns and cities in the State. I understand that some established jewellers also offer to buy gold and jewellery for cash. The prevalence of this trade would appear to be linked to the high price that gold now commands on international markets, and the ‘cash for gold' concept would appear to be an international phenomenon. I am aware that the trade gives rise to concerns reported in communities about crime that may be linked to the cash for gold trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_7905">The informal purchase of jewellery is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation; however, the circumstances under which jewellery is being bought or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, for example handling stolen property and/or possession of stolen property under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_7906">Section 17 of the Act in essence provides that a person is guilty of handling stolen property if he or she, knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen, dishonestly receives or arranges to receive it, or undertakes, or assists in, its retention, removal, disposal or realisation by or for the benefit of another person, or arranges to do so.  A person guilty of handling stolen property is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both.</p>
            <p eId="para_7907">Section 18 of the Act in essence provides that a person who, without lawful authority or excuse, possesses stolen property knowing that the property was stolen or being reckless as to whether it was stolen, is guilty of an offence. A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or both.</p>
            <p eId="para_7908">An Garda Síochána enforce the provisions of the criminal law in respect of theft and robbery including the theft and robbery of jewellery and gold.  Should members of the public have suspicions that goods being sold or traded may be stolen, the correct action is for these suspicions to be referred to An Garda Síochána for investigation. I have received a small amount of correspondence in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_7909">To take account of concerns about the matter, my Department has formally asked the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána  to ascertain his view as to the extent, if any, that criminal offences are being committed in the procurement and receipt of gold and similar items in transactions carried out at the cash for gold locations.  In particular the Commissioner has been requested to examine whether the trade  may be linked generally or in particular areas to burglary offences;  whether Criminal Justice legislation, and in particular, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 is adequate  in the context of cash for gold transactions; whether criminal elements involved in organised crime or otherwise may be connected with the operation and ownership of the cash for gold outlets; and  whether any new legislative provision may be required to address criminality in respect of cash for gold transactions.</p>
            <p eId="para_7910">I can assure the Deputy that as soon as the outcome of this examination of the matter is to hand, I will make an assessment as to what if any action, legislative or otherwise may be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_7911">The issue of any requirement for planning approval, or change of use permission for such premises is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_7932">This year, the Government has provided a total of €671 million in official development assistance (ODA), €536 million of which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs under the Government's aid programme.  Ireland's aid programme has a clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger, especially in the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  Over 20% of our total assistance is channelled through development Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), reflecting the strong role played by Ireland's NGOs and missionaries in the developing world, and the support they have consistently received from the Irish people.</p>
            <p eId="para_7933">The organisation referred to by the Deputy is a children's rights NGO based in the Philippines.  It has received over €300,000 in support from Irish Aid since 2004.  In 2007, a three-year grant of €218,319 was allocated to support a community-based programme to protect and promote the rights of vulnerable women and children.  I expect that the final payment of €73,769 from this grant allocation will be made to the organisation in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_7934">Future allocations of funding to development NGOs will, of course, be dependent on the budgetary resources available for the aid programme.  Information on future funding rounds under Irish Aid's civil society funding scheme will be provided on the Irish Aid website at <i>www.irishaid.ie</i>.</p>

In its report, the Commission, although acknowledging good progress by Albania over the past 12 months, did not recommend that the Council grant the status of candidate country to Albania.  Rather, it said that "negotiations for accession to the European Union should be opened once the country has achieved the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria, and in particular the Copenhagen political criteria requiring the stability of institutions guaranteeing notably democracy and the rule of law."  The Copenhagen criteria, as they are known, are the conditions a country must meet before it can join the EU, and include the areas of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, economic policy and the general ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.</p>

            <p eId="para_7940">The Advisory Board for Ireland Aid operated until 2008, when its term of appointment came to an end.  One of its primary functions was to commission academic research on issues relevant to the Government's official development cooperation programme.  Some work commissioned from the Institute of International Integration Studies (IIIS) on Policy Coherence for Development was ongoing at the time the Advisory Board ended its operations in 2008.  This was subsumed into the work of my Department.  There were three pieces of work involved: a scoping research on key policy coherence issues; a study on policy coherence on agriculture and development; and a policy indicators project.  These projects involved costs of €364,000 in 2008 and €10,655 in 2009.  Two of the projects are completed and the policy indicators project will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_7941">The Development Education Advisory Committee commissioned a research study, Mapping the Past, Charting the Future: A Review and Analysis of the Irish Government's Engagement with Development Education in Ireland, in early 2010.  The study is being conducted by Dr. Matthias Fiedler, Irish Development Education Association (IDEA), Dr. Audrey Bryan, St. Patrick's College of Education, Ms Melíosa Bracken, MSc, School of Education, UCD, and Dr. Vanessa Andreotti, School of Maori, Social and Cultural Studies, University of Canterbury, New Zealand, and will be  completed before the end of 2010.

            <p eId="para_7944">The prospect of accession to the Union is a very important element in the overall diplomacy of the EU in its neighbouring Balkan region.  It bolsters and acts as an incentive to reform efforts, both economic and political, promotes regional cooperation and the resolution of disputes and should lead over time to greater stability, progress and benefits for Europe as a whole.  Ireland is actively engaged in this process, both in internal EU discussion and in contacts with Western Balkan countries.  The European Commission adopted its 2010 Enlargement Package on 9 November.

            <p eId="para_7946">Regarding potential candidate countries of the Western Balkans, Commissioner Fuele announced that negotiations for accession to the European Union should be opened with Montenegro and Albania once they have achieved the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria and in particular the Copenhagen political criteria requiring the stability of institutions guaranteeing notably the rule of law.  The Commission recommended that the Council grant Montenegro the status of candidate country.  No such recommendation was made in regard to Albania, in relation to which the Commission made an additional reference to the need to guarantee democracy.  The Commission reaffirmed its opinion on Macedonia, namely that a solution is necessary to the name issue.  Serbia was deemed to be well-placed to fulfil the requirements under the SAA and was continuing to cooperate with the ICTY, which is seen as an essential condition for membership.  While regional cooperation was highlighted as a Serbian strength, a more positive attitude towards cooperation with Kosovo was urged, in particular in relation to regional economic cooperation. On Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Commission said that there was a need for a government to be formed quickly and for reforms, notably aligning the constitution with the European Court of Human Rights.  There was also a need to move forward on the conditions to allow the Office of the High Representative to be removed.  Kosovo was deemed to have made progress in a number of areas but still faced major challenges, notably in regional cooperation.</p>

            <p eId="para_7948">I am gravely concerned about the deterioration in the human rights situation in general in Iran since the Presidential election in 2009.  We have witnessed the continued repression of civil and political rights in Iran, including in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest and torture in detention.  This highly targeted repression has been particularly stringent against not only academics but also members of Iran's religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, human rights defenders and members of the legal profession in Iran who represent clients detained by the authorities.  These actions are in clear violation of Iran's international obligations under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, of which Iran is a signatory.    I drew attention to the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran in my address to the UN General Assembly on 27 September.  In my remarks, I called upon Iran to respect and fulfil the international obligations it has undertaken in the field of human rights, in both law and practice.  I have also made clear our concerns about the treatment of human rights in Iran in contacts with members of the Iranian Government, most recently at a meeting which I had with Foreign Minister Mottaki in Dublin on 9 June.  I have written to Foreign Minister Mottaki on a number of occasions to express my concerns about, and to raise specific aspects of, the human rights situation in Iran.</p>
            <p eId="para_7949">Ireland has also been active in raising issues relating to human rights in Iran within the specific UN bodies which deal with human rights.  Along with our EU partners, we have traditionally supported the annual Resolution on the human rights situation in Iran which is adopted by the General Assembly and have again been active in relation to this important resolution at the current session.  In our national intervention at the UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva on 17 September, we raised concerns relating to the death penalty in Iran. I urge the Iranian authorities to introduce a moratorium on executions pending the abolition of the death penalty in accordance with UN General Assembly resolutions 62/149 and 63/168.</p>
            <p eId="para_7950">The EU has also been pressing at the highest levels for Iran to abolish the cruel and inhumane practice of stoning and to meet its international human rights obligations.  A detailed démarche was delivered on behalf of the EU in Brussels to the Iranian Ambassador to the EU on 4 November in relation to several specific human rights cases including the case of Ms Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who has been sentenced to death by stoning for adultery.  Officials in my Department have raised this case with the Iranian Ambassador most recently earlier this month following worrying reports that Ms Ashtiani was scheduled to be imminently executed.  Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding the human rights situation in Iran, both bilaterally and at multilateral organisations.</p>

During this meeting, we discussed a range of bilateral and multilateral issues, including EU-Cuba and Cuba-US relations.  At the Foreign Affairs Council in October, Ministers considered recent developments in Cuba, including the ongoing release of political prisoners and the announcement of economic reform.  The High Representative was tasked with exploring the future relationship between the EU and Cuba.

            <p eId="para_7960">While Ireland and our European Union partners consider the United States' foreign policy toward Cuba to be a bilateral issue, the European Union has clearly expressed the opposition of its Member States to all unilateral measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international law.

            <p eId="para_7963">There are several countries in Africa which are suffering from conflict, food shortages, and human rights abuses, and some which have suffered genocide.  I do not propose to go into details on each of them individually.  The international community continues to intervene to address these issues on the African continent, whether on a bilateral or multilateral basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_7964">With regard to the issue of hunger and famine, it is estimated that more than a billion people today do not have enough food.  Ireland is responding to this challenge, working bilaterally in our Programme Countries with our EU partners and other donors, and at a global level through the UN agencies.  Since the publication of the report of the Hunger Task Force in September 2008, Ireland's focus on hunger reduction has become a cornerstone of Irish Aid's development programme.  With regard to Africa, efforts are concentrated on the three priority areas identified in the report, namely: increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa; targeting under-nutrition (especially maternal and infant); and promoting governance and leadership action on tackling global hunger.  Nowhere is this work more challenging than in African countries affected by conflict, where it is critically important to move quickly with large-scale emergency food assistance in order to save lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_7965">We know that more can be done to address the causes of hunger and famine. To this end, at the Millennium Development Goals Summit in September in New York, I hosted a meeting with the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to accelerate action against hunger. At this meeting, Ireland and the US came together to highlight the urgency of tackling under-nutrition in pregnant women and children under the age of two and to build new partnerships with global political, business and civil society leaders.  Our two countries launched the "1,000 Day" initiative to focus on the period from pregnancy to a child's second birthday and to galvanise international action on this issue. We were both very encouraged by the support that we received by the international community, including the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, EU Commissioner Georgieva, the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation. Irish officials are working with their US officials to galvanise action in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_7966">With regard to security, UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa have a role in stabilising former and current conflict zones.  Members of the Irish Defence Forces have participated in numerous UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa, including in the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia and most recently in Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_7967">Situations which conform to an internationally accepted definition of genocide are thankfully extremely rare.  Nevertheless, there are a number of current situations in Africa which give rise to extreme concern. The UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide is mandated to alert the international community to the potential of genocide in a particular country or region, and to make recommendations on actions to prevent or halt genocide.</p>
            <p eId="para_7968">Human rights concerns remain central to our foreign policy. Together with our EU partners, Ireland monitors closely the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including both official and non-governmental organisations.  Where and when the situation warrants, we make known our concerns about human rights violations to the Governments in question.  We do this either bilaterally, through the EU, or through action at the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council, including, in the case of the latter, through the new Universal Periodic Review process whereby the human rights performance of each UN State is reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_7969">Active participation in multilateral organisations such as the EU, the UN and the Council of Europe provides opportunities for Ireland to voice its concerns regarding human rights abuses. Through these organisations, international pressure can be brought to bear on those responsible for the violation of human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_7970">In developing a sustainable approach which properly addresses the root causes of all these issues, and other problems, African leadership and responsibility are crucial.  This is recognised by the EU and UN, which are both working to build the capacities of African States and the African Union to respond to these challenges.  Ireland is committed to playing its part in this work, and I believe that our comprehensive and inclusive approach to these challenges stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people in Africa.</p>

            <p eId="para_7972">At its meeting of 28-29 October, the European Council endorsed the report of the task force on economic governance chaired by President Herman Van Rompuy and agreed on the need for Member States to establish a permanent crisis mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area.  The European Council has agreed to revert to the matter at its next meeting on 16 and 17 December, with a view to taking the final decision on both the outline of a crisis mechanism and on a limited Treaty amendment, so that any change can be ratified by mid-2013 at the latest.  President Van Rompuy also expressed the intention to consult Member States — in a separate and subsequent exercise — on the issue of the right of euro area members to participate in decision-making in EMU-related procedures in the case of a permanent threat to the stability of the euro area as a whole.  No timeframe has been set for these consultations.</p>

Following a review of procedures and as there was no legislative basis for such a disregard, this practice ceased and since June 2009 maintenance has been assessed in full for the purposes of FIS.</p>

            <p eId="para_8050">The developer of a residential estate is statutorily required to complete the development in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.  A development which has not been completed in accordance with the planning permission is unauthorised development.  Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the planning authority, which can take action where a development requiring planning permission has not obtained this permission, or where permission has not been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_8051">Planning authorities have substantial enforcement powers under the Planning and Development Act 2000.  A planning authority may issue an enforcement notice, non-compliance with which is an offence, in connection with unauthorised development (which includes failure to comply with planning conditions) requiring such steps as the authority considers necessary to be taken within a specified period.  If an enforcement notice is not complied with the planning authority may itself take the specified steps and recover the expense incurred in doing so.  A planning authority may also seek a court order requiring any particular action to be done or not to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_8052">The Planning Acts also place clear statutory obligations on planning authorities in relation to unauthorised development.  A planning authority must issue a warning letter in relation to written complaints regarding unauthorised development, or other unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development).  The planning authority must then carry out an investigation and where it establishes, following such an investigation that unauthorised development (other than development that is of a trivial or minor nature) has been or is being carried out and the person who has carried out or is carrying out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or make an application for a court order unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.</p>
            <p eId="para_8053">The 2000 Planning Act also contains other relevant provisions in relation to the completion of housing estates:</p>
            <p eId="para_8054">Sections 34(4)(<i>g</i>) and 180(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Act provide that a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development, and, if the development is not subsequently completed satisfactorily, may apply the security to that satisfactory completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_8055">Section 160 of the Act provides that a planning authority may apply to the Circuit Court or the High Court for an order requiring that a development be carried out in accordance with the permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_8056">Accordingly it is clear that planning authorities have very substantial powers to compel the completion of housing estates by developers in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_8057">Section 180 of the 2000 Planning Act provided that where estates have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the residents of the estate, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.  A further provision has been added in the 2010 Act to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.  The decision as whether to take an estate is taken in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of a local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_8062">For purposes of the shared ownership scheme, the redemption value of the outstanding local authority share, for transactions commenced from 1 January 2003, is based on its initial cost adjusted annually to compensate for differences between the rent paid on the local authority's share and the interest calculated by reference to the prevailing interest rates. The scheme is structured so that, on redemption, the price of the outstanding share is not determined on the basis of a percentage of current market value, but is, rather, a function primarily of its initial capital cost.  Accordingly, the issue of an authority accepting a loss due to the current economic climate may not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_8063">The same calculation methodology is utilised in the event that the owner of a house purchased through shared ownership wishes to sell the house on the open market.</p>

            <p eId="para_8114">The European Court of Auditors Report on the Sugar Reform package of 2006 was addressed directly to the European Commission. The purpose of this report is to consider whether the reform of the sugar sector had achieved its main objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_8115">One of the issues commented on by the Court was the Impact Assessment carried out by the Commission. This was a theoretical exercise undertaken prior to the commencement of the negotiations to assess the possible impact of the reform proposals on sugar production in Member States. It indicated that the Member States most likely to be affected adversely by the reform measures were Ireland along with Portugal, Greece and Italy.</p>
            <p eId="para_8116">The European Court of Auditors criticised the Commission for not using up to date information in the impact assessment in the case of a number of Member States.  The Commission in its response pointed out that "<i>the reform model did not require an analysis of the current profitability and prospects of every individual sugar producer in the EU.</i>
                            <i>Therefore the Commission did not consider it necessary to collect such data on productivity and efficiency for the model chosen”</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_8117">As the Commission points out repeatedly in its 17 page response to the Court, under the reform package it was up to operators to decide whether to close processing plants and avail of the compensation package or not.  Obviously industry operators would have the most up to date information available to them in making that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_8118">Ireland strongly opposed the Commission's reform proposals and sought to have them modified in such a way that an efficient sugar industry might have been retained in Ireland.  At all stages during the actual negotiations the most up to date available information on the sugar industry in Ireland was used and the Commission was fully aware of the fact that sugar processing here was consolidated to one factory.</p>
            <p eId="para_8119">Ultimately, there was insufficient support for the Irish position and our efforts had to be directed at achieving the best possible compensation package. The total compensation package negotiated was worth €353m to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8120">Greencore plc, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the Irish sugar quota, decided to avail of this scheme and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme. The decision by Greencore plc, to cease sugar production in Ireland was a commercial decision, having regard to the sugar market situation prevailing at the time and the impending reform of the sugar sector.</p>

This approach is supported by the aquaculture industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_8124">The European Commission has made a regulation in line with the Fish Health Directive specifying measures which must be taken by member states to deal with the oyster herpes virus issue. The principal measures contained in this legislation require a surveillance programme to be established to ensure early detection of the virus in heretofore disease free areas, and the establishment of containment areas in respect of sites where the virus has been detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_8125">The Marine Institute is the competent authority in Ireland for the implementation of the Fish Health Directive and controls are in place in relation to the importation of oysters from containment areas (in Ireland or abroad) to surveillance (disease free) areas.  While not totally prohibited, any such importation is subject to certification by the relevant competent authority in France of the disease free status of the consignment.  In addition, the Marine Institute also encourages producers to avoid importing oysters from containment to surveillance areas.  Furthermore, in the case of importation of oysters from abroad generally, producers are strongly advised to submit samples of the oysters to the Marine Institute for testing prior to importation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8126">My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, will continue to take all appropriate measures to protect Irish oyster stocks from this virus.</p>

         the value of stock relief, agricultural relief and retirement relief to the farming sector in each of the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and to date 2010; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_8138">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioner that the Exchequer cost of the tax reliefs outlined by the Deputy are as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_8139">The estimated cost to the Exchequer of stock relief for 2007, the latest year for which information is available, is two million euro. This  figure is the estimated cost of renewing the general 25 percent stock relief for farmers and the special incentive stock relief of 100 percent for certain young trained farmers.  It should be treated as the best estimate available but the calculation is subject to a considerable margin of error.</p>
            <p eId="para_8140">The relevant information available on the cost to the Exchequer of retirement relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of assets by the farming sector is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers, whose main activity was farming. The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4-digit NACE code (Rev. 1), which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. This information is as follows for the total years available.</p>

            <p eId="para_8176">The details sought by the Deputy are contained in the tabular statement below.</p>
            <p eId="para_8177">Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them; details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), my Department's computer-based land parcel tracking system.  Details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the LPIS system are registered and continually monitored by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_8178">In Ireland, the vast majority of Scheme applicants have been making sufficient deductions from their claims to take account of ineligible areas in that they reduced the area claimed.  However, in many cases as no mapping evidence supporting these deductions was provided, the ineligible features were not, therefore, recorded onto LPIS. As LPIS underpins all the area-based payments, worth in excess of €1.8 billion annually, it is crucial that it accurately reflects the true position on the ground, particularly given the audit scrutiny that this Scheme attracts not just in Ireland but also in all Member States. To this end, the initiative I took earlier this year in urging all farmers to map out ineligible areas was crucial and, given the overwhelming response, absolutely vital.</p>

            <p eId="para_8206">I can confirm that the balancing payments under the Single Payment Scheme are on target to begin issuing as and from 1 December.  In addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the confirmed eligible land. Because of this decision, which I made following consultation with the EU Commission, many farmers, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, will now receive payment. I estimate that the net effect will be additional payments worth in excess of €100 million issuing in the early days of December.</p>
            <p eId="para_8207">I am determined that this momentum will be maintained and that the maximum numbers of farmers will receive their full payments as the earliest possible date. <i> </i> At the same time, I must continue to emphasise the absolute urgency in getting the mapping system fully accurate and up-to-date to protect Irish direct payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_8211">Access to the Rights Commissioner Service, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts is governed by the definition of "worker" in Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.

Arising from an agreement between management and union sides to abolish the existing Conciliation and Arbitration machinery for vocational educational committee officers and to bring them within the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts, it is now proposed to amend the definition of "worker" to include such officers, with the exception of teachers, within the definition of "worker" in the 1990 Act.  An amendment to this effect is included in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_8215">Access to the employment dispute settling bodies under the Industrial Relations Acts is governed by the definition of "worker" in Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Workers not included within this definition are normally covered by separate schemes of Conciliation and Arbitration.</p>
            <p eId="para_8216">Workers in some parts of the public service, e.g. Local Authorities, Health Service Executive, are already covered by the definition of "worker" and, accordingly, have access to the State's industrial relations machinery.</p>

            <p eId="para_8218">The question of an amendment to the Industrial Relations Acts to provide for the inclusion of persons employed in the civil service in the definition of "worker" is a matter that is under consideration in the context of ongoing discussions between civil service management and unions.  This would involve issues around coverage by the existing Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme and is a matter for the Minister for Finance, in the first instance.</p>

        <b>Deputy Frank Feighan</b>
         asked the

         the position regarding a redundancy claim in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Roscommon. 
        [43478/10]

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise__Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_751">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise; Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_8220">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8221">I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_8222">It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50's) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_8223">Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_8224">In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_8225">If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_8226">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_8228">In my earlier reply on this matter on 4 November, 2010, I indicated that, according to my Department's records, there is no record of a redundancy claim in respect of the individual concerned lodged with my Department.  The individual concerned may have made application for a hearing before the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to establish the right and entitlement to redundancy payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8229">The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent, quasi-judicial body under the aegis of my Department, and, as such, I have no role in its day-to-day operation.  Enquiries concerning claims submitted to the Tribunal can be made directly with the Tribunal Secretariat by telephone at 01 6313006 or Lo Call 1890 220 222; by email at eat@entemp.ie or in writing at Davitt House, 65A Adelaide Road, Dublin 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_8230">Once an EAT determination in favour of the individual's claim is available, it should be forwarded with a completed redundancy claim form (RP50) to my Department to enable the Department to make payment to the individual concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_8231">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.</p>
