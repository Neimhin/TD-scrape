#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I welcome Mr. Martin Murphy, managing director, and Ms Anna Doody from Hewlett Packard Ireland and Mr. Brian O'Malley from the Department of Social Protection.  I apologise for the fact that we are a little late in commencing our deliberations.  As members are aware, Mr. Murphy chaired the steering group on the national internship scheme, JobBridge, and his contribution today will focus mainly on this.  That scheme is playing a significant role in addressing some of the problems faced by those seeking to enter the workforce and is very relevant to the work the committee is doing.  I welcome the recent announcement to the effect that the number of available places on the JobBridge scheme has been increased from 5,000 to 6,000.  That is a good development and I look forward to hearing Mr. Murphy's views on it.The committee has already held three meetings in respect of this subject.  The main focus of these was to discuss ideas and solutions relating to tackling unemployment, with specific emphasis on youth unemployment.  We have also received a large number of submissions.  We are probably going to spend the next couple of months identifying the areas on which we believe Ministers should focus their attention.Before we commence, I wish to inform members that they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege with regard to the evidence they are to give this committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and if he or she continues to so do, he or she will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I again wish to apologise for the late start to the meeting.  We were obliged to move it from the regular time of 9.30 a.m. and this may mean that some members may be obliged to leave and return to the meeting as a result of its clashing with other events.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address them.  I am aware of the wider item of work to which the Chairman referred in his introductory remarks.  What I thought I would do is share with the committee some general perspectives I have on the challenge relating to job creation in Ireland.  I will also provide an update on the national internship scheme, JobBridge.  Given that I work for a company which has made a significant investment in Ireland, I thought I might provide some insights on investment and job creation.  I also thought I might refer to some qualities I see as essential elements of a successful jobs strategy.I accepted the invitation to attend this meeting because I am passionate about job creation in Ireland.  I am of the view that this subject is not attracting anything like the focus, priority or sense of urgency that it deserves.  The current economic challenges are having a huge effect on every family in the State.  Ireland is at a low ebb and people are looking to us for leadership on many fronts.  On of the most important ways in which we can provide leadership is in assisting unemployed people to return to the workplace.  If we can get this right, we can make a real difference.The level of work required in respect of job creation is immense and the number of people currently on the live register bear this out.  Before we consider the enablers or mechanics relating to job creation, I wish to take a step back.  I am of the view that there is a need for an enormous national effort - with politicians, industry leaders and the media being obliged to work together - in order to come to grips with the challenge that exists.  We all need to become involved in the business of building a better Ireland.I am of the view that politicians from across the political divide need to put aside their individual agendas and come together with a unity of purpose in respect of this topic.  We need fresh, lateral and radical thinking and we must move away from the current rhetoric which states that the next big idea on job creation is that the previous idea was a bad one and which does not offer any sort of constructive or viable solutions.  There is no getting away from the fact that fostering the environment for job creation is going to be difficult and that a unified approach will be required.  Sections of the media need to stop talking Ireland down.  The perpetual negativity in this particular domain is draining valuable energy away from our nation.  It must be remembered that we are at a unique time in our history.  Building a better Ireland is not just for the here and now, it is also for our children and future generations.Job creation should be everybody's business.  However, there is very much a national mindset that it is someone else's business.  Whereas I am of the view that leadership involves what I, as an individual, can do and what difference I can make, in the context of this presentation the question to be asked is what difference we can make together.  Our competitiveness is currently on an absolute knife edge and this must be borne in mind because it is business cases - not sentiment - that create jobs.  The national jobs strategy which the Government is working towards must build on our well-established inward investment track record.  It must also support small to medium-sized businesses and help them to grow and multiply.  Critically, it must also focus on how we can create new opportunities for those who are unemployed.  The key to economic recovery is to create an environment whereby every business in the State will actually be in a position to hire staff again.  If every business or every second business in the State hired one additional person, we would be well on track to solving the problem that exists with regard to unemployment.On labour activation and JobBridge, I am a very strong advocate of the principle that Government creates the environment and industry creates the jobs.  There is no question about that.  In that context, the Pathways to Work initiative packages meaningful back-to-work incentives for people and employers.  JobBridge is a very important component of that mix.  A year ago I was asked by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to chair the steering committee for the national internship scheme, JobBridge.  The Government set the steering committee an ambitious target to get 5,000 people back into the workplace in order to give them a boost of confidence and allow them to obtain further experience and new skills.  I and many of those participating in the scheme believe it deserves critical acclaim.  From a standing start, this public-private partnership built the first national internship scheme in the history of the State from scratch in a period of eight weeks  Inside ten months, almost 7,000 interns have commenced placements.  This has exceeded our expectations.  There has been a very strong take-up in respect of the scheme across the public, private and voluntary and community sectors.  There has been a strong take-up across company sizes with almost 60% of interns taking positions within Irish small and medium sized businesses.  There is a strong take-up across all the key and prime age groups we would target under this scheme.  There are some early indications, which we can discuss later, of positive progression rates back into the workforce, certainly rates that are very much in line with similar schemes in operation across Europe.  As the Chairman mentioned, last week the Minister announced an additional 1,000 places and a widening of the eligibility criteria to include those in receipt of the one-parent allowance or the disability allowance.  The Minister also announced that an independent evaluation of the scheme is to be undertaken with an interim report due in September.  Most importantly, the new PRSI incentive scheme, which was announced as part of the Finance Bill in January, will further encourage the hiring of interns into the workplace.  JobBridge is a pragmatic response to an urgent problem.  From a standing start, we created, and I emphasise this, a universally accessible internship ethos for the first time in the State, and that is a key part of the job activation mix.I will deal with the broader picture on investment and job creation.  At the heart of every investment decision made in Ireland lies the debate on our national competitiveness.  We have improved competitiveness in Ireland by a factor of 10% to 15% in recent years but we need to achieve at least the same again in the next two years.  Underpinning our efforts to create jobs in this State must be our holding the line on the competitiveness adjustments we have made, difficult and all as that will be.  While we have experienced many cost reductions and improvements in competitiveness, many of our competitor countries have achieved similar gains.  We cannot take competitiveness for granted.  As part of that equation, we simply cannot take foreign direct investment for granted.For an investor, the Ireland product is still compelling.  We are uniquely attractive as a gateway to Europe.  We offer a very high skill base, falling labour costs, favourable tax structures and very strong industry-based clusters here, which the IDA put in place in recent years.  Traditionally, we have had a very stable economy.  Ireland is still a good place to invest but there is intense international competition for every investment that comes into Ireland.In recent years my company, Hewlett Packard, HP, has been able to translate the improvements in Ireland's cost base into jobs and more investment here.  It is our ambition to build HP's Irish operation into a global innovation hub where we will innovate, incubate and globalise from our Irish base.  The National Competitiveness Council has provided a roadmap for change which will drive down the cost of doing business in Ireland.  We need to ensure that, as part of our work, we deliver on its findings.I wish to share with the members a summary of some qualities I consider to be intrinsic in a jobs strategy, and we can discuss them in the questions and answers session.  First, our jobs strategy must comprise a strong communications strategy, which effectively reinforces the messaging around Ireland's value proposition internationally, strongly addresses perceived threats to doing business in Ireland and allays any fears around economic instability in this country.  I strongly advocate a defensive strategy to fight against perceptions of weak corporate demand in Ireland, tight credit and low market confidence.  Getting our communications right will be a key part of a jobs strategy.Under the Government's action plan for jobs, we need to create 25,000 new and incremental jobs in this State annually.  In my view if it does not get measured, it will not get managed.  Second, I strongly advocate monthly updates of the number of jobs created being published publicly.Third, our jobs strategy must implement the findings of the National Competitiveness Council and prioritise the delivery of the recommendations outlined in its recent competitiveness scorecard.  Fourth, leadership and innovation is a common denominator across OECD countries and our jobs strategy must position Ireland as an innovation leader.  The principles of innovation must be adopted into the core of our jobs strategy.  In terms of how we commercialise innovation, create a return on investment, understand the downstream jobs benefits and understand that its deliverables and outcomes are realistic, Ireland has to commercialise innovation outcomes and translate that into jobs.  Fifth, our jobs strategy must drive a culture of start-ups and entrepreneurship because the reality is that these businesses will be the lifeblood of job creation in this State in the future.Sixth, Ireland should examine becoming a global hub for intellectual property.  We should examine how we could exploit intellectual property and build a proposition that is the best in Europe for patenting, which is better than any offering available in terms of the protection and cost of patents, and the speed of service.  If the intellectual property is here, we can centre the jobs here and, most likely, we can make the products or deliver the services from here.To support all of the above we need a modern primary and secondary educational curriculum with a much stronger emphasis on mathematics, science and the related technical competencies.  We welcome the bonus point change made to honours mathematics at leaving certificate level last year.  We strongly advocate that science becomes a compulsory subject in the Irish leaving certificate curriculum.  We must build the skills and the competencies that enable us to deal with the global market.  That means we must at least ensure fluency in international languages.  Specifically we strongly advocate fluency in two international languages at leaving certificate level in this State.I return to the question I posed at the start, namely, what can we do?  Today I have offered the members a roadmap covering areas that are well within our sphere of influence collectively which, if acted upon, would significantly improve the environment for job creation in the State.  I came here today because I am passionate about job creation and because I am in the business of building a better Ireland, which is the business in which we are all in.  If the members came to this meeting expecting a silver bullet, I will leave them with one.  It is that we must act now, we must act with urgency and we must act together to solve the job creation problem that exists in this State.

It is much appreciated.  We will now move on to a questions and answers session.  I will call Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh first as he was here first.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	4	That is fine.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	5	-----and, hopefully, I will not go on for too long.  I preface my remarks by saying I have been critical of Mr. Murphy's company in the past for some of its anti-trade union stances.  I will not get to go into that having regard to today's agenda, with the JobBridge scheme, in particular, being the subject with which we are dealing.  I was one of those who was critical of it from the start but acknowledge the experience of it has been positive.  I have always said there is a need for a proper internship scheme and we do not have that as yet in Ireland.  That is evident from even a perusal of what is still on offer on the JobBridge website to people who are fragile because they are unemployed.  They are reaching out and looking for opportunities.  It is regrettable that what is available includes positions as forecourt assistants and waitresses and positions in housekeeping.  Last month there was a furore about the fact that one of the options was to work as a loader, that someone would spend nine months learning how to load a truck.  In most of those cases, what is being offered seems to suggest that there is a displacement of jobs.  How will the Department ensure the opportunities being offered through JobBridge do not displace full-time positions which were previously offered in hotels, for example?  There is an advertisement on the website for a hairstylist.  It requires a City & Guilds qualification.  If one has a City & Guilds qualification in hairdressing, one does not need nine months in a hair salon.  What one needs is a job which pays a wage.In the United States there is a different type of internship scheme.  Has the Minister examined the criteria used there where an employer can only get an intern for free, which is what is involved in this situation, if he or she derives no immediate advantage from his or her activities?  If one employs a fully qualified hair stylist in a hair salon as an intern and charges members of the public for having their hair done by the intern, then the employer is gaining an advantage from his or her activities.  I could go through the range of criteria used.There is at least one website where people who have experience of JobBridge post their views, some of which are trenchant in that regard.  Are those sites monitored by the JobBridge team to see what problems and issues arise?  In some cases the issues are not just with the employer.  Some of them relate to mentors not carrying out their function.A series of jobs are being offered in construction, which is to be welcomed as it is an indication the construction sector is taking off.  However, many people have served an apprenticeship and done work experience as part of it.  If such work is being offered, it undermines an existing programme.  Previously, a graduate placement scheme existed.  Some of the companies that used to avail of it have switched to JobBridge which costs them nothing.  Has the reduction in placements options on the graduate scheme been monitored?  Has there been encouragement for those companies who are taking on interns to invest in them?  Not only do employers get staff for free but also they do not enjoy all of the protections of normal employees.  Have employers been asked to provide training or to provide access to City & Guilds courses or whatever is the relevant qualification in the area?  Apart from being on the JobBridge scheme people would have a piece of paper at the end of the process confirming they got more than just job experience, that they also obtained a qualification.  That would be an indication of progress.  Working as a car valet, fast food operative or telesales assistant is not what most people presume an internship is about.  It is about gaining key experience so that one can go on to a job that was beyond one's reach prior to the internship programme.
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank Mr. Martin Murphy and Ms Anna Doody for attending the meeting.  I do not wish to focus on JobBridge alone.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh made many valid points but I do not agree with all of them.  My perception of an internship is a little different from his.  We are in a situation in which we have never found ourselves previously so we must broaden the scope of what is considered as an internship.  Many young people who have finished secondary school or third level have never had the experience of being in a job.  They do not know what it is like to work.  For all the faults and failings of the internship scheme as it is, which people will always pick up on because it is the nature of any such scheme, there is much positivity around it.  Internships provide people with an opportunity to see what it is like to be in a simulated work environment.  It is recognised that by virtue of being an intern one does not have the same rights as another worker.I wish to broaden the scope of the debate as I am a supporter of the JobBridge scheme.  I am delighted it has expanded.  The news is good about the number of people who have been replaced and those who have gone on to full-time jobs after the JobBridge scheme.  We must spread the word more in that regard.Reference was made to being an enabler.  Industry, Government and the media to a certain extent must sing from the one hymn sheet.  The message must be that this country is open for business and that this is a good place to invest, create employment and do business.  I agree with the point made about the negativity that exists which is evident when one looks at the newspapers every morning.  People in this country are not the only ones reading those newspapers.  They are being read internationally and it is being reflected in the Financial Times.Reference was made to a silver bullet.  There is a sense of urgency right now.  Some of the solutions proposed will be too late given the time involved to roll them out.  They will happen either way.  It was said that Government creates the environment and industry creates the jobs.  I am anxious that people under the age of 25 do not end up being long-term unemployed because of the wage scar and all the factors they carry with them.As someone who is involved in the private sector I am aware there is a certain amount the Government can do.  One of the ideas that has been tossed around is that of a youth guarantee scheme in some shape or form, possibly replicating ideas from other countries but putting our own style on it to match the support systems in place in this country.  One could ask how industry can become involved.  The reality is the funding does not exist for us to try to create a youth guarantee scheme that would give everyone under the age of 25 an opportunity to become involved in education or training or for the State to become an employer of last resort.  We must acknowledge that.  Any scheme that would be developed would be a streamlined one that would meet the needs of those who are the most difficult to reach.To compensate for the fact the Government does not have the money to operate on a broad range and encompass everyone under the age of 25, how could industry become part of the system to devise a scheme to guarantee everyone under the age of 25 some sort of placement or education and training?  Any scheme would have to complement the Pathways to Work scheme and the action plan for jobs.  It is not about creating something new but about building on and complementing existing schemes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I will answer the previous questions first.  The JobBridge scheme is not perfect and we have acknowledged that.  If we had sat down with the intention of designing the perfect scheme, we would still be here today and the scheme would not be in existence.  Instead, in the short space of ten months what we have is 7,000 people who are either currently on the scheme or who have progressed through it.  Of the 2,000 who have completed the scheme and been reskilled, 800 have moved into full-time positions.  They are off the unemployment register.  That is an excellent outcome.  Given the numbers and the fact that the JobBridge programme is hoping to expand to cater for 6,000 annually, if we can get 40% into full-time positions, that will prove the programme has delivered.  The outcome it is designed to deliver is not just progression into the workplace, although that is the ideal outcome to any internship, but also to give people experience and skills in areas in which they do not possess them.  For example, there is a significant skills shortage in the technology sector in which I am located.  Hewlett-Packard has taken people in under the scheme and these individuals have been reskilled and are helping to solve the problem we face, as are many of the other peer companies in our space.On the quality of the positions on offer, I accept fully that a small number have been questioned, but the data we have available which I can share with the committee show that in respect of the 7,000 currently participating in the JobBridge programme, we have only received 30 complaints, or five in 1,000 or 0.005%.  These complaints must be addressed.  A total of 93% of interns who have participated in the scheme have said they would recommend the scheme, while 97% of employers have said they would recruit another intern if the opportunity arose.Clearly, questions have been asked about the scheme which has been designed as a universal one.  Many would say understanding a business involves working in all of its aspects.  There is a person in this building who packed my bags in a supermarket for many years who saw it as a key part of what he was trying to do - to understand customers.  We may regard this as a menial task, but it was of huge value to the individual concerned.  The scheme is universal; as such, we have to have an open mind.I accept that there must be quality control.  We do this in the case of all positions on site and have reduced the number of roles that are open to question.  To take the example of the hospitality sector, one of the early takers of interns, we worked with the relevant agencies.  The industry bodies would take people off-site for a certain length of time to train them in the hospitality business to ensure that when they had completed their internship, they had not just worked in an hotel or a restaurant but they had gained wider experience, expertise and skills.  They were more marketable as a result.  We have worked with industry bodies to improve the level of experience gained.  It is a mentoring and developmental process and we want an individual to leave the scheme having improved his or her skillsets and made himself or herself more marketable.There will always be negative experiences, but our job is to continue to reduce them.  I am not familiar with the websites to which the Deputy referred, but I know the Department monitors all of them.  We have a contract which is signed by the employer which commits him or her to maintaining a mentoring and developmental relationship with the intern.  There is considerable checking by the Department of the bona fides of the internships as they progress.  We have a complaints mechanism, but as I stated, we have received only 30 complaints in respect of 7,000 participants.  We also have a confidential whistleblowing facility in place for those participating in schemes who have issues.  Issues will arise for employers and interns can reach out to us in that regard.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It is an important question which keeps coming up in the feedback we receive, but it is important to note that a variety of measures have been introduced to protect interns and ensure the integrity of the scheme.  For an application to be approved, the host organisation must meet a number of quality criteria: the internship must not displace an existing position; it must provide for an appropriate training and development experience; and appropriate mentoring and support must be provided for the intern.  Each application received is checked against a number of quality criteria to determine if it provides for mentoring, supervision, the provision of support and the acquisition of a wide range of skills and experience.  In that context, it is important to note, as Mr. Murphy stated, that the JobBridge programme is open to individuals, irrespective of their skill levels.  Our view is that low skilled individuals have a right to access an activation measure that has been designed specifically to improve their skills, enhance their experience and improve their chances of securing employment.Additionally, there are a number of checks and balances.  For an internship to commence, a standard agreement must be signed and agreed by both parties.  The terms and conditions of the internship are clearly stated.  Importantly - to reply to one of the questions asked by the Deputy - a learning plan is incorporated; the host organisation must agree with the intern the range of learning outcomes to be achieved during the course of the six to nine month internship.  They cover a range of transferable and generic skills such as project management, IT skills, sales skills, etc.  It is important to note that we seek to ensure the host organisation and the intern abide by the rules of the scheme.The Department is involved in continuous monitoring of internships.  In that context, it is important to state there were 104 monitoring visits in the first quarter of the year, which involved an employment service officer visiting the workplace, liaising with both the host organisation mentor and the intern and asking a range of questions about the way the internship was progressing.  Of the 104 visits, 97, or more than 95%, were very satisfactory.It is important to note that participation in the scheme is entirely voluntary and that an intern may come to the JobBridge team at any stage in the internship for advice and support.  We have a dedicated e-mail address which is listed in the Contact Us section of the JobBridge website.  If an intern believes he or she is encountering difficulties, he or she can outline his or her grievance and have it investigated by the JobBridge team.  It is important to highlight that there is a whistleblowing facility in operation.  Consequently, an individual who suspects an internship may breach the scheme's criteria, including in terms of potential displacement, may contact the team and all such matters are fully investigated.We are keeping a close eye on comments on social media sites.  For example, there were many comments about disability allowance and one-parent family payments.  The Minister has acted on this feedback.  From 28 May those included in these cohorts will be allowed to participate in the scheme.  We take cognisance, therefore, of what is being said on social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, and try to respond to generic issues that emerge.  I have given two examples of where feedback was acted on.  Issues arose early on in the scheme about the participation of sole trader companies which was the subject of a good deal of commentary on social media sites.  Again, the Minister amended the terms of the scheme to allow such sole traders to participate in it.  These are just three recent examples of where we responded to what was emanating from social media accounts.A comment was made that there was no investment by host organisations.  That is not strictly the case.  The host organisation engages in a recruitment process to recruit the intern, into which a significant amount of time is put.  There is a standard agreement setting out the terms and conditions of the internship.  A learner agreement is attached as an appendix through which the host organisation must go with the intern.  Every month the host organisation must also undertake compliance checks to ensure the internship is proceeding in line with the standard agreement.  There are regular monitoring visits of workplaces.  Every advertisement states the intern will gain practical experience in listed areas.  There is a significant investment on the part of the host organisation or mentor in ensuring the internship works particularly well.Let me recap on some of the data.  Our figures as of 3 May indicate 6,840 internship placements had commenced.  This represents significant progress in the first ten months of operation.  We are examining some of the data in this regard, particularly for the rate of progression to employment.  As of 3 May, there were approximately 2,100 finishers, of whom 797 had progressed to employment.  The statistics are very positive, as some 37% of finishers to date have progressed to employment, either with their host organisation or another company.Let us examine international comparisons in this regard.  A European work study conducted last year examined 3,000 internships across the European Union and concluded the progression rate was typically 34%.  Our progression rate, 37%, compares favourably with that statistic.  The 797 who had progressed to employment had progressed directly thereto.  This figure does not take account of interns who may have found a job several weeks or months after their internship.  Our data pertain to progression immediately after an internship.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Does that mean the interns took up employment in the same position in the same company?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	10	No.  Of the 797 who took up employment, 360 were employed with their host organisation, while 437 were employed with another organisation.We have engaged Indecon to carry out an independent evaluation of the scheme.  Its work recently commenced and the results will give us a clearer picture of the progression rate among those who finished several months after their internships.  As Mr. Murphy indicated, there will be an interim report by the end of September.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I wish to answer the question on youth unemployment and how we might address it.  Transition year in secondary school represents a missed opportunity for youth.  It affords the main opportunity to introduce students to industry and link them directly with the skills industry seeks, irrespective of whether the students proceed to third level after the leaving certificate examination.  Schools need to build relationships with industry.  Every school in the State needs to have a transition year programme that ensures placements to industry, not for a couple of days or a week but, perhaps, a more extended period.  Thus, students could become immersed in a workplace and understand the critical skills they would need in it.  They include interpersonal, language and technical skills.I agree fully on the concern expressed by the Deputy.  We were discussing the rate of unemployment among those under 25 years.  This is a source of great concern.  A starting point in addressing this problem is the adoption of a much more structured approach and forging better links between schools and industry.  I highlighted transition year, in particular, as an opportunity to start that process.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I thank Mr. Murphy.  I will bank all the questions asked.  This session was meant to end now, but we will continue until 2 p.m.  Members must not make speeches; they should ask direct questions.  If we do not have time to hear all of the answers, we may obtain them in writing afterwards.  We will probably meet the delegates again on this issue.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I thank the delegation for its presentation.  Mr. Murphy has stated job creation is not being afforded the priority it deserves.  I did not see in his paper strong evidence to support this, or new ideas he might be recommending to us.  I acknowledge that he has said there is no silver bullet.  Most of us around the table would accept this and that we will be working incrementally to create jobs one by one in small and medium-sized enterprises.Mr. Murphy referred to innovation and leadership, as well as intellectual property and development in this area.  In recent years staff from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and other organisations have told us that this is exactly what they are working on and that this is their strategy.  Is there something these organisations are doing that is inadequate?  Will the delegation elaborate on this point?Is the gain in competitiveness in the order of 10% to 15% purely on the basis of labour rates?  Are there other productivity elements?With regard to the need for clustering, is it possible to encourage it or does it emerge independently over time?  I am interested to hear the delegates' thoughts on this issue.Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh referred to JobBridge and people driving a forklift.  Traditionally, we regarded internships as being more for engineers, scientists and professionals at that level.  An individual with a low skill level deserves an internship just as much as the engineer or scientist.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Mr. Murphy referred to start-up businesses.   He is, therefore, speaking about self-employed persons.  A charity group stated on radio this morning that many self-employed persons were finding it hard to put food on the table because there was no social welfare system in place for them.  I acknowledge there has been a relaxation of the social welfare code for the self-employed.  A gentleman who attended my constituency office last week was going to deregister, but the Revenue Commissioners did not want to do so in the hope he would start up again.  If we are to make serious progress, we must put a system in place for self-employed persons.  Civil servants who were before us recently stated 20% to 30% of their income was taken away to put a stamp in place.  I want to see facts and figures.  We were told there would be an internal report last November, but it has not appeared.  I want to see something done.  If we are to have self-employed persons working, we must put in place an incentive for people to start up businesses.  What does Mr. Murphy believe is the way forward for self-employed persons?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	15	To clarify, Department representatives were present last week.  As Mr. O'Malley is new in the Department, we will not hit him with all the questions.  The representatives clarified that the report would be available in a couple of months.  We will hear Mr. Murphy's comments on the issue as we cannot expect Mr. O'Malley to answer because, being new to the Department, he is present specifically to discuss internships.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	16	That is satisfactory.  The report was meant to be issued in November.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Yes.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I agree that job creation is the key to moving beyond our current position.  I agree with Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh's point on internships.  Originally, they were associated with higher skilled graduate positions, for example.  My understanding of low-skilled jobs is that there were training areas to which one went to be trained to drive a truck or a car, for example, after which one proceeded to a job.  There was workplace training for six months and if one was up to scratch, one was kept on.  That is why I am concerned about the way internships are used.  I do not believe there was a real need in this regard, but we will see how effective the internships have been when the report is published.  Mr. Martin Murphy made the point that the Government creates the environment, while industry creates jobs.  However, to my knowledge there has been a reduction in investment of approximately 67% by private industry in Ireland in recent times.  How will this issue be resolved?  Does Mr. Murphy believe there is a commitment from industry to increase investment in the future?  If not, how should one approach matters such as the public works programmes and so on that must be put in place?  Mr. Murphy also made the point that national competitiveness has improved by 10% to 15% and this must be replicated within the next two years.  However, the problem is many of our competitors are doing the same thing.  Consequently, how does Mr. Murphy envisage such competitiveness improvements being achieved?  I seek clarity on whether such improvements in competitiveness will be achieved through labour costs, the type of jobs we have etc.  From where will it come, as a further 15% improvement over two years would be quite a lot?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I thank Mr. Martin Murphy, as the managing director of a large company, for taking on this work and being obliged to defend it on radio and television.  I would love to see other managing directors in similar roles working voluntarily to increase jobs.  I thank him for putting his neck on the line.I will now begin to give out.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Deputy should not give out but should just ask questions.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I wish to ask Mr. Murphy two things.  He mentioned the possibility of the 80,000 companies each taking on another member of staff.  Can Mr. Murphy or Mr. O'Malley tell members how this can be done?  Would it be possible to try to fast-track this proposal, as a silver bullet, really quickly?  My second point is made from an education perspective.  I often have heard Mr. Murphy state everyone should be doing honours maths and science should be compulsory.  Such comments annoy me because there are different intelligences and some people simply lack mathematical skills but are equally as good at linguistics or in the artistic field.  When listening to Mr. Murphy make that point, it is very tough on kids who have failed their maths examinations but who may have been brilliant in other fields - especially tough on the day on which the leaving certificate results are released.  I believe those who are very good at maths should only get double or additional points for engineering.  One should not receive such a bonus for subjects such as medicine or other studies to which it really does not apply.  While I agree with Mr. Murphy, such a bonus should be for the sciences, mathematics or whatever.  I ask Mr. Murphy to comment on this point and want him to take on board the perspective of those who are not very good at maths.  He also referred to international languages but I do not believe one can make stuff compulsory.  We should direct kids who are very good at mathematics to do mathematics.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I agree with Deputy Butler's point that time is of the essence when it comes to self-employed people and this is an extremely important issue.  Second, I apologise for not being present for the entire meeting and I would greatly appreciate a copy of the presentation.  I share Deputy Ó Snodaigh's views that the chances for exploitation in this sector are serious.  I refer to the entire idea of having people doing internships for nine months while on forecourts, waiting on tables, packing bags etc.  Nevertheless, I favour the idea of internships.  My major problem concerns the figure of 300-odd people who got jobs in the companies concerned and the 700-odd people who got jobs afterwards.  According to the latest CSO figures from April 2011, 6,500 people are emigrating each month and consequently, as a proportionate response to the mammoth task ahead, this merely comprises a drop in the ocean.  As the State has access to funds, does Mr. Murphy think the Government should access funding from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank?  In addition, does he believe the Government should take up the offer by the private pension industry to put €5 billion into infrastructural capital expenditure, which could create jobs initially and competitiveness in the long term?
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I apologise for missing the beginning of the meeting as I was obliged to attend another committee meeting.  I am glad to meet Mr. Murphy in the flesh as I heard him speak on the radio and was impressed as he spoke with great credibility.  Moreover, he elicited a great response from people who rang in afterwards - I checked  - which is a good sign.  He answered any constructive criticisms in a highly forthright and honest fashion.  He was a good spokesperson for the brief he holds.  The purpose of these joint committee meetings is to hear new ideas and I regret Deputy Ó Snodaigh has used this meeting to criticise.  While there will be time for constructive criticism and evaluation of existing schemes, this is about new ideas and Deputy Ó Snodaigh should have spent more of his time on that sector of activity.I wish to raise two points.  First, while I do not know whether he had a chance to respond earlier to my colleague, Deputy Lyons, about youth guarantee schemes, what does he think of such a scheme in respect of youth unemployment?  Second, I will run an idea by Mr. Murphy to elicit his response thereto.  I have been working, with a couple of others, on imagining a new profile for activation measures for young people to really engage and garner the enthusiasm of young people into this area of activity.  It is time for a new profile of activation measures whereby a typical activation measure would embrace health and well-being.  For example, as part of their scheme, young people would engage in swimming, physical education, mountain climbing or canoeing.  The profile would be animated across the week with such activities, as well of course as the training and perhaps a bridge into apprenticeship or whatever.  However I believe young people must be engaged in the round in all the aspects of their being, including health, fitness, lifestyle and so on.  I seek a response from Mr. Murphy to this suggestion.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	24	A lot of questions have been asked and while we can stretch out the meeting until approximately 2.05 p.m., we will have to wrap it up thereafter.  If Mr. Murphy, Mr. O'Malley or Ms Doody wish to add anything further thereafter, they are welcome to send written replies to the committee.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I will go around the table quickly.  No one wants to see exploitation under the scheme and I assure the Deputy that each JobBridge steering group meeting considers the whole area of governance and compliance, as well as the questions raised at this meeting.  Each time we meet, which is approximately every three or four weeks, we consider this and we review the statistics on a weekly basis.  We are very alert to the concerns that have been raised and that State funding is being used for the scheme in what obviously are extremely straitened times.  Exploitation is very much a focus for our minds.As for the languages question, Hewlett-Packard was one of the first organisations, I think it was about three years ago, to broaden the debate to which the Deputy already has alluded, to the effect this is not just about maths and science but also is about the languages.  We have lobbied heavily on the question that people should be leaving with maths or science or, if they are not that way disposed, certainly with language skills.  We were one of the first companies to work with some schools, particularly in the Dublin region, to introduce Chinese as a part-time subject in transition year and beyond and many other schools have followed suit.  We are highly conscious of this and it is about more than just the science and maths.As for the question on start-up companies, I accept we have a lot of work to do in the State.  However, if one considers the foreign direct investment companies that have come into Ireland over the past two years, many of them did not exist three, four or five years ago.  Consequently, the challenge we face as a nation is to create some of those types of companies here.  I do not know whether this will solve the problem posed by the Deputy but when I talked about start-ups and entrepreneurships, I note I recently was invited to be a panellist in an Irish entrepreneur forum for 20 and 21-year olds.  It was hosted by all the universities in the State and I was absolutely impressed by the calibre and quality of business ideas with which our young people are capable of coming up.  I can see many of those young people out there, but it is about making it easy for them to start a business, get up and running, get seed funding and literally giving them that first beginning to drive their businesses forward.There is a lot of be done in this space but those companies should ultimately be growing into Irish multinationals.  As a nation, we have to focus on, foster and nurture those type of companies, whoever is starting them.  We also have to look at how we can scale them up.A question was posed about ideas and I think there are some very good ideas in this document.  One might say it is stating the obvious, but that must be done.  I have mentioned the work of the National Competitiveness Council a number of times, and competitiveness is a serious enabler to creating jobs.  It is not just labour rates, but also the whole package that Ireland has to offer.  We have a great story to tell, although we must improve in certain areas.  Looking at the tourist sector, for example, we are all well aware that hotel rates have come down.  Equally, however, we are aware that the cost of eating out and other things is still very expensive compared to international standards.  We know that and must find a way of addressing it.Competitiveness is an enabler to creating jobs.  The task we set ourselves in the Government jobs strategy was getting 100,000 people back in employment by 2016.  That is where I got the figure of 25,000.  On a weekly basis we can get an unbelievable amount of details and data from the Department on the JobBridge scheme.  I am advocating that we publish that data.  If we are focused on managing that, in itself it will become a catalyst to push harder and drive numbers.The question of innovation was raised also.  A couple of years ago, the report by an bord snip nua highlighted innovation outcomes.  Nobody is denying that we are investing heavily in innovation, but can we drive outcomes and translate them into jobs?  That is the question I am posing to the joint committee.  We have had some successes but that is the core question.If we have our intellectual property here, the jobs that will form around it will also be here.  My predecessor, Mr. Seán O'Driscoll, who sits on the JobBridge committee with me, is a strong advocate of manufacturing.  Some questions were asked about manufacturing following his piece and Mr. O'Driscoll addressed them quite well.  We clearly have to start making things in Ireland again and finding ways of manufacturing them.  Rather than manufacturing somebody else's ideas, we need to innovate, have the intellectual property and translate that into Irish jobs.  They may be high-end jobs but could equally be manufacturing jobs.  That is what that circle is about.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Yes, I would like to clarify a few points.  The figure of 797 who progressed directly into employment on immediate completion of internship, was 360 in the host organisation and 437 in another organisation.  That was immediately on completion of the internship, so there was not a gap between them going in there.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Yes.  The exit surveys that we were undertaking indicate that it is easier for people to get a job when they are currently working.My final point concerns low-skill internships which continue to get much publicity.  We are getting a lot of daily feedback from people coming into us, particularly early school leavers who have been long-term unemployed and have not had an opportunity to work.  They say that many of these opportunities allow them to develop a work ethic and build networks in places of employment.  It is a confidence-building exercise to get back into the routine of doing a nine-to-five job.  There has been criticism of those type of internships but they are equally valid depending on the educational qualifications and skills profile of the individual in question.  Not everyone has a PhD and can do the higher level opportunities.  That is not to say that we do not take cognisance of the criticism of potential abuses.  We are following up formal complaints about those areas.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I wish to make a closing comment.  My own company took on 23 interns in a facility in Galway.  Some of those have progressed into full-time employment.  I understand four of them were hired into HP.  As a number of them were in HP, in the network and back in the workplace, they found full-time jobs with companies in the area.  Therefore part-way through their internship with us, they regrettably left and went into full-time employment.  That is a dynamic that nobody had anticipated.  The internship scheme is not like a university course which has to be six or nine months long.  If somebody comes in and gets a job two or three months later, that is a good thing.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I want to thank everyone for their contributions.

We may have missed some questions in Mr. Murphy's wrap-up and if members of the committee have any more questions we can forward them to him for written answers.  We may invite Mr. Murphy back to the committee on another occasion when the report comes out.  There are many issues of concern which feed into the work of the committee.I thank the witnesses for their time today.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy can talk to Senator Healy Eames after the meeting because I know she wanted to pose a question, but we cannot deal with it formally now.  We will re-engage with this subject.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I will provide the Chairman with a shortened version of the areas I covered at the outset.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I welcome Mr. Peter Baldwin, assistant secretary, Mr. Vincent Landers, principal officer, and Mr. John McDermott, assistant principal officer, at the Department of Education and Skills.Before we hear the officials' presentations, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Mr. Baldwin to make his presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I thank the committee for the opportunity to meet to discuss the European Globalisation Fund, EGF, in Ireland to date.  We have already forwarded a briefing note to the committee which I hope it found useful.The EGF is an EU fund which co-finances programmes of active labour market measures in support of workers who are made redundant as a result of the adverse impacts of globalisation.  The fund provides specific, once-off, time-limited support to facilitate the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market.  The EGF has a number of strict eligibility criteria governing when and how applications can be made by an EU member state.In summary, applications can be made when the number of redundancies is at least 500 in a specific company and any of its suppliers or downstream producers within a four month reference period, or at least 500 in a NACE 2, statistical classification, sector in a nine month reference period.  There are also strict eligibility criteria regulating what constitutes globalisation.  Under the original 2006 regulations these criteria centred on circumstances where there was major structural change in world trade patterns leading to a serious economic disruption, notably a substantial increase of imports into the EU, a rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector, or a delocalisation to third countries.  Under a subsequent amending regulation in mid-2009, a temporary derogation was introduced which provided that another eligibility criteria could be used involving redundancies that were a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis.  However, this derogation ended on 31 December 2011.EGF measures may include but are not limited to job search assistance, occupational guidance, training and education, outplacement assistance, entrepreneurship promotion and aid for self-employment.  Programmes must be completed within two years of the date of submission of the application.  All EGF measures must, in turn, be co-financed from national funding sources.  With the end of the so-called crisis derogation at the end of last year, the co-financing rate has reverted from 35% to 50%.  Clearly national resources available to co-finance EGF programmes are finite and must compete with demands for funding of other labour market activation programmes across the entirety of the unemployed population as well as with demands for funding of other areas of expenditure.  This impinges on both the upfront provision of such resources ahead of EGF approvals by the EU and the complementary or additional nature of such programmes.Ireland first made an EGF application in 2009 through the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which then held national policy responsibility for the EGF.  In that year it made three applications in support of up 2,840 workers at the Dell computer manufacturing plant in Raheen, County Limerick, 653 workers at the Waterford Crystal factory in Kilbarry, County Waterford, and 910 workers at the SR Technics aircraft maintenance facility at Dublin Airport.In 2010 the Department of Education and Skills, to which policy responsibility for the EGF had transferred, made the first Irish sectorial application in support of almost 9,000 redundant construction workers.  The European Commission subsequently requested that this application, the largest of its type to that point, be broken down into three separate NACE 2 subsectors.  On 29 February this year, the Department submitted an application in support of 592 redundant workers at the TalkTalk call centre in Waterford and a number of ancillary enterprises.In the Department's written brief prepared for the committee, there is an overview of the number and types of EGF applications submitted and approved across the EU to date and details of the Irish programmes.  Total EGF potential expenditure across all approved Irish programmes is €93.2 million, of which €60.6 million is available from the EU.Under the EGF regulations a member state has up to ten weeks after the reference period to submit its application to the European Commission.  Applications require to be approved by the Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The full application and approval process is a lengthy and complex one which can take on average between seven to ten months for completion and the actual release of funding to a member state.  The Department utilises the statutory collective redundancy notifications issued to the Minster for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as the primary early warning system.  The redundancy payments system is the primary verifiable documentation used to satisfy the EU, including its audit authorities, of the actuality of redundancy numbers.In preparing EGF applications and implementing EGF programmes, the Department has in the main to date worked through existing structures and service providers.  They are on the ground and have local and regional knowledge to engage in the first instance with employers and workers to assemble relevant data and assess the needs of workers in terms of guidance, training, etc.To date, three of the six approved EGF programmes in Ireland have been completed with in excess of 10,000 guidance, training, education and enterprise interventions having been provided to almost 4,000 individual workers.  Final reports have been submitted in respect of the completed Dell programme in December 2011, Waterford Crystal programme in February 2012 and SR Technics programme in April 2012.  The European Commission, in turn, has up to six months after the receipt of all relevant information on a programme to formally close that programme.  None of the three programmes has yet been formally closed by the Commission.  However, we have indications from the Commission of the likely amounts to be approved which are included in the written brief.  The three construction sector programmes are due to finish by 9 June 2012 and the TalkTalk application is under consideration by the European Commission.The Minister of State with responsibility for training and skills, Deputy Cannon, initiated a review of the three completed EGF programmes to date late last year with both written and oral submissions from key stakeholders, notably the representatives of the redundant workers themselves.  The point of this is to examine how we build on the strengths of the process while learning of areas where improvements can be made.  This will ensure we put our best foot forward in any further applications.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	38	The EGF provides the State with an opportunity to ensure those who lost their jobs have some level of retraining, a measure we support.  However, there has been an uneven delivery of the fund.  I know one former construction worker in Navan who wanted to become a crane driver, a slight change in career direction.  To do so, he took a course and was offered work experience on a crane.  All he had to do was cover the cost of the insurance.  However, he did not have the money and he could not complete the training.  A limit was put on his development.Is it not the case that €5.9 million has been returned to the fund?  Given the difficulties encountered by people trying to reskill, such as the case I just mentioned, the idea that €5.9 million was returned is shocking.  What went wrong in the Department that caused this return?  Has there been an official investigation into how that was handled?  I believe that on a particular date in January, 18 months after the application was made, few if any of those 9,000 workers were contacted to let them know the procedure.  I note that at certain times during the process the Government had tens of millions of euro to spend but it was coming close to the closure of one of those programmes.  It may have had only 24 weeks to spend all of this particular funding and that would have made it next to impossible.Will the Vodafone workers who have been displaced have access to the globalisation fund?  Will the State make an application to the European Globalisation Fund on behalf of the 10,000 persons who lost their jobs in the banking sector?  Will the Government make an application on behalf of the 50,000 persons who lost their jobs in the retail sector in the past four years to see whether it can help them retrain?  If it is all right, could we begin with those questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Certainly, it is a valid question.  Today's meeting is valuable because it allows us drill down into some of the issues.In terms of the return of funding, the programme envisages recoupment to the EU, and that is the pan-European experience.  In fact, the amount of funding we would have returned from Ireland would be less than the European average.  It is the dynamic or the way the regulation is constructed.  In other words, one applies and puts one's best foot forward.  One tries to assess and we use the staff on the ground because one cannot make an assessment from Marlborough Street.  I will come back to the sectoral ones but in terms of an individual company, we use the staff on the ground to assess what might be provided for the workers in this company in terms of engagement by FÁS.  In one case, the agency worked through the shift rota of the companies, where they were working at night, etc.  The agency makes an assessment and together we try to put together a package.The first of these three applications, all of which were made in 2009, was our first foray into or effort to use the EGF.  When one does that, one is dealing with persons who, understandably, are in a state of uncertainty, not only as to what might be available but as to where they want to go forward.  Any of us faced with a career defining moment must ask whether we will invest a year in this particular training and whether that is where we want to go.  I only mention that.  In trying to assess at that point in time, one must bear in mind there is a ten-week period, between the end of the notifications and submitting the application, to make one's assessment as to what persons might avail of.  When it comes to the delivery end where one is trying to roll out one's assessment based on local knowledge of what people might avail of, matters have moved on.  By the time the EU has approved, which would be on average seven to ten months later, what people want to avail of might be different from what is in the original application.  Inevitably, the take-up on programmes may be less than one originally planned.  This has been the pan-European experience.There is no hazard or downside in putting one's best foot forward or being as positive as possible in one's application because the EU gives the funding and then if one does not use it, one gives it back.  However, that is not a failure.  Equally, one could call it an over-estimate.  There would be valid reasons where one might err on the higher side because one does not want to leave anybody out in terms of expenditure.  There is an inevitability and our experience in Ireland has been better than the EU average.  At the end of the day, one just does not know.  As anyone who has children making college decisions or a family where someone is unemployed will be aware, those who might be clear at one moment who make a decision to go a particular route as a change may switch a few months later and state that it is not what they want to do, and that affects the take-up.We have tried to build in the lessons from that in how we go forward from the review.  For example, we provide guidance at the back end and guidance is part of the programme.  If someone is uncertain after the programme starts, at least we can offer him or her guidance.  As we have done in the latest application on TalkTalk, which is still under consideration by the Commission and the outcome of which we do not know, we try to build in as much flexibility as possible to the model in order that if people change what they might want to avail of, one has the flexibility to switch further downstream.It is not like a normal annual Government process where one has a good idea every year what one must spend and suddenly there is a downturn.  In this case, one is trying to guess, based on many uncertainties and variables, what people might avail of some months hence and there is almost an inevitability, and certainly a high probability, of one recouping funding to the EU on the basis that there is no downside in getting it but may have to return it one subsequently, and if one did not get enough from the EU and one had the funding to co-finance, one may well have left people out.  That is the explanation for that.

Our benchmark should be that all the funding to which we have access to deliver training would be utilised.  The second issue is that if it is necessary for more effort to go in at the assessment end to ensure the assessment is closer to the end result, that needs to be undertaken.The third issue is there are big waiting gaps.  As I stated, 18 months after making applications, none of the 9,000 workers has been contacted.  No doubt matters change over 18 months but if individuals could be contacted much sooner, one is more likely to get into dealing with them under the initial assessment.  There have been major gaps and time lags in the delivery of this.  There also has been limited time for spending the money which, at the other end, creates a difficulty for the Department.  Given we are in a more difficult circumstance than the European average on job losses, especially in the construction sector, we need to be spending this funding where it is needed.  If it is the case the infrastructure of the European Globalisation Fund is so inflexible that it does not suit the experience of those who are losing their jobs, it is up to us as a member state to go to the Union to seek to make it flexible enough so that it works for the applicants.Some of the information that was coming out is astonishing.  The Department was asked during the process whether it knew the names and addresses of everybody who was on this list and it put its hands up, as it were, and stated it did not know the address of those who had applied for this.  It seems the delivery did not suit the need of those who were made unemployed.The further questions were, what is the Department's view on applications in the case of Vodafone, the banking sector and the retail sector?

On the assessment in advance, the ten-week period is a big constraining factor where an individual company is concerned.I will come back on the sectoral one.  That is a different animal and is not as amenable.  It has been a difficult one.  I will come back on the construction one.On Deputy Tóibín's example of the crane driver, FÁS, now the Department of Social Protection, has a TESG grant, which is a flexible grant for the unemployed that might be the type of support that could have assisted in that case.  Often an employment services officer would have a person saying he or she would like to do something which, rather than being a full-time course, would be addressing a need in a certain area, for example, a HGV licence.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I will clarify with regard to the construction fund.  The sector is being monitored to establish how many redundancies arise.  Often redundancies are announced in the press but, as we saw recently with regard to Aviva, they do not transpire.  Therefore, one must also watch the amount of redundancy payments made and measure the difference.  We drill down through this information to see whether the circumstances in which the redundancies arose are suitable for the EGF.  After this process was completed with regard to the construction sector an application was lodged and we have the details and addresses of the individuals involved.One must bear in mind the approval process can take seven to nine months.  The construction sector had to be broken down into sectoral codes but our systems were not programmed to provide the information with the NACE code format.  This caused a delay as we worked on breaking down the group of 9,000 into sub-categories such as specialised construction, construction and architectural services.  A total of 3,000 companies and 9,000 employees were involved and we had to examine under what code each company fell.  This took time and caused the delay.The question of what can be done in advance of approval was raised by workers during the consultation phase.  The Deputy referred to the country's economic situation.  The amount of money available to the State for upfront payments is very limited.  We have had three company and one sectoral applications.  What we can deploy quickly in a co-ordinated way to engage and see what can be produced are the existing structures in which the State has invested, such as FÁS employment services which are now under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection, and the VECs, institutes of technology and universities.  This is one level of prioritisation whereby resources are concentrated on the company involved.We must also ask what spend can be incurred in advance of approval, and we do not have a significant pot of resources from which to draw.  A potential area is the national training fund which, like any other area of expenditure, is treated like the Department of Finance.  The only difference is that we do not need to borrow for it.  Initially we did not have an allocation, although some FÁS work has been funded by it, but we now have a small allocation from the fund.  The programme required for the construction sector is huge because if 9,000 people were given a grant of €1,000 each it would amount to €9 million.  We do not have the resources for this so our capacity to act immediately is limited.  All we can do is use existing resources in a concentrated way, which is possible for a company but not a sector spread throughout the country.  Therefore, we must wait for approval from the EU.  This is how it worked with SR Technics, Dell and Waterford Crystal.We listened to the outcome of the consultation process and we have examined whether workers can be given additional funding from the beginning.  The only company affected since then has been TalkTalk and we have tried to provide this although we do not have approval yet.  We have also tried to improve contact with the workers and the Deputy made a valid point on this.  This is more difficult with regard to the construction industry and I will return to this point.  We are using existing resources, and FÁS and other public sector organisations are trying to do more.  A locally based team was assigned in Limerick which has gained experience and additional staff have been contracted to work with it.  It is engaging with TalkTalk although the application has only just been made and has not been approved yet.  The moment the application was made we began to engage with the workers.  Based on a suggestion from workers who had been affected previously we now have a dedicated website.  We have learned lessons since the first foray into the EGF by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2009.Dealing with the construction sector is difficult because it involves selecting a period during which the numbers can be optimised.  We did this and submitted an application.  What do we tell the 9,000 people involved?  The normal seven to ten-month period would be bad enough, but a delay occurred because of the NACE codes.  If we tell construction workers we may be able to help them because we have made an EGF application the first question they will ask is what we can do for them.  The answer is we do not know because the application has not yet been approved.  The next question will be when will we know and the answer is that we do not know how long it will take.  Notifying people at the time an application is made would be problematic and may cause greater anxiety.  As soon as we were made aware it had been approved letters were sent to all 9,000 people.To answer the Chairman's question the only people involved are those named, and this creates a difficulty.  People can fall off the edge if redundancy payments do not go through by the deadline.  The number of redundancies in the construction sector within the period means one person may receive something and another may not.  An equity issue arises when 450,000 people are on the live register.  We want to use the EGF as best we can but this means using national resources to co-finance the EGF.  This means pulling these national resources from something else, which is why we are limited to what we can provide upfront.  This causes a dilemma because if two factories in the same industrial estate lose workers, the 400 workers lost in one factory could receive the standard amount while the 600 workers lost in the other factory could receive additional funding.  These latter workers could argue the additional funding was not sufficient, and we are working on this, but they would have the benefit of the EGF.  Using national resources requires prioritising and this raises an issue of equity.  I do not mean equality, but issues of equity and fairness do arise.We monitored the banking sector during 2010 and 2011.  Announcements were made and some redundancy payments were made.  We had to choose when to drill down through the figures to see whether the criteria were met with regard to financial circumstances and globalisation.  The indications were that announcements of greater redundancies in retail banking would be made.  As we subsequently found out, 2,500 redundancies were announced in AIB with redundancies in Bank of Ireland also.  The problem with the banking sector is the derogation which allowed for financial circumstances was expected to continue because financial circumstances had not changed, but a blocking minority at EU level stopped it.

The issue is complicated by the process of matching funding and so on.  Have qualifying applications been made to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF, and subsequently turned down on the basis that there were no matching funds from the Department?Regarding the application process, the time for drawing down funds once an application has been made is limited.  It takes a long time to get from application to successful decision.  Someone mentioned as many as seven or ten months.  The effect of this is to limit the window for individual workers to draw down funding.  This has been a factor in the case of former workers at SR Technics, SRT, and so on.  I have been dealing with this matter for constituents.  Although this issue might be outside the Department's control, could it recommend to Europe as part of a review that the draw down period should start from the point at which the decision is made instead of from the date of the application?  It would make sense.  I would be interested in our guests' comments in this regard.Some SRT workers who have received some money under the fund have commenced two-year or three-year degree programmes.  However, only the first year of a worker's course was funded because the time had elapsed and the funding for the end of the course was not available.  This is unfair.  The Department is adhering to the rules, but could this matter be examined in the review?

The circumstance that applies is globalisation.  I am not sure whether retail would fit into the globalisation piece.Regarding banking, prior to the end of the period for considering the financial circumstances criteria at the end of December, we conducted a nine-month evaluation to determine whether we could establish the numbers, but they were not credible.  The main numbers came out in January of this year.I am unsure of the position in respect of the Vodafone announcement, what transactions may have occurred and how the situation meets the criteria.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Yes.  To revert to Deputy Ryan's point, no application has been rejected for lack of funds.  Before making an application, our side commits to providing funds to the approved extent, given the limitations that I announced.Regarding changes at EU level, we have articulated our opinion.  The Deputy referred to the draw down, but the length of the programme must be completed within two years from the submission of the application.  Ideally, the two-year period should date from the approval.  One would want to truncate the process, as people will have moved on with their lives.  If one wants to assist them at the most critical moment, everything should be pulled back.  The Deputy's point was valid.I am not fully au fait with the Deputy’s SR Technics example.  A concession was made, in that a particular course was made eligible for higher education grants.

They are Mr. Dermot Curran, assistant secretary; Ms Fiona Flood, principal officer; and Mr. Michael Greene from the employment rights and industrial relations division.  The meeting has dragged on so I apologise for keeping the witnesses waiting.  I am also conscious that the meeting should have been this morning so I appreciate the delegation compromising for our schedule.  Our three guests are here to brief the committee on the two proposals for consideration: COM (2012) 130, proposed regulation on the exercise of the right to take collective action within the context of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services; and COM (2012) 131, proposed directive on the enforcement of the directive concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services.  Mr. Curran will brief us on COM (2012) 130 and Ms Flood will brief us on COM (2012) 131.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege with regard to the evidence they are to give this committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and continues to so do, he or she will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	63	My opening remarks will cover both the directive and the regulation, and Ms Flood and Mr. Greene will be available on matters of detail that may be of interest to the committee.  The two proposals launched by the European Commission in March are intended to strike the right balance between protecting workers and facilitating cross-border service provision in the context of fair competition in Europe's Single Market.The proposal for an enforcement directive aims to remove uncertainties that have arisen in the implementation of the 1996 rules on the posting of workers.  It aims to ensure better information for workers and companies about their rights and obligations, and better co-ordination between national competent authorities.  In Ireland's case, our competent authority is the National Employment Rights Authority.  The parallel so-called Monti II regulation is intended to take account of recent case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union and confirm that the freedom to provide services does not have primacy over social rights or vice versa.  It is intended to confirm that the fundamental right or freedom to strike and economic freedoms must be placed on an equal footing.The posting of workers plays an important role in the cross-border provision of services, particularly in sectors like construction, transport and temporary agency work.  It is also important for service activities requiring a specialised, highly skilled workforce, such as in the information technology sector.  The original 1996 posting of workers directive set out a core of mandatory working conditions applicable to posted workers in the host member state.  It seeks to guarantee fair competition between all service providers and a level playing field.  It also seeks to ensure that posted workers enjoy an adequate degree of protection during postings and prevents a race to the bottom with regard to working conditions.The Commission's package of proposals will be examined in the Council of Ministers and by the European Parliament.  Ireland's key concerns will be to ensure that any additional legislative intervention in this area will bring clarity and legal certainty to it.  A key public policy concern is to ensure that core working conditions, such as minimum rates of pay, working time and provisions on health and safety at work, are well defined and that the temporary posting of workers is not used as a way to side-step minimum entitlements relating to pay and conditions.In this context our priority is to ensure that any new proposal respects a diversity of the different industrial relations systems across member states, including the long-established role of bodies such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Departmental officials are currently engaged with the Council's deliberations on the new proposals via the working group on social questions.  The Department has also initiated a round of consultations with social partners and other key stakeholders in order to ascertain views on the overall package of measures.Turning specifically to the directive, the Government broadly welcomes the Commission's draft proposal for a directive on the enforcement of the original posting of workers directive.  Ireland attaches great importance to the two fundamental principles at the heart of this proposal - the free movement of workers within the EU and the protection of those workers' rights on the one hand, and on the other hand the freedom of businesses to provide services anywhere in the EU's internal market.  The challenge in getting the text of this directive agreed between member states will be in striking the appropriate balance between these two fundamental principles.An improved system of enforcement of the posted workers directive should be capable of being achieved without creating excessive administrative burdens.  This means avoiding excessive new burdens in resource constrained times for competent authorities of the state by minimising the need for new institutional systems or entities for the purpose.  More importantly, perhaps, it means the new measures should not unduly impinge on business, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, which are disproportionately affected by administrative burdens.Any improved system of enforcement of existing posted workers' rights should build on, not duplicate, existing compliance and enforcement arrangements that exist at national level.  In the Irish context, there are robust employment rights enforcement arrangements in place and significant inspection resources committed in that area.  Any new arrangement should also be proportionate and, in this context, it is interesting to note that according to the Commission statistics the relevance of posting in the Irish employment context is very low.  Workers posted from Ireland as a percentage of employment in private sectors in other member states was an average of 0.1%, and workers posted to Ireland as a percentage of employment in the private sector averaged 0.5% between 2007 and 2009, which would include some of the boom years.The provisions of the draft directive which provide for greater access to information across member states are welcome.  The objective in Article 5 is to improve access to information about working and employment conditions in other member states where a business is considering providing services.  Many small and medium-sized businesses, which are a cornerstone of job creation in Ireland and in most member states, are hampered by the lack of clearly and readily accessible information of this nature and this proposal can bring greater transparency in the area of information provision.  There is also a welcome emphasis on providing information electronically, whether it be through an opening up of business registers or the use of the Internal Market information system, to exchange information between sending and host member states on companies engaged in the temporary posting of workers.The principles governing administrative co-operation between member states to facilitate the implementation of the directive are also welcome, even as some of the finer detail concerning response times to requests for assistance remains to be agreed.  The key to making such mutual assistance workable is to find realistic response times that do not create an excessive administrative burden for the member state which is the subject of the request.Article 12 proposes introducing a provision whereby, for the construction industry, a contractor may be held jointly and severally liable for remuneration at minimum rates of pay owed to a posted worker and taxes and social insurance contributions owed to the state by a sub-contractor.  The purpose of this Article is to provide enhanced protection for posted workers in the event that their employer, the sub-contractor, disappears or fails to pay them what they are owed.  This Article also provides that a main contractor may avoid such liability by undertaking "due diligence" in conformity with a system to be created by the member state.The committee may be aware of the concerns of employers in this regard.  From the Government's perspective, we would have our own concerns.  Joint and several liability is not a feature of existing employment law in Ireland and we have sought the Attorney General's advice as to whether this proposal is feasible in an Irish context.  The Commission recognises that there are differing views among member states and stakeholders on the feasibility or desirability of such an instrument at EU level.  Only eight member states have joint and several liability provisions for parties other than the direct employer with regard to wages, taxes or social security contributions.In Articles 13 and 14 of the draft directive, some general principles are articulated concerning cross-border enforcement of administrative fines and penalties for those companies found by a host member state to be in breach of its employment legislation.  While welcome on the face of it, the challenges should not be underestimated in terms of putting in place a framework for such cross-border enforcement.  The existence in some member states of administrative fines and penalties for non-compliance with the relevant legislation, versus the criminal sanctions applied in jurisdictions, such as Ireland, is one such challenge.  We are engaging in further consultation with the relevant national authorities which will inform our position on this element of the draft directive.Turning to the regulation, this legislative proposal for a Council regulation, the so-called Monti II regulation, has been proposed by the European Commission in order to complement the parallel proposal for a partial revision of the directive and to build upon the significance of the European Court of Justice judgments in the Viking Line and Laval cases.  These cases recognised for the first time that the right to take collective action, including the right to strike, constitutes a fundamental right and an integral part of the general principles of EU law.  The purpose of the draft regulation, accordingly, is to clarify the exercise of freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services alongside fundamental social rights, including the right to take collective action, in accordance with national law and practices and in compliance with EU law.  A feature of an EU regulation is that it has more legal certainty than a directive, which would still leave room for diverging transposition and takes somewhat longer to produce real effects on the ground.  A regulation is often seen as being a more direct and effective way of introducing particular proposals but, as the committee is aware, it requires unanimity among member states.This regulation is intended to confirm that the freedom to provide services does not have primacy over social rights or the other way around.  The proposal explicitly states that it may not be interpreted as affecting the right to strike.  It avoids reversing or re-interpreting the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.  It does not give primacy to economic rights, nor does it give primacy to social rights.  Instead, it sets out to uphold a balance not only between those important rights, but also between the different social models and industrial relations within the Union.  The draft regulation lays down general principles with respect to the exercise of the right to strike within the context of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.  The proposal provides for a new alert mechanism for industrial disputes in situations that affect the proper functioning of the Single Market, but leaves national law governing the right to strike unaffected.Undoubtedly some of the concerns of member states about the proposed regulation stem from the fact that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, clearly stipulates that the provisions of Article 153 of that treaty do not apply to the right to take collective action.  The Commission is seeking a way out of this dilemma by basing the proposed regulation on the so-called "flexibility clause" at Article 352.  This article may be used if a measure by the Union should prove necessary in order to attain one of the objectives set out in the treaties.  The precondition is that the treaties do not provide the necessary powers for this, so it is using a specific clause within the treaty to try to bring forward this regulation.The Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, is generally opposed to the proposed regulation and considers that there is no legal basis for EU legislation on the right to take collective action.  IBEC objects to the Commission's reliance on Article 352 in furtherance of the proposed regulation.  It considers that the legal base chosen for the proposed regulation constitutes a distortion of the purpose for which Article 352 is intended and operates to undermine the specific exclusions outlined in Article 153.  IBEC's view is that Ireland already has well established industrial relations mechanisms which give expression to the right to collective bargaining and action, underpinned by statute.  Any significant change in this, such as is being proposed, especially in the current climate, runs the risk of upsetting the careful balance that has been struck between workers and employers in this jurisdiction.For its part, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions appears to consider that the proposals on the right of unions to take strike action could result in the right to strike being undermined across Europe and could well be in contravention of International Labour Organisation conventions.  Its view appears to be that neither economic freedoms nor competition rules should have priority over fundamental social rights.What is clear from the reactions of the social partners at both the national and European level is that they have significant concerns about the proposed regulation for altogether divergent reasons.  The Department is aware of the sensitivities that surround these issues.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs previously examined some of these issues in its 2009 report, "The Lisbon Treaty and Workers Rights".  The committee may wish to note that a majority of parliaments of member states have not submitted reasoned opinions to the Commission in respect of this proposed Monti II regulation.  This is very likely to be because of the significant doubts that have been expressed, in public commentary and elsewhere, about the prospects of the Monti II regulation being adopted in its current form.However, as the draft regulation is currently framed, the Government's overriding concern would be to ensure that any additional legislative intervention in this area would bring clarity and legal certainty to it.  Legislative intervention in this area would bring clarity and legal certainty.  We are fully involved in the Council's deliberations on the new proposals and we are taking steps to consult directly with social partners to ascertain their views on the overall package of measures.  Given the requirement for unanimity in respect of a regulation, it is likely that Ministers in the Employment Council would only agree on the proposed instrument if they are convinced it will bring real added value in terms of legal certainty to all member states.

There was a reference to the Attorney General giving an opinion on feasibility.  Until now I understood the Attorney General's role was to give legal opinion rather than opinion on feasibility.  IBEC and ICTU have divergent views on these matters.  Is it likely the Government will have to take a view one way or the other at some point?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	65	There are two different instruments at play and they have two potentially different timeframes. Both issues as they move together as a package may land in our lap for the Presidency next year.  The Danes are currently progressing the issue and will table it at the Employment Ministers Council next month.  There will be further discussion but it is unlikely that it will be disposed of during the Danish Presidency.  The Cypriots will then take it on and they are aiming to win agreement on an overall approach rather than the detailed text.  It is likely then that come the Irish Presidency in January, we will have a job to steer it through by crafting the final shape of the package.There is, however, a general pessimism about the Monti II regulation in particular.  It is more likely the posting of workers directive will form part of our Presidency agenda but whether the Monti II regulation has not been disposed of by then, that could happen.  Some people would predict that such is the level of divergence among the social partners and member states, there will not be any consensus around this regulation.  It might be that it falls to one side or features might be integrated in the posting of workers directive and we will then make progress in that way.Feasibility is probably the wrong way to put it.  It is about the idea of joint and several liability and how appropriate, rather than feasible, such a provision would be for the Irish situation and legal context.  It is on that specific legal issue that we are seeking legal advice.  The idea of sharing liability between an employer and subcontractor is not a feature of employment law in this or many other jurisdictions; it is a novel thing.  That, however, is part of the Monti II regulation and depending on the view one takes of the prospects for that regulation, it may not fall to be an issue for us to wrestle with.I stand corrected, it is part of the directive so we will have to cross that bridge and finalise our thinking on it.The social partners are important stakeholders in these discussions.  In all such public policy changes in the employment sphere, they are represented in Brussels through various umbrella bodies.  They would have a key interest and role in the discussions around proposed legislative measures.  We would listen carefully to what they have to say about the implications on the ground but ultimately the call will be made by Government as to how to transpose any directive that may emerge.  That is always the case.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The figure for workers posted from Ireland is 0.1% and posted to Ireland is 0.5%.  There appear to be insignificant numbers coming into Ireland and going out of the country.  How many people are we talking about in those percentages?This will have more legal certainty as a regulation than a directive.  It takes longer to produce real effects on the ground.  Is a regulation more practical than a directive?Legislation on agency workers is being updated.  How would this regulation fit with that?  When will this be transposed into law?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The statistics we quoted came from the European Commission's own estimate of the constituency of workers in this category.  I am not sure, however, how accurate that count would be.  It is notoriously difficult to track and accurately count so I am not sure a great deal of reliance can be put on the precise figure but the key message is that it is a significantly small minority of the overall labour force.  The 0.5% translates into about 1,700 in the private sector, and it is only the private sector we are talking about.  I am not sure how that was counted by the Commission but I sound a note of caution about placing too much reliance on that.  It is accepted to be a very small percentage of the overall workforce.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The methodology the Commission used to calculate posted worker inflows and outflows across the Union was to count the number of E1-11s, the health certificates issued in respect of those outflows and inflows.  The Commission admits it is not reliable because one E1-11 does not always equate to one posted worker.  A posted worker who is posted several times over a period of time would get several E1-11 forms.  As Mr. Curran said, with our own Border, there is a degree of porosity that is not formally captured in those statistics.  Taking account of the nature of the Commission statistics, its headline figure is 1 million workers throughout the whole of the EU per annum.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	69	On the question of the directive versus regulation, the regulation has direct effect and is an instrument that does not require to be transposed by member states.  It is therefore regarded as somewhat quicker to yield whatever policy results it seeks to achieve.  The downside of regulation as a mechanism is that it requires unanimity among all members states.  That is the issue that might jeopardise the Monti II regulation to some extent, in that it is so contentious and the degree of consensus required for a regulation has not yet been reached, whereas a directive takes somewhat longer because each member state has a certain amount of time in which to transpose it and a certain amount of freedom in how each state transposes it.  It will come into effect either by way of statutory instrument or by primary legislation, a recent Irish example is the Bill that dealt with the temporary agency worker directive.  A directive allows for nuances and customisation to meet the needs of the member state, but this is not possible with a regulation.  That essentially is the difference.  People would be most optimistic about the success of this package of proposals on posting if we were to use the directive model.Agency workers are covered by a directive that is enshrined in law, the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 that has been signed by the President today, Wednesday, 16 May 2012.  Technically they can be a form of posted worker.  We have domestic agency workers, indigenous agency workers, people who chose to work in health care or in other areas for family or other reasons.  There are agency workers who are posted from abroad.  There is nothing in these proposals that would cut across any of the provisions or protections we have given to temporary agency workers, most recently in the new legislation.  It would not be inconsistent with the rights and entitlements of temporary agency workers.  There are differences with the agency worker arrangement that do not apply in other employment relationships.  The agency worker is in a triangular relationship, as there are three parties, namely, the hirer, the employer, which is the agency, and the worker.  For that reason it is treated as a particular set of employment relationships that must be managed.Nobody is expecting that the dossier will be concluded before Ireland hosts the Presidency.  Naturally it would be the Government's ambition to make progress on it and we could hope to do that in 2013 with a commencement date in 2014.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-16 00:00:00	Prelude	70	That concludes our scrutiny of COM (2012) 130 and COM (2012) 131.  I thank Mr. Dermot Curran, Ms Fiona Flood and Mr. Michael Greene for being most helpful.  I acknowledge they received very short notice as they were asked to come before the committee only last week.  They were very informative and have helped us to arrive at a formal conclusion.Let me outline the three options to deal with COM (2012) 130.  First, we can propose that the policy draft and a brief contribution can be sent to the European Parliament and Commission.  Second, we can send the policy draft and an outline of the concerns that were raised at our meetings last week and today, which can be drafted and considered by the committee at our next meeting and can contain any observations on the proposal.  Third, the committee may recommend a reasoned opinion to both Houses, which can only address the principles of subsidiarity.  As our concerns are of a general nature, I do not think we need to take the third option.  I think we should draft a proposal for the Minister that covers the concerns raised at our meetings, which we can discuss at next week's meeting.
