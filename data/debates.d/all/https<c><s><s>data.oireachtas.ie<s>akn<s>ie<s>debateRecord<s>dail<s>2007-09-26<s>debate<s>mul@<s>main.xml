            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2">People who are homeless are among the most vulnerable in society.  There are a variety of reasons people end up homeless including, poverty, unemployment, poor health, loss of contact with family and friends, alcohol and drug dependence and leaving institutional care.  The variety of causes of homelessness and of services required to address them underlines the need for a co-ordinated, integrated approach to providing for the needs of homeless people on the part of Departments and agencies at national and local level and, the voluntary sector.  I pay special tribute in this context to the excellent work done by so many dedicated people in the voluntary sector in supporting people who are homeless.</p>
            <p eId="para_3">The Government has adopted a strategic approach to tackling poverty since the introduction of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy in 1997.  This is designed to promote the joined up approach to policy development and implementation which is of particular importance for vulnerable groups such as the homeless.  The current National Action Plan for Social Inclusion, NAPinclusion, and the social inclusion commitments in the national development plan follow a similar approach.  They have been drawn up in consultation with the social partners and following a wide ranging consultation process with other stakeholders and set out clear goals, demanding targets and, a detailed programme of action to meet these goals and targets during the period 2007-16.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">The overall goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2% and 4% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.  The NAPinclusion adopts a life cycle approach, in line with Towards 2016, with specific, measurable goals set for each group: children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities and their communities.  Detailed action targets cover a broad spectrum of services including homelessness and housing, health and long term care, education, income support, early childhood development and care and participation.  Homeless people are eligible for the full range of services provided for in these strategies, subject to the normal conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">Special provision is made where necessary by the various services to meet the needs of the homeless.  One of the most important supports provided to homeless people through the social welfare system is assistance with rent deposits to enable them to secure private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">In excess of 8,800 rent deposits were paid out under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in 2006 at a cost of some €4.7 million.  Responsibility for addressing homelessness rests with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and, in the case of youth homelessness, the Department of Health and Children.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has a substantial programme under way to assist people who are homeless to move to accommodation suitable to their needs.  I am aware of, and fully support, the approach being adopted by officials of that Department under the aegis of the cross departmental team on homelessness in developing a revised Government strategy on addressing adult homelessness.  It is envisaged that the revised strategy will have as its core objective the elimination by end 2010 of long-term occupancy of emergency accommodation and the need to sleep "rough".  This initiative builds upon the commitment made in Towards 2016 that no homeless person will occupy emergency accommodation for a period exceeding six months by end 2010.  I understand it is intended to launch the new strategy before the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">Reducing and eventually eliminating homelessness is one of the key outcomes sought from the strategies to tackle poverty and social exclusion.  Much has already been achieved but, I am fully aware that much more needs to be done.  I am confident that through the NAPinclusion and the other relevant strategies we can achieve the necessary co-ordination and integration within the Government sector and with the voluntary sector that is required to provide the necessary support and care for this most vulnerable group.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_9">Does the Minister appreciate the difference between eligibility and accessibility?  Currently, there are 5,000 to 6,000 homeless people on the streets of Ireland.  While some of them may be eligible for the service, clearly, they are not accessing it.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">Does the Minister agree that the rent supplement is inadequate particularly in certain areas?  It has been pointed out that it is impossible to obtain rental property in Dublin 1, Dublin 2 and Dublin 13 based on the current rental supplement.  In view of his answer, and given there are 1,400 children homeless, how does the Minister intend to address the issue of homelessness?  I am sure everybody in this House would offer their sympathy to the family of Kevin Fitzpatrick who was found in appalling circumstances a fortnight ago.  In response to that incident, homeless people have said they know of many people who sleep in wheelie bins in cities around the country.  If what happened to Kevin Fitzpatrick happened to an Irish person in London we would be up in arms.  What steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure there are no further such people found on the streets of Ireland with no access, as opposed to eligibility, to services?</p>

            <p eId="para_11">There is a huge range of services available which all people in society but specifically homeless people can access.  The issue of homelessness is complex.  There are various reasons why people end up homeless in different parts of the country.  There are issues in Dublin currently, to which the Deputy referred, that affect not only homeless people but also people returning to college.  There is again a lack of rental accommodation which it is hoped to address.  The rent supplement scheme, which has been extended dramatically over a number of years, has had a major impact and has facilitated and benefited people throughout the country, particularly in terms of allowing homeless people to get into private accommodation.  The resources put into this area are substantial.  The strategy set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion was drawn up by all the stakeholders working with the Department and has been bought into by all of the participants.  At its core are the many supports to help people get back into education, into society and into employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has taken up many of the relevant issues with the local authorities in an effort to prevent long-term homelessness and get people permanently into housing throughout the country.  In terms of the resources that have been put in across the spectrum on behalf of the taxpayer, the general social welfare budget has been increased from just over €3.5 billion some years ago to more than €15.3 billion today.  Working with the relevant agencies we intend to reduce homelessness and meet the targets that are clearly set out.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">We are talking about the most vulnerable people in our society.  They would not be homeless if they had been able to avail of services.  What steps does the Minister intend to take to ensure that those 6,000 or so people are able to access the services the Department provides so they will not find themselves homeless?  Is the Minister aware of the growing tension between nationalities that has been reported among the homeless population?  Has the Department examined that issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_14">I do not agree that people are unable to access services.  A large number of voluntary groups, principally the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, work in this area.  We work with those groups.  Unfortunately, it can be difficult to persuade individuals to work with the services.  It is part of our role to ensure that people can get into a secure environment where we can work with them and examine the range of services available to ensure they have capacity within themselves whether in terms of better health care, more education, or facilitation in getting back into the work force in order to try to earn an income, which would give them the sense of independence and well-being they need.  I do not accept there is a difficulty there.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_20">Deputy Shortall shadowed me when I was the Minister for Transport and now she is the Opposition spokesperson on Social and Family Affairs.  I congratulate her and wish her well.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">The report to which the Deputy refers was produced by the Social Welfare Appeals Office, SWAO, of my Department in accordance with legislative requirements.  It contains details of the activities of the office in 2006 as well as commentary on other issues which arose during the year.  As previously stated by me on 29 June 2007, I welcome the continued commitment of the SWAO to provide an accessible and independent review mechanism for people who wish to appeal against decisions made by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">My Department makes every effort to deliver entitlements to people in accordance with the legislation.  However, considering that in 2006 my Department made over 1 million payments per week that benefit more than 1.5 million people, and received 1.75 million claims for statutory social welfare schemes, it is understandable that there will be some people who will not agree with decisions made on their entitlements.  The 13,800 appeals received, when viewed in the context of the number of claims received is less than 1%, which is small.  Of the 14,006 appeals processed in 2006, favourable decisions were made in 6,439 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">The report highlights that 46% of appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant.  It refers to the fact that of the 6,439 favourable decisions on appeal cases, almost half of these decisions, 3,199, were in fact revised decisions made by statutorily appointed deciding officers of my Department, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his or her claim.  In such cases an appeals officer decision was not necessary.  In addition, it should be noted that of the 9,100 appeals actually decided by appeals officers, a total of 5,860,64%, upheld the original decision of the deciding officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">Customers whose claims are disallowed or who are disqualified from payment or awarded social welfare at a reduced rate are informed that if they have any new fact or evidence that has a bearing on their case, they should send it in the first instance to the deciding officer for re-examination and, if appropriate, for revision of the decision.  They are informed that this right is in addition to their right of appeal to the SWAO.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">They can seek a deciding officer review before making an appeal or can do both concurrently.  The right of appeal to the SWAO remains an option if the review by the deciding officer is not fruitful.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">The success of the deciding officer review process has been highlighted in a number of annual reports of the SWAO.  In the annual report 2002, for example, the contribution which the deciding officer review process made in reducing the overall number of appeals that were received in the SWAO was noted.  The 2005 annual report also highlighted the success of this strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">The role of the statutorily appointed deciding officer is to decide entitlement to statutory social welfare schemes and insurability of employment in accordance with the legislation.  To assist deciding officers in their role, guidelines relating to all aspects of decision-making and social welfare legislation are issued and regularly updated by my Department.  In addition, training is provided to deciding officers on their statutory obligations and the application of principles of natural justice and fair procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">The need for transparency in the decision-making process by deciding officers is also provided for in legislation. Regulations provide that decisions on social welfare claims must be set out in writing and, where the decision is unfavourable, the reasons for the decision must also be recorded and included in the notification to the person concerned.  Therefore, when a deciding officer has reached a decision, which is unfavourable to the claimant, she or he must give the grounds for the decision, that is, the statutory condition which is not fulfilled; and the reason the grounds are not met.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">The rules of natural justice and fair procedures are applied by deciding officers when making decisions that could have an adverse affect on the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">Given the legislative provisions and administrative guidelines and practices in place, I am satisfied with the procedures in place for deciding social welfare claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">The annual report of the appeals officer which was published  last June stated that a majority of the appeals heard were upheld.  He referred to the serious problems arising from inadequate information being provided to clients on their entitlements.  He drew attention to serious delays in the response from deciding officer to queries from his office.  These are quite serious indictments.  The appeals officer made a number of recommendations in his annual report. Does the Minister accept that his findings indicate that something is wrong down the line in the Department and in the decision process of deciding officers?  Will he outline what action has been taken on foot of the appeals officer's report?</p>

            <p eId="para_34">When the number of appeals is put in context of the 1 million payments per week, I think the system is working extremely well.  We can always learn from the issues that arise.  There is constant contact between the officials from my Department and the Social Welfare Appeals Office to see how to improve and get consistency in the decision making process throughout the country.  While there were more than 6,000 successful appeals, some 3,000 were made by the Department's deciding officers.  In many of the cases, new information came to the fore, which allowed the deciding officer to make a different decision.   Some years ago it was decided that an independent body was needed to deal specifically with appeals.  We are encouraging our offices to make people aware of all information and to assist them in making their case in the first instance.  We must remember that the Department deals with more than 1 million people per week throughout the country.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office did not intend the report as an indictment of the Department.  It simply highlights issues which need to be changed.  Since the report was made, the officials in my Department and in the appeals office have enhanced procedures and training for staff throughout the country to try to achieve the consistency we would all like.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">Does the Minister accept that there is a specific problem in respect of medical evidence?  Most Members regularly come across the problem at constituency clinics of people with substantial medical difficulties who submit medical evidence but are refused the payment for which they are applying.  The figures from the appeals office bear this out.  Only 25% of appeals relating to disability allowance and only 15% of appeals relating to illness benefit were disallowed.  The invalidity pension and injuries benefit figures are similarly poor.  The issue of how medical evidence is viewed by officials of the Minister's Department and medical officers is a real one.  I ask the Minister to examine this situation again, given the poor performance figures I have highlighted.  This is a matter of concern to many people who have serious injuries or other medical problems.  They are often subjected to excessive hardship by being asked for additional evidence from their medical practitioners and obliged to go through the appeals process.  Hardship is imposed on people who already have medical problems.  I ask the Minister to examine this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">This issue is encountered by all Members when we deal with people who have serious medical problems and are going through an appeals process.  While the vast majority of appeals are dealt with satisfactorily, there are always some which are more complex.  As a non-medical person, I find it difficult when one medical opinion gives one outcome and a second opinion gives a different outcome.<b/>

            <p eId="para_40">The case in question relates to a customer who had requested a pension forecast from my Department on two separate occasions in 1989 and 1995.  On both occasions the forecasts provided made reference to 260 contributions, which led the customer to believe he had sufficient contributions to qualify for a pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">In October 2003, the customer applied to my Department for a retirement pension.  Qualification for retirement pension is based on a number of conditions but primarily the customer must have 260 paid full rate contributions and a minimum yearly average of 24 paid or credited contributions.  The rate of payment is determined by the yearly average.  His application for a retirement pension was refused on the grounds that he had less than 260 full rate contributions paid since entry into insurance.  The customer, a retired public servant, had a combination of insurance classes but less than the 260 paid full rate contributions.  A decision outlining the position issued to the customer in February 2004.  On receipt of the notification of disallowance for retirement pension the customer appealed my Department's decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  His appeal failed because the decision was correct, based on his paid insurance record.  However, in this case the customer claimed he had a legitimate expectation to a pension based on the information provided for him twice by my Department.  He was of the view that if accurate information had been supplied to him when requested and the implications pointed out to him, he would have had ample time to secure the additional contributions required to qualify for a pension.  He subsequently took his complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman which made representations on his behalf.  It was of the opinion that the customer had a legitimate expectation of entitlement to a pension on foot of the information supplied to him by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">The background and circumstances of the case were fully reviewed and in the interests of fairness, in 2006 my Department sought and received sanction from the Department of Finance to pay a pension under existing legislative provisions, as though the customer had 260 paid contributions.  The customer was subsequently paid his pension in September 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">Was the pension paid on the basis that the Minister's staff had created a legitimate expectation?  Was that the basis on which the senior official decided to pay the sum of €32,000 plus a lifelong pension to the individual in question?  What review has the Minister carried out to ensure there are no other individuals with a legitimate expectation created by officials in the Department because of inaccurate information?  Will he confirm that the Social Welfare Appeals Office established that the Department had provided inaccurate information when it reviewed the case?  Did it inform the Department of this at the time?  Was the appeals office unaware of this?  Would it not have been more appropriate for that office to establish the claimant's entitlement at the time rather than obliging the claimant to revert to the Ombudsman?</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_44">The Social Welfare Appeals Office upheld the decision of the Department.  Officials provided the information in good faith in 1989 and 1995, confirming that 260 contributions were required.  However, it was not made clear that these should be at the full rate, which they were not, and therefore did not qualify as payments towards a full pension.  That should have been made clear when the information was provided.  The procedures have now been changed and such cases are isolated, this being the only such case that has arisen.  It was agreed to pay a pension in the interests of fairness because the individual concerned thought he had qualified for a pension on the basis of the information given.  When we receive a request for information, customers are now provided with a copy of their insurance record to facilitate pension entitlements.  The danger is that people want forecasts, which is a separate issue.  We provide the full insurance record and the method used to calculate it.  This eliminates the possibility of a recurrence of what happened in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">We must consider the context.  Given the scale of involvement and the customer base with which the Department deals — over 1 million people per week, benefiting 1.5 million individuals — the number of errors is small.  Nevertheless, I would like to reduce it further.  Most would say the quality of the information provided by the Department over the past years and long before I came to it was of the best available to customers.  However, nothing is perfect in society and the Department will continue to strive to improve on its parameters and guidelines so the information provided to customers is easily understood so as to allow people make judgments based on the correct information and facts.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_48">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent companies nationwide with over 230 money advice staff operating the service.  Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the credit unions work closely with the programme.  Last year, MABS provided services to almost 12,500 new clients throughout the country.  To date in 2007, some 8,300 new clients have approached the service.  The number of active cases at the end of August was 18,400.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">In 2006, €16.4 million was provided to fund the service and in 2007 the annual allocation was increased to €17.67 million to assist MABS in dealing with its workload.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex.  The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people encounter in managing their finances.  I am particularly concerned about the high level of interest rates currently being charged by some financial institutions, loan companies and by legal moneylenders in situations where people have no alternative sources of credit available to them.  My concerns in this regard are borne out by the recent Financial Regulator's report on the licensed moneylending industry in Ireland which shows that moneylenders may be charging interest rates of up to 188%.  Most significantly, 71% of people surveyed in the report did not know what interest they were paying on their loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The regulation of moneylending comes under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and the licensing of moneylenders is a statutory responsibility of the Financial Regulator.  MABS has a unique and expert contribution to make, on behalf of people on low incomes, in shaping the strategies that need to be put in place to ensure greater financial inclusion.  For example, MABS has a role in promoting to the providers of payment services, such as the banks and credit unions, the needs of people on low incomes, so it is easier for them to access financial services.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">In line with the programme for Government I am developing proposals for a new structure for MABS geared to meet the needs of people with debt difficulties in today's society.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_22">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_53">There is no doubt that MABS provides a very worthwhile service throughout the community.  I was disappointed to note that the legislation to put this on a statutory footing will not be ready until next year.  It has been promised for some time and it is regrettable there is yet a further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">My question is not about MABS but rather that moneylenders can legitimately charge exorbitant interest rates of up to 188% which represents about ten times the level of interest charged on credit cards.  People and families on low incomes who are in a difficult financial situation and who need to obtain short-term loans quickly are forced into the hands of moneylenders.  I am referring to legal moneylenders as I have not even begun to discuss the issue of illegal moneylenders.  Legal moneylenders can legitimately charge up to 188% interest which is scandalous.  This problem has been identified by a number of agencies working in this area.  It has been discussed at length by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who last year and earlier this year gave a series of interviews in which he promised to take action in this area and to work with the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance to curb the level of interest that can legally be charged.  Yet, there has been no action — it is all promises and no action.  In light of the comments made by the Minister in the media in the past week, I ask him to state what action he intends to take to limit finally the level of interest that can be charged to these vulnerable families who have no choice but to go to moneylenders in order to gain access to short-term credit.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_23" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_55">I would like to achieve a scenario in which people have no need to go to moneylenders in the first instance and can instead access legitimately the main stream of financial services to which most of us have access.  The difficulty is that people on very low incomes get themselves into debt and find it very difficult to access credit from the normal institutions with which most of us deal on a daily basis.  They end up in what are regarded as legal institutions elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">The Deputy has rightly identified the Financial Regulator who is entirely independent in this matter and has a direct responsibility along with the Minister for Finance.  The levels of interest being charged in these circumstances are quite exorbitant.  Since I made certain comments, it has been pointed out to me that while it may be quite easy in some respects to reduce the level of interest charged, I may still not achieve the end at which both Deputy Shortall and I aim.  Deputy Shortall has outlined that end in the House this afternoon.  I am informed that the rates of interest in question are usually charged on very small amounts of money which are repaid over short periods.  If the outcome is to cap interest rates, people may be charged at a lower rate but over a much longer period and no significant difference will be made.  It is important to note also that there are more issues than this one involved in the wider context of financial markets, including the legitimate moneylending market, which have consequences elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">While I am having discussions in this area, I am not sure as I speak today where the answer is.  One may turn a corner and think one sees the answer there, but it may be pointed out very quickly that adopting that course may achieve the opposite of what one intends.  Discussions are taking place in the tripartite group on the issue and the database MABS now has will be very important in informing the decision which is finally made.  The Deputy and I both want to ensure that vulnerable people on low incomes can access credit which does not impose the exorbitant interest rates charged by some of the legitimate moneylending institutions.  The credit unions, for instance, are working very actively with people on low incomes.</p>

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_30" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_65">The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as has been stated in this House on many occasions, a matter for each local authority.  Local authorities operate under the auspices of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Since taking office as Minister for Social and Family Affairs I have not been in contact with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding a waiver system for refuse charges.  My officials have discussed this issue with their counterparts in that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">It has been suggested that my Department could respond to the issue of waste charges through the exceptional needs payments of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Under this scheme a single payment may be made to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his or her weekly income.  The payments are for such items as bedding or cooking utensils for someone setting up a home for the first time or costs relating to funerals, or visiting relatives in hospital or in prison.  This scheme is not intended to meet the cost of regular household bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">In any event, the introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would not be feasible given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State.  Charges vary across local authorities and within local authorities where there is more than one provider.  In addition, some local authorities and private operators already operate waiver schemes but, again, the qualifying conditions for these schemes also vary.  Any system put in place to assist people with waste collection charges would have to take account of the different local arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">In its 2005 report, Implementing a Waiver System: Guidelines for Local Authorities, the Combat Poverty Agency investigated the practice of charging for waste collection services, examined the rationale behind the practice, established the implications for low income households and considered potential solutions to ease the financial burden on them.  A set of guidelines was developed for local authorities to consider when implementing a waste charging system.  The report considered that the most effective way of achieving a fair and consistent system of waste charging in Ireland would be via the national implementation of one model that satisfies all of these guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">The report concluded that if a suitable procurement approach could be developed, a locally operated waiver system would offer the most effective delivery model and I am in agreement with that finding, given that all options were considered.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_31">
            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_70">I am not sure if that is a "Yes" or "No" to the possibility of a waiver system.  Half of the local authorities are in a position to offer a waiver because the refuse collection service is not privatised in their areas.  In the 17 local authorities where the service is privatised, the local authorities cannot offer a waiver as they do not receive the charges, which is why I have asked the Minister and his Department to implement a waiver scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">The exceptional needs payment is not the way to do it because that payment might be made monthly, weekly or annually.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the possibility of the Department providing such a scheme.  It need not be dissimilar to the fuel allowance given that the cost of fuel, depending on the type being used, can vary between different areas and this does not alter the fact that it is a standardised payment.  The Minister could have discussions with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the issue but he should consider letting his Department take it on board.  It is difficult for some people to pay the charge.  The average charge is €360 per annum or approximately €32 per month.  Many elderly people and social welfare recipients are simply unable to pay it.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_32" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_72">I do not disagree with the Deputy's last point.  Everybody is aware that this issue can be difficult for some people.  I have some experience with the matter because I dealt with it when I was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This is a matter for the local authorities.  Some local authorities operate good waiver schemes, and not simply where the authorities operate a public refuse collection service.  In some areas private contractors are involved in a waiver scheme.  It is not an excuse for local authorities to suggest that because they have privatised the service they cannot operate a waiver scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">The local authorities have all the necessary powers to operate waiver schemes in their areas.  It is a matter on which local councillors in the local authorities should make the decision.  They can do it by involving themselves in the estimates process.  It is wrong that there should be differences throughout the country, whereby good waiver schemes are operated in some areas, urban and rural, while there are none in other areas.  This is an issue on which local councillors should step up to the plate.  We are regularly accused of taking power away from local authorities and giving it to central government.  Councillors, particularly when estimates are being drafted, should put this issue to bed once and for all by demanding, through motions and submissions, the introduction of waiver schemes in their areas.  That is local autonomy.  This is a local issue that is better looked after at local government level.</p>

          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_33">
            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_74">Does the Minister intend to raise this issue with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that local authorities are in a position to carry this out and are given the funding to do so?  The people most affected are those in receipt of social welfare payments who fall under the remit of the Minister's Department.  They cannot make ends meet because of these charges.  The Minister cannot wash his hands of the issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_75">The Deputy asked where the authority lay and I gave a straight answer.  When the Deputy reads the full reply, she will see that the matter of how this issue could be managed best was considered in some detail during recent discussions between this Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and it was clear it was managed best at local authority level.  It is not simply a matter of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government providing extra money for local authorities.  We all have priorities and if one had all the money in the world, one could probably spend it.  Like each Department, each local authority must decide what way the resources available will be used.  I agree with those local authorities which have decided a waiver scheme is warranted and to implement one as a priority.  It is an issue and other local authorities should step up to the plate and take a more serious view of the needs of their constituents.  If this were done, it may lead to other issues in which we might be able to become involved.</p>

        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the position regarding the backlog of pension claims identified earlier in 2007; the reason for this backlog; the average waiting time for a claim to be processed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [20775/07]
      </p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_35" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_77">My Department is committed to providing a quality service for all of its customers.  Claims and applications are processed and decisions on entitlement issued as quickly as possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply and the available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">The State pension transition, SPT, and State pension contributory, SPC, schemes, which are insurance based schemes, require those eligible to reach a certain standard in terms of the social insurance contributions paid or credited on their record.  The customer base is 239,000 with an annual intake of 36,000 claims.  These customers predominantly reside within the State but approximately 14% are paid abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">Some difficulties occurred during the months prior to May this year with regard to the processing of State pension transition and State pension contributory claims.  In April there was a backlog of approximately 9,200 new claims for SPT and SPC at various stages of processing.  These were divided into 5,600 domestic and 3,600 foreign claims.  By the end of August the domestic claims backlog was fully cleared and action was taken on all foreign claims.  In all cases where delays occur customers do not lose payment as the determining date for pension payment used is the original date of receipt of the claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">Social welfare entitlements requiring examination under EU or bilateral agreements take a longer time to process than domestic claims due to the need to obtain additional information from the customer which can often prove to be difficult and to exchange information with the other countries involved.  Approximately 3,000 foreign claims await information from customers or foreign institutions.  Reviews of the implementation of EU and bilateral arrangements, including the timely processing of requests for information, are carried out from time to time by officials of the Department and social insurance institutions in the other countries involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">Delays in processing new claims occurred for a number of reasons, namely, an increase in the numbers of new claims received, the implementation in September 2006 of a number of scheme enhancements introduced in budget 2006, an unusually high level of staff turnover in the office in Sligo and delays which arose following the migration of the pensions system to a new computer system.  As I stated, these have all been dealt with and all we await is information from other countries on foreign claims.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_82">One of the reasons given in May for the delay in processing was a series of technical glitches in the Department's IT system.  Will the Minister confirm that this issue has been resolved?  He mentioned the turnover of staff in Sligo, part of the reason for which was decentralisation.  Will he guarantee that steps will be taken to ensure the Department's customers will not be affected by the decentralisation process?</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_83">The Deputy's first question is one I also asked.  All of the issues have been resolved.  There were some technical issues but they have been resolved.  I have provided the information to the Deputy.  About 40% of the staff turnover was related to decentralisation where staff transferred to another area.  I certainly do not want any issues relating to decentralisation, which is substantial within my Department, to have any effect on customers in terms of the delivery of the services they require.  We will try to ensure — and the staff is committed to this — that such upheaval will not cause the type of delays to which the Deputy referred.  I am glad this issue was resolved very quickly.  All the outstanding claims are foreign based and relate to information from the individuals or the institutions in the other countries.  Until we get that information we cannot finalise the payment.  However, it will be backdated so that there is no loss of money to the individual.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_87">The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of child care; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a social assistance payment for low income families with young children.  The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment — something with which we would all agree.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">One of the proposals in the report was that the upper income limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week.  This proposal was completed in budget 2007 which in effect meant that the upper income limit increased by more than one third in two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">In addition, the report recommended increasing the qualified child increase for recipients of the one-parent family payment.  In budget 2007 the three rates of qualified child increase, which had been maintained at the same levels for several years, were combined into a single rate of €22 per week in respect of more than 340,000 children of welfare families.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">The new social assistance payment, under development in my Department, will have the long term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — the avenue that is widely agreed to offer the best route out of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place on the ground by other Departments and agencies.  This is why the Government has instructed the senior officials group on social inclusion to create an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce any new payment.  Discussions are ongoing with the relevant Departments and agencies on issues including child care, education, training, and activation measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">As part of this process, my Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, is to test the non-income, activation proposals in Coolock, Dublin and in Kilkenny.  These tests, due to commence in October, will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced.  This will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the policy and operational details of the new scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">I am concerned that 18 months have elapsed since the discussion paper was published and it is still not clear how the Minister intends to proceed with those proposals.  I appreciate the Minister referred to the fact that the income limits are being raised but that is only one aspect.  He also said the implementation group would look at the non-income elements.  I wish to ask about the income elements.  Those elements provide the poverty traps in which many lone parents find themselves in accessing employment and in respect of rent supplement if they enter employment and, most critically, cohabiting arrangements within the family.  I am not clear how the Minister intends to proceed on those matters.  Does he accept the recommendations and proposals made in the discussion document?  Has he established an implementation group on those elements?  Given that the document was published 18 months ago, I would have thought he would have been in a position to bring proposals on those critical elements to Cabinet in time for this year's budget.  Is it his intention to do so?  In particular, how does he intend to proceed on those income-related elements?</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_94">We have moved on some of the income areas which have made a considerable difference.  We all agree that the measure that led to the greatest level of stability and the greatest number of options for many families was the removal of the cohabitation issue, whereby the partner was not supposed to be living in the property.  This issue led to considerable instability, particularly for young children where the presence of both parents working together was required to assist each other.  The change in the rule is substantive.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">The Deputy raised issues on implementation, as I have done.  Clearly, the Office of the Minister for Children is involved, as is the Department of Education and Science.  There is a specific group in place.  I have now stated we will have a pilot scheme in Coolock in Dublin starting in the next month or two, as well as in Kilkenny in two centres.  They want to do this to ensure the appropriate structures will be in place.  There would be no point in rolling out a national scheme if we were unsure whether it would work and achieve the desired outcomes.  The outcome we want is to facilitate lone parents in returning to the workforce in a meaningful way that will allow them to earn as much as they can and also to facilitate them in getting their children into a happy schooling environment or some lone parents to return to the education system.  It is a complex structure involving many of the different bodies involved.  I can only move as quickly as the experts can.  I do not claim to be an expert in this area.  The senior group is working through the matter.  Within the next month activation proposals will be tried in Coolock in Dublin and Kilkenny.</p>

In the past we introduced new ideas which of themselves seemed beneficial only to find that when commenced they reduced benefits a person may have had or disimproved access to other services he or she may have had with the result that the overall position was not improved.  The intention is to ensure we can give a broader role and better equip lone parents and their children to participate in society by creating an opportunity to work, to be educated and to live as normal a life as the rest of us.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_46" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_106">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 117, 119, 133, 134, 172 and 569 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs publication, Report on the Position of Full-Time Carers, which was published in 2003, makes 15 recommendations.  Some of these relate specifically to my Department and others relate to the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">A key recommendation of the report was that where a person is in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension and is providing someone with full-time care and attention, he or she should be paid a half rate carer's allowance in addition to his or her pension.  Budget 2007 introduced fundamental structural reforms in this area which go beyond this recommendation.  From tomorrow, people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments, who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person, will retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be the equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance.  It is estimated this measure will benefit more than 17,000 carers by up to €100 per week at a cost of €56.72 million in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">These new arrangements will apply to people receiving weekly social welfare payments, other than recipients of jobseeker's allowance or benefit or those signing for jobseeker's credits and people in receipt of a qualified adult allowance.  This is in line with the arrangements that apply to receipt of the respite care grant.  The recommended extension of the respite care grant to people in receipt of a social welfare payment, other than carer's allowance or benefit, who are providing full-time care and attention, was implemented in budget 2005.  That improvement went beyond the report's recommendation in that the grant was extended to all full-time carers, regardless of means.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is that the person be providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  The number of hours a person may engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still be considered to be providing full-time care and attention for the purposes of the schemes was increased from ten to 15 hours per week in June 2006.  In budget 2006, the duration of carer's benefit was extended from 15 to 24 months.  This is in line with the joint committee's recommendation that the 15-month restriction be waived where the person continues to provide care.  Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in the greatest need.  The means test has been significantly eased over the years most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of €640 per week. This ensures a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.  In addition, the rates of carer's allowance have been increased to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">The report also recommended the development of a national strategy for carers.  One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, is the development of a national carer's strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the programme for Government.  The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community.  While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason all relevant Departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.  My Department, along with a number of others, is examining how this issue can best be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">The recent improvements in the income supports available from my Department, together with improvements in home care and related services provided by the Minister for Health and Children, represent major improvements in the services and supports available to carers in the community.  I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_113">I welcome the positive changes made to the carer's allowance but, in view of the significant benefit to the Exchequer of easements in the means test for the allowance, will the Minister consider broadening eligibility for carers in the current year?  The reward to the Exchequer is huge because those being cared for would require institutional care if they were not being looked after at home by carers.  Will the Minister clarify the case for carers who have given much of their life to the work of caring for relatives but who have not given up PAYE employment?  Does the Minister foresee a time when he can retrospectively award credits so that such people will in their own right be able to claim a pension in the future?</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_48" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_114">I am glad the Deputy agrees.  We have come a long way in a relatively short period, and rightly so.  There is no doubt those who provide care deliver a great service.  If the State had to provide this, the cost would probably far exceed the current cost.  Nevertheless we have grown the budget in this area very substantially.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">Nobody has unlimited resources, so we must continue to ensure we target the benefits, be they financial or otherwise.  This is particularly relevant where we offer financial benefits to those who could do with them most.  We should have some structures around those who benefit.  Some families, who can well afford much more than others, should not necessarily get all of this free.  The targeted method we are using, the apparent benefits and the lifting of the limit to €36,000 of income, amounts to a very generous package.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">My intention as I go forward with this Government is to do more within this broad area.  We will act on whatever issues we can bring to bear at budget time or otherwise.  It is an area in which I have a particular and obvious interest.  I wish to build on the excellent work done to date.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_117">Given the saving to the State by the work carers provide, is the Government considering an individual assessment for carers recognising that they are providing the care, rather than a partner for example?  Under the social partnership agreement it was agreed that income limits for carer's allowance would be expanded.  Does the Minister intend that this will be seen in the 2008 budget?</p>
            <p eId="para_118">The Minister will be aware that there are approximately 3,000 children aged 15 to 17 years old engaged as full-time carers.  They may not appreciate me calling them children.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">Some of them work for up to 43 hours per week caring for people within the home.  Does the Minister feel a separate strategy should be provided for them?  These people are a unique section within the caring community and they are missing out on education and much of their youth in such a position.  They are certainly fulfilling a task the State should probably do.  I realise a study will be carried out under the partnership agreements but perhaps a strategy should emerge from that study.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_52" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_121">I would like to have full information on this, although I know the area being spoken about by the Deputy and some of my own colleagues have pointed out these facts to me.  We must look at how we can achieve results on the issue.  At this stage I cannot pre-empt what the Minister for Finance might decide to do with the budget.  We will have our own discussions — as do all Departments — in regard to all of these areas in advance of the budget.  We will ensure that we progress and build on the very clear and enormous benefits the Department of Social and Family Affairs delivers across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">It is quite extraordinary that the amounts in question have come from approximately €3.7 billion to more than €15.3 billion today, when unemployment has plummeted to where we almost have full employment.  This demonstrates that we have correctly shifted our emphasis to the services area, particularly services and resources people must have to fully participate in society.  We want to build on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">In the past two years there was much catching up from a social welfare perspective.  Many big jumps were required to bring us to some reasonable norms acceptable to people throughout the country.  We must incrementally protect those and build on them as we go forward <i>vis-à-vis</i> inflation or other issues so that the good base and incomes available to people are protected from budget to budget and from year to year.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_53">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_124">The introduction of the half-rate carer's allowance has been a very welcome development but it has thrown up several anomalies.  I would like clarification on these from the Minister as I have been unable to get it from his Department.  I refer, for example, to whether a person who is in receipt of a qualified adult allowance will be entitled to half rate carer's allowance.  Will a person who is in receipt of carer's allowance and who has an underlying entitlement to a State pension be in a position to avail of the two-payment arrangement that has been introduced?</p>
            <p eId="para_125">I wish to refer also to applicants for carer's allowance who do not meet the criteria relating to full-time care and attention.  I understand that 15% of people who applied for carer's allowance last year were refused on the basis they did not provide full-time care and attention.  Does the Minister accept there may be a number of circumstances in which a carer might be providing critical care and attention to somebody, perhaps not on a full-time basis, which enables the individual to whom it is being provided to stay in his or her home and remain outside State nursing home care?  Is there a need to relax the existing requirement or to introduce a part payment to people who may be providing two to four hours care per day, which is critical in nature and which, as already stated, enables the person to whom it is being provided to remain in his or her home?  In my opinion there is a need to relax the criteria relating to full-time care and attention and I ask the Minister to consider taking action in that regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_54" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_126">I welcome the support offered by the Deputy and Members on all sides for the new half rate carer's allowance that comes into effect from tomorrow.  This payment will be enormously beneficial to many people.  There is no doubt that when a change of this magnitude is introduced, anomalies will arise in the system.  The latter is particularly true in the case of a Department such as mine, which has a huge customer base.  The Deputy highlighted specific areas in respect of which issues arise.  I want to achieve two things, namely, to ensure resources are used to the best effect and to see to it that such resources are targeted at areas in respect of which they will provide the best outcomes and prove most beneficial.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">It is not possible to resolve all the issues in one year or through one budget.  The achievements realised in the area of carers in recent years have been phenomenal.  We want to protect these achievements and build on them.  There are issues relating to this area and the Deputy pointed out that as regards the cost to the State, the return obtained in respect of the investment made is extremely significant.  We want to protect this position and if we can enhance the system by allowing people to provide specific care while also taking account of other aspects of their lives, we will try to do so.</p>

          <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_55">
            <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
            <p eId="para_128">My question also relates to the introduction of the half rate carer's allowance.  This change was announced in the budget but is only being brought in this week.  The Minister stated that we have come a long way in a short period.  I have raised the anomaly of people on other social welfare payments who do not qualify for carer's allowance in respect of each of the past eight budgets.  I possess records which support my claim in this regard.  A half rate carer's allowance will finally be provided to some categories of people in receipt of certain other social welfare payments later this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">Is it the Minister's view that people in receipt of, for example, widow's pension are not full-time carers and are not as good at what they do as other carers?  While I welcome the introduction of the half rate carer's allowance, I am disappointed that people who provide full-time care for doubly incontinent, bed-ridden patients in their own homes will only qualify for this rate.  Will the Minister consider eliminating this anomaly in order that those to whom I refer might qualify for the full carer's allowance?  Under the means test, the income requirement relating to a couple is €36,000.  However, a person in receipt of widow's pension is only paid €10,000 per year.  This falls well below the means test requirement relating to other categories.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_56" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_130">I should have answered the question raised by Deputy Shortall about people in receipt of the qualified adult allowance.  My understanding is that the arrangements do apply and include people on the qualified adult allowance, if I am reading my note correctly.  That is certainly my understanding of it.  It also applies to people on social welfare payments generally.  That goes across the system, although there are some exceptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">Deputy McCormack has again returned to the issue.  Of course anomalies arise within the system, particularly when one makes the sort of sweeping changes we have made.  All are in agreement that the benefits the half carer's payment will bring will be very substantial.  If I had unlimited resources, we could simply pay it without any means test or criteria, but we do not live in that world.  I do not necessarily agree that this is the best use of precious resources provided by the taxpayer to spend in different Departments as we go forward every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">I want to build on what has been achieved with regard to carers.  I have consistently stated this since we started the debate this afternoon.  There are anomalies, with which I will try to deal.  This does not necessarily mean that I can deal with all of them, but I would like to target it to the maximum benefit of the widest group which can benefit from any change that we may pursue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_134">Disability allowance was one of the payments which formed part of the expenditure review of illness and disability payment schemes that was carried out by my Department in 2003 and subsequently published in 2004.  The review examined and reported on the trend and level of expenditure and found that disability allowance is well targeted in addressing income maintenance requirements of customers and combating social exclusion.  In addition, the review highlighted a number of areas where further work can be usefully targeted.  The first of these is the reason for the rise in the number of recipients of disability allowance since 1996, when my Department initiated the disability allowance scheme to replace the previously existing disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">The second area to be further examined is access for people in receipt of disability allowance to employment and training.  This is obviously an area of increased importance to the Department, reflected in the focus on people of working age, in the national action plan on social inclusion, Towards 2016 and the Department's disability sectoral plan.  The sectoral plan is of particular importance in that regard because it builds on the Department's key policy objectives and aims to deliver support to people with disabilities that will reduce their risk of dependence.  It is now proposed to further examine these two particular issues.  I am anxious to ensure that this examination is relevant to the needs of persons with disabilities and my Department is at present finalising terms of reference for the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">Central to this work will be the forthcoming publication by the Central Statistics Office of findings from the national survey on disability in Ireland carried out in 2006.  This survey will allow the Department, for the first time, to "match" the incidence of disability in Ireland against the numbers in receipt of disability allowance.  It will give valuable information on the profile of recipients, including previous and current employment history, which will allow for more informed policy options to be taken.  Publication of this survey by the Central Statistics Office is expected before the end of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">Is the review referred to by the Minister the same as that of the disability allowance scheme, which is due at the end of December 2007?  The Minister is obviously aware that an EU study in 2005 found that persons with a chronic illness or disability are twice as likely to be in a position of consistent poverty compared with other members of the population.  In light of this, will the Minister's review include and will he consider the introduction of a cost of disability payment?  I believe this is the only method of addressing the extra expenses which a person with a disability has, compared with another member of the population.  Has the Minister given any consideration to introducing this payment?</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_138">The final point, with which I would agree, is that they may be looking at this in the wrong way to some degree by concentrating on the disability rather than on everybody having ability, irrespective of whether there are some areas where they are unable to work.  We want to identify what the ability spectrum is with regard to many of these people and see whether we can get them into the workforce in a way that facilitates them.  If we do that, we will have taken a large step forward rather than screening people and effectively saying that if one is disabled in a particular way, one cannot work.</p>

Standing Orders reflect this constitutional provision.  However, it must be recognised that the House has set up a tribunal of inquiry to inquire into certain matters.  In respect of those particular functions, there has been a delegation of sorts to the tribunal, for the time being, which must, in turn, report to the House.  To that extent, the accountability provision is fulfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">However, we must be realistic.  I understand that in the political domain there may be a wish by the party leaders to question the Taoiseach on the Mahon tribunal.  Therefore, it would be nonsensical of me to refuse that political imperative.  It would be equally remiss of me not to remind the House that certain functions have been delegated to the tribunal of inquiry.  When addressing questions to the Taoiseach on this matter, it should be in everyone's mind that the tribunal has been asked to look into certain specific matters.  It would not be right for any Member, or Members, to seek, during the course of questions, to replicate the functions of the tribunal or to seek to establish the truth or untruth of given allegations of misconduct.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach back to the House after the recess.  I congratulate Deputy Gilmore on his first day as Labour Party leader in the House.  I am not sure what the Ceann Comhairle meant by all of that but common sense and the truth are imperative to what we must do in the House as much as anywhere else.  I will abide by the Chair's ruling.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">What I have to ask is relevant to comments made in the House by the Taoiseach.  I am in order by requiring accountability and accuracy to the House.  What I will say relates to comments that were first made in the House.  I do not have the time that Mr. Des O'Neill, SC, had to question the Taoiseach forensically but I have two questions that are as important as any the Taoiseach has been asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The first relates to the large amounts of cash which the Taoiseach received between 1993 and 1995.  We now have the benefit of statements made in the House, statements made to the media and evidence given on oath to the Mahon tribunal.  We are thus able to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of those statements.  I have two questions for the Taoiseach.  First, is it his intention to make a personal statement to the House and correct misleading statements that he has made to the Dáil in the past 12 months on this issue?  Second, does he still say that he fully and freely co-operated with the Mahon tribunal?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">As regards the second question, as far as I am concerned I have totally and absolutely — and my legal team believes the same — co-operated with the tribunal in every way that I possibly and physically could.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_155">I did not ask the Taoiseach's legal team, I asked him.  I shall give him two examples.  On 22 September 2006 the Taoiseach said in this House: "I have provided all documentation requested, sworn affidavits, given statements of evidence and had no difficulty with this."  That is what he said.  We now know that he did not provide all the information and that he had difficulty.  Otherwise the tribunal would not have called him back for private interview or to public hearings.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">On 27 September 2006 the Taoiseach also told this House that he had not broken any tax law.  However, on 14 May this year he told reporters that he had recently made a payment to the Revenue Commissioners relating to the payments and the gifts that he received in early 1990.  Misleading statements were not confined to this House.  On this day last year the Taoiseach told RTE on the "Six-one" news that the money he had saved was gone.  However, he agreed with the tribunal that when he first received £22,500 in December 1993, he had nearly £70,000 at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Finally, on co-operation with the tribunal, the Taoiseach agreed under oath to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, that he had not supplied it with the comprehensive information it requested concerning cash lodgements the tribunal was investigating over a two and half year period.  We know now, from the evidence at the tribunal, that he did not disclose in his sworn affidavit details of Irish £50,000, transferred to an account opened for his benefit by his then partner.  I do not have the time to give the Taoiseach more examples, but I could.  I ask him again, in view of the comments he made in this House, whether he is prepared to correct these misleading statements to the Dáil, of which he is Taoiseach.  In view of what I have pointed out here, does he still stand over his statement that he fully and freely co-operated with the Mahon tribunal?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_72">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_158">I shall be dealing with some of these issues at greater length.  It is my view and the view of those who advised me that I made discovery in accordance with the requirements of the tribunal.  The chairman of the tribunal has made it clear there are no suggestions that there are documents I failed to discover.  The Deputy is making reference to two items, in particular to the money I transferred to Ms Celia Larkin.  I shall deal with that issue later.  However, it is my view that I made matters clear in the letter attached to my discovery documents on 7 February 2005, where I made reference to that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">On the issue of the Revenue Commissioners, there is no contradiction as regards what I said on 13 May and in this House at the end of September last year.  The position is that it was my advice from two senior and eminent tax consultants that I had no tax obligation as regards the money I received on the basis of loans, with the intention of repaying — and subsequently paid back.  Obviously I was in correspondence with Revenue, as I believe most people appearing before the tribunal are.  I was advised that what I should do, on a no-fault basis, was to make a tax discovery on that and pay the sum, notwithstanding the fact that my case, and that of my tax advisers, is that I have no such liability.  I did that and complied with the advice I received.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">On the £48,000 I believe I received in all, I paid back with interest, almost £100,000 on the basis that the moneys were loans.  I do not believe there is anything misleading in what I state.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">I beg the Ceann Comhairle's indulgence to express my sadness over the tragedy that occurred in Bray earlier today and I extend my sympathy to those affected.  I do so because I live near Bray, where the accident occurred, and because, in my life as a trade union official, I represented and organised part-time and temporary firemen.  I therefore have some understanding of the risks they take and realise how deeply affected the local community and the two firemen's colleagues must be by today's tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">In putting my question to the Taoiseach, I acknowledge his achievements for this country.  A year ago, the story broke that he had received large sums of money from private sources for his personal use and we now know from the tribunal that the total amount we are talking about is approximately €300,000 in today's terms.  When the Taoiseach was challenged about this at the time, he said to us that he wanted an opportunity to explain to the tribunal what had happened regarding the money.  We all waited to hear the explanation and he gave it as evidence at the tribunal over 18 hours over four days.  I do not believe his explanation and I believe a majority of Members of this House do not believe it.  Many Members on the Taoiseach's side, who are publicly loyal, and the majority of people do not believe the story he told the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">This issue is serious because there is national disbelief about the evidence the Taoiseach gave to the tribunal, which he gave on swearing a solemn oath to tell the whole truth.  This national disbelief goes to the heart of trust and confidence in Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach.  It is a resigning issue and would be in any other country.  We cannot ignore that because, in the global economy in which we now function, these issues matter.  Does the Taoiseach intend to resign from office and, given that he has stated he does not intend to continue in the office of Taoiseach for the full life of this Dáil in any event, when does he intend to resign and hand over to his designated successor?</p>

          <p eId="para_170">Seriously, I wish the Deputy well.  Deputy Eamon Gilmore has served in this House with distinction since 1989.  He has an onerous task and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I join Deputy Eamon Gilmore in expressing my sympathy to the families and colleagues of the two firemen who lost their lives while serving on the fire brigade.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I would like to respond to Deputy Gilmore's questions about the value in today's terms of certain sums of money.  I received loans of approximately £48,000, in 1994 terms, from friends.  Those moneys were repayable and I paid them back.  The Deputy is obviously talking about other sums of money which I did not receive on the basis that they were loans.  I paid back approximately £97,000, in 2006 terms, in respect of the loans I have mentioned.  I have explained previously why I did not make the repayments earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The tribunal and its legal team have made clear that the allegation against me is that I received either £150,000, £50,000 or £30,000 from Mr. Owen O'Callaghan in 1989, or at some time between 1989 and 1992.  While there are many other allegations, that is the only one on which I have been questioned.  I have to answer questions on that issue and not on anything else.  I would like Deputy Gilmore to believe me — if he does not, I cannot force him to do so — when I say that I never received anything from Mr. Owen O'Callaghan, or anyone associated with Mr. O'Callaghan, for any purpose in 1989, 1999 or at any other time.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">I never said the Taoiseach received anything from Mr. Owen O'Callaghan.  My question relates to the disbelief throughout the country at the evidence the Taoiseach gave to the tribunal.  I refer to the idea that the Taoiseach had no bank account for a long period of time and cannot remember receiving or lodging certain moneys.  I refer to the suggestion that the Taoiseach got a bagful of money from a man who walked into his office.  It has been claimed that this money, which was not counted by the Taoiseach, the man in question or the person who lodged it, was left in a wardrobe overnight.  I would like to comment on the idea that one lodgement coincided with an even amount of dollars and another lodgement coincided with an even amount of sterling.  We can take one coincidence, but to believe in two coincidences is a little far-fetched.  The problem we have is that we do not believe the Taoiseach.  We do not believe what he said to the tribunal.  I do not believe the Taoiseach's story.  I think his story at the tribunal was a cock and bull story and I think many people in this country agree with me.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">The problem we now face relates to the lack of belief in what the Taoiseach said to the tribunal.  I wish I could believe his evidence, frankly.  Where does that lack of belief leave him as Taoiseach of this country?  How does the Taoiseach propose to continue to lead the country, given that a majority of its people do not believe the sworn evidence he gave to a tribunal that was established by this House?  The people of this country have great affection for the Taoiseach, as he knows — they have elected him as the Head of the Government on three occasions.  Like the people of Ireland, I have great respect for the work the Taoiseach has done for this country.  However, he cannot take the people of this country for gullible fools.  In light of the lack of credibility that attaches to the evidence the Taoiseach gave to the tribunal, how long does he propose to continue in the office of Taoiseach?  That the Taoiseach will have to go to the tribunal repeatedly over the next few years to answer questions about various aspects of this matter will represent an obvious distraction from his day job.  The question I have asked is particularly relevant when one considers that the House will consider a motion of confidence in the Taoiseach later today.</p>

That I will continue to do so does not create any difficulty for me or distract me from my job, although it might mean I have to work longer and more demanding hours at times.  That is how it has been and how it is likely to continue.  I assure the House that I will continue to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I remind Deputy Gilmore that I have addressed the issues I was asked to address and submitted the information I was asked to submit in response to certain questions.  It was not the case that I did not have a bank account during the period in question, as the Deputy purports to allege.  I have discovered details of over 20 bank accounts which were either in my name, my wife's name, the names of my children or the names of people with whom I was politically associated.  There was a period, between the time when I separated from my wife to the time when the resulting judicial case was brought to a conclusion in the High Court, when I did not use my bank accounts in the normal way.  I can accept that people will say that was unorthodox, but that is how it was.  I have given all the factual information on that to the tribunal.  The details of what happened are quite clear to the tribunal because it has all the records of the accounts.  The tribunal knows how I dealt with my affairs during the period in question.  I cannot change that.  When I was issued with a discovery order relating to the period between the start of 1988, which is almost 20 years ago, and the end of 1995, which is almost 12 years ago, I complied with the order by providing all the information in question.  When I was questioned on that information, I gave an account of it which I believe to be totally truthful.  I cannot do any more than that and that is the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">On 3 November 2006, I proposed a referendum on the place of children in the Constitution.  I asked the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to initiate a process of consultation and discussion with the Dáil parties and all relevant interest groups.  The then Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, engaged in a series of discussions with representatives of political parties, the Ombudsman for Children, non-governmental organisations — represented by the Children's Rights Alliance — and faith-based groups.  The purpose of the consultation was to achieve consensus on an appropriate wording for a constitutional amendment that would reflect the need to establish robust safeguards and protections for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">On the direction of the Government, proposals were brought to the Cabinet by the then Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, on a referendum to amend the Constitution in respect of children's rights.  The Twenty-Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2007 was published on 19 February last.  In line with the programme for Government, it is proposed to establish an all-party committee to examine the proposed constitutional amendment with a view to deepening the consensus on this matter further.  It is envisaged that the Bill which has been published will provide a framework for the work of the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">A decision on whether a referendum will be held on the EU reform treaty will be taken on foot of the outcome of the current Intergovernmental Conference.  I commented recently that I think it is likely that there will be a referendum on the treaty in 2008.  The All-Party Committee on the Constitution published its report on the family on 24 January 2006.  The relevant Departments are considering the report's recommendations.  The Government has acted on most of the key recommendations which emanated from earlier reports of the all-party committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The two previous Governments introduced ten referendums.  The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to make progress with further recommendations of the all-party committee.  The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration must be given to the frequency with which referendums can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_190">I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that a full briefing on all the documentation in this regard is arranged for Deputy Shatter, who will handle this matter for Fine Gael.  As the Taoiseach is aware, this month marks the 15th anniversary of Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  Since this country signed that convention, two reports published by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child have criticised the Government's failure to comply with the obligations imposed on the State by the convention.  If we are to fulfil those obligations, we urgently need to prioritise constitutional and legislative reform and to attach greater priority to bringing children's laws and services into the 21st century.  Arising from this, does the Taoiseach know when it is proposed to hold the referendum?  When are we likely to see the proposed wording and what mechanisms are to be put in place to hold the referendum?</p>
            <p eId="para_191">Will the Taoiseach confirm that Ireland is likely to be the only State to hold a referendum on the European Constitution?  Given this is the case and that this will result in a great deal of international activity here, probably on the anti side, will the Taoiseach confirm that he will ensure the Forum on Europe is properly resourced and that the Irish Government will conduct a real campaign in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_192">Has the Taoiseach held discussions with Green Party Ministers and have they confirmed to him that their party will fully support, vocally and otherwise, ratification of the treaty when it comes before us in the form of a referendum?</p>

            <p eId="para_193">I will ask the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Smith, to arrange for a full and detailed briefing on this matter for Deputy Shatter as Fine Gael spokesperson in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Dáil Éireann on 21 September 1992 and entered into force in Ireland on 21 October 1992.  Ireland subsequently signed the European Convention on the Exercise of Children's Rights in 1996.  This is intended to supplement the UN Convention by promoting the rights of children in family law proceedings.  Similar to other common-law countries, Ireland has a dualist system under which international agreements to which it becomes a party are not automatically incorporated into domestic law.  Two Articles of the Constitution deal with that.  Article 29.3 states "Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in relations with other States".  Article 29.6 provides that "No international agreement shall be part of domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas".  The Constitutional provision has been interpreted as precluding the Irish courts from giving effect to an international agreement where this is contrary to domestic law or grants rights or imposes obligations additional to those of domestic law.  Consequently, whereas Ireland has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the convention did not automatically become part of Irish law.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of the rights set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child are already provided for in the Constitution either expressly or implied.  Others are provided for by way of legislation.  However, several issues remain to be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">Deputy Kenny will be aware that Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister of State with responsibility for children, published a proposed wording in this regard last February.  We hope we can re-establish a committee of the House to examine this and the work done up to that period and subsequently try to get agreement on this, which is always better in the case of referendums.  We have tried to get agreement on this over the past several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_196">Deputy Kenny will recall we made a commitment earlier this year, when we decided in March or April not to press on with this issue, but to try to deal with it in 2008.  It is not necessary to state when exactly in 2008 but I would like to stick to the commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">On the reform agenda, obviously, the Government has held discussions on the matter.  I hope everybody in Government will support it.  The Intergovernmental Conference appears at this stage to be on target to finish its work if not by end October then by end November.  We will have to make a decision in due course on how we will ratify the reform treaty.  It is reasonable to assume we will need to hold a referendum next year.  I do not foresee any circumstances wherein that would not be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">Following the decision of the Netherlands last Thursday, it appears Ireland will be the only country to hold a referendum on this issue.  From what I hear from my colleagues, all other countries will deal with the matter by way of parliamentary ratification.  As Deputy Kenny stated, this means we may invite people with a counter view on the matter.  Those who support such issues never seem to turn up but perhaps they will on this occasion.  Everything has been done to ensure sufficient resources and staff are made available to the Forum and we will continue to do this.  The Forum is doing a good job and its work within the confines of this city and elsewhere will be helpful as it has been in the past.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_199">The questions relate to referenda on constitutional amendments generally.  In this regard I would like to go through them one by one with the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Is the Taoiseach saying Ireland will definitely hold a referendum on the EU reform treaty or is he saying this has yet to be decided by the Government?  I refer in particular to his comment that the Government has yet to decide how the ratification process will be undertaken.  I would like some clarity on that.  My recollection was that following the summit last June, the Taoiseach gave a public commitment that a referendum would be held.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">On the referendum on children and the proposed all-party committee which I welcome, when will that committee be established?  There were passing references at different stages to other possible referenda, for instance on the question of building land arising from the all-party committee report.  Will a referendum be held on that issue or will recommendations be implemented by way of legislation?  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto contained a reference, not repeated in the programme for Government, to changes in the courts system to deal with the problem where criminal trials collapsed because of legal technicalities.  There was a reference to the possibility of an amendment to the Constitution to deal with that.  Is that still envisaged?</p>
            <p eId="para_202">On the situation facing <i>de facto</i> couples be they non-marital heterosexual couples or same sex couples, does the Taoiseach intend to regularise the position of the relationships of such couples by way of legislation or constitutional amendment?</p>

            <p eId="para_203">I will respond to Deputy Gilmore's questions in the order in which they were raised.  On the reform treaty, as I stated last year, it can be reasonably assumed that a referendum will be necessary.  However, a decision in that regard cannot be made until the Intergovernmental Conference document has been agreed.  When that document is completed the Attorney General will examine it.   He cannot decide until he examines the document and he cannot examine the document until it is completed.  Based on experience, I do not foresee any outcome other than that the matter be decided by way of referendum.  Technically, no decision can be made until the IGC process is completed, probably in November.</p>

            <p eId="para_205">A decision cannot be made in the absence of a document.  The Attorney General cannot make a decision until he has examined the final document.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">We are anxious to move on the issue of children's rights.  Much work has been done.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brendan Smith, is anxious to have the all-party Oireachtas committee re-established as a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas rather than as an informal <i>ad hoc</i> committee.  It makes sense that the committee should enjoy the same support and backup enjoyed by other committees.  There is no reason it should be outside the normal committee system.  I am anxious that this be done as soon as possible.  The Whips will be discussing these issues shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">In regard to building land, it is the view that this could be done by way of legislation.  I understand the possibility of introducing legislation is being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">I am not aware of any legislation in regard to the courts.  There is a need to reform the courts system in the context of cases that fall outside it.  I have no information that this requires a constitutional referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">On the Deputy's last question regarding constitutional change which would extend the protection of the Constitution to cohabiting heterosexual or same sex couples, it is clear that it will be necessary to examine this issue in the context of legislative provision.  That is what is happening.  We had two reports last year, one from the Law Reform Commission and another from the Colley Group.  Both have been examined within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the past six months.  I understand from the Minister that a memorandum will be brought to the Government next month for it to make a decision with a view to progressing the matter in line with what was outlined earlier this year.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_93">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_210">Will the Taoiseach assure the House that whatever the outcome to the referendum on the EU constitutional treaty, the Government will abide by it and avoid the type of debacle that took place in regard to the Treaty of Nice II?  Will the Government accept the judgment of the people on the various arguments?  It is important to assuage the fears of many as to the Government's intentions on this matter.  The Government has repeatedly sought to assure the House that the growing militarisation of the European Union does not represent a threat to Irish neutrality.  If that is the case, is the Taoiseach prepared to consider a referendum to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Constitution?  Just over a year ago the Sinn Féin Deputies presented a Bill for that purpose which I commend to the Government if it wants to examine what would be required to progress such a proposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_211">In regard to the proposed 28th amendment of the Constitution regarding the rights of children, I acknowledge that the former Minister with responsibility in that area, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was very accommodating and accessible in the exchange of ideas and views on the matter.  I wish his successor, my constituency colleague, well in this responsibility.  Is the Taoiseach still open to ideas in regard to the structure, wording and detail of the proposition?  Will he and the Minister with responsibility in the area ensure there is a proper debate leading to such a referendum in order that the best advice and the widest raft of opinion can be factored in in advance of tabling the wording?  In the document we presented we suggested inserting a new article into the Constitution expressly detailing children's rights based on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the Taoiseach referred in his opening response to this group of questions.  Will the Government continue with the approach employed by the former Minister with responsibility for children?  Will he adopt, as we have argued for, a broader and more comprehensive protection of the rights of children?</p>
            <p eId="para_212">This is the 50th anniversary of the last introduction by an Irish Government of internment without trial.  Fifty years ago the Government of the day exercised that power, a power that does not require a vote or debate in the House.  It is a power that remains on the Statute Book and has not been exercised since.  It has no place in any Statute Book.  In the light of today's reality, knowing how detrimental, unhelpful and how adverse it is to the human rights of individuals who are scooped in such a manner — hundreds were detained at the Government's pleasure in the Curragh 50 years ago — would the Taoiseach be prepared to consider a constitutional amendment to further guarantee the rights of citizens and put an end to the employment of such abusive measures as were represented by the introduction of internment without trial 50 years ago?  The Taoiseach will remember it well, or some of his family might.  He should smile and be proud.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">In regard to the reform agenda, we should not have to wait too long for the outcome of the IGC.  I hope we will be able to recommend it to the people as a good agreement for the country and the future of Europe.  I hope we will get it passed.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">Regarding the Deputy's remarks on another referendum, the issue is not the same.  We made a number of changes in regard to the referendum on the second Nice treaty.  In that case we also succeeded in agreeing a protocol that dealt with some of the issues the Deputy raised to bring clarity to our position of neutrality.  That dealt with what was probably the biggest concern, with the misunderstanding of the referendum on the first Nice treaty, to the satisfaction of more than two thirds of the people and allowed the enlargement of Europe to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">In regard to the rights of the child, the answer to the Deputy's question is yes.  We are anxious to proceed on the basis of achieving consensus.  We must bring this matter to a conclusion and are committed to doing so.  We are anxious to have discussions because it is always best, in the case of a referendum, to get agreement and broad political support from the Houses of the Oireachtas on an issue to be put to the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">I am not certain whether internment is a legislative or constitutional matter.  I suggest that the Deputy progress it directly with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The issue has not been raised for a long time, nor has the power of internment been used.  I am not sure what its status is or what legal basis there is for examining it.  I am sure a question to the Minister would result in the issue being dealt with.</p>

            <p eId="para_222">In regard to the new reform treaty, did the Taoiseach say that 90% of the substance of the old constitutional treaty would be included in the new proposals?  Is it not a fact that the leaders at that time determined, almost precisely, the substance of the reform treaty?  In effect, is the intergovernmental conference now drafting what was decided at that time?  Was there not a commitment to a constitutional referendum made on the basis that 90% of the constitutional treaty would be included in it?</p>
            <p eId="para_223">The Taoiseach entered a caveat at that summit that Ireland would opt-out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights or that it would retain the right to do so.  Has the Attorney General studied the documentation sufficiently to determine that Ireland will not exercise the opt-out clause?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_101">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_224">Deputy Costello is correct that the reform treaty is substantially the same as the work we had completed during the Irish Presidency.  Obviously it does not carry the status of a constitutional treaty because people in this and other countries raised issues in that regard.  Amendments and changes have been made to it.  Some issues were agreed in the subsequent discussions earlier this year and in the June European Council.  It would not be correct to say that the same document will issue from the Intergovernmental Conference.  There is an ongoing round of discussions and I understand from the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, that my worry that people would try to reopen issues has not happened.  Things are in line with the position we had reached in June, and that being the case, we have nothing to worry about.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">The former British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, late in the night of the June meeting introduced legal submissions and caveats, about an examination of a number of areas in the JHA area and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I stated that we wanted the right to examine the legality of those submissions.  We have examined them and they have no implications for us.  It was never our intention to opt out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I have supported the Charter of Fundamental Rights from the time it was prepared seven or eight years ago up to the constitution.  We brought it forward and included it in the Irish Presidency.  We are and have always been supportive of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

As I mention Independent News &amp; Media, I record my strong disagreement with the Ceann Comhairle's decision not to accept a question from me about the meeting the Taoiseach had or may have had with representatives of that company in the mouth of the general election some months ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_246">Is the communications unit involved in tracking particular coverage or advising of the disposition of media entities, whether broadcast or print?  What advice does the unit give the Taoiseach and how does he respond to such advice?  Was this why he met with representatives of Independent News &amp; Media and, perhaps, Mr. Tony O'Reilly?</p>

            <p eId="para_247">The communications unit is staffed and run to Civil Service standards.  The information it documents is provided to several hundred people in Departments, merely giving the headlines of the hour or the day and, where necessary, giving transcripts to Departments.  Previously, Departments used to source and purchase this information from outside companies, with several Departments sourcing the same information from the same or different companies at great cost to the State.  The unit is not engaged in monitoring of stories.  It provides the news stories or headlines of the day to Departments to make press officers and key individuals in Departments, who serve the public, aware of current issues.  It has no connection with the political system.  Neither is it connected with the Government Information Service, unless to provide information for the GIS, which provides a service to the Government.  The officials of the unit do their job as civil servants.  They rotate within and between various Departments.  The unit does not and has never had a function of the kind described by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_253">The officials of the communications unit are part of the Civil Service structure and are answerable in the normal course to the Secretary General of the Department.  They work on a strictly non-political basis.  The unit deals only with the Government Press Office and with press officers in the various Departments on matters of a non-political nature.  The officials are subject to all the conventions which apply to civil servants regarding political impartiality.  The unit covers those conventions, probably more scrupulously than any other area of the Civil Service, because it deals with media issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">The data prepared by the unit is made available.  The information provided is simply a synopsis of daily news bulletins and news stories from radio stations.  It can save a substantial amount of money when, for example, interviews are being checked.  That is its benefit.  It can provide information quickly to Departments so they can deal with issues, whether a news story is a good or tragic one.  The unit keeps the entire system up to date on what is happening outside.  Civil servants at all levels receive information and can act on it.  Were it not for the unit, civil servants might not be aware of what is happening outside their Departments in the course of a normal day.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise the following urgent matter: the health sector cutbacks leading to cutbacks in patient services at hospitals across the country.  Extensive cutbacks of frontline staff at Sligo General Hospital will adversely affect the quality and availability of patient care.  The scale of the job cuts at Sligo General Hospital exceeds anything proposed for any other location.  The inclusion of both nursing and consultant staff seriously erodes the capacity of the hospital to maintain the current standard of service and care.  With more than 360 patients on the waiting list for surgery for more than 12 months, these major cutbacks will result in longer waiting times for patients.  Out-patient appointments and clinics will be cancelled, leading to greater hardship and stress for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">While budgetary matters are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, it is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that standards of care and access to services are maintained.

          <p eId="para_284">—recognises the enormous contribution made by An Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, TD, to Irish public life including his many achievements in:</p>
          <p eId="para_285">—patient and skilful leadership of the peace process which has resulted in a restoration of democratic institutions in Northern Ireland and a new era in North/South and Anglo-Irish relations;</p>

          <p eId="para_296">—maintains that it is the role of the members of the tribunal to make an objective assessment of the completed evidence and to make findings if necessary;</p>
          <p eId="para_297">—commends the Government for refusing to be distracted from its agenda of taking Ireland forward with positive and inclusive policies;</p>

          <p eId="para_299">—rejects the politically opportunistic motion of no confidence put forward by the Fine Gael Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">In Easter 2000 I first became aware of an allegation that I had received a bribe of £50,000 from Mr. Owen O'Callaghan.  I sued in respect of the allegation, the source of which was Mr. Denis "Starry" O'Brien.  At the hearing of defamation proceedings, the trial judge found the allegation to be false and baseless.  In addition, Mr. Tom Gilmartin has made allegations to the Flood tribunal concerning an alleged payment of £50,000 in 1989, which I believe is the same allegation as made by Mr. Denis "Starry" O'Brien, a payment of £30,000 sometime prior to 1992, and a further payment of a sum of £150,000, allegedly paid by Mr. Owen O'Callaghan to Mr. Albert Reynolds.  Each of these allegations is false.  Counsel for the Mahon tribunal has stated that there is no evidence establishing any payment by Owen O'Callaghan to me.  After four days in the witness box that remains the position.  There is not a scintilla of evidence of any such payments.  This is so because I never received such payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">These allegations are not the only allegations made against me by Mr. Tom Gilmartin.  Among the more bizarre and lurid allegations is one that I procured two Ministers to blackmail another Minister in the context of tax designation.  I will not dignify the allegation by revealing its sleazy details to this House but I can assure the House it is as baseless as it is vicious.  The Mahon tribunal sought extensive information and discovery from me because of various allegations.  It has involved a trawl of my financial affairs for a very extensive period.  So be it.  I have given it the information and documentation available to me.  I attended a private session, which I was not legally obliged to do, and I have now given evidence in public.  The tribunal will sift and assess that evidence and reach its conclusions in due course.  Normally I would refrain from commenting on ongoing work of the tribunal but I find myself in a position where I must respond to calls for me to resign.  Therefore, I will take some time to address the recurring questions and issues concerning my evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Last Saturday, on the "Marian Finucane Show", I urged people to read all the transcripts of my evidence at the Mahon tribunal.  I understand the difficulties the media have in compressing 18 hours of evidence into limited space, meaning that accusations are sometimes made against me by soundbite.  I contend that for anyone interested in these matters, the most thorough and detailed examination of my testimony the Irish public can receive is to read the entire transcript.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Some simple facts must be restated.  The lodgments under consideration by the Mahon tribunal took place within 30 days of the ending of my matrimonial proceedings, were completed within a two year period and were the only lodgments being examined in a career of more than 30 years in politics.  These are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">To many my affairs are unorthodox.  That is because my lifestyle in that dark period was unorthodox.  Many who have gone through the trauma of marital separation and legal proceedings will feel empathy with me.  Mine was not a perfect life, nor a perfect family and matrimonial environment but as I emerged from that period I was assisted by friends and my affairs were regularised over a short period.  Now those who stated they would leave matters to be adjudicated by the tribunal last October and May, seek to sit as judge, jury and executioner.  One day they blow hot, the next day they blow cold.  Last May due process was an excuse not to comment but today political accountability is the pretext for their questioning.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I have repeatedly stated that I looked forward to giving evidence at the tribunal.  I have done so.  With eagerness I take this opportunity to challenge my accusers on the opposite side of the House.  I deal with their allegations, soundbites and glib criticisms.  I will address the issues separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Regarding the $45,000 issue, after the conclusion of my evidence on Monday media reports and political commentary by some was to the effect that I was unable to contradict the dollar allegation.  This is simply not so and such comments are based on a misunderstanding that I will expose.  The salient facts in respect of the $45,000 are as follows.  A bank official, Mr. Philip Murphy, who worked in AIB, O'Connell Street, has given evidence that there never was a deposit of $45,000.  Ms Rosemary Murtagh, having been taken through the documentation in the AIB remit room, agreed that the hypothesis that $45,000 was remitted by the branch to AIB headquarters, was destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The money lodged came from Mr. Michael Wall from Manchester.  He did not deal in dollars.  Rather, he dealt in sterling or Irish punts.  A variety of combinations of Irish punts and sterling gives exactly $45,000.  Likewise a variety of combinations of Irish punts and sterling gives exactly $25,000, $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000<i>ad infinitum</i>.  The exact sum lodged in Ms Celia Larkin’s account on 5 December 1994 amounts to the following foreign currency sums, when the range applicable that day is applied: 71.5 million Italian lira and 237,700 French francs.  So far I have not been accused of having received lira or French francs but no doubt the Opposition will seek an inquiry into it.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">My independent expert, Mr. Stronge, having analysed the documentation with the branch and from the remit room in AIB headquarters, has concluded that the evidence does not substantiate a lodgment of US$45,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">There has been much confusion about the basis for the opinion of Mr. Stronge.  He prepared his preliminary report that was submitted to the tribunal having heard all the evidence.  That evidence which concluded with the evidence of Rosemary Murtagh finished on Tuesday, 11 September 2007.  As I was giving evidence on the Thursday morning, a preliminary report could only be furnished to me at that stage.  This is the preliminary report to which I referred in my statement at the opening of the tribunal.  That preliminary report and its conclusions is based solely and exclusively on the branch and the remit room documentation.  The view is abroad that the report of Mr. Stronge which was put in evidence at the tribunal on Monday, was based on 67 material or actual calculations; this is not so.  The mathematical formula by which those calculations are carried out was perfectly valid and they are based on the evidence of banking witnesses given up to the end of July.  However, the Allied Irish Bank's evidence changed in September and because that evidence changed the calculations were therefore no longer applicable.  As I emphasise this point, this is not the factual basis for the opinion contained in the report of Mr. Stronge.  His conclusions are based on entirely separate and distinct reasoning.  It is based on the evidence of the documentation of Allied Irish Bank and not on the 67 calculations.  This is the reason I am now availing of this opportunity to nail the lie that I have somehow failed to establish that there was no $45,000.  Mr. Stronge is a distinguished banker and is the former chief operating officer of Bank of Ireland corporate banking and lectures in financial reporting at the Smurfit Graduate School of Business and is a financial statement analyst at the National College of Ireland.  He will be giving evidence to the tribunal in due course that the AIB evidence and documentation does not substantiate a lodgment of US$45,000.  Mr. Stronge is a truly independent witness.  I do not know him; I have never met him; I have never had a discussion with him.  My lawyers retained him as an independent expert.  In this context, the branch documentation is relied upon to demonstrate that my evidence is wrong.  Such an assertion ignores the reality of the evidence already given by bank officials.  They have acknowledged that what are known as the narratives on the banking documentation are of no accounting significance and are unreliable.  They have told the tribunal that it is very possible that the sterling and dollar sums were transcribed onto the wrong sheets but that this had no accounting significance because all sums were expressed in Irish pounds and so long as the Irish pounds sums balanced, no issue would arise.  If $45,000 had been lodged to the branch, the branch would have remitted that sum to the remit room in bank headquarters.  However, the remit room documentation is not consistent with remittal of US$45,000.  Accordingly, the narrative on the documentation in the branch must be wrong.  It contains a simple and understandable error and one which the bank is not concerned with because it has no accounting significance.  This is the type of error which the bank officials readily acknowledge can occur and in this case it has occurred.  I wish to be clear that I did not receive US$45,000, I did not receive the sum of Italian lira 71.5 million, and I did not receive French francs FF237,700.  The money was a combination of sterling and punts.  These are the facts as brought out before the tribunal.  It is the truth.  I am satisfied that my evidence will be vindicated in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">On the matter of discovery, I made discovery in accordance with the requirements of the tribunal.  The chairman of the tribunal has made it clear that there is no suggestion that there is some document I have failed to discover.  I have given hundreds upon hundreds of pages of discovery and answered questions, not just about five lodgements but about 86 lodgments.  They have included questions about money spent on the education of my children, on the maintenance of my wife and I have dealt with these issues in exhaustive detail.  As there appears to be a lingering suspicion about the quality of my discovery — although this is a matter for the tribunal — I will now address it in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I intend to address separately a number of recurring themes.  The first is the Michael Wall money.  The moneys lodged to the Celia Larkin account on 5 December 1994 belong to Michael Wall.  They were applied in respect of works to the house at 44, Beresford.  This was the house which he bought and he owned.  The moneys on deposit in that account were not my moneys nor were they applied for my benefit.  In so far as I and my lawyers are concerned, this was not an account in respect of which discovery applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">On the second issue of the Celia Larkin £50,000, I informed the tribunal that I transferred money to Celia Larkin's account in December 1994.  I did this in a letter to the tribunal on 7 February 2005.  There is no mystery about this.  While the money was my money, the account was not my account — it was Celia Larkin's account.  However, I wanted to make it plain to the tribunal that I transferred my moneys to her account.  This I did by referring to this fact in the letter of 7 February and it accompanied my affidavit of discovery.  I spent night after night and many weekends and days addressing the issue of discovery.  I unearthed a voluminous amount of documentation.  I disclosed more than 20 accounts in my name or in the joint names of my wife and I or in the names of my daughters.  I did not consciously or wilfully omit any account from affidavit of discovery.  I believe this is also my lawyers' view and I fully complied with and discharged my discovery obligations.  The legal issues in this regard are being addressed to the tribunal by the lawyers representing the tribunal and my legal team, if the need arises.  However, I am satisfied I have done nothing wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">On the issue of alleged delay, there is a false view that I did not make discovery for two and a half years but this is untrue.  Not only did I make a discovery on 7 February 2005 and on 27 March 2006, I gave to the tribunal — although not obliged by law to do so — two letters of authorisation given on 10 June 2005 and on 6 April 2006.  These authorised the tribunal to interview my bankers and obtain all bank documents and I thereby waived confidentiality.  Hence the tribunal had full access to my accounts and information concerning those accounts.  The tribunal also obtained discovery against Allied Irish Bank and I consented to that discovery.  Moreover, during the greater part of this period the tribunal was precluded by court order from inquiring in public into Quarryvale two.  Thus while I was dealing with the tribunal, there were court orders affecting how the tribunal could deal with Quarryvale two.  The way was only cleared for it to conduct that public inquiry when the Supreme Court gave a judgment in the Owen O'Callaghan case on 30 March 2007.  Before this, the public inquiry could not proceed.  An injunction against it so proceeding was granted by a High Court judge on 8 December 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I refer to the issue of a limit of £30,000 on discovery.  Because of the potential extent of the discovery sought by the tribunal, through my lawyers I sought to limit it to sums of £30,000 and above.  What was the basis for this?  In the Denis "Starry" O'Brien litigation, a High Court judge, at the request of my counsel, limited discovery to the sum of £50,000 and above.  This was because the allegation then being made by Denis "Starry" O'Brien was that I had received a bribe of £50,000 from Owen O'Callaghan.  The principle informing the making of that order in the High Court is exactly the same principle which my lawyers sought to apply to discovery to the tribunal where the allegations I was then facing involved the assertion that I received £50,000 in 1989 and £30,000 sometime in or around 1992.  Hence, the approach suggested at the tribunal by my lawyers in relation to discovery was one based on exactly what happened in the High Court when discovery was being addressed in the Denis "Starry" O'Brien case.  This was the approach I suggested be followed.  Whether it would have been followed or not, it would have been absolutely clear that I was not operating bank accounts at the time and that this was the case from the 1980s.  Second, in making my actual discovery on 7 February 2005, I made it clear, as I would have done in all circumstances, that I had not operated bank accounts since the 1980s, including the period from the actual separation from my wife.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">On the issue of the changing of evidence, the fundamentals of my evidence have remained the same.  I have added some detail and elaborated in some areas for reasons which I will explain.  I make no apologies for giving my best recollection when giving evidence.  It is a matter of reality that one's recollection can be helped as new information comes to light.  This has occurred in my case and I will explain the reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">In the run-up to this year's election, the transcripts were leaked to the media.  An issue arose in relation to a lodgment in June and another in December, which totalled £30,000 sterling.  I had already confirmed to the tribunal that these were sterling lodgements when I met its representatives on 5 April last.  On foot of the publicity surrounding the illegal leaks of the manuscripts, I was contacted by a number of people.  They recalled for me that I had in fact looked at houses in early 1995.  This refreshed my memory that in fact at one stage I was not going to proceed with the deal with Michael Wall and, therefore, returned the money to him.  Hence, the rationale for converting punts into £30,000 sterling.  It was because of the leaks during the general election that this information was brought to my attention.  Hence, I informed the tribunal of this when I was giving my evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Second, on 21 April 2006, a report from my accountant Des Peelo was sent to the Mahon tribunal.  It stated that the sum of circa £8,000 sterling was lodged.  There is a very simple explanation for this.  The lodgement of 11 October was one I knew included some of the Manchester money, but I could not be precise as to the exact composition of the amount lodged.  The report from Mr. Peelo relied on the Central Bank rate rather than the precise exchange rate applicable in Allied Irish Banks on that day.  The published AIB rates were not available to me or to him at that time which meant that, of necessity, the sterling sum could not be exact.  It was the use of the Central Bank rate that created the uncertainty.  I did not see the actual bank conversion rates used by AIB until after the private session with the tribunal on 5 April 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I said in the private session that I did not recollect purchasing the £30,000 sterling, but assumed I had purchased it in AIB's O'Connell Street branch.  I mentioned that the AIB branches on O'Connell Street and in Drumcondra were the only two banks with which I dealt.  It became clear from the O'Connell Street branch documentation that I could not have purchased the sterling there.  The tribunal has not circulated the AIB Drumcondra documentation.  In either event, I cannot be precise as to where and when and by whom the money was purchased.  I continue, however, to make inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The period of time under consideration was a difficult one in my life.  I was busy attending to many obligations of holding office as Minister for Finance and then as leader of Fianna Fáil.  If I am to be criticised for not having a precise and clear recollection of all matters of detail some 12 and 13 years on, so be it.  I have done my best in recalling these events.  Indeed, the very people who now criticise me for lack of recollection in detail are the ones who would regard precise recollection of every detail as suspicious.  I have given my evidence as honestly as I can and to the best of my ability.  The human mind makes mistakes of recollection, forgets details and mingles events.  That is life.</p>

Through the process of discussion and the revelation of other facts, new memories and recollections come to the fore.  To err in one's recollection is normal and honest.  The essential facts of the transactions which have been the subject of the tribunal inquiries are clear.  The expenditure of the amounts in question in respect of the refurbishment and purchase of my house have also been corroborated.  No alternative suggestion has been made and none can be made as to the source of these payments or any other context in which they might have been paid.  That is because there was none.  Only the determination by my political foes to stretch the available evidence with malign intention can put a sinister construction on events which, however unorthodox to some, were truthfully described in my sworn evidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">This motion was tabled by my party because we do not have confidence in the Taoiseach.  The debate must focus on three themes.  The first is standards in public office and the question of whether it is acceptable for a senior politician to accept large sums of money for his private use and the second is whether the Taoiseach has co-operated freely and fully with the Mahon tribunal.  The third and most important issue is the question of whether the Taoiseach has been telling the truth to the Irish people, this Dáil and the Mahon tribunal.  If the Irish people have a Taoiseach whom they cannot believe, they cannot have trust and confidence in him, or indeed, his Government.  This is not a debate about the peace process, the economy, the European Union or any of the many other smokescreens which Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Progressive Democrats will undoubtedly seek to introduce into the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">The Taoiseach has no need to make that statement about himself as I will make it for him.  He has done the State some service.  Thousands of people on this island will live in peace and trust one another in part because of the Taoiseach's work.  The Good Friday Agreement which he piloted through with former Prime Minister Blair wrote an end to years of hatred and misery.  It required people of all traditions to relinquish the worst of their past and to express what Abraham Lincoln called "the better angels of their humanity".  The Taoiseach had my full support and the support of my party in pursuing this worthy objective with all his diligence and commitment.  I do not, therefore, deny that he has done the State some service.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">In the past period, the Taoiseach has obviously been concerned that what he perceives as his reputation and legacy may be tainted, tarnished or even erased.  He has lashed out at the media, the Mahon tribunal and everybody but the one person responsible for tainting that reputation.  That person is the man who saw the equivalent of €300,000 in today's terms lodged in cash to his or his partner's accounts.  That person is the individual whose explanations for the lodgements change by the day.  That person is the one who occupies the highest political office in the land and whose credibility is now in shreds.  That person is the Taoiseach himself.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">When Members on all sides vote on the motion, they should ask themselves the simple question of whether they believe the Taoiseach.  If they believe the Taoiseach and his many twisted and tortured accounts of how he came to lodge €300,000 in today's terms over a period of two years, if they believe that he cannot remember memorable events such as changing IR£30,000 into sterling and if they believe he gave the tribunal everything it sought when it sought it, they can vote confidence in the Taoiseach.  That is the choice the Fine Gael motion gives them.  However, if they agree with my party that the Taoiseach cannot be believed on these matters, they should not vote confidence in him.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">On 3 October last year, Deputy Sargent stated in the House:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_355">What the Taoiseach did in taking money from businesses and businessmen was and is totally inappropriate and improper.  It was unethical and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Deputy Sargent was correct.  Along with other members of the Opposition at the time, we said the Taoiseach was wrong.  We now know that the money the Taoiseach lodged to various accounts between December 1993 and December 1995 amounts to €300,000 in today's money terms.  The recent hearings focused on four of those lodgements, which equate to $45,000, £25,000 sterling, £20,000 sterling and £10,000 sterling.  We have heard no credible explanation from the Taoiseach for these lodgements.  People want to know where they came from.  In the absence of such an explanation, the deep suspicion will always remain that these lodgements were a result of personal contributions made to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Last year the Taoiseach said repeatedly that he did no wrong.  His Ministers to a man and a woman supported him.  One year later, we now know that the amounts of money concerned did not just come from two so-called whip-arounds and an alleged dinner totalling IR£48,000 but rather a series of lodgements which amount to €300,000 in today's terms.  However, the response of the Taoiseach and his Ministers is exactly the same: "I did no wrong"; "He did no wrong."  That is the standard that those who vote confidence in the Taoiseach tonight will set for themselves and for their parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The scale may well be different from that of Mr. Haughey, but scale does not alter standards.  It may well have happened at a time of change for the Taoiseach, but circumstances do not alter standards.  If it was wrong in the case of Mr. Haughey, it is equally wrong in the case of Deputy Ahern.  To take such moneys for personal use was simply wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Nothing illustrates the brazenness of the Taoiseach more than his repeated assurances to the Irish people, delivered directly on television or in this House, that he has co-operated fully and freely with the Mahon tribunal.  On 13 May 2007, in the middle of the general election campaign, the Taoiseach told the Irish people:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_360">The tribunal has come back to me at various points and asked me to explain particular transactions in my bank accounts.  I provided those explanations.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Taoiseach did not provide those explanations; he did not provide them in private correspondence with the tribunal and he did not provide them at a private interview with the tribunal.  That is why he had to attend the tribunal to give sworn testimony for four days in the past two weeks, at considerable cost to the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The Taoiseach says he fully co-operated with the tribunal, but that is not true.  On 13 September, in sworn evidence, that is, the truth and nothing but the truth, he accepted that he had not supplied the tribunal with the comprehensive information it requested concerning cash lodgements being investigated by the tribunal over two and a half years.  The Taoiseach said he freely co-operated with the tribunal, but that is not true.  At the tribunal on 13 September, correspondence was opened which revealed that at one stage the tribunal threatened the Taoiseach with a summons because of his failure to supply information.  The Taoiseach told RTE's Bryan Dobson on the Six One News on 26 September last year that he had provided full disclosure of all his records.  That is not true.  He did not include in a sworn affidavit details of the transfer of IR£50,000 to an account which his partner had opened for his benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Taoiseach's explanations of lodgements to his accounts over two years have been riddled with inconsistency and received with incredulity.  He changed his stories on lodgements as the tribunal's investigations uncovered more and more hard facts.  His explanations for critical lodgements are completely at odds with evidence available in bank documents.  His challenge to the tribunal's view that $45,000 was lodged has been blown away.  He agrees that five sterling transactions were memorable events yet he can remember no critical details.  Anybody who would change that amount for sterling or withdraw a cash amount of IR£50,000 would remember the day and the purpose for which it was intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">He told the tribunal he could have lodged money with a bank official whom he then admitted he had never met.  He told the Irish people on the Six One News last year that the money he had saved was gone, but he has admitted to the tribunal that when he first received £22,500 in December 1993 he already had £70,000.  His explanation for the so-called Manchester dinner is simply incredible.  He cannot identify the date, cannot remember who was there and there is no documentary evidence to support the notion that the event took place as he described it.  He told the Irish people he had fully co-operated with the tribunal but it is clear that he withheld critical information.  He told them that he freely co-operated with the tribunal but it is clear that the tribunal had to threaten him to secure co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">A recent opinion poll, for what it is worth, indicated that 32% of the Irish people believe the Taoiseach.  I wish those people were asked: "Which story do you believe?""Which version of these fairytales do you believe?"</p>

          <p eId="para_367">We know now what we did not know then, after he gave evidence under due process.  One year ago the Taoiseach's finances became the dominant political issue of the country.  Looking back at that period, especially with the benefit of the public disclosure of the forensic work of the Mahon tribunal, I am convinced that the convulsions which we went through counted for nothing.  Why?  Most of the events we were discussing never happened.  In my view, they are fictitious.  They are complicated stories, part of a web of complicated stories designed to mask hard facts, and constructed stories to fit known facts.  These facts are the lodgement into the Taoiseach's and Celia Larkin's accounts of the equivalent of €300,000 in today's terms, the bank documentation created at the time of the lodgements which point to lodgements of $45,000 dollars, £25,000 sterling, £20,000 sterling, £10,000 sterling — substantial sums of money — and the persistent failure of the Taoiseach to provide the tribunal with information on the source of these funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Instead we became besotted with stories about whip-arounds, after dinner presentations and, more recently, a bag of sterling to refurbish a virtually new house.  The Mahon tribunal will continue its work.  It will continue to treat the Taoiseach as he has asked to be treated, like every other citizen.  Its members and staff will continue their efforts to get to the truth behind the facts it has already uncovered.  However, the public interest and the protection of the reputation of the highest executive office of the land, the Office of the Taoiseach, demands that the charade that is currently being played out is ended now.  The Taoiseach's stories are threadbare, his evidence is invisible.  With blind loyalty his Ministers, Deputies Cowen, Ahern, Hanafin, Dempsey, Ó Cuív, Lenihan, Cullen, Brennan, Coghlan and O'Dea, have all been out foursquare behind him.  They nailed up their statement of standards and acceptance of this type of activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">What about the other Ministers in the Government?  We remember the slogan "Green politics is clean politics".  Now, Green politics is blind politics as Deputies Gormley, Ryan and Sargent adopt the standards we have come to associate with the Progressive Democrats.  Last year Deputy Sargent, a man of impeccable standards and principles, sat on this side of the House as an admirable man who week after week rose to his feet to excoriate Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach, in particular, for the lack of standards manifest in his taking of money.  He now sits behind the Taoiseach, his mind utterly changed having been seduced by the attraction of power.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Two decades ago a young woman in this House walked away from a political party and leader on the matter of standards.  She had the courage on much less evidence to take on the enormous personal risk of challenging the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  She was a woman with standards who stated she could not live with this, nor should her party.  Now it is silence of the lambs.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">In time the Mahon tribunal will come to its conclusions.  We now know that some of the criticisms made of the tribunal on its cost and the time it was taking are not down to the tribunal but to the individuals it was investigating.  It will reach a conclusion on whether specific allegations made are true.  We can and will wait for its verdict on those issues.  However, we must not wait — the office of the Taoiseach cannot wait — for the tribunal to report.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">The longer we fail to say the Taoiseach cannot be believed the more we damage the high office he holds, demean the profession of politics and increase the cynicism about politics, particularly among young people.  Let us be clear across all sides of the House that if we let the current charade continue, politics and political office will suffer as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I wish to make a broader point about this shabby affair to the House and beyond it to two groups, in particular, those concerned about the erosion of values in our society and those who see this entire issue as something which does not matter but is politics as usual, they are all the same and it is nothing to do with them.  Unlike the parties in government, namely, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats, I believe it is never right but always wrong to accept private moneys for personal use while wielding public power and holding high public office.  When one takes up high public office, one crosses a moral threshold.  Yes, one faces the same problems and traumas as the next person.  However, unlike the next person, one has power given to one by the people, one holds high public office and, therefore, a higher and better standard applies and must be seen to apply.  This is the privilege and the consequence and constrain of holding high office.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I live in the real world.  I recognise that there is a permissiveness and relativism, a new cult of "sure-who-gives-a-damn-once-I'm-alright-Jack" which makes the idea of morality something to be laughed at or even to be embarrassed about.  As parliamentarians we have a job and duty to rise above it.  Call me old-fashioned or behind the times but I believe as Members of this House we need to rehabilitate the word "morality".  If we do not lay down the strong foundations of what is acceptable and desirable behaviour in government, the country and society, who will?  In terms of the nation who will define and guide our better instincts?  Who will lead the debate on what is right and wrong, on being truthful and accountable at all times and on what is acceptable and unacceptable?  That debate, for the good of our future and all the people of our island, should include, if not be led by, the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, this is now an impossibility.  I do not want the children of this country to grow up where nothing is ever right or wrong, where all kinds of behaviour are tolerated and accepted and where the truth is not respected because everything falls into the cursed, convenient no-man's-land of permissiveness where anything will do because everything goes.  I know the Ireland that I want for my children and all the children of this country.  What we do about this mess as a Government, as Ministers, as parliamentarians and as a society will go a long way to deciding the kind of Ireland it will be.  We cannot underestimate the damage done to politics and the body politic by the Charles Haughey era and the saga concerning Ray Burke and the late Liam Lawlor.  We are now at it again.  People want to see a Taoiseach with full credibility when he speaks.  This is not the case because of the evidence he gave, the statements he made and the tales he told.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">At the start of my contribution I stated we should focus on three questions.  Was the Taoiseach right to take large sums of money for personal use?  My answer is that he was wrong.  Did the Taoiseach fully and freely co-operate with the Mahon tribunal?  My answer is that he did not.  Has the Taoiseach told the truth, the full truth and nothing but the truth to the people, the Dáil and the Mahon tribunal?  My answer is that he has not.  Taking all of these circumstances into account, I move the motion that Dáil Éireann has no confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">It gives me no pleasure to speak to the motion.  I entered politics and sought election to this House because I hold firm convictions about the type of country I want Ireland to be.  I have many political differences with the Taoiseach and his party because I have a different view of what Irish society can be.  I would far rather debate those matters of policy and principle than conduct and character.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I acknowledge the contribution the Taoiseach has made to public life and have no desire or intention of taking any interest in his, or anybody else's, personal affairs.  It is the Taoiseach's own actions which made the motion necessary.  Let us be clear why he faces a motion of confidence today.  One year ago information came into the public domain about his personal finances and transactions being investigated by the Mahon tribunal.  He came to the House and offered a strange account of moneys received in Manchester and Dublin.  He indicated his firm intention of accounting for himself at the tribunal and appealed for the time and opportunity to do so.  No one was more eager than he, he then claimed, for the opportunity to account for himself at the tribunal.  He appealed for the sympathy of the nation, claiming these transactions occurred at a difficult time in his life.  In large measure he received that sympathy and he was given that time.  He was given that time also by the Opposition parties in this House.  I note with some irony that he seeks to criticise the fairness he was shown throughout all that period.  Last April, when more information appeared, he again said that he would explain all to the tribunal.  Throughout the election campaign, he constantly repeated the statement that he would explain all to the tribunal.  We gave him that opportunity often in the face of criticism.  We gave him the time and we waited for the explanation.  However, the explanation is not credible.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">We have had four days of evidence at the tribunal and the Taoiseach's story is simply not believable.  The Taoiseach came into the House today and read from a script that has not been circulated.  He spoke with great authority about many aspects of the matters on which he was questioned at the tribunal.  As I sat here listening to it, I was struck by his authority, his conviction, the detail, the way in which he was able to navigate his way around the jungle of fact.  I am glad that his memory has recovered because when he was asked questions about these matters last week, he seemed to have a far less good recollection of those events.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">It appears that the transactions discussed here last year were only part of a broader picture.  The evidence last week focused on no fewer than five transactions involving large amounts of foreign currency in a 13-month period between 1994 and 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">It transpires that far from being eager to appear at the tribunal, the Taoiseach was often delaying and frustrating its work.  It transpires that the total amount of moneys under discussion in these transactions comes to almost €300,000 in today's terms.  These are substantial sums of money for which the Taoiseach cannot credibly account.  Therein lies the kernel of the problem, his failure to offer a credible account.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">After 18 hours in the witness box, giving sworn testimony, the Taoiseach has not offered a believable account of these transactions.  After 18 hours of testimony, over four days, there are few who believe him.  I do not believe him.  I do not believe many of his own Deputies believe him and the public do not believe him either.  I repeat that, after 18 hours of sworn testimony given in front of a panel of three judges, there is still no credible account of transactions involving large sums of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The people have a large reserve of common decency.  They will insist on fair play and they will give a man time to account for himself.  They also have a large reserve of common sense.  They do not believe the bizarre and shifting tales that have been offered, of a former Minister for Finance who deals in briefcases full of currency, of men he never met before who suddenly give him cash, of wads of foreign currency, of trips to banks where the clerks do not count the money or at least do not count it in front of one but take it into a back room and produce a piece of paper stating that was what was in the bag in the first place and asking one to sign it.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I do not believe the Taoiseach can tell RTE and the Dáil precisely how much money he received by way of a goodwill loan from each of several named donors in Drumcondra, that he has a signed acknowledgment to that effect from each of them, that he repaid the loans with interest calculated precisely on the figures he says he received and that he can repeat the same story to the tribunal but, when facts and figures have to be checked to see whether they tally with the record, he can now say that in fact neither he nor anyone else ever counted the money and it may have been something quite different.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I do not believe there is any possible explanation for the Taoiseach telling RTE and the Irish people that, at the time he was receiving dig-outs and whip-arounds, his £50,000 in savings was gone.  He is happy to tell the tribunal that his partner lodged that £50,000 in cash savings in an account in her own name on 5 December 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I do not believe the Taoiseach can say he is certain he acquired £30,000 in sterling, in order to return it in one lump sum to Michael Wall, without even the vaguest recollection as to which bank he bought it in, whether he bought it in one lump sum or a series of smaller amounts — or even whether he bought it himself or asked a team of others to do so for him.  The Taoiseach has always professed to be a man of modest means — he is — and a man of public service, as are most of us in this House.  That is why we find it so incredible that if somebody gave one £30,000, one would not remember the circumstances in which one got it, that one would not recall the day one went to a bank to withdraw a sum of money which would have bought one a house at that time.  That is simply incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I do not believe anyone, no matter what their line of business, travels overseas with £30,000 in cash, leaves it in a hotel wardrobe while they go out on the town and then delivers that amount to a private couple, for domestic purposes, without any one of the parties being in the slightest bit surprised, thinking anything was otherwise than normal or even bothering to check how much cash was in the bag in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I do not believe that he cannot tell us the date of the mystery dinner in Manchester, yet he cannot identify anyone who attended the dinner except for one man who is deceased and the man who did not eat the dinner because he was driving the bus.  This is from a man who claimed on the "Late Late Show" in 1998 that one of his strengths and best attributes was a good memory.  The people have a large reserve of humour, but they will not be taken for fools.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The reality is that the Taoiseach, far from co-operating with the tribunal, delayed it.  His statement today was that of course he made discovery.  That is not the issue.  The matter at the tribunal was not the fact that he made discovery, but whether the discovery included all of the material.  We know from the evidence given at the tribunal that an attempt was made by the Taoiseach's lawyers, presumably on his instruction, to limit the time to which discovery was applied to the time that he says he did not have a bank account and that a second attempt was made to limit the discovery to amounts of lodgements and money which were above the amount of lodgements that we know were actually made.  The reality is that the Taoiseach has changed and rechanged his story, explaining the explanations in an attempt to explain away what few records exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">There were many strange things happening in the Irish banking system in the 1980s and 1990s but one thing they did was count the cash at the end of the night and keep records of currency transactions.  We can stay here all night and into the morning, poring over the detail of the Taoiseach's finances.  That is not the issue.  The issue is his failure to offer a credible account of himself and the political consequences that flow from that failure.  The issue is that he is not believed.  The issue for this House is what do we do when the Taoiseach's sworn evidence, at a tribunal established by this House, is not believed by the Members and not believed by the general public.  That goes to the essence of the trust and confidence that is required for a Taoiseach to continue to hold office.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The Constitution gives this House the duty of electing a Taoiseach and of holding him or her to account.  We cannot shirk that duty and we cannot subcontract it out to any tribunal.  It is for each of the 166 Deputies to discharge that public duty in this public forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">It is the function of the tribunal to investigate the facts and to report, but it is the duty of this House to decide who should and should not be Taoiseach.  Those who are suggesting that we should leave it to the tribunal are playing for time.  They are at best seeking to postpone for their own political convenience the decisions which we are constitutionally obliged to make.  They are seeking to contract out to three tribunal judges the political judgment which Members of this House are obliged to exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">How can we have a situation where the leader of a Government has given 18 hours of sworn evidence in front of three judges which the people do not believe?  How can we have a situation where the Taoiseach's credibility has been shredded and where his word is not believed?  How can we have a situation where the leader of a Government is known to have taken large sums of money from a person or persons unknown — unknown because he cannot say credibly from where the money came?  Apparently, he no longer remembers.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">As the Taoiseach said in this House during the debate on the McCracken report, "The tribunal stresses a point I have repeatedly emphasised, that public representatives must not be under a personal financial obligation to anyone."  How can we have a situation where the Taoiseach's motives are at least open to question because he received large sums of money for which he will not account?  Was Mr. Wall just a friend in need and an admirer, or the owner of a bus company offering bus services in the liberalised UK market when liberalisation of the Irish bus market was under active consideration by the Government?  I do not know and I cannot know because the Taoiseach has failed to offer a believable account.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The Taoiseach claims that the only issue on which he should be answerable to the tribunal is the allegation that he received money from Owen O'Callaghan.  That is not so.  The Taoiseach himself, speaking in the Dáil in 1997, said: "The Government considers that following the money trail is the most efficient and effective way to progress this type of inquiry as witnessed by the great success of the Dunnes payments tribunal which adopted this approach."  If a tribunal is to investigate an allegation of corruption it must follow the money trail and the person being investigated must offer a credible account of where large sums of money have come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">No doubt Government Deputies of all parties, will come into the House and say that none of this matters, that the Taoiseach is a public servant, that he does not have a lavish lifestyle and that what they claim are his successes in Government mean that his financial dealings should be ignored.  I do not dispute that he had achievements or his record of public service.  However, neither do I accept that these provide a blanket dispensation from the requirements imposed on holders of public office.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">John Adams, the second president of the United States, said: "A free people has an indisputable, unalienable, indefeasible, divine right to that most dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the character and conduct of our leaders."  This State was founded by men and women who knew the meaning of public service.  In the turbulent times that gave birth to an independent Ireland, the founders of the State knew privation of all kinds.  That first generation, which built the State, was driven by the ethic of public service.  It embraced the principle, developed across Europe in the 19th century that true democracy requires true public service.  It requires that people in public life will act in the public interest.  If we are to have Government of the people by the people, then the people must know that those who exercise power do so entirely for the people and not on behalf of any private interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The people who founded this State, many of whose heirs are still Members of this House, knew and understood that principle.  However, when that generation retired, a new and less savoury element entered Irish politics.  The men in mohair suits contained within their ranks those who saw public life as a route to private gain.  The great principles of civic republicanism, where the republic is governed in the interests of all the people, were eroded.  The culture of public service was polluted by a culture of greed.  I am not just referring to the people who we now know took money.  I am also referring to those who turned a blind eye.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Taoiseach enunciated the doctrine of the blind eye, when he spoke at the funeral of his late leader, former Deputy Haughey.  His theory is that the normal standards do not apply to the special few.  However, the basis of a democracy is that there is no special few.  Instead, the obligations imposed on those in public life are rightly greater than on private citizens.  What is the motivation behind that eulogy and what of the motivation of other Ministers?  Why have so many senior Ministers, who must know that the Taoiseach's account is not credible, continued to defend the indefensible?</p>
          <p eId="para_404">This debate is not just about the money that one man was given or why.  There is a great principle at stake here: the principle on which democratic governance in a free society is founded.  I had understood that the Progressive Democrats were founded on those principles.  I had understood that democracy mattered to the Green Party.  I read with incredulity the interview that Deputy Cuffe, my constituency colleague, gave to a morning newspaper this morning in which he stated that there was no point in the Green Party pursuing this matter because Fianna Fáil would not listen to it.  While I know that certain compromises must be made by a smaller party in a coalition government, I had not expected that the Greens would have turned yellow quite so quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Where now are the fulminations of the Green Party Deputies about corruption in Fianna Fáil that we heard with such regularity in the last Dáil?  Deputies Sargent and Gormley were particularly prone to exciting themselves on this issue.  During the general election campaign the Green Party frequently repeated its determination to clean up politics.  None of that, it would appear, matters today.  It cannot but be a source of deep regret to those of us who support progressive politics and standards in public life that the Green Party should have sold out so comprehensively and so quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">However, they cannot hide — neither the Green Party, nor the Progressive Democrats, nor those in Fianna Fáil who adhere to the principles of the founders of their party.  Deputies in those parties cannot hide behind the tribunal and must take responsibility for assessing the suitability of the Taoiseach to remain in office.  Deputies cannot hide behind the ideal that these are the private affairs of a private man.  The credibility of the Taoiseach is a matter of public importance.  They cannot hide behind his record — we all acknowledge his record.  However, there are records in the Allied Irish Bank for which he cannot account and so his credibility is shredded.  They cannot hide either from the scrutiny of people beyond these shores, who will look at how we, the elected representatives of the people of Ireland, deal with this matter.  In a global economy they will look to the standards of probity that are applied here today and form their own conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Members of this House, and in particular of the Government parties, cannot delude themselves.  There is a duty to act.  Sooner or later they all will act.  Yesterday I was struck by a comment by one of the Taoiseach's defenders that Fianna Fáil does not do resignations.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">Members of the Green Party, of the Progressive Democrats and of Fianna Fáil have a duty to ensure that the country has a Taoiseach in whom this House and the people can have confidence, and whom they believe.  This is an important decision for the House and I hope that if not Fianna Fáil, at least the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and the Independents who support the Government will do their duty and vote with the Opposition on the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">To correct the record of the House, the person who said that Fianna Fáil does not do resignations is Deputy Kenny and I thank him for his support.  Speaking on radio today Deputy Kenny advanced three reasons for proposing this motion.  First, he stated baldly as an established fact that the Taoiseach did not co-operate with the tribunal, which is wrong.</p>

There is no question of non-co-operation with the tribunal — there is no finding of non-co-operation.  The tribunal has not accused the Taoiseach of not co-operating or even of delaying the tribunal.  In fact the reverse is the case.  That claim by Deputy Kenny is simply wrong and untruthful, and should be withdrawn.  On several occasions Judge Mahon has stated at each of the Taoiseach's appearances before the tribunal that the co-operation the Taoiseach has given the tribunal is not an issue.  The Taoiseach has put an enormous effort into complying with the very many requests made of him by the tribunal, about which there is no issue.</p>

I find it impossible to understand how it can regard and treat a general trawl in public into the Taoiseach's life as a definite matter of immediate public importance.  I remind the House of the Supreme Court decision in Fitzwilton <i>v</i>. Mahon.  It ruled that the tribunal had been in breach of its own terms of reference in making its decision on its J2 list and that it had no jurisdiction to inquire into matters on that list.  Despite the Opposition’s claims, the J2 list is not a red herring.  The Taoiseach became aware in July that the tribunal had made a decision on 1 May 2005 to go to public hearing on any matters whatsoever concerning him, with no limit on any allegation or subject matter.  This is a wholly unprecedented decision which appears to have allowed a general trawl in public into all aspects of the Taoiseach’s life from cradle to the grave.</p>

I make these observations, not in an effort to disrupt or hinder the work of the tribunal or to attack it, as has been suggested, but merely in an attempt to restore a sense of proportion to the exaggerated and incorrect analysis we have witnessed in the past few weeks and to counter the misinformation and misrepresentation being peddled, mainly by Opposition Members.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">Deputies Kenny and Gilmore have outlined in great detail the reasons the Taoiseach is unfit for office.  Therefore, I would like to address the other Government parties which intend to support Fianna Fáil on the motion.  Their capitulation to the larger party, emboldened in recent months by the Progressive Democrats wipe-out and the Green Party's sell out, will be complete if they trudge obediently through the Government lobby and vote for and accept low standards in high places.  There was a political time when low standards in high places were important to Fianna Fáil, particularly in the 1980s when such standards were the subject of much debate and led to the establishment of the Progressive Democrats, as Des O'Malley and the late George Colley led the charge against Mr. Haughey.  However, that party effectively no longer exists.  Many in the party are embarking on an exercise in soul searching to identify where they can go but we all know they are going nowhere.  They should fold the tent rather than allow a lingering political death to continue.  If anyone wonders why that is, they only need examine examples of total political cowardice such as we are witnessing today as an explanation.  The indecision of the Progressive Democrats on issues such as the truth and political standards came to an abrupt end with Michael McDowell's defeat last May when he ceased to be the legal and political adviser to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The Green Party is setting out on the same political route to oblivion.  Its Members will be squeezed and politically suffocated by their friends in Fianna Fáil if they decide to support motions such as the one before us.  However, Planet Bertie, to borrow a phrase from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, is a strange place and the Green Party has found itself in office.  However, being in office does not by any means mean being in power.  The Greens self-serving decision to go into power has resulted in 100 days of policies abandoned, priorities ignored and principles jettisoned — in other words, total submission to Fianna Fáil.  I refer to its record over a few short months.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">As the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will be aware, 91% of communications pledges in the programme for Government come directly from the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  The section on energy contains commitments taken from the same manifesto, with none from the Green Party.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has opposed an incineration motion identical to one he presented last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The Green Party has completely reversed its opposition to the co-location of hospitals.  Its being in government has led to delusions of adequacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, limped home in Dublin South-East and almost lost his seat yet again.  He occasionally gives the impression that he is a political force.  The stranger members of the Green Party, of which there are a few, have even sought to perpetuate the myth that the Minister was responsible for the downfall of the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell.  Deputy Creighton, the Fine Gael representative from Dublin South-East, may offer a different version of events.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I wish to make crystal clear what the Green Party, as well as the Progressive Democrats, will support today if they back Fianna Fáil.  When the Taoiseach was asked by the tribunal if he were to attend an Irish function now similar to the famous Manchester dinner — an event which now looks as if it never happened — and be offered an envelope with a large sum of money, he did not say he would absolutely not accept it.  He did not say it would be wrong or inappropriate for a Minister to do so.  His reply was "Now you can't".  He went on to say he may have then, if there were similar circumstances, before all the new rules were introduced.  He probably would have.  That is the ethical standard the Green Party sees fit to support.  It is not the belief that it is wrong to take money which is stopping him accepting wads of cash in brown envelopes but rather the rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">In recent days the former Green Party leader, Deputy Sargent, has asked what has changed since the general election which has brought Fine Gael to move a motion of no confidence.  I will tell him.  In mid May he was describing the Taoiseach as a dead man walking.  The Taoiseach stated he had co-operated fully with the tribunal and given it all the explanations required.  We now know that was not true.  When Deputy Sargent was in the National Botanic Gardens getting assurances before forming a Government, he was giving statements along the lines that the Taoiseach certainly would not let him down, that he had no reason to distrust the Taoiseach and that he believed him to be a man of his word.  The evidence to suggest otherwise is clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Truth is the key.  The Green Party knows the mantra of letting the tribunal do its work no longer washes.  I ask the party and its Deputies to consider such matters before they cast their votes on the motion.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_484">On a day such as this, when we are debating a Taoiseach who tells incredible stories and uses language which ordinary people can barely, if ever, understand, it is worth quoting another famous Dubliner with a certain facility for language.  Joyce told us history was a nightmare from which we must seek to awake.  It seems Fianna Fáil is showing no signs of awakening from the nightmare of the cash culture and the debasing of politics we witnessed during the long Haughey era.  Large sums of cash are taken for private use; there is stonewalling of a tribunal set up to investigate such matters and a procession of Ministers defending the indefensible.  All-comers, including the media, Opposition parties and the tribunal are under attack from Fianna Fáil Ministers who insist on looking the other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Who are we talking about today?  Is it the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, or the current Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern?  What we are witnessing today is history repeating itself.  Every Fianna Fáil Minister has now signed up to the version of events presented by the Taoiseach over four days in the witness stand at the Mahon tribunal.  These are the same Ministers who stood before television cameras and radio microphones 12 months ago and stated a Minister for Finance taking large sums of cash for personal use was okay.  Apparently, there is nothing wrong with it.  At least we can say the acceptance by these Ministers of the incredible stories told in Dublin Castle this week is consistent with their acceptance of low standards last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">What is every Fianna Fáil Minister signing up to?  They are subscribing to a new standard in high office which accepts the lodgement of the equivalent of €300,000 in cash to the accounts of the Taoiseach over a two-year period.  It accepts a constantly changing version of events as to the origin of these moneys as the tribunal established new facts surrounding the massive lodgements.  They are signing up to accepting less than full co-operation with the inquiries of a tribunal, when we have seen that the Taoiseach was fully aware of the massive lodgements which interested the tribunal fully two years before he disclosed the information in private session.  This cash culture within Fianna Fáil reached its peak in the Haughey years and is clearly still evident within the party today.  If no Minister is prepared to state taking huge sums of money for personal use is wrong and, worse again, that the incredible stories being offered up by the Taoiseach in Dublin Castle are to be believed, we can say with certainty that absolutely no lesson has been learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">This is not an isolated rogue incident involving an individual down on his luck.  This is not a cautionary tale about modern life and marriage breakdown.  This is a story about standards in public office and complying with the work of a tribunal.  It is the story of a former Minister for Finance and the current Taoiseach telling stories under oath that are simply unbelievable.  It is a story of Fianna Fáil Ministers stating nothing is wrong, that a good man is being hounded, that black is white and white is black.  Years after Haughey we have a mostly different cast but we are getting the same script.  Instead of principle we get vitriol.  Instead of honesty we get dishonesty.  Instead of acceptance of wrong-doing we get sustained, discredited attack.  The dishonesty in accepting the unacceptable is matched by the dishonesty of the defence of the indefensible.  It takes several forms.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">One allegation is that the tribunal has failed to address the original allegations from Mr. Gilmartin regarding Mr. O'Callaghan's alleged payments.  This is a complete falsehood.  On the first day in the witness box tribunal lawyers put it to the Taoiseach that their investigations into large cash lodgements were a direct consequence of them pursuing the Gilmartin allegations involving sums of £30,000 and £50,000.  These amounts appear in the Taoiseach's finances.  I note the Taoiseach accepted this to be a reasonable line of inquiry.  The O'Callaghan name was mentioned 67 times on the opening day of the Taoiseach's testimony.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Another argument is that these matters are all related to a very difficult time for the Taoiseach and concern his marriage break-up.  The Taoiseach separated from his wife in 1987 and had been in a new relationship for several years before the cash lodgements under investigation occurred.  The legal separation was finalised in November 1993, before any of the lodgements under investigation took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Another argument is that the Taoiseach has co-operated fully with the work of the tribunal but that it is dragging on, meaning he will be an old man before it is finished.  This is complete and utter rubbish.</p>

Following the IRA ceasefire, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, did all the groundwork leading up to the decision made by the European Council at Essen on 9 and 10 December 1994 to establish the peace and reconciliation funds to be concentrated in the 12 Border counties, particularly those in Northern Ireland.  The amount paid through these funds will, by 2013, amount to over €1.8 billion, of which over €1.3 billion will have come from the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">In an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i>, published on 14 December 1994 and given on the occasion of his leaving office, Deputy Bertie Ahern pointed out that the new Government would inherit the healthiest public finances for 27 years, with the first current budget surplus since 1967.  At the time, a new partnership agreement, the PCW, had come into force.  This was opposed by Fine Gael when in opposition——</p>

          <p eId="para_507">During some of the period under examination by the tribunal, in addition to preparatory work on Estimates and the budget, the then Minister for Finance had already been elected party leader, was supervising detailed negotiations for government and did not have a great deal of time in which to attend to his personal affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Since that time, the Taoiseach, who returned to office in 1997, has given outstanding service.  This fact was recognised by the electorate when he was recently returned to power for the third time, something that has not happened since the days of Eamon de Valera.  There has been a large measure of industrial peace in recent years, which dates back to the Taoiseach's time as Minister for Labour.  The Taoiseach achieved consensual reform of industrial relations legislation and has been a key figure behind social partnership since 1987.  The Taoiseach has presided over an economy of which earlier patriots and political leaders could only dream, with unemployment banished, emigration reversed, taxes cut, welfare improved and huge infrastructural improvements that are steadily becoming more visible.  His style of leadership is that he identifies problems, patiently works on them with colleagues, advisers — civil servants and others — and, with a minimum of public grandstanding, tries to build a consensus behind what needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I wish to refer now to the historic achievement of the peace process.  The Taoiseach restored the IRA ceasefire, negotiated the Good Friday Agreement — which is not only a political settlement but also a peace settlement — and oversaw its implementation.  The Agreement is at last working as it should.  It was a difficult process but if one considers events elsewhere across the globe, it is evident that there are not many equally successful peace processes.  The Taoiseach enjoyed an historic collaboration with Tony Blair who, when leaving office, stated that of all leaders of other countries, Deputy Bertie Ahern was the one with whom he had the closest relationship.  The Taoiseach kept in touch with all the parties involved and the peace process and his achievements in respect of it are deeply appreciated throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The Taoiseach also oversaw Ireland's Presidency of the EU, which President Chirac described as the best one ever.  There is no doubt that Ireland's standing around the world has never been higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">There has also been a political achievement.  The Taoiseach has led two coalition Governments that remained in office for their full terms.  In 2002 he opted for stability rather than maximising short-term party advantage and the same was done on the most recent occasion.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">It is understandable that, facing into a further five years in opposition, Fine Gael and the Labour Party would like to overturn the result of the recent election and destabilise one of the most popular Taoisigh ever.  There is no adequate explanation as to why, if they felt this way previously, they did not take a stronger line, except that the people would not have liked it.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">As far as the tribunal is concerned, if one employs a dog to bark, one should not bark oneself.  Taoisigh and Governments, present and future, should respect the separation of powers and not press the override button.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">As has been pointed out, Fine Gael has not won an election in 25 years and it is seeking instead a repeat of the <i>deus ex machina</i> — something similar to the article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, relating to an obscure legal point, which succeeded in dislodging the Government that was to have been formed on Monday, 5 December 1994.  The said article showed that, for obscure legal reasons which did not subsequently stack up, Fianna Fáil was unfit for office.</p>

I do not buy that and neither do most people.  There is no evidence that the Taoiseach was motivated by personal gain.  He has been obliged to face a great deal of hearsay evidence, a choice specimen of which was repeated in Dublin Castle earlier today.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">Like previous speakers, I wish to recognise the immense contribution made by Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach during the past ten years.  I agree with Deputy Mansergh in one respect only, namely, that the Taoiseach's contribution to the peace process has been extraordinary.  As I stated repeatedly in the Upper House during my five-year term there, we must recognise the Taoiseach's contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Be that as it may, however, we are faced with a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach of this country.  In that respect, the issue is bigger than the person who occupies the office of Taoiseach.  The issue relates to standards in public office and whether people believe the version of events that Deputy Bertie Ahern has related to the tribunal and placed in the public domain.  If the people do not believe the version of events — it is my opinion that they do not — put forward by the Taoiseach, there is only one course of action for him to take and that is for him to resign.  Failing that, it is the constitutional responsibility of the Opposition to table a motion of confidence in Deputy Bertie Ahern.  That is what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I wish to deal first with one of the issues raised by Deputy Mansergh, who referred to the separation of powers.  Let us be clear about this.  A tribunal of inquiry is not a separate court of the land.  A tribunal is an animal of the House, it reports to the House, it is provided with its functions by the House and it is caused by the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I was very interested to hear the bleatings from the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, who said we should leave the tribunals alone and give them the space and time to report.  The Fianna Fáil benches did not give that opportunity to the late Deputy Liam Lawlor whose circumstances were such that they demanded his resignation on the evidence that came to light at the tribunal at the time.  There is a certain changing of the guard and the argument made by the benches opposite tonight to suit their particular circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The problem is this.  Someone walks into the office and plops down £30,000 in sterling and punts, as I understand it, in front of the former Minister for Finance and soon to be leader of his great party, an accountant and a person of standing who knows what cash means to Revenue and the economy and this does not sound alarm bells in his mind.  He does not see a problem and puts the money in a safe.  I submit that this is a problem of credibility as the people, despite all the bleatings of the Deputies opposite, know full well.  The people have lost confidence in the Taoiseach.  The real problem is had this been known at the time about Charles Haughey or an allegation been made against former Deputy Albert Reynolds, they would have been gone by 5 p.m.  The reason, in the words of the former manager of Chelsea Football Club who thinks he is something special, this politician believes he does not have to account in the same way is that he is, of course, hugely popular, as we all know.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It is time to bring this issue to a head.  In respect of whether the Opposition dealt with this matter properly or well in the past 12 months, the jury is possibly still out on that subject.  We may well have done things differently.  Perhaps we did not do the right thing at the right time but this is the time, following the evidence, testimony, cross-examination and incredible explanations given, to cause the motion to be moved and put it to a vote in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">Normally I welcome the opportunity to debate a motion.  Tonight I do not have that opportunity as it is a shame the Taoiseach's behaviour has necessitated the moving of this motion of no confidence.  I share my party leader's sentiments in acknowledging the work the Taoiseach has done in the last ten years, in much of which he had the co-operation of Fine Gael.  It is right and proper that good work is acknowledged and I have no problem in doing so but it is equally important that the opposite is exposed, otherwise this House has no purpose and the notion of democracy in this country amounts to a fallacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Many in Fianna Fáil who have rushed to the Taoiseach's defence in recent days, believing their press office spin, have said the tribunal has ruled out making any charge of non co-operation against the Taoiseach.  Clearly, this is not the case.  In legal terms, the Taoiseach faces adverse findings that he has failed to co-operate adequately with the tribunal.  Furthermore, it is open to it to declare that his testimony is unreliable and find in respect of the moneys lodged to his accounts over a two-year period, representing over three times his annual income, that there is no satisfactory explanation from him.  It may draw inferences from this.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">In political terms, the Taoiseach has made various statements in the Dáil and in public which are at variance with what he has stated to the tribunal.  He is accountable to the House.  He has not explained his ever-changing story of how he came by, in today's values, €300,000 in the two-year period 1994 to 1995.  The tribunal outlined in its hearings the extent of the Taoiseach's lack of co-operation with its inquiries, the failure to disclose a lodgement of £50,000 to an account for his benefit, his failure to disclose that he had personally received £30,000 from Michael Wall and to indicate other lodgements and withdrawals, including the alleged purchase of £30,000 sterling.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Ten years ago this month in the Dáil the Taoiseach said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_539">It is unacceptable that people who have held high office and enjoyed a high degree of public trust should give evidence that is, in the words of the tribunal, unacceptable and untrue or deliberately conceal vital information from this House, or from a tribunal set up by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">There is no excuse for this. How little we have moved on in a decade.  Last year he publicly stated he had supplied extensive material freely to the tribunal.  In an interview for "Six One News" on RTE he said "I had to give full discovery of all my records."  In the Dáil he said "I provided all documentation requested and had no difficulty with that."  In his public statement of 13 May he said "The Tribunal has come back to me at various points and asked me to explain particular transactions in my bank accounts.  I provided those explanations."  We now know the tribunal did not accept that these statements represented the true position.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The failure of the highest political figure in the land, bar the President, to co-operate with a tribunal of inquiry established by the Oireachtas is surely a very serious matter.  Desperate for something positive to latch onto in the past week, Fianna Fáil Ministers appear to have drawn comfort from statements from Judge Mahon on the issue of co-operation but they should read the transcripts in full.  The position was set out by counsel for the tribunal on Friday, 14 September, a position with which Judge Mahon did not disagree, when, in respect of the failure to disclose the lodgement of £50,000, he stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_542">It may be that it represents a breach of the discovery obligation.  And in the event that it does, I'm suggesting that that is a matter which is open to the Tribunal to find at some stage when all the evidence as to what the circumstances surrounding this lodgement were.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The changes in the Taoiseach's evidence in the last week raise the question of whether he even co-operated with the tribunal in its public hearings.  The many changes in his evidence may at times seem amusing but it is those very changes which undermine his credibility.  Nothing illustrates his insincerity and his dealings with the tribunal more than the paragraph in a letter from his solicitor to the tribunal which states "Mr. Ahern does not accept that any of Miss Larkin's accounts were operated for his benefit".  At the same time as his lawyer was writing to the tribunal, the Taoiseach was telling the people that Ms Larkin had opened an account into which he had transferred £50,000 to go towards the refurbishment of the house he rented from Mr. Wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The Taoiseach spoke about recollections.  We have heard much about mistakes of recollection, partial recollection and mature recollection from Fianna Fáil and there will be a final analysis of this one too.  The Taoiseach described his banking transactions and personal life as unorthodox.  His personal life is of no interest to me and no one in Fine Gael has attempted to drag it into this mire.  He made that choice himself and we have still not risen to the bait.  What I find almost mind-blowingly incredulous is that we in this House and the public are expected to believe someone could receive the equivalent of €300,000 and cannot explain in an even semi-coherent fashion where the money came from.  How out of touch is the Taoiseach that he treats such a massive amount of money in that manner?  The same is true of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea.  It is simply not believable that an explanation cannot be given.</p>

There is no ordinary man who would not remember how he received such a sum, what denomination it was in or where he lodged it.  Any ordinary man would be able to tell the time, date and probably what he had had for breakfast on the morning he lodged such a significant sum of money.  One thing is certain: the ordinary man would have looked into the case.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak to the motion.  I have known the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, for the best part of 20 years and made a judgment call on him 20 years ago.  I believed him to be a fresh wind blowing through our political party.  I viewed him as being a distinctly different person and character to the people who had gone before him.  For that reason, I chose to join Fianna Fáil, to become active in politics and put my name before the public for election in the general election of 1997.  I formed that judgment of the Taoiseach 20 years ago and I am delighted to say to the House my character judgment of him has been vindicated.  I venture to say he has exceeded the expectations of almost everybody who supported him 20 years ago and particularly in the past ten years.  Nobody expected when he became leader of our party that he would do the enormous things he has done.  It is not an exaggeration to state, as Deputy Mansergh did, that he is the most significant Taoiseach and leader this country has had since independence.  In co-operation with coalition parties not of the same political persuasion, he has created an undoubted atmosphere of peace and prosperity which is unrivalled and the envy of many other countries.  The former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair; the former US President, Bill Clinton; and Reverend Ian Paisley have spoken volubly about the character, commitment, ability and talent of the Taoiseach in bringing people together and nurturing peace and prosperity.  That is why the Opposition is annoyed and we have a panicky no confidence motion.  It is panicky because the Opposition failed to impress the electorate when these issues emerged last October and during the maelstrom of the recent general election.  It is clear the Opposition wanted to raise the issues then but was fearful of doing so.  It simply did not have the nerve.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Deputy Brian Hayes was honest enough to admit there may be a competency issue at the heart of the Opposition.  It made a mess of these matters and did not raise them effectively.  No one within or outside the House can claim that the substance of the issues of which the Taoiseach stands accused was not raised over four weeks last October or in the most transparent way possible, namely, during the general election campaign.  From October last year onwards the public willingly gave its increased support to Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach in the full knowledge of what happened during his marital breakdown in 1993.  No Member can claim the public did not know then what it now knows from the evidence before the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">We have an incompetent Opposition which remains panicky about facing 15 arid years in opposition.  This is because of its incompetence and the confidence the people have placed in the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The people attribute honesty and trust to him in how he conducts his personal and political affairs.  That is the electorate's judgment call.  The public had ample opportunity to examine, in detail, every aspect of the Taoiseach's finances since October 2006.  It, like me 20 years ago, made a judgment call on this man and decided he is an honest man.  The Opposition parties are arrogant.  Are they suggesting the public was mistaken and should have elected Fine Gael and the Labour Party to be the next Government?  At least Deputy Pat Rabbitte had the nobility to acknowledge he failed and resigned as party leader.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">His successor, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, chooses to lecture us about finances and the receipt of moneys.  Yet, he is the direct beneficiary of massive amounts of moneys from the most barbarous regime ever invented, that which obtained in Soviet Russia.  This matter has never been explored and Deputy Gilmore has never been transparent about it.  He is also the leader who boasted that when he left the Workers' Party, he destroyed all records related to his time in that party by burning them in his back garden.  If Deputy Bertie Ahern did that to his records, he would have to resign as Taoiseach.  If he claimed he could not furnish the tribunal with all the details of his personal finances and his marital breakdown settlement, people would ask serious questions.  If that were the case, I do not believe he would be in the Chamber this evening answering honestly and openly to every question put to him about this terrible period in his life.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">The manner in which the House is dealing with this matter highlights the death of any charitable instinct in the Opposition parties.  I do not believe any Member, least of all myself, could remember after 14 years detailed transactions in his or her personal finances, particularly in the fevered atmosphere following a difficult and turbulent marriage breakdown.  There is no point in the Opposition skirting around this issue and talking about credibility.  Where is the credibility of an Opposition which had the opportunity to raise these matters but failed to do so?  It has been publicly criticised for this and Deputy Brian Hayes has acknowledged it was incompetent in dealing with the matters when they arose last October and during the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Deputy Bertie Ahern is the same man I supported 20 years ago.  The remarkable secret of his longevity and success in the political system is that he is exactly the same man he was 20 years ago.  He has not changed because of success and achievement.  What one sees is what one gets.  I accept he is not the perfect memory man like Jimmy Magee and cannot remember who won the FA Cup final in 1924 or 1954.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">The House seldom debates a motion of this kind, particularly so soon into the parliamentary term after an election.  An election is when the foundation of our democracy utters its opinion.  Some Government Members have asked why the Opposition is doing this now as much of what is now known was known before the general election.  That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Opposition Members do not have a tribunal's capacity to cross-examine other Members.  We certainly do not have 18 hours to do so.  If we did, perhaps we would have got from the former Deputy, Ray Burke, the answers which were ultimately extracted from him in the tribunal.  The sense of sympathy which I felt at the time for the man would have been replaced with a sense of outrage at the way in which he behaved.  To suggest this side of the House is being opportunistic, devious or incompetent in not raising these matters last September is to ignore utterly the facts that have now entered the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The facts are, as Deputy Gilmore has simply said, that the Taoiseach's account of the money trail is unbelievable.  Not that there is proof that money was given by certain individuals to names already in the public domain, but quite simply that this account of the money trail is unbelievable.  That is the unanimous view of commentators and those who have had the patience and the time to listen through it.  It is also, according to the most recent opinion poll, the view of the public in so far as this can be measured.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">What is the obligation on the Opposition in this House in these circumstances?  I believe we had no choice but to put down a motion of no confidence.  We would be derelict in our duty if we did not so do.  This is important because the very foundation on which democracy rests is that the people trust the politicians, that we are elected because we can be trusted.  In any country which drifts away from that fundamental relationship, the basis of democracy is eroded along with its credibility.  As we have seen in countries which have lost those standards and that relationship with the people, for whatever reason, the damage is virtually impossible to repair.  If this was any other country in the European Union, the Prime Minister of the day would by now be sitting on the backbenches.  There is no doubt in my mind that the standards we expect from other member states in the European Union, if applied here would, in fact, bring about that result.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">As someone who has known the Taoiseach for very many years, I acknowledge that his historical contribution to this country is not in dispute.  The speech that Deputy Mansergh gave to this House is one that could better be given to an Ard-Fheis.  However, Deputy Mansergh's judgment in these matters has to be looked at in the context of his loyal service to Deputy Charles J. Haughey.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">I keep hearing Fianna Fáil apologists such as Deputy Mansergh say that the voters knew all this about the tribunal and the Taoiseach when they voted on 24 May.  They did not.  They got an explanation of sorts in May from the Taoiseach and many voters took that on trust.  That trust was abused because what we got from Deputy Bertie Ahern in September is very different from what he told the people in May.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">It is well to recall what a judge said at the tribunal, when Deputy Bertie Ahern was reminded that his story one day was the polar opposite to what it had been on an earlier occasion.  If that was the case from one week to the next in September, how can anyone claim that voters got the full story in May?  For these twists and turns alone, the Taoiseach has forfeited his claim to be trusted by the Irish people.  I remind the Taoiseach of a phrase accountants use in judging financial accounts.  He will recall it from his own training and experience — is a set of accounts a true and a fair view or picture?  The people of Ireland may well pose the same question to the Taoiseach.  Are the stories he has told a true and fair picture of these payments, the transactions that involve large amounts of foreign currency?  It is impossible to come to any such conclusion from what the Taoiseach has said in Dublin Castle or from what he told the people that Sunday in May.  For these shifting sands alone he deserves to lose the confidence of the Dáil and the citizens of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">This issue is greater than Deputy Bertie Ahern, the man.  He is held in high regard at home and abroad and has many considerable achievements to his credit over his time in public office, not just in the past decade.  However, these payments cast a cloud over this reputation and represent a decisive blow to his capacity to carry on in his present post.  This country, like many others, in Europe and the wider world, faces a turbulent period of uncertainty in financial markets, as regards oil supplies and oil prices, and indeed the Irish construction industry.  We have a changing economic situation, which will have enormous consequences for the public finances and employment next year.  When there is uncertainty the public is entitled to political leadership that is above suspicion.  I fear Deputy Bertie Ahern cannot offer that leadership to the people of Ireland because he has been less than frank and truthful in this business, and to the people in the run up to the election.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">It is not just Deputy Bertie Ahern who has taken a position that is the polar opposite to what he said earlier.  The same is true of his new allies in Government.  Can the Green Party Ministers so casually turn somersaults and give opinions today that are the polar opposite of their statements to the people in May?</p>
          <p eId="para_586">In making a judgment today we should return to first principles.  These first principles are set out with refreshing simplicity by Mr. Justice McCracken in his tribunal report.  It is not a question of what was legal at any particular time.  It is fundamentally a question of what is right and proper for a person who serves as a Minister in a democratic Government.  Such a person must not compromise his or her office by accepting gifts that might compromise the conduct of the nation's business.  From ancient Rome we can recall the story of how Julius Caesar divorced his wife over a scandal.  Caesar's wife had to be above suspicion.  So must the Head of the Government.  The Taoiseach must be a person above suspicion.  Deputy Bertie Ahern fails the Caesar test and for that reason we in the Labour Party believe he should resign his high office.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">At the outset, the tribunal has not accused the Taoiseach of not co-operating with it.  The tribunal has not accused the Taoiseach of delaying its work.  In fact, Judge Mahon no later than last Monday, 24 September, said there was no allegation of non-compliance.  He said this many times, indeed he said it on 20 September as well.  In almost nine years of investigations there is no evidence of the Taoiseach receiving any money from Mr. O'Callaghan.  There is no evidence of him doing any favours for Mr. O'Callaghan.  There is no smoking gun and not a scintilla of evidence was adduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The motion this evening is not about the tribunal and it is not about the Taoiseach.  It is more about the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party vying for Leader of the Opposition.  A new Labour Party leader who believes he is Dick Spring is calling for the Taoiseach to resign.  It is somewhat like Deputy Ruairí Quinn, once again, looking for a head.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The Fine Gael leader, scared of being overshadowed, is backed into calling for a motion of no confidence.  Fine Gael Members talked themselves into putting down this motion of no confidence.  It is yet another gesture of politics from the parties opposite, another attempt by the Fine Gael leadership to divert attention from the party's failure to recoup the losses suffered in 2002.  Fine Gael has not been elected to office since 1982 and is not liable to be in the foreseeable future.  It is another grey attempt by the Labour Party leadership to approach relevance.  This is a Labour Party now totally bereft of working class support.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">This evening they have lined up against the most popular Taoiseach in the history of the State, the man who picked up the pieces of a shattered peace process to build the Good Friday Agreement, who led his party to three successive victories in general elections, who has the overwhelming support of his own party and that of the Irish people, as was shown most recently in the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The tribunal will ultimately have to make a simple call, that is, to believe the testimony of either the Taoiseach or Mr. Gilmartin.  It will have to decide on the veracity of Mr. Gilmartin's allegation, based on mere hearsay, that the Taoiseach took money from Owen O'Callaghan.  This matter is all about an allegation based on hearsay, in respect of which not one whit of evidence has been produced.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">It is a baseless allegation to follow the many baseless allegations made by Mr. Gilmartin against many other Deputies in the House.  It is a baseless allegation like that made by Mr. Denis "Starry" O'Brien which was seen off by the Taoiseach in the Circuit Court.  It is a baseless allegation like that made against me by Mr. Gilmartin, a man I have never met in my life, nor wish to meet.  He made it in 1999 but it was only drawn to my attention earlier this summer.  The allegation which was directed at me and the former Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney, was scurrilous and absolutely untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">There is no evidence against the Taoiseach — that is the bottom line.  Prior to the general election, the parties opposite quietly briefed against him but would not attack him publicly for fear of losing the confidence of the electorate.  In the light of this <i>volte face</i>, it must now be asked of the Opposition parties where they found their spine, voice and Pauline path to conversion.  Let me outline where Deputy Eamon Gilmore found his spine.  Embarrassingly, we saw him on “Prime Time” last night in a clip recorded before the general election.  He found his spine in the desperate need to break from his predecessor’s fawning attachment to Fine Gael.  He found it in the desperate decision to mimic the Labour Party strategy of 15 years ago by reviving Dick Spring’s attempt to make the Labour Party leader the Leader of the Opposition.  The Labour Party is an old party pining for its glory days, grasping at the strategies of the past and in desperate need for a role in modern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Deputy Kenny found his voice in the need to counter Deputy Gilmore by topping the latter's call for resignation with a motion of no confidence.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">I am deeply disappointed to witness the shoddy attempt from the Government benches to defend the indefensible.  I am particularly disturbed that senior Ministers have failed even to address the essence of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I wish to address the motion of no confidence because the lies and untruths that have emerged in the past year are undermining the integrity of the political system.  Politics is a noble profession that has unfortunately been tainted by a prevailing culture, particularly in the Fianna Fáil Party, of backhanders, double standards and deliberate untruths designed to confuse and ultimately dupe the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Taoiseach's evasion, obfuscation and deeply contradictory evidence at the Mahon tribunal in recent days can no longer be ignored.  His efforts to mislead and obstruct the fact-finding efforts of a tribunal, established by his own Government, are base in the extreme.  They certainly do not represent the high standards in public office that we should expect from any public figure, particularly the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach's deliberate untruths have contributed to a deep suspicion of politicians among members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The Taoiseach has even refused to provide us with a copy of his speech.  Is it true that he is afraid to put in writing the lies and untruths he has told the House?  He must not continue to treat the people like fools.  The public has heard his evidence and seen the holes therein.  Clearly, it will no longer be duped.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The sequence of events has been outlined by Deputies Enda Kenny, Eamon Gilmore, Fergus O'Dowd and others and it speaks for itself.  Since last October the Taoiseach has given three separate and conflicting accounts of the payments he received in the 1990s.  His statements have been inconsistent and his explanations completely incredible.  More pernicious in terms of its direct impact on public confidence and the public perception of the Taoiseach and other public figures was his tear-jerking performance on RTE with Brian Dobson last April.  If it was not an Oscar-winning performance, it may have secured him a walk-on role in "Coronation Street", "Fair City" or some other soap opera.  The manner in which he dragged up his personal affairs, although nobody was interested and nobody asked, the way in which he feigned tearful emotion to conjure up the sympathy of the electorate and the way he lied blatantly to the nation regarding his personal finances beggar belief and are utterly unacceptable.  Now that he has given contradictory evidence to the Mahon tribunal, it is time for him either to tell the truth and stop treating the people like fools or regain some smidgeon of dignity by doing the decent thing, that is, resigning from his post.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">We have heard misleading claims from the Government.  During the election campaign the Taoiseach promised full answers at the Mahon tribunal.  He is now sending out his wing men, including the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, to say all the questions were answered by the result of the election.  He cannot have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The Taoiseach is now trying to blame the legal system for his own failure to come up with credible and coherent responses to the questions posed at the Mahon tribunal.  A very famous saying advises that when the facts are with one, one should pound the facts; when the facts are against one, one should pound the law; and when the law is against one, one should pound the table.  In this case, the Taoiseach is pounding the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">We have seen the activity of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and his colleagues in the past few weeks.  It is true that the tribunal has been slow but this is because individuals such as the Taoiseach, the late Liam Lawlor, Ray Burke, Frank Dunlop and others have continually hampered its investigation.  The tribunal has focused on the Taoiseach, which it is entitled and ought to do, because he was given sums of money in foreign currencies in the 1990s that add up to over €300,000.  He has continually failed to give a credible explanation for these moneys.  The pounding of the tribunal represents an attempt to distract the House from the central point, that the Taoiseach has once again failed to explain these huge sums in a credible manner.  It is time for him to stop playing the people for fools.  He pledged before the general election that he would tell us the full truth in the Mahon tribunal when he was given an opportunity to do so.  He has such an opportunity this evening.  I hope he will have the decency and courage to give us the full truth before this debate concludes.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_630">If Fine Gael stands for anything in terms of standards in public office, it had no choice but to table this motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach.  Despite the direction in which Ministers are trying to steer the debate, the essence of the motion does not relate to the Taoiseach's handling of his brief in respect of issues such as Northern Ireland, the EU Presidency and the economy, or his ability to be a popular political leader.  We know about his public achievements which, as the Government is aware, are not at question.  The credibility of the Taoiseach, in the eyes of the public and the House, needs to be questioned following his treatment of the Mahon tribunal and his performances at public hearings to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">With the exception of die hard Fianna Fáil supporters who have blind loyalty or are afraid to speak out, I have met nobody who has followed the tribunal and believes the testimony of the Taoiseach.  His account of his personal finances in the 1990s has changed under the scrutiny of the tribunal in a manner that is not credible and does not stack up.  Fianna Fáil speakers have said we should wait for Judge Mahon to draw his conclusions before we cast judgment, which seems fair enough.  That would be a reasonable request if the Taoiseach's testimony was consistent with his previous statements, credible and supported by the evidence presented by the tribunal.  That is clearly not the case, however.  Given that we have just heard four days of testimony which blatantly contradicts the evidence the tribunal has assembled, it is simply not an option to wait up to two years for a report.  The standards which apply to any other person appearing before a tribunal should also apply to politicians.  The Taoiseach should be no exception — one would expect that he would want to lead by example.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The motivation behind the motion of no confidence can be put simply — if we believe the Taoiseach has, at best, deliberately frustrated the tribunal with selective amnesia and contradictory statements or, worse, not been truthful with tribunal lawyers under oath, we can no longer have confidence in him to lead our country.  That is the issue at question.  Although the Taoiseach publicly said in the past that it was unacceptable for office holders to take money for personal use, regardless of the sums involved, we now know of the personal "dig-outs" given to him.  The money in question, worth approximately €300,000 in modern day terms, as many have said, was given to him in December 1994 while he was Minister for Finance and on the verge of becoming Taoiseach.  When these questions arose last year, he made it clear that he would explain all the details to the tribunal when given an opportunity to do so.  He gave the same performance during the election campaign, when he said he looked forward to appearing before the tribunal to clarify matters and give full explanations.  Fine Gael believes it was right to allow due process to be upheld and to give the Taoiseach an opportunity to clarify matters.  It is now being criticised — by Fianna Fáil Ministers, for example — for not taking a harder line at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Now that the Taoiseach has had an opportunity to give a full explanation, over four days of testimony, there are more questions unanswered than there were before he started to give evidence.  If his testimony is true, bank transaction and account details in the possession of the tribunal must have been incorrect on at least six separate occasions.  Those who support him are saying they believe his evidence to the tribunal is credible and accurate and that he did nothing wrong in accepting the moneys as he did.  Do Members really believe his account to the tribunal?  Do they believe that a man walked into his office while he was Minister for Finance with a bag of sterling notes worth approximately £30,000?  Nobody knows for sure how much money was in the bag because the businessman in question did not count it.  The Taoiseach did not count it, despite keeping it in his safe for three days, and Ms Celia Larkin who also saw it did not count it, even though it was heading for her bank account.  Do Deputies believe that when the Taoiseach drove Ms Larkin to lodge the sterling in a bank three days later, no receipt was asked for or given?  It is suggested nobody saw the bank clerk count the money.  We are expected to believe the bank was mistaken, by approximately £28,000 sterling, when it compiled its foreign transaction records that day.  The records of the bank state just £1,921 sterling was exchanged on the day in question.  Is this series of events really credible?  I have referred to just one version of the financial transactions under investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">This is an unpleasant day in the Dáil.  We have to make a political judgment based on the evidence before us.  When Fine Gael bears in mind the actions of those who have gone before us, it has an obligation to hold Fianna Fáil leaders — in particular, a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach — to account for their actions.  I want the understandable public cynicism of politicians to be challenged and in time replaced by a new trust and belief in the political system.  Many may be willing to forgive the Taoiseach because of his popularity, but few believe what he said in the context of recent tribunal hearings.  That such a set of circumstances is unacceptable for Fine Gael necessitates the tabling of a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">This is the second vote of confidence in the Taoiseach to be considered this year.  A motion of confidence in any Taoiseach involves a questioning of his ability to govern the country and his capacity to lead Ministers.  It is a question of confidence in the leadership of someone in steering the society and economy of Ireland on behalf of the people.  It involves deciding whether to give a mandate to someone to act as a leader.  The first of the votes of confidence to which I refer took place on 24 May last, when the people overwhelmingly declared their confidence in Deputy Bertie Ahern and the Fianna Fáil Party by returning the Government.  When the people gave the Taoiseach that vote of confidence, they based their judgment not only on his successes in recent years, but also on their confidence in him to lead Fianna Fáil into government to meet the challenges which our society and economy will face in the years to come.  Those who gave the Taoiseach their vote of confidence had heard his explanations of certain issues relating to his personal finances.</p>

All these facts were in the public domain when the people agreed to give a vote of confidence to the Taoiseach.  Given that the tribunal has not made a decision in the five months which have passed since, why are we debating the issue today?  The new Dáil has not yet had a chance to debate this country's major issues.  The ability of the Taoiseach to govern, to lead Ministers and to implement the programme for Government is not being questioned in any way.  The public has put its faith in the Taoiseach and the Government as a whole to lead the country.  There is no basis for the motion of no confidence.  It has been proposed because the Opposition parties are trying to establish themselves in opposition at the beginning of the new Dáil term.  Politicians who have been elected as Deputies are not members of a tribunal, just as those who have been elected as party leaders have not been appointed as tribunal judges.  Certain politicians and party leaders are trying to be the tribunal and the judges in that tribunal.</p>

My party wishes to continue with the people's priorities.  This does not mean, however, that we can ignore standards in public life.  The Progressive Democrats are committed to the highest standards and have been willing to act in accordance with that commitment.  In keeping with it they insisted on the establishment of suitable vehicles to investigate allegations of wrongdoing, including the tribunals of inquiry and special investigations into matters such as Ansbacher accounts.  Such vehicles must be given the appropriate resources and reasonable time to conclude their business and reach conclusions.  We support the work of the tribunals and look forward to seeing their conclusions at an early date.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Quarryvale module has not run its course.  There are a number of witnesses to be heard and issues to be examined before conclusions can be reached.  It is appropriate that we allow the tribunal to do its work and present us with a comprehensive report.  It is not for us to anticipate its outcome and reach conclusions based on partial information.  We are not dealing with its conclusions, rather we are dealing with an opportunistic attempt by the Opposition to use this as an excuse to override the results of the general election.  In the run-up to the election the Opposition shied away from the issue and stated it was a matter for the tribunal.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">This is about low standards and credibility.  Politicians should not take money for personal benefit from wealthy people.  I do not know why the Taoiseach took the money.  I do not know if the reason he took money in Manchester was that some of them were the Manchester investors in the casino project in my constituency.  I do not know why the Taoiseach took money from Mr. Michael Wall, a private bus operator looking for bus services to be deregulated in this country.  I would like to know because I do not accept the reasons provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">What the Taoiseach has done is no different from what Mr. Liam Lawlor, Mr. Charles Haughey, Deputy Lowry and former Deputy Ray Burke did.  In none of those cases do we have documentary evidence of corruption.  The reason they are discredited, disgraced and removed from office is they behaved in an inappropriate manner by receiving large sums from private individuals for personal gain.  The same standards should be applied to the Taoiseach.  Just because he is Head of the Government does not mean lower standards should be applied.  By any international standard, he would no longer be Head of the Government.  In Germany Ministers resign when they keep frequent flyer points accrued on Government flights.  In Britain Ministers resign for accepting undeclared loans.  In the United Kingdom the Taoiseach would not be fit to be a member of a county council.  He is certainly not fit to be a candidate for the Fine Gael Party.</p>

Even Mr. Padraic O'Connor of NCB Stockbrokers, for example, denies that he is the Taoiseach's friend and stated the money was given to Fianna Fáil.  Nobody believes the money the Taoiseach received was for the refurbishment of a new house.  Nobody believes the Taoiseach did not deal in dollars.  Nobody believes the 24 people in Manchester were his friends.  The Taoiseach claims that they were but cannot name them.

I have served the people of west Cork in politics and in this House for more than 21 years.  I am a realist and I know that we do not have the numbers on this side of the House to force a change but the people opposite have that choice and while they may not do it today they will have to do it very soon.  Where are the Mary Harneys, the Séamus Brennans, the Charlie McCreevys, the Dessie O'Malleys and the George Colleys?  Those were the people who knew in previous times that the leadership of their party was going in the wrong direction.  They stood by their principles and stood up for their dignity and for their party.  Where are these people now?  Is there no one over there who has even the slightest doubt about the leader of Fianna Fáil or have they all been bought and silenced?  Is there not one who can stand up for his or her principles?</p>
          <p eId="para_698">If the evidence that was offered over four different days had been given as a counter defence to an order by the Criminal Assets Bureau for confiscation of assets illegally obtained, would any judge in the land or any fair-minded person order that the assets be returned to the perpetrator?

The man who can be trusted in little things can be trusted in great things.  The man who is dishonest in little things will be dishonest in great things.  If you cannot be trusted with money, that tainted thing, who will trust you with genuine riches?  If you cannot be trusted with what is not yours, who will give you what is your very own?  No servant can be a slave to two masters; he will either hate the first and love the second or treat the first with respect and the second with scorn.</p>

I was previously a Member of this House from 1989 to 2002 when we had the tumultuous debates under the previous Fianna Fáil regime of Charles J. Haughey.  His legacy has obviously affected the body politic in Fianna Fáil.  I do not need to list the names as they are all known.  They have left a problem for us all in politics.  There is a disconnection not just with the tribunal but also with this Chamber.  Should we just sit on our hands and regard these standards as acceptable because nobody is listening?  Nobody is listening because nobody believes any of us. </p>

          <p eId="para_707">The sense of <i>déjà vu</i> was confirmed yesterday evening when I listened incredulously to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on an RTE radio programme as he said that this was the hounding of an honourable man.  Where have I heard that line before?  It was the term used by the Taoiseach himself in the context of Ray Burke’s departure from public office.  The accusation was hurled at these benches that this was the hounding of an honourable man.  If we use this occasion to draw a line in the sand and to start a new chapter in Irish politics where trust and truth will be the central planks of how we conduct our daily business, then this will be a welcome debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">It is regrettable that the Taoiseach has tarnished the body politic.  The honourable option to do the honourable thing and resign, as encouraged by the leader of the Labour Party yesterday morning, is not an option the Taoiseach will take.  It is incredible that Minister after Minister can stand up in this House and, leaving aside the motivation, say there is nothing wrong with an office holder admitting that very substantial sums of money were given to him and passed through his accounts.  The argument put forward is that we are undermining the tribunal and we should allow the tribunal pass judgment.  The tribunal will complete its business in due course but we have a political rather than a judicial role to play.  That role is to do with accepting standards and trying to reconnect with the public who are obviously disbelieving of the Taoiseach's evidence to the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I regret that my first opportunity to speak in the 30th Dáil is in a debate on a vote of no confidence in the Taoiseach.  I wish we were about the true business of the nation such as the health service but we must deal with fundamental issues such as the Taoiseach's credibility and his unsuitability for office.</p>

          <p eId="para_710">This motion is more to do with the attempt by Fine Gael and its leader to recover the initiative which has been snatched from them by a very eager new leader of the Labour Party whom I congratulate on his appointment.  The Fine Gael motion is nothing short of political grandstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">As the Members opposite know very well, the Oireachtas set up the tribunal and requested its report.  It is for the members of the tribunal to assess the evidence, draw up a report and make the findings as they see fit.  I too heard this being said in 1997 when I first became a Member of this House.  This is what the Oireachtas asked the tribunal to do and it is what many of the Members opposite voted for in 1997.  It suited their political agenda then but it does not seem to suit them now.  This is another flip which I am sure will be followed by another Opposition flop.  What the Opposition is trying to do is pre-empt the tribunal's report while at the same time trying to call the verdict.  This is predictable but no less outrageous for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The Taoiseach has given his evidence about moneys he received from friends in the period surrounding the conclusion of his separation.  There is no allegation of corruption or wrongdoing against the Taoiseach.  He explained this during the election and he explained it in this House last October.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_724">The new leader of the Labour Party is going for the old discredited Labour Party approach of heads in baskets.  Deputy Gilmore told us during the election that the people should decide on any issue arising out of the Taoiseach's finances.  His position now is that he alone should decide and the Labour Party has the neck to criticise the Taoiseach about contradictions; one could not make it up.  As legislators, those of us on this side of the House want to get on with the business of the Dáil and of running the country.  To be fair I think that is what the majority of people on the opposite side also want.  It is a poor reflection on the Opposition that it is engaging in such a charade at such an important time.  As the Government motion reflects and almost everybody who has spoken today acknowledges, the Taoiseach has made an enormous contribution to Irish public life.  He was Minister for Labour when social partnership first took root and, as a result, the days of widespread strikes and industrial chaos were consigned to history.  He was Minister for Finance when international commentators first used the phrase "Celtic tiger" to describe Ireland's economic progress.  He is the first Taoiseach since Éamon de Valera in 1944 to win three elections in a row.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Taoiseach is a giant of modern history.  No Taoiseach has a more impressive curriculum vitae including leadership of the peace process, record economic and employment growth unprecedented in the history of independent Ireland, negotiating successful partnership agreements and his standing as a European statesman as evidenced during our country's successful EU Presidency.  Faced with such a political colossus, the Opposition's only tactic is to try to take the low road to high office.  The Taoiseach has served in public life for three decades.  He has held a number of offices of State and it is self-evident that he has not benefited from any political decision he has made.  Bertie Ahern does not live an ostentatious lifestyle.  His life revolves around work in public service and there is no suggestion that he has placed private gain above the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The tribunals sought the Taoiseach's bank records on the basis of allegations made to it that he had received money from Owen O'Callaghan.  This is an allegation the Taoiseach and Mr. O'Callaghan both deny and one which there is no evidence to substantiate.  The Taoiseach was previously vindicated when the allegation was before the Circuit Court.  The tribunal sought sight of the Taoiseach's bank records and queried a number of lodgements relating to the period surrounding the conclusion of the Taoiseach's separation agreement.  It was a time when the Taoiseach did not have a home or marriage and had considerable legal bills to discharge.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged financial assistance from personal friends in the period which those contributors have confirmed.  No allegation of impropriety exists in relation to these payments.  There is no question of favours sought or given.  It is important to note that during more than 18 hours at the tribunal, not one allegation of improper conduct was put to the Taoiseach in the context of any of the funds he received.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Taoiseach was asked for details of his personal life and of how people assisted him.  He provided the information to the best of his recollection.  While the nitty-gritty of every banking lodgement and transaction from 12 or 13 years ago might stick in the minds of some, it should be remembered that it was a time of political and personal turmoil during which Bertie Ahern's focus was not solely on his financial affairs.  It is important to note that there was no attempt to conceal any of the lodgements into which the tribunal has inquired and that they were made into regular AIB accounts.  The lodgements were made in this way because there was nothing to hide and nothing sinister in progress.  Those who have said the Taoiseach has failed to supply every detail are the very same people who would be jumping up and down saying it was not credible had the Taoiseach professed to possess total and immediate recall of every aspect of his financial affairs from over a decade ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">While all of us accept that those in public life must be open to scrutiny, we must also reject vehemently a campaign of leaks and vilification unprecedented in modern Irish history.  Participation in public life should not mean people have a licence to destroy unfairly the reputations of those who serve.  If ever it becomes so, who then will serve?  It is to be hoped that all Members will pay even half as much attention to the evidence of Mr. Gilmartin as they did the Taoiseach's.  Mr. Gilmartin's allegations about the Taoiseach are falling apart under cross-examination.  It has been demonstrated that Mr. Gilmartin has made up significant numbers of inconsistent and contradictory allegations about the Taoiseach and others.  We should not forget that the purpose of the tribunal's inquiries into the Taoiseach is supposed to be to establish whether he got money from Owen O'Callaghan.  After lengthy and expensive investigation into the Taoiseach's house, his family circumstances, landlord and other irrelevant matters, it is crystal clear that the allegations which are currently relevant — that he received money from Mr. O'Callaghan — are completely and utterly without foundation.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I conclude by quoting Mr. Justice Flood who said that in his view there was nothing in what had been heard which would lead the tribunal to make an adverse judgment against the Taoiseach.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_730">I remind Deputies on all sides of the House, especially those who belong to the party which used to use the term "just society" to refer to one based on justice, fair play, due process and equality, that they need to remind themselves of these core values.  We must stand up for due process and hear all the facts before making any judgment.  I remind Members that the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters and payments was established by resolution of Dáil Éireann and appointed by instrument of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 4 November 1997.  I affirm my confidence in the Mahon tribunal, the Quarryvale module of which has yet to run its course.  A substantial number of witnesses have yet to give evidence.  Members of the Oireachtas should not seek to predetermine the tribunal's report on the matters which it has asked the tribunal to investigate.  This is a very important point and the basis of my support for the Government's motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">It is the role of the tribunal's members to make an objective assessment of the completed evidence and findings if necessary.  I urge people to be sensible, respectful and fair.  We hear many parties in the House talk about fair play and we should have it in tonight's debate and allow the tribunal to carry out its proper functions.  I reject the politically opportunistic antics of some of the Opposition parties.  It is not fair or proper to make a decision until we all hear the facts.  It is important for all Members to study the tribunal, consider the details and only then make a final judgment.  A number of Deputies have asked me my position and that is it.</p>

          <p eId="para_732">I wish to share time with Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.  Today is an unfortunate day.  It is not the type of day any of us envisaged coming back on.  The subject at issue is not one any of us wishes to speak to.  Nevertheless, if one stands for public office and is elected, there are things one must do even if one does not necessarily want to.  It is part of the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I have listened with great interest and amusement over the last number of weeks and have heard every single Fianna Fáil Minister and, now, backbencher sing from the one hymn sheet.  It is commendable to an extent.  It shows the type of loyalty one expects within a political party.  However, when the hymn involves the spinning of facts, it the job of the Opposition to point out exactly what are the facts.  This is not about the Taoiseach's personal life.  No one mentioned his personal life until the Taoiseach raised it himself.  For him to continue to throw that cloak around him is unacceptable.  He should not do it.  The Taoiseach hopes his continued use of his cloak of invisibility will force us all to back off.  It is like Ray Burke coming in here and crying with the result that the Opposition backed off because someone was upset.  The nation has been upset by the type of corruption we have seen in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Under discussion is a citizen who happens to be the Taoiseach.  An accusation has been made and the tribunal has approached the Taoiseach as it would approach me or a local urban councillor to require the production of bank records.  It may be the case that there is nothing in the bank records connected to Owen O'Callaghan.  However, there are unexplained amounts of money in the records and, regardless of what the Taoiseach says, he has not explained them.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">When former Deputy Liam Lawlor went before the tribunal and Fianna Fáil heard his evidence and heard how he evaded giving evidence, held up the tribunal and refused to give the tribunal the information it sought, Fianna Fáil took action.  It did not wait for the tribunal to report to decide what it thought of Mr. Lawlor's actions.  The party took action and told Mr. Lawlor he must leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">It is not the Opposition or the tribunals that will put the Taoiseach out of office but the men in grey suits sitting next to and behind him.  They will go to him and say: "Bertie, your time has come.  You are damaging the Government and you must go."  The Taoiseach should do the honourable thing and go in his own time rather than be pushed by the people who now sit next to him and pretend to be his friends.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_740">The motion put down by the Fine Gael Party states: "That Dáil Éireann has no confidence in An Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern."  We have no hesitation in supporting that motion as we have no confidence in this Taoiseach and the Government because of the disastrous policies pursued since 1997.  The Government has squandered the unprecedented prosperity of the economy and failed to build a fairer society.  It has managed our public services disastrously and pursued privatisation policies that have undermined those services.  Despite the assertions of other speakers in this debate, these are the principal reasons this Taoiseach and Government must go.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">No previous Government had such opportunities, resources, capacity to plan for the future and wealth to distribute fairly.  No previous Government had such a favourable climate in terms of the vibrant economy and the successful peace process.  However, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, under this Taoiseach, have failed miserably to use those huge advantages in the public interest.  For their fundamentally flawed policies and appalling management of our health services in particular, the Taoiseach and the Government deserve the censure of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil colleagues have attempted to hide behind the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Progressive Democrats in an effort to shirk their responsibility for the gross inequality and inefficiency of our health services.  Thousands of dedicated men and women work in those services providing excellent care to millions of people.  However, patients and health care workers alike have been betrayed by Governments charged with vindicating the health care rights of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Hospitals are obliged to cut back services to patients because of budgetary diktats from the HSE.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm say that patients will not be affected by these cuts.  On what planet do they live?  The Government's plan to provide radiotherapy centres is in chaos, with the Minister and the Professor making contradictory statements.  Before the 2002 general election, Fianna Fáil promised to end the two tier system of hospital care.  It has done the opposite and reinforced it.  Through its notorious private for profit hospital co-location scheme, it is privatising our public health system.  The Government's disastrous hospital centralisation policy has cost lives; of that there is no doubt.  Monaghan General Hospital is being used as the template for downgrading hospital facilities that were once the pride of their communities.  The 24 hour accident and emergency service in Ennis is to be ended.  I wish the people of County Clare well with their protest next Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The failure of the Government over the past decade in health is mirrored in housing, where it has presided over gross price inflation and a severe shortage of social and affordable housing, leaving thousands of families in hardship in all constituencies.  Under this Taoiseach there has been a total failure to plan for growth, with children denied school places; a lack of balanced regional development and the decline of many rural communities; inadequate public transport; the sale of our natural resources such as Corrib gas; the betrayal of our neutrality and the use of Shannon Airport by warring powers and the privatisation of State assets, including Aer Lingus and Eircom.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The Taoiseach's testimony at the Mahon tribunal is an issue that has raised far more questions than it has answered.  It has exposed contradictions and undermined the Taoiseach's credibility.  The focus of the Government is being taken away from the serious issues I have outlined, as well as many more.  Instead of doing their jobs, Ministers in recent weeks and today, the first day of the new Dáil session, are being trundled out to defend the Taoiseach.  I have never seen a Government more badly prepared for the return of the Dáil.  For all these reasons but primarily because of the failure to deliver quality public services, particularly in health care delivery, this Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and all members of the Cabinet stand indicted and deserve to have no confidence voted in them this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">I have little to add to what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, stated.  The tribunal was empowered by the Houses of the Oireachtas to perform a task.  However, prior to the Taoiseach giving testimony the week before last, throughout his testimony and since his testimony a large number of Fine Gael Deputies established themselves as experts on banking practices, cross-examination and examination of witnesses, the inferences judges are supposed to find from the testimony of witnesses and every other matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Despite the fact that as Members of a party represented in the House they established this tribunal they refuse to accept the due process ordained by the House.  They leaped to judgment in a particular context whereby the Supreme Court ruled only a few months ago that a definite list of matters of public importance exists which the tribunal must investigate.  With regard to the Taoiseach, the only definite matter of public importance the tribunal is required by us to investigate is the allegations of Mr. Gilmartin.  I will not comment on his evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">In so far as the Taoiseach is concerned, those allegations do not appear to have been disclosed to us.  I find it difficult to understand how the Opposition parties can rush to judgment on the basis of an uninvestigated allegation.  This is all we are at in terms of the tribunal and its inquiries with regard to any allegation against the Taoiseach.  We do not have any evidence on the allegation itself and yet this evening we are meant on this basis to reverse and not accept the judgment the people made some months ago when they affirmed their confidence in him and not trust our own judgment but that of the banking, forensic and legal experts which the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies turned themselves into.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">It is a pity they do not display more expertise on the position of Shannon Airport.  Many of the employees of that establishment were outside the House today.  They are extremely concerned about their future.  As a Member of this Government I understand why they are concerned.  They raised serious questions which we, as a Government, are trying to address.  However, the Opposition was not interested in discussing this matter as an issue of first priority this evening.  Its first priority was to resume a nasty campaign of character assassination against the Taoiseach and it was disappointing to see young Fine Gael Deputies whose mandates, like those of everyone else, only began last June engage with such relish in this operation——</p>

          <p eId="para_765">The Opposition failed to get the better of the Taoiseach on a political front and is beginning to scrape the bottom of the barrel and trawl through a difficult period in the Taoiseach's life and that of his family, trying to add fuel to a tribunal inquiring into matters completely outside its remit and in the process causing more conspiracy theories among the general public in the hope the Taoiseach will be damaged beyond repair.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Yesterday, I listened to my Fine Gael constituency colleague state on local radio the tribunal should be allowed make its recommendations before tabling such a motion as this.  It is not difficult to see he has too much integrity to get a place on the Front Bench of the Fine Gael Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The allegations made here are mainly made up of conspiracy and untruths.  The Taoiseach never took a penny of the State's.  He was never involved in any untoward planning matters.  Rather, he is the hardest-working politician this country has ever seen.  He lives the life of a very ordinary man and the Opposition can only dream of his record in this House.  I hope tonight's motion gets the result it deserves, allowing the Taoiseach return to running the country and keeping the economy affluent as only he has the ability to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I stand firmly behind the Taoiseach.  Integrity and respect in the House have been taken to a new low by the Opposition.</p>

As this week wears on we will find people want us to debate matters such as cancer services in Tallaght which is what I want to discuss.

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_782">Standards in public matter a great deal to this House.  One of our core jobs is to uphold standards with regard to people who take high office.  We must ask at what stage do we believe an office holder crosses the threshold and state this person is no longer fit for office.  Is it when an office holder accepts huge sums without any documentary evidence of the source of those sums even though they are from private individuals when we know Ministers should not receive money of this nature?  Is this when the threshold is crossed?  Is it when we find money is treated as a personal gift which the donor believed was a donation to a political party?  Is it when moneys are deemed to be loans even though they have lain for years without interest, payment or other sign they genuinely represented loans?  Is it when information about transactions crucial to the work of a tribunal are withheld from the tribunal?  Is it when the explanations offered are contradicted time and again by records held by the bank?  Is it when explanations presented as categorical and clear are changed when confronted by the facts?  At what point along that journey does one decide this is no longer acceptable, this person no longer has the trust to remain a fit person to lead the country?  I believe that at the first step the line was crossed.  When a person holding the position of Minister for Finance accepts private money a line is crossed.  Many other lines have been crossed in the meantime.  People ask why we have lost confidence and why we are tabling this motion.  It is because it is our job to do so.  It is our job and, I submit, the job of Members on the other side also to say there are standards that we must insist are upheld and these standards have been transgressed.  We have to hold the person accountable and that is what we are doing today.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I have listened to the Fianna Fáil spokesmen and they would have one believe that because the tribunal has not proved a corrupt act that none of this matters.  I do not accept that.  That is the test of criminal proof — that one attests that someone has committed a crime.  That is not the test we apply to the suitability of a person to lead the Government.  The suitability of a person to lead the Government hinges on them understanding their obligations not to receive money from people, their obligation to treat tribunals properly, their obligations to have consistent and proper explanations backed up by facts when they present them.  These are the tests that have to be applied.  This is the test that has been failed.  I ask Ministers here if they believe that any of this behaviour would be suitable for them?  Do they believe they should be less than co-operative with a tribunal and that they should accept money?  I believe many of the honourable Ministers would very definitely say no and would not dream of doing so.  Yet they sit there and tolerate it as if it is acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">We are also asked to believe, and the Minister for Education and Science said it, that has all been decided and the people voted in the general election.  People voted back Deputy Lowry, Ray Burke and Deputy Beverley Flynn but that did not stop Members deciding that whips should be withdrawn, that they should no longer be members of parties and no longer have posts of important responsibility.  People took a different view in this House.  They do not believe that simply because one has won an election that suddenly one's obligations of accountability are wiped clear.  The reality is that the public did not have the information we now have, nor were they judging on this issue.  Rightly, they were told that the last general election was not about the Taoiseach's appearance at the tribunal.  We now find that he has not co-operated at the tribunal although they decided they were told he was, that he has not got consistent explanations for what happened although we were told that he had.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The leader of the Green Party came into the House when the Government was being formed and told me he had received explanations from the Taoiseach and was content.  Were the explanations he received those that were given at the tribunal and have they not been shredded?  The same applies to the leader of the Progressive Democrats.  During the election he had marched his troops to the top of the hill and said they should pull out of Government but he marched them back down again because he had explanations that he believed were consistent.  I ask the Progressive Democrats if these were the explanations because they have been totally demolished by the tribunal, by the investigative process of following the trail of money, a process the Taoiseach has accepted as the way this should be dealt with.  His explanations have been demolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">This is not the end of the matter.  Two thirds of the public do not believe the Taoiseach's explanations.  There is still more evidence to be exposed.  For example, the issue of the would-be loan donation, disputed by NCB, has still to be unearthed.  How is it that something the NCB director believed was a donation to the party became a gift?  We still have to see how the house in Beresford was willed by Michael Wall to the Taoiseach.  We still have to see how €50,000 was saved to be produced as a deposit.  The Taoiseach will be in and out of the tribunal.  On the evidence we have seen so far, his explanations will not build confidence that this is a Government handling important issues and led in a coherent way by a Taoiseach in whom the public has trust.  That is the ultimate test.  We are responsible to the people to give them a leadership in which they can have confidence and trust.  That trust has been undermined and destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">This motion of confidence is an important one because we, and particularly those on the other side who have indicated they want to vote against it, will have to decide at what point the line is crossed.  I believe the line has been crossed ages ago but the parties and the Independents who are not within Fianna Fáil will have to decide these issues.  While Fianna Fáil has said the election has decided it all and that there is still no proof of corruption they are not the issues and the standards we must apply to Members of high office.</p>

The onus is on people to produce credible explanations of where huge unexplained sums arrive in their accounts.  That is the onus that has to be explained.  We have seen the explanations that have come forward.  We have seen the failure to provide full documentary evidence to the tribunal when requested.  We have seen the Taoiseach having to be drawn into a public open hearing because he did not co-operate in the earlier phases of the investigation.  That is what has happened and there is no getting away from that.  That has undermined people's credibility in this Taoiseach.  That is why I believe now is the time for the Taoiseach——</p>

One of the things being suggested is that opinions such as those offered by the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, on Fitzwilton <i>v. </i>Mahon are an abuse of the tribunal.  This is not correct.  As Mrs. Justice Denham said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_804">The tribunal was established in 1997.  The concept behind the establishment of a tribunal is that there be an inquiry into definite matters as a matter of urgent public importance.  The fact that the tribunal is still inquiring ten years later is the antithesis of an urgent public inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">That is not the abuse of the tribunal.  That is simply a statement by a very eminent Supreme Court judge in respect of how they saw the situation based on the declarations and orders that were sought by Fitzwilton on appeal from the High Court.  Let us try to avoid this attempt to consider people having anything to say about the tribunal as being in some way an abuse of the tribunal.  It is not an abuse of the tribunal.</p>

          <p eId="para_807">Deputy Kenny spoke about the need to maintain standards.  I would like to quote from a person Deputy Kenny might know, the former leader of Fine Gael, Mr. John Bruton, who said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_808">There is not, and never will be, a system of conviction by denunciation.  Independent authorities, not rivals nor those with an axe to grind, make judgments as to culpability.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">If Deputies Kenny and Gilmore want to seek to accord high standards, which I always seek to accord to myself, as I am sure does every colleague here, then perhaps they should listen to that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The Oireachtas has decided there are matters of urgent public importance, which began in respect of inquiries into planning matters about 728 acres in north County Dublin and have subsequently developed into a range of inquiries into areas quite apart from the original intention, which was amended by this House on a number of occasions.  Again in 2004 we amended the terms of reference and directed the tribunal to indicate the other matters upon which it wished to proceed to public hearing.  If it did not so indicate by 1 May 2005, it could not proceed.  Those were interventions made by this House which, I remind Deputy Bruton, were not deemed as an abuse of the tribunal.  It was a case of us trying to ensure we could maintain public confidence by trying to bring some efficacy and finality at some stage to all these necessary inquiries and that the methodology being used would protect the constitutional rights of everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">A contention was made by Opposition leaders that we are trying to permit a privileged few to have entitlements over and above those of other citizens.  That is not the case.  What we seek for the Taoiseach, as we would seek for anyone appearing before the tribunal, is precisely the same rights and entitlements of any citizen.  If Deputy Kenny wants to maintain standards, due process requires that we avoid judgment by denunciation, that we await facts to be established and all witnesses to be heard, and that we allow the judges who have been designated by the Oireachtas to adjudicate on these matters and to report back to the Oireachtas which will make its own judgment on the basis of the calm and final deliberation of that tribunal in respect of all those matters.  That is what is required for the maintenance of standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">I do not accept that Deputy Kenny has a principled view about all of this.  Last October he saw an opportunity.  He came with his dagger, but it did not work: it was quite blunt.  When that happened and Deputy Rabbitte saw that he had gone down by five percentage points in the opinion polls, he acknowledged that he was wasting his time and would not proceed with it because he had an election to fight.  Suddenly principles went out the window when the issue was not going to be the big political hammer the Opposition thought it would be.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_1023">Cancer is the single biggest killer in Ireland.  According to the National Cancer Registry, there are approximately 22,000 new cancer cases reported each year, with over 7,000 people dying from this life-threatening disease.  The incidence of cancer is likely to double to 44,000 cases by 2020.  One in three Irish people will develop invasive cancer and one in four will die from the disease.  That is why the word "cancer" strikes such fear into the hearts of those who are diagnosed with the disease and their families.  Thankfully, the outlook for many who receive such a diagnosis can be very positive but only if their illness is detected early and if they receive appropriate treatment in a prompt fashion.  The evidence supporting early diagnosis and treatment across virtually all cancers is irrefutable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Despite the fact that risk of developing cancer continues to increase and that the population has increased by at least 500,000, facilities to treat this frightening illness have not improved and remain stagnant.  Given that 60% of people diagnosed with cancer will be obliged to avail of radiotherapy during the course of their treatment and that international best practice for ensuring best outcomes states that patients should not have to wait any longer than six weeks for such treatment, it is not just shameful that people must wait up to six months for therapy but, in a country as wealthy as ours, it is morally reprehensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Although Fianna Fáil has been in power for ten years and has had access to unprecedented resources, the repeatedly announced breast screening programmes first mooted in the national health strategy published in 2001 have still not been put in place.  Cervical screening in the mid-west has remained at pilot level since 1999.  This is all the more inexplicable in light of the fact that cervical cancer can be prevented because screening detects changes in the cells that are pre-cancerous and these cells can then be destroyed by means of a simple out-patient procedure.  In 2005, 253 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer and approximately 70 women die from this eminently preventable disease each year.  There has been nothing but stagnation in respect of the radiotherapy plan announced only two years ago.  We are now informed that it will not be delivered until 2015 and not 2011 as promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">There is nothing but chaos in the health service.  Promises have been broken, patients are in distress, families have become disillusioned and staff morale has reached an all-time low.  Frontline staff cuts will further exacerbate our already unacceptable waiting lists.  The Minister guaranteed that the latter would not happen.  The people of Ireland and the members of Fine Gael cannot possibly accept her assertion that the loss of 30 nurses and four consultants at Sligo General Hospital will not affect the delivery and standard of care available to patients in the north west.  Given that there are only two breast surgeons there, this represents a 50% reduction in this critical area of cancer care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">Recent media reports exposed a frightening reality in respect of cancer services.  Inequitable access to cancer treatment and incidents of cancer misdiagnosis are costing people their lives.  These are real people — our friends and families.  Thousands of women in the midlands are obliged to undergo the deeply distressing experience of being re-examined as a result of a fragmented, unreliable cancer service.  Is it any wonder that a crisis of confidence has swept across the health service?</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The emergence of disturbing information on breast cancer care at Barringtons Hospital supports the need to establish a patient safety authority that would register and accredit all health care facilities, including private hospitals.  This is Fine Gael policy.  At Waterford hospital, there is no waiting room and the treatment room relating to oncology services, which was designed to deal with ten patients, is regularly used to treat 50 patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">I tabled this motion in the hope of obtaining answers as to why the public has been misled with regard to the delivery of urgently needed radiotherapy services.  The Minister for Health and Children's national plan for radiation oncology, announced with much fanfare in 2005, has been exposed as nothing more than an empty promise.  Last January, a leaked Health Service Executive report seen by Newstalk 106 showed that the Government's €500 million cancer treatment plan had encountered serious problems.  The assessment by the HSE exposed years of delay, cost uncertainties and concluded that the plan's timeline was not achievable.  The document also revealed that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, did not involve the HSE before announcing the plan in 2005.  At the time, her response was to cover up the facts and accuse whistleblowers of political scaremongering.  Delay being that deadliest form of denial, the Minister opted to sit on the issue.  Now, after a nine month wait, she has received a report confirming what we already knew, namely, that the timetable is looking less achievable than it did in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">As a result of the Minister's failure to consult the HSE before announcing the plan, cancer patients will be obliged to wait until 2015 for urgently needed services.  Last week, the head of the HSE, Professor Brendan Drumm, conceded that the plan could not be delivered on time and blamed the delay on the fact that it was to be delivered by way of a complex public private partnership arrangement.  According to Professor Drumm, there is no doubt that a public private partnership represents a more difficult way to deliver anything.  Rather than accept these findings, the Minister, Deputy Harney, seems to have slipped into a state of denial.  She simply refuses to accept that the plan cannot be delivered, just as she refuses to accept that health cutbacks and recruitment bans will affect patient care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">Not only is the Minister refusing to accept the opinion of HSE management, she is also ignoring that of the Department of Health and Children's hospital planning office and the National Development Finance Agency, which accept that the target date of 2011 cannot now be met.  This begs the question as to why the Minister is so set on providing this service via the public private partnership route.  Will she confirm that it is her intention to insist on using a single private company to build all of these facilities throughout the country?  If the answer is yes, that is hardly the stuff of competition or quality assurance.  Why place all our eggs in one basket?</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">This complacency and inflexibility is completely unacceptable to Fine Gael and to the patients who are awaiting much needed cancer treatment services.  In recent months a series of misdiagnoses and unreliable treatment practices have exposed a frightening reality as regards our health services.  Inquiries into practices at Barringtons Hospital in Limerick, along with a review of thousands of mammograms and breast ultrasounds at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, have justifiably led to a crisis of confidence in our cancer services.  The latter is further compounded by the fact that, 19 months ago, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE were aware of seven separate issues concerning the quality of breast cancer services at Barringtons Hospital.  However, no action was taken and these questionable practices were allowed to continue unabated while private patients were referred and had their bills paid by the VHI.  It is absolutely appalling and utterly reckless that the Minister for Health and Children, who has responsibility for the welfare of all patients, could allow this to happen.  Will she inform the House whether public patients were being treated at Barringtons during the period in question under the National Treatment Purchase Fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The Minister's assertion that she did not know, the HSE's claim that it had no remit over private hospitals and the Department of Health and Children's inaction have further strengthened the belief that no one is in charge of the health service.  Had she been prepared to take action, the Minister could, as sole shareholder in the VHI, have withdrawn cover from Barringtons Hospital and, if appropriate, instructed the NTPF to discontinue referring patients until the matter was resolved.  Instead, the repeated concerns highlighted by the director of cancer services in the mid-west, Dr. Raj Gupta, regarding the quality of such services delivered at Barringtons were ignored.  The Minister indicated that she did not become aware of concerns in respect of the hospital until the start of August of this year.  This issue was passed from Billy to Jack — or Brendan to Mary — with nobody accepting responsibility and patients' lives continually being put at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">In terms of a cancer diagnosis, 19 months is a long time.  This is completely unacceptable, particularly as best international practice dictates that treatment should begin within six weeks.  Given the existence of spare capacity in our private hospitals, many of which have two linear accelerators and thus meet best practice standards, surely the Minister should instruct the HSE to avail of these life-saving machines and thereby shorten waiting lists and lengthen the life expectancy of patients.  I understand there are eight such machines and their use would greatly enhance the current level of service provision and thus reduce much suffering and stress on the part of patients and their families.  With the Minister's well known preference for the private sector, we should surely avail of this golden opportunity to fill a gap in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I take this opportunity to point out to the Minister that a national annual age appropriate check up would not only ensure early detection of many cancers, which is so critical to a positive outcome, it would also detect many other diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, etc., and allow for early treatment, thus avoiding needless pain and suffering for patients and the incurring of unnecessary expense by the State.  It is a well-established fact that for every euro spent on prevention, one saves €20 on treatment.  We could refer to this as the NBT — the national body test — given that we have an NCT.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me that people are more important than cars.  As the Minister is aware, this has been Fine Gael policy since 2005 under Senator Liam Twomey.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Today, Fine Gael calls on the Government to urgently deliver treatment services for cancer patients as quickly and efficiently as possible so that we will no longer have to suffer a situation where one is less likely to have access to treatment services such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy if one lives in the west because of the variation in access to services regionally; where one is more likely to survive breast, bowel and prostate cancers if one lives in the east but significantly less likely to do so if one lives in the midlands, south, south east or west of this country; where breast cancer incidence is 26% lower in Ireland than in the US but where the mortality rate is 33% higher; where Ireland spends less on research in comparison to other European countries — Ireland spends €3.99 per head of population in comparison to Great Britain, which spends €13.18 per person; where Ireland consistently falls below the European average when it comes to survival of major cancers, such as colorectal, lung, breast, ovarian, testicular, prostate cancers and Hodgkins disease; where we have a 20-week wait for radiotherapy services for prostate cancer sufferers; and, where we still have no interim service in Beaumont Hospital or St. James's Hospital, despite being promised this two  years ago as an integral part of the plan then announced with such fanfare.  I think the Minister will agree that while one might take some time to build these facilities, it takes time to build up expertise among personnel.  That is why these interim facilities are of such importance.  We should get to the stage where we will no longer have to tolerate a situation where a 30-year-old woman from the north west with three small children under the age of five feels she has to choose between lengthy journeys to Dublin for radiotherapy and precious time with her young family.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">In this regard, a strategy for the treatment of seriously ill patients in the north west that depends on the goodwill and variable availability of services in Belfast is not acceptable.  Clearly, the people of Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim cannot be blamed for expecting that their illness will be treated on the basis of severity and not on whether they live north or south of the Border, as the current plan clearly stipulates.  If such North-South arrangements are to be put in place, it must be on the basis of a defined guaranteed service that patients can rely on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">My job is to hold the Minister and the Government to account when her policies are ill-judged or misguided and do not result in improved patient care in a timely fashion.  It is also my remit to support her when her policies deliver for the patient in an efficient fashion.  With this in mind, I ask her to divorce herself from this ideological wedding to public private partnerships in this instance as  all the professional advice from those working in the service, both medical and administrative, including the CEO of the HSE, indicates that it is obstructing and delaying the roll-out of these life-saving services.  I leave the Minister with one final question.  How is it possible for a private facility in Waterford to be built in 18 months and in a position to deliver cancer care in a further two months, a timeframe of 20 months, when the Minister's putative plan will now take until 2015?  The Minister should forget about ideology.  Patient care comes first.</p>

        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_499">
          <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_1039">I am delighted to have the opportunity to broach once more the subject of cancer treatment and radium treatment for cancer patients in this country, particularly in the north west.  It is entirely appropriate and timely that the first Private Members' Bill we have on the resumption of this new Dáil concerns the health services because every aspect of the health services is in difficulty at the moment.  One could say it is in turmoil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">There is an embargo on recruitment, which will have a significant impact on the care and treatment of patients in our hospitals, particularly in Sligo.  Contractual staff are being laid off.  There is a headlong clash between the Department and the HSE and pharmacists in this country.  Anything that interferes with the service provided by pharmacists will have an impact, particularly in rural areas where they are just trying to survive.  There has been a cutback in hospital transport.  In my constituency, a 90-year-old lady with a fractured hip and Alzheimer's disease must travel to Letterkenny General Hospital for a check up on her hip but no transport is available for her.  This is another indication of what is going on in the health services and the reduction in home help.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">We are specifically dealing with cancer treatment here this evening.  The cancer strategy was laid out a number of years ago.  On a number of occasions here, including Adjournment and other debates, I mentioned that as far as cancer services and radiotherapy services were concerned, the area north of a Dublin-Galway line was a vast barren desert.  There has been very little improvement in the situation because there is no radiotherapy available in that area to patients, as Deputy Reilly already mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">Donegal is a county with a population of approximately 140,000 people.  Letterkenny General Hospital caters for the needs of the people of that county.  In every year, there are 60 to 70 breast cancer cases, 70 prostate cancer cases and 70 bowel cancer cases in Letterkenny General Hospital.  The operations are carried out in Letterkenny General Hospital, but when radium treatment is required, people's only option is to come to Dublin.  Efforts are being made to set up something between ourselves and Belfast but that is not the answer to our difficulties in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">If one takes the north west — Donegal, Derry and parts of Tyrone — there is a critical mass of 500,000 people.  It has been mentioned by the HSE and the Minister on numerous occasions that 500,000 people would be a critical mass, if I am allowed to use that term when speaking about radiation, to establish such a facility.  I appeal once more to the Minister and her office to influence the HSE.  I am sure it would listen to her opinion and her wishes that we should have something like that in the north west.  As Deputy Reilly has already stated, there are women in Donegal who are faced with the choice of having radical mastectomies or radiation treatment and opt for the former because they do not want to be away from their families and environment — support which is so important when one is receiving such treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">I have not travelled that much since I entered this House 26 years ago but I had the good fortune last year to visit New Zealand.  We met people there involved in the health sector.  I believe the Minister was there herself, if my memory is correct, and left a very good impression.</p>

          <p eId="para_1048">Naturally, we introduced the subject of cancer services and radiation services in New Zealand.  We were told that its yardstick or benchmark is that no patient should be further than two hours from such a facility.  I was very fortunate last year because I had another trip to Switzerland.  Two eminent Members went with me, the Ceann Comhairle's predecessor, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, and former Senator, Mary Henry.  We met the Minister there who informed us that in her canton, which has one million inhabitants, there are six publicly funded radiation centres and a number of private centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">In the limited time available to me, I welcome what has been announced today.  That there will certainly be a breast cancer service in Letterkenny goes some way towards meeting needs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1051">It is a pity Deputy McGinley did not bring back some chocolates from Switzerland.  It might have sweetened the Minister, ensuring more significant announcements on cancer services today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The alleged objective of the reform of cancer services is to provide an improved level of service delivery and the successful treatment of cancer patients.  There is no detail, however, on how this will be delivered.  It will be 2015 when radiotherapy services will be available in the four proposed regional networks.  Multi-disciplinary teams will be set up but no timescales or budgets for their roll-out have been given, if we are to believe the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">There will be no cancer services north of the line between Galway and Dublin, meaning half the country will be ignored in the provision of cancer services.  It is not acceptable that in a country supposed to be the second richest in Europe, basic cancer services cannot be provided to people in the north west and that they must travel across the country to access radiotherapy services.  The only commitment in today's announcement is the withdrawal of services from several hospitals, including those at Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital.  It will result in patients from these areas having to make arduous journeys to access radiotherapy services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The pipe dream is that somewhere down the road a better level of service will be provided.  Cancer rates have been predicted to double in the next 14 years but the delivery of services remains in the Dark Ages.  The ethos behind today's announcement is about cost-savings and not improving services.  I agree with the objective of centres of excellence that will ensure one fifth more of cancer patients will survive.  However, as a Member from the west I cannot understand how the Minister will deliver on this when she has failed to deliver on BreastCheck.  Women in the west and north west will have to wait until the end of 2009 for the full roll-out of BreastCheck.  Seven years ago County Roscommon had cervical cancer screening services.  They were withdrawn because a national programme was to be rolled out.  Seven years later, we are still waiting for it.  There is no national programme for prostate or bowel cancer screening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I am appalled at what has occurred at Barringtons Hospital.  Some 19 months ago, concerns were raised about its services.  Women in the west and north west have no other choice but to go into the unregulated private health care system because a public service is not available to them.  Will there be another disclosure regarding screening services provided by private operators in the west and north west?  If the Minister is to deliver on the provision of services, she must retain those services already in place until the promised super service is in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">The provision of transport will be a critical element to these new centres of excellence.  During the Minister's tenure, transport provision to and from treatment for cancer patients, has been reduced in the west and north west.  I know of a young woman in the advanced stages of breast cancer who must pay €200 every time she travels to Galway by taxi for treatment because a public transport service is not available.  As she has private health insurance, she is ignored by the HSE regarding support for transport costs.  Many oncology patients have had transport services for treatment withdrawn.  It is hard to explain to people how they will have a better service when existing services are being withdrawn by the HSE.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_505">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1057">I welcome the Minister to the House.  From speaking to members of the new health structures, I know there is a feeling of frustration and disenfranchisement. The overall health service is moving towards a centralised system.  Previously, it was a more devolved local system, a model other European states are following.  The new health structures are becoming more like talking shops.  The officials are courteous and respond to questions.  The frustration, however, lies in the downgrading of services.  Will there be a downgrading of cancer services at Letterkenny General Hospital?</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">There is frustration between the workings of the HSE and the Department.  For example, it is believed BreastCheck and the National Treatment Purchase Fund work as autonomous bodies.  There is a lack of communication and, therefore, trust between these structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">I welcome the Minister's cross-Border efforts in providing 50 hospital beds at Belfast City Hospital for patients from County Donegal as it is only one and a half hours by road.  Up to 1.7 million live in the Six Counties.  The models used in the Twenty-six Counties have catchment areas for 1 million people.  By this model, Belfast City Hospital will not be able to facilitate the people of Donegal.  A more imaginative and creative approach needs to be taken in providing health services in the north west.  Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim have a combined population of 300,000 people.  If taken with the population of Northern Ireland, the region has a population of 2 million people.  Using the Minister's model for catchment areas, it is logical there should be a satellite radiotherapy centre in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">I know the Minister has spoken to the management of Altnagelvin Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital in providing health services to people from County Donegal.  Communications between both hospitals broke down at a time when the political climate was not as good as it is now.  Will the Minister examine establishing a forum where players in the health services can come together?  There is a fantastic team in the breast cancer service at Altnagelvin Hospital.  They have been providing breast checks for women in Derry for a period of 15 years.  They have the expertise, the knowledge and the energy and they do not like the fact that five miles across the Border in places such as Muff and Quigley's Point, women from Donegal cannot be facilitated because they are not in that jurisdiction.  The energy exists at local level and among the professions, but it is up to us to be creative in what we try to provide for that natural region of the north west.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">On a concluding point, last year a woman left Letterkenny for Dublin and the journey took her seven hours.  It merited attention in the national media at the time.  During her journey the only opportunity for a stop was either at a garage or a pub.  At the time of night she was travelling she could not access any toilet facilities on that route.  I am suggesting to the Minister, that given the very good infrastructure which she and her Department have helped to put in place, along the entire N2 network from Letterkenny to Dublin, through Monaghan and Carrickmacross, that we make such centres accessible for patients who have to travel that distance in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">It is important to review this situation.  I come from a farming background and I know the good manner in which we treat animals that are being exported live.  We should be treating patients travelling for cancer treatment with the same concern.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_506">
          <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
          <p eId="para_1063">It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to participate in this important debate.  I want to focus on one aspect of cancer services of particular concern to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Deputy Reilly has pointed out that there are two specific fundamental conflicts at issue here.  There is the conflict between the Minister for Health and Children's opinion on the ability of the HSE to deliver the proposed cancer services and the different take of the HSE chief executive, Professor Drumm, on that issue.  Then there is the conflict as regards the timetable laid down by the Minister with a delivery date of 2011, and the actual timetable, namely, 2015.  It is yet another example of the push-pull leadership of the health service, with two people in charge displaying two separate and diverging opinions and nobody taking responsibility.  It is very unfortunate that St. Luke's Hospital finds itself at the middle of this mess.  St. Luke's, as the House knows, is located in Rathgar, at the heart of my constituency in Dublin South-East and has consistently been rated one of Ireland's best hospitals.  It has delivered a quality caring service to patients throughout the length and breadth of this country.  It has built itself an unblemished reputation for the type of health service to which the entire State ought to aspire.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">It is bad enough that St. Luke's is being shut by the Minister's administration.  Even worse, in the midst of this chaotic mess there is a grave risk that it cannot be replaced properly or in time.  If neither the Minister nor the chief executive of the HSE knows when it will be replaced, how may they be trusted to tell us how this will happen?  To add insult to injury, it is proposed that St. Luke's will be replaced by a public private partnership, as alluded to by my colleague, Deputy Reilly.  For 26 years an organisation called the Friends of St. Luke's has proved itself to be just that when successive Ministers for Health, mostly from the Fianna Fáil Party, did not exactly fit the description of friends of St. Luke, given the endemic problem of underfunding, which has caused enormous suffering for cancer patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">For 26 years the Friends of St. Luke's have worked tirelessly to raise money for the hospital, through their fundraising.  The local community has done the same, as have families and friends of patients attending the hospital.  Fundraising among supporters and well wishers has gathered more than €22 million for the upkeep of the hospital.  They have to do this in order to supplement the inefficiencies and underfunding caused by successive Ministers.  Unfortunately, this Minister has presided over the same problem.  They have done this work tirelessly and with admirable energy.  I cannot understand why this is now being ignored, as the future of this hospital is very unsure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">When the Minister shuts St. Luke's I want to know whether she will refund this money to all the people who have donated generously and selflessly to ensure a proper cancer service for the country.  Deputy Harney has proven to be no friend of St. Luke's.  We have seen this over a number of years.  It is absolutely unacceptable that there is no clear co-ordination of the move towards a replacement for St. Luke's Hospital.  Replacing it with something better would be acceptable, but we have not seen any evidence for this or any reports to show it will happen.  We do not know when or where or how it will be replaced.  There is a vague commitment as regards St. James's Hospital but we have seen nothing concrete.  What worries me most, and the Minister should be concerned about this as well, is that Fianna Fáil candidates and Deputies in the run up to the last election were blaming the Minister and her party for the failures in the health service.  I witnessed this in my constituency and I see across the floor of the House, Deputy Andrews, my colleague in Dublin South-East, who has given commitments as regards St. Luke's Hospital.  The reality is that when the Minister carries out the national roll-out of cancer services we have been promised over time and the failings in the system are exposed, it is the Progressive Democrats and Deputy Harney, especially, who will be held responsible.  Fianna Fáil will wash its hands of the PDs as they did before the last election.  Rather than going from four to two Deputies I fear that her party will go from two to zero.</p>

I congratulate Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan on being selected as spokespersons on health for their respective parties.  I have no doubt they will be very busy over the next number of years and that we shall have a good deal of engagement with each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">I said in the Seanad earlier that one of the features of the last Dáil was the frequency of the meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Many of those meetings went on for more than six hours, so it was an enormous time commitment for Deputies.  In the event, many of the members of that committee lost their seats.  In fact it was quite extraordinary, so I am not sure there is a great political bonus in participation in the health committee and attendance at its meetings, although perhaps it was coincidence.  However, I look forward, genuinely, to working with the Deputies opposite.  I know they are both motivated by the same things I am, namely, to create a better health service for patients and a world class health system, which I believe we can aspire to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">Having said that, a number of matters must be put in context.  What passes for health debates in Ireland often ignore some basic facts.  At present we spend 8.9% of GNP on health.  Based on OECD figures that is equivalent to the average of the 30 wealthiest countries in the world, even though 11% of our population is over 65, as against 17% on average for the OECD.  On a purchase parity or similar basis we spend <i>per capita</i> $2,596 on health.  That figure is for 2004 and there has been a substantial increase since then and the OECD average is slightly under that, at $2,500.  I mention these statistics because there is an assumption that more money and staff would solve all the problems.  If that were the case, there would not be a single health problem in Ireland today because we have almost multiplied public expenditure on health fivefold in the last decade.  As a matter of interest, since I became Minister the proportion of public to private funding on health has increased.  It was 78:22 and it is now 80:20, which means 80% of funding on health comes from the public purse and 20% from private investment.  In the OECD, on average, it is about 73:27, a higher proportion across Europe and other countries being private investment.  It is worth noting this, given many of the comments being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I come to this debate on cancer with only one interest, namely, patients.  I am not trying to be smart when I say this.  Many of the contributions Deputies have made have been about particular interests in particular constituencies.  For too many years, local, institutional, political and professional vested interests have prevented appropriate developments in cancer care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Reference was made to Barringtons Hospital.  What happens there is happening in many public hospitals today.  Breast cancer operations are being carried out by surgeons in circumstances that are not good for patients.  We all know, not just from our expertise but also from well-documented international evidence, that if a woman has breast surgery in a centre of excellence that deals with at least 150 new cases per year, and if her individual case is assessed by a pathologist, radiologist and surgeon, her outcome will be more positive.  Her likelihood of survival will be much greater than it would be in a place where a surgeon is carrying out various other surgical procedures.  This is why we announced today that 13 hospitals will have to cease breast surgery with immediate effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">Deputy Naughten mentioned Roscommon hospital and should note that breast surgery was stopped there 18 months ago.  The hospitals ordered to cease breast surgery are dealing with less than 20 cases per year and only two deal with double-digit figures.  Portiuncula Hospital had 17 cases and Louth County Hospital had 15.  The rest of the hospitals deal with approximately one to four cases, bearing in mind that one in this group dealt with seven cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">The decision regarding centres of excellence was made in the interest of patients.  It is known that volume and multidisciplinary care must be taken into account when treating cancer.  The survival rate improves by 20% when one is treated in a centre of excellence with multidisciplinary care.  In other words, it ensures the survival of one in five patients who would not normally survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">This leads me to the issue raised by Deputy Creighton, namely, St. Luke's Hospital.  It is recognised, both by Irish experts, including the doctors who work at St. Luke's, and international experts, that stand-alone radiation facilities are not in the best interest of patients.  Patients should be treated in a multidisciplinary environment where medical oncology, surgery and radiation therapy are all provided.  This approach is the approach of the future and the eight centres announced today will adopt it.  The only exception to the high-volume stipulation will be in Letterkenny where, for reasons of geography and distance, there is to be an outreach centre.  This centre will be linked to the one in Galway and will be quality assured.  The staff will be members of staff in Galway and will carry out the work in Letterkenny on an outreach basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">Somebody made a comment at the announcement of the new programme to the effect that a parent with a child who is very sick with cancer will go almost anywhere to ensure he or she is treated appropriately.  The same applies to ourselves.  In the past week, I lost a friend to brain cancer.  A couple of weeks before she died she examined the possibility of going to the United States for a clinical trial.  She knew she had a slim chance but that is what she wanted to do.  As it happened, she was not able to travel.  These are the kinds of options patients and their families consider with a view to getting better.  They will do almost anything.  Thankfully, we do not need people to do almost anything because we can provide eight cancer centres for the population of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I was asked about the time it will take to roll out the breast cancer treatment centres.  Some 60% will be completed in the first year, that is, during 2008, and 90% will be completed by 2009.  The 22 existing centres will be reduced to eight.  Some 50% of the cancer centres will be completed during 2008 and 80% to 90% will be completed by 2009.  This is the target the HSE has set.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Today we announced the appointment of Professor Tom Keane, an Irishman and graduate of University College Dublin.  He completed his initial oncology training at St. Vincent's Hospital and has been working in Canada for 35 years as a medical oncologist, both as a clinician and manager.  He set up the cancer services in Ontario and subsequently in British Columbia, where I met him when I visited two years ago.  I was very impressed and asked him whether he intended to come home.  He had no plans to do so at the time but has decided to take the position offered for approximately two years in order to set up our programme.  We are very fortunate to have somebody of his standing, experience and expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">British Columbia, at the time of my visit, had 4.1 million people, which is roughly the same as the population of Ireland.  The province has ten inpatient beds dedicated to radiation oncology while there are 179 in St. Luke's alone.  Professor Keane makes the point that the Irish approach is not only expensive but also inappropriate.  The most expensive beds in any country are acute hospital beds.  Clearly, treating patients on an ambulatory basis, as is possible for most patients receiving radiation therapy, or having them stay in hostel-type or hotel-type accommodation represents the model of the future.  This is the kind of innovation we must support and which is working extraordinarily successfully in Canada.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">In Ireland our machinery works for six and a half to seven hours per day, which does not represent very good use of linear accelerators.  In Canada the machines work for ten hours per day.  When I am asked how many linear accelerators we need, I reply that it depends very much on the length of time for which they can be worked.  If our machines can be worked for ten hours per day, which would involve industrial relations issues, we can achieve a lot more for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">In British Columbia the period of 28 days from the time a decision is made that one requires radiation oncology has been reduced to 14 days.  This is an incredibly short period, as Deputy Reilly would acknowledge.  We are a long way off that in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">When Deputy Reilly was concluding his contribution, he asked why the private sector can provide radiation oncology facilities in 18 months.  This is a very valid question.  I asked the HSE why it takes the public sector over ten years given that the private sector can build a new state-of-the-art facility in Waterford in approximately 18 to 20 months and commission it a couple of months later.  I accept that public procurement procedures must be followed and that we must put the work to tender.  This causes delays in putting public facilities in place but I do not accept the provision of the facilities in question can take as long as has been said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">I met officials from the HSE and my Department this morning regarding the roll-out of radiotherapy facilities.  I am assured by the HSE that we will have the capacity we require in the public system by 2010.  As has been acknowledged, the number of cancers will increase greatly and we must therefore continue with our programme of investment over the coming years so the required radiotherapy facilities will be in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">When the Government made the decision to roll out the national strategy two years ago, I said that two new linear accelerators would be installed in St. Luke's and that they would be commissioned from the start of next January.  I also stated a facility would be provided according to traditional procurement practices at Beaumont and St. James's hospitals, and this is going ahead.  Those facilities, together with the services currently being procured by the HSE on behalf of patients from private providers, will provide the capacity we require by 2010.  We are ensuring capacity at present at Whitfield and the facility in Limerick, which is being provided by the Mater Hospital and built using the Limerick trust fund.  The majority of patients being treated at Whitfield are public patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">If facilities are safe it should not really matter whether they are funded privately, publicly or by both means.  The main consideration is to ensure the standards we expect apply to both the public and private sectors.  Although the newly-established Health Information and Quality Authority was given responsibility in the first instance for public services and services procured by the public system from private providers, it was not possible, according to my legal advice, to extend its remit to private health providers until such time as we have a system of authorisation, accreditation and licensing for them.  This is why I established the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, which is chaired by Dr. Madden and due to report in nine months, to consider issues pertaining to licensing and authorisation.  It would not be acceptable to have one standard for public providers — not just providers of cancer services — and a different one for private providers.  Patients are entitled to expect that the Government, including the Minister for Health and Children, will quality assure services being provided in the State.  That is not the case because, until now, we have never really examined the issues of licensing and accreditation.  Our performance in that regard has represented a deficit in this country's provision of health facilities.  We have not studied the standards in the public system either.  I acknowledged this earlier when I spoke about what was happening in Barringtons Hospital.  That brings me to the issue of who knew what and when.  I was not aware of the issues in that hospital until the August bank holiday weekend of this year.  I did not know that issues had been raised — that is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_1095">When the doctor in question, Professor Rajnish Gupta, contacted the Department, he was asked to make a complaint to the Medical Council.  He was asked to do so again a few weeks ago, but it has not happened.  Some of the complaints made by Professor Gupta also apply to the public system.  We do not have multidisciplinary assessment in many of the hospitals in which we are ceasing breast surgery forthwith — they do not have many of the things about which Professor Gupta complained.  He did not complain about specific patients until August of this year.  I am not making a big issue of it other than to say we do not have any authority, other than through the Medical Council, to take action if a doctor is performing procedures which are unsafe.  As things stand, standards, etc., are issues for the council, although they will be issues for the Health Information and Quality Authority in the future.  We have initiated an investigation, chaired by the former chief medical officer in Northern Ireland, Dr. Campbell, which could not happen without the agreement of the hospital.  I understand that the investigation, which will involve a look back on all the cases which have been dealt with over recent years, will be completed some time in November.  Dr. Campbell performed a similar role in Northern Ireland, when 8,000 cases were re-examined.  I hope very few patients will have to be referred for further analysis or treatment.  It is my understanding that that will be the case.  The reality is that breast surgery, mammography and other treatments for symptomatic breast cancer were being carried out in far too many places in unsafe circumstances and without appropriate supervision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Reference was made to the roll-out of the BreastCheck facility, under which cervical screening and other forms of screening are facilitated.  I wish I could roll out a national screening programme by pressing a green button.  I know of no country in which such a programme has not been rolled out over a number of years.  The facility in Cork will be rolled out next month, which is also when the new facility in Galway will open.  The roll-out started in Roscommon a couple of months ago.  Much of the screening is done in mobile units.  It is obviously more convenient for women to travel to such units than to have to travel to centres.  Approximately 4% of the women who are screened are called back, and less than half of those ever have an issue.  Those who do are asked to travel to the designated centres at that point for treatment.  The roll-out will happen throughout the country from October.  It is clear that it will take approximately 24 months to roll the service out to every woman who is covered by the screening programme.  The roll-out of the cervical screening programme will start in January.  Money has been provided this year to hire the staff who will be needed for the programme.  We have increased expenditure on cancer services by approximately 60% this year, mainly to provide for the roll-out of the breast and cervical screening programmes.  Time is of the essence in these cases, of course.  We want to get the results back as soon as possible from the time the smear test is done.  It is expected that it will happen within a month, but it is hoped that it can be expedited.  The HSE recently outsourced a number of smears to a company in the United States because it was encountering huge delays, which were not acceptable to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">I was asked about the satellite centre in Letterkenny in the context of a speech about the situation in County Donegal.  We have reached agreement with Belfast City Hospital for radiation therapy services to be offered to women from Donegal.  No more than a small number of women from that county have been treated in Belfast to date, unfortunately.  I will meet my counterpart, the Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, on Friday of next week to discuss, among other things, the provision of radiation oncology services to people from the north west.  It makes eminent sense for the authorities on either side of the Border to work together to provide facilities that can be used by people in both jurisdictions, including people in the north west.  All of the evidence suggests that if we want to have world-class standards, given that we have a small population, we will have to develop critical mass.  I believe we will be able to reach good agreements not only in the area of cancer but also in other areas of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">There are significant opportunities for co-operation on a North-South basis, particularly in the area of tertiary services.  It was announced today that just one centre in the country will deal with brain cancer, for example, of which there are 130 or 140 cases each year.  It would not be safe or wise to divide brain cancer services among a number of centres.  We want to retain all this country's expertise in that area in a single national centre.  We might work with the Northern Ireland authorities to develop a single and shared facility on the island to cater for some tertiary facilities.  I refer not only to cancer but also to paediatric care and other areas.  In such circumstances, the health services on either side of the Border could procure services from each other.  I would be strongly in favour of making that happen.  I hope the establishment of the new Administration in the Northern Ireland Assembly will allow us to enter into agreements which are in the interests of all the patients on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">I will put the recent freeze on recruitment in context.  The public health system employs approximately 120,000 people.  The Health Service Executive decided to freeze recruitment for September, to help it work within its increased budget of €1.2 billion for 2007.  To put that decision in perspective, it will affect between 200 and 300 people.  I will respond to the comments which were made in this regard about Sligo General Hospital, with which I am familiar.  Some 30 nurses were employed in Sligo over the summer months to cover for nurses who were going on holidays.  Almost 700 nurses are employed in the hospital.  As the holiday period has concluded, it is no longer necessary to retain the 30 nurses.  It has not been made clear publicly that the contracts of the 30 nurses have not been renewed for that reason.  A locum consultant was appointed to the hospital to allow one of the orthopaedic surgeons at the hospital, who was a member of the Medical Council, to attend to his duties with the council.  When the consultant in question retired, and a new full-time consultant was appointed in his place, there was no longer a need to retain the services of the locum.  A consultant in gynaecology and obstetrics at Sligo General Hospital who was planning to retire was asked to stay on for some time as a locum because the person who had been appointed to replace him was unable to take up his new position for a while.  His period as a locum has elapsed and his replacement has arrived at the hospital.  It is clear that the locum position will not be retained.  Two consultants were employed to deal with long waiting lists in the surgery and diagnostic specialties within the ear, nose and throat unit in Sligo.  The waiting lists have since been cleared.  That is the story in Sligo.  It is not the story that is being publicly presented.</p>

          <p eId="para_1105">This matter will be addressed in this House later this evening during the Adjournment debate.  The facts I have just outlined are in line with the information I have received from the Health Service Executive.  I would like to put the freeze in HSE recruitment in context.  There are 12.2 nurses per 1,000 people in Ireland.  The OECD average is nine per 1,000.  The corresponding figure in France is seven per 1,000.  If we are to honour the agreement we reached with the nurses during the dispute, we will have to remove 2.9 million nursing hours from the public health care system between now and June 2008.  We agreed to introduce a 37.5 hour week on a cost-neutral basis without any diminution of services to patients, which will be a huge challenge.  If the system cannot deal with the challenges it faces this September, I do not know how it will be able to deal with the challenge of removing 2.9 million hours on a cost-neutral basis without any diminution of services to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">We have to consider how we can do things better.  It is not always a question of more money and more staff.  We are lucky that the success of the Irish economy over the past decade has allowed us to make substantial investments in the health care system.  The current rate of increase — between 11% and 12% — will not be sustained in the years to come.  I emphasise that I am talking about the rate of increase — I have heard commentators saying there will be no increase next year, which is not the case.  One needs to increase the bill every year if one is to pay existing staff.  Changing the way we do business is as important as making new investments because the economy will not be able to sustain increases at the current rate.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
          <p eId="para_1107">My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, has clearly set out the significant commitment of this Government and the HSE to cancer control as evidenced by today's announcement of the appointment of Professor Keane to lead the establishment of the national cancer control programme and the designation of managed cancer control networks and cancer centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">There have already been significant developments in dealing with cancer that have benefited patients throughout the country.  These are based on a clear strategy for cancer control and substantial additional investments across the continuum of cancer including prevention, screening, treatment and supportive and palliative care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Cancer survival is improving in Ireland for all of the major cancers.  The National Cancer Registry compared cancer survival data between 1995 and 1997 with data between 1998 and 2000.  Our overall relative survival from cancer increased from 48% to 50% for women and 38% to 44% for men.  According to the registry these increases are statistically significant.  For women, there were increases in survival in the four commonest cancers, namely breast, lung, colorectal and lymphoma.  For men, survival improved for almost all cancers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">This Government is not complacent in respect of its successes in this area.  The National Cancer Registry predicts that cancer numbers in Ireland will have increased from 22,000 a year at present to 43,000 by 2020.  The numbers of potentially fatal cancers will more than double, from 13,800 to 28,800, in the same period.  About two thirds of this increase is expected to be due to the increasing number of elderly people in the population, and the remainder to upward trends in the incidence of some of the common cancers.  This anticipated increase in cancer numbers will place a major additional burden on cancer services and must be considered in current planning for cancer control.  The Government is committed to significant additional investment based on the reform programme being implemented by the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">There has been a transformation in the range and capacity of cancer services since 1996 based on a sustained increase in cancer funding.  Since 1997, approximately €1 billion has been invested in cancer services nationally and more than 100 additional consultants and 360 additional clinical nurse specialists have been appointed in key areas of cancer care.  More than 96,000 patients — inpatients and day patients — were discharged from hospital following a diagnosis of cancer in 2006, an increase of 75% over 1997.  More than 60,000 people were treated for cancer as day cases in 2006, an increase of 140% over 1997.  Additional revenue funding of €20.5 million has been allocated in 2007 for cancer control, an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">BreastCheck screened 64,000 women in 2006, an increase of 7% over 2005.  I allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million to BreastCheck this year to meet the costs of national roll-out, bringing BreastCheck's revenue budget to €21.7 million in 2007.  BreastCheck will be rolled out nationally from next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">The Irish cervical cancer screening programme will commence national roll-out in January 2008.  Additional revenue funding of €5 million has been allocated this year for this purpose and an additional 30 posts have been approved.  Approximately 230,000 women will be screened annually based on an 80% take up.  Women aged 25 to 44 will be screened every three years and women aged 45 to 60 every five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">Patients in Ireland are benefiting from the development of a clinical trials network across the country.  Between 2002 and 2008 the health research board will have invested more than €21 million to support this initiative.  The number of staff involved in cancer clinical trials has risen from five when the initiative started to 105 today.  The Irish clinical oncology research group recruited the 2000th patient during 2006.  The group expects to recruit 600 patients in 2007 rising to 1000 per year by 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">The National Development Programme 2007-2013 includes major investment in the implementation of the national cancer control strategy.  A sum of €415 million is provided for the implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology, mainly by public private partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">By any standards these are substantial achievements that have benefited and will continue to benefit cancer patients and their families.  We recognise that a cancer diagnosis is a traumatic event for patients and their families.  Our health system needs to continue to expand and develop the services to meet the clinical, social and supportive needs of this community.  We have significant opportunities now to cure cancer and to ensure that patients with cancer survive longer with improved quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">Considerable progress is being made in implementing the national plan for radiation oncology which has been supported by substantial additional investment.  We are already seeing the return on the substantial investments in Cork and Galway.  In Cork University Hospital more than 2,000 new patients were treated over the four linear accelerators in 2006, constituting more than 35,000 treatments.  This was an increase of almost 5,800 treatments over 2005.  The waiting time for patients to receive treatment has halved from eight to ten weeks to three to four weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">In University College Hospital Galway, almost 1,000 patients were treated in 2006.  The number of treatments increased from 11,300 in 2005 to 18,500 in 2006.  The hospital expects treatments provided to increase by 7% this year over last year.  The main developments to date include the procurement of additional capacity, namely two linear accelerators for St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar.  These linear accelerators will be commissioned in February and March 2008 and two replacement linear accelerators will be commissioned in August and September 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Interim facilities have been provided at Beaumont and St. James's Hospital.  The contract for the design consultants has commenced and the evaluation process for procurement of the supply contract is also under way.  A technical subgroup is preparing the equipping specification for the phase 1 developments.  The HSE has appointed a project director and project board for the plan.  A project team was also established comprising representatives from the HSE and the National Development Finance Agency.  The team meets twice monthly and is progressing all procurement and planning issues.  Four leading international experts have validated the population needs assessments, technical specifications, process mapping and other outputs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Patients are being referred to the radiation centre at Limerick Regional Hospital.  The HSE is working with Limerick Regional Hospital to ensure its service delivery is integrated with the radiation oncology department at University College Hospital, Galway. This is an important element of the implementation of the national plan for radiation oncology.</p>

I intend to continue the approach of Deputy McManus, particularly in disagreeing with the Minister, Deputy Harney, in her drive to create a two tier health service.  The Labour Party is committed to a one tier health service that addresses patients on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.  We disagree with the provision of co-located public and private hospitals.  I will continue in the vein of Deputy McManus in that regard.  I look forward to working with the Minister for Health and Children but will not agree with her in many areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The Minister referred to Ireland's spending on health in comparison to other OECD countries.  However, we do not receive real value for money in the health service.  We do not have enough early interventions which is precisely the issue being addressed in the motion.  More early interventions would mean we would not have to spend as much money on the more costly elements of the health service.  When there has not been early detection and intervention, treatment is much more expensive.  Therefore, I congratulate Deputy Reilly and the Fine Gael Party for tabling the motion which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">An integrated cancer strategy is required to include prevention and delivery of services.  I agree with Deputy McHugh that integration is not happening across the range of services provided.  The Minister referred to the announcement today by the HSE of the national cancer control programme, a subject on which I note she has delivered a speech.  She stated she was given clear information on the roll-out of BreastCheck, the figures being 60% in year one and 80% in year two, and 80% to 90% for general cancers by 2009.  I am not aware of any timeframes referred to in the HSE announcement, which is a concern.  We need to know the timeframes for the programmes announced today.  The Labour Party agrees with the Minister on the provision of centres of excellence which will have the required critical mass of numbers using the service, as well as multidisciplinary teams.  This is the appropriate way to proceed.  I am concerned at the lack of a timeframe in the HSE announcement and an indication of the resources to be provided in these eight centres of excellence within an appropriate timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">I am concerned also about the list of hospitals which must cease performing surgical procedures.  There is no indication of what will happen to people living in the catchment areas of these hospitals and whether they will be accommodated in their nearest centre of excellence within an appropriate timeframe.  I question whether transportation will be provided for them.  This is an incomplete picture of what will happen.  There is a concern which was also raised at the time of publication of the Hanly report that the smaller hospitals will suffer and extra resources might not be provided in the larger centres to ensure patients will be properly treated.  I do not note a commitment in the document to the welfare of patients in these areas and the provision of resources in the centres of excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">In 2003 I shared a platform with Professor Gupta, the head of the centre of excellence in the Mid-West Regional Hospital in Limerick, on the subject of the roll-out of BreastCheck.   At the time we were promised a roll-out of BreastCheck by 2006 but now we are informed it will be rolled out by the end of this year.  I sincerely hope this timeframe will be adhered to, unlike the previous ones set for BreastCheck.  The region where both the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and I live is still not being treated equally in terms of access to preventive treatment of cancers.  Early detection makes the difference between life and death and it is not acceptable that it has taken so long to roll out BreastCheck for everyone.  We have campaigned on the streets to have this process speeded up and this is coming to fruition.  Even at the time I shared the platform with Professor Gupta he was concerned that his centre of excellence was not receiving the resources it needed to provide a full and speedy service.  A month ago he publicised the issue of Barringtons Hospital and highlighted his concern that his centre was not being adequately resourced.  It is an excellent service for those who are treated but there is a problem with the waiting list.  Acute and urgent cases will be treated immediately but it is not as well resourced as it should be.  The failure to roll out BreastCheck and the waiting time are the reasons people choose private establishments such as Barringtons Hospital.  This is of serious concern considering that there is no quality control system in place in the private health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">With regard to the provision of radiotherapy services, Limerick and Waterford were originally to be excluded from the provision of a centre of excellence.  As a result the people of Limerick set about fund-raising to provide such a service on a private basis to which public patients were given access subsequently.  This was a long battle over a couple of years before public funding was provided to pay for the treatment of public patients in the privately run radiotherapy centre.  Health policy should not merely be a reaction to a regional movement but rather should be properly planned from the beginning.  Hundreds of reports were published when Deputy Martin was Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">There is a lack of quality control in the private sector, for which nobody is taking responsibility.  When Professor Gupta made his concerns known to the Department in 2005, the HSE stated it was not responsible because its remit only covered the public service.  We need to know where responsibility lies and also who is responsible for pathology laboratories.  Many of the concerns expressed in the midlands and other areas are connected with testing procedures.  I refer to the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> report on testing being carried out in the United States and the diagnoses which are of concern to Cork University Hospital such as the double checking of mammographies.  Quality control and geographical equality are my main concerns.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_518">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_1128">The latest scandals in our crisis ridden health service and the failure of the Government to deliver radiotherapy show once and for all that the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, are unfit to govern.  The ill-conceived, confused and mismanaged approach of the Government and the HSE, particularly in the provision of vital cancer treatment services, is a far bigger scandal than anything we have addressed in the Chamber today.  As Deputy O'Sullivan stated, lives are being lost as a result of these failures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Cancer patients are being denied lifesaving treatment because successive Governments have failed to provide the radiation oncology facilities required.  This dire need has been recognised for many years and the Government has had ample time and a booming economy in which to plan and to budget for the provision of radiotherapy centres.  Now, we find that the plan for delivery of such centres by 2011 is in chaos.  The State could and should have taken the lead and provided them directly as public facilities open to all on the basis of need alone.  Instead, the Government committed itself to public private partnerships to deliver them, but then it was found that these would take too long.  A review was ordered and we now find that a delay until 2014 or 2015 cannot, allegedly, be avoided.  The Minister for Health and Children has told us the planned centres may have to be provided entirely by the private sector, while Professor Drumm has told us the public sector can do it.  Delay is piled upon delay and patients are dying in the face of a clear lack of uniform approach to these very pressing matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">It must be pointed out that the current plan for radiotherapy centres is itself deeply flawed and leaves the northern half of the country with totally inadequate provision.  Even this flawed plan, however, will not be delivered as promised.  I heard the Minister in her response refer to the north west.  I welcome the establishment of a satellite service or full service for radiotherapy in the north west which is what people actually want and need, but we must also talk about the north east where there is a blanket ignoring of the people's needs.  It is not acceptable, especially where there is an opportunity for cross-Border co-operation in delivery.  Cancer treatment service delivery is a complete shambles and is presided over by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Taoiseach, both of whom I hold equally responsible.  The Dáil is the tribunal of the people, a very important point to restate.  It is where the Deputies named should be challenged and held to account for their gross mismanagement and irresponsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">The Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Green Party Government is attempting to shirk its responsibility for the chaotic state of cancer care services.  The mammography issue at Barringtons Hospital in Limerick — also referred to by the Minister — has exposed the failure of the Government to ensure that private hospitals are properly accountable.  The Health Information and Quality Authority was established in legislation last year, but empowered only to monitor services provided by the HSE.  It does not have powers to hold private hospitals fully accountable.  While I pointed this out in the Dáil debate on the HIQA Bill, the Government chose to ignore it and ploughed on regardless.  Through the infamous co-location scheme, the Government is encouraging the development of more private, for-profit hospitals without proper accountability.  While none of them is present, I wonder if Green Party Members remember their opposition to co-location on which they are now very silent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">Fianna Fáil-led Governments have presided in the past decade over a catalogue of failures and delays in cancer care.  These include the failure to roll out fully the long promised BreastCheck service, with many women having to wait until 2009 and beyond to get their first appointment.  The Government has presided over the failure to deliver the long-promised radiation oncology centres and failed to plan radiation oncology services for other regions, including the north east, which has led to completely inadequate provision in the northern half of the island.  This is compounded by the failure to ensure full cross-Border co-operation in cancer services.  The Government has failed to establish national screening services for cervical cancer and other cancers such as prostate cancer.  The Government has failed to heed the testimony of current and former patients and staff at St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin on the need to review the decision to close that centre of excellence.  What is needed urgently is comprehensive public cancer care provided in the public health care system and available to all based on need alone, regardless of ability to pay and without discrimination based on geographic location.  Nothing less is acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">The motion comes as the Government presides over cutbacks in our hospitals, with the HSE acting as its enforcer.  It has ordered the lay-off of 30 nurses and four consultants at Sligo General Hospital and no amount of trick-acting with words can take away from the real impact and effect of that decision.  The Government is ending 24-hour accident and emergency provision at Ennis General Hospital and implementing cuts in Mullingar, Clonmel and Tullamore.  These cutbacks have been imposed in the aftermath of a general election and in advance of a budget which promises more public spending restrictions.  The Government has refused to use the unprecedented prosperity of the past decade to end the two-tier system and transform our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The Government is now cutting services to patients.  If the Minister, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm believe, as they claim, that these cuts will not affect patient care, they are clearly living in cloud-cuckoo land.  The Minister and the chief executive seem to be losing touch with reality.  How else can one explain Professor Drumm's assertion that the use of hotels is the way forward for our hospitals?  The Government has ensured there will be no democratic accountability for these decisions.  It has insulated the HSE from any responsibility to the local communities it is supposed to serve.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has insulated herself from proper accountability in the Dáil.  These cuts must be resisted.  I urge communities to mobilise to resist them and to turn out in the maximum numbers possible in Ennis on Saturday and at any future mobilisation which gives voice to the people's need in this critical area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I welcome the two newly appointed health spokespersons for Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is delighted to see that I am still in that role on behalf of Sinn Féin.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_1136">In their pre-election promises the Taoiseach and Minister for Health and Children said no health cuts would be made and that more than 4,000 health workers would be recruited in the post-election period.  The recent health cuts have completely undermined any credibility the new Government might have had.  We cannot believe a word it says.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, promised two weeks ago that there would be no cutbacks at Sligo General Hospital.  We learn now that he is uncomfortable about the cutbacks which have been made.  It is two weeks since he told <i>The Sligo Champion</i> that patient care should not be hit in any way by cutbacks being implemented at Sligo General Hospital.  The promises of the Minister and Minister of State that such measures would not reduce services were plainly inaccurate.  Today’s developments on critical services and the roll out of BreastCheck and radiotherapy are very disappointing.  Delivery will depend on the capacity of services in Belfast to take patients from the region.  It is appalling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">Sligo General Hospital has lost four consultants and 30 nurses.  The scale of the cuts at the hospital exceeds anything proposed for any other location nationally.  The cutting of the consultant posts will be especially disappointing for women in the north west with the loss of a consultant obstetrician gynaecologist and a general surgeon with special expertise in breast surgery.  Other specialties affected are orthopaedics and ear, nose and throat services, which are also critical.  These extensive cutbacks in front-line staff will adversely affect the quality and availability of patient care.  The IMO president, Dr. Paula Gilvarry, has said the decision will cause outpatient appointments and clinics to be cancelled and result in longer waiting lists.  The IMO president would not make such a statement without specific knowledge.  The chairman of Sligo General Hospital medical board, Dr. Niall Considine, has said that breast operations will be reduced by 50%, while there are over 360 placed patients on the waiting list for surgery for more than 12 months.  These major cutbacks will result in longer waiting times for outpatient appointments and the cancellation of clinics leading to greater hardship and stress for patients.  There is no arguing with these facts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">I am very disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Harney, is not present to deal directly with this matter.  She is trying to defend cuts which are doing grievous damage to patient care.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to ensure the standards of care and access to the service are maintained.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Harney, to urgently address these serious concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">The budget is the responsibility of the HSE but the Minister has ultimate responsibility.  Look at the scale of the cutbacks.  The staff in the north-west region cover a huge area.  It is most disappointing to hear the Minister, as late as today, briefly allude to this and offer a feeble excuse.  There is huge unrest about this issue, as my colleague Deputy Scanlan will agree.  No spin will alter the fact of the cutbacks in this area, while up to €13 billion is being spent on health care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">Before the general election we were promised the roll out of BreastCheck in 2007, in addition to radiotherapy and other oncology services.  However, the IMO president, Dr. Paula Gilvarry, has said this decision will cause outpatient appointments and clinics to be cancelled, as well as longer waiting lists for patients.  The most eminent consultant in Sligo, Dr. Niall Considine, in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> said that breast operations will be reduced by 50%.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, should reply not just to me but also to Dr. Considine, who knows his business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">This relates to the oncology service.  People are dying in the north west because they do not have services.  They feel the cutbacks and the lack of BreastCheck and radiotherapy services.  A doctor who provides breast surgery is being removed.  Dr. Niall Considine has stated as much.  I demand quality health care.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Harney, who knew this issue was to be discussed and mentioned it earlier, would not wait to reply to the debate.  It clearly indicates what she thinks of the roll out of services in Sligo General Hospital.</p>

          <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_520">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_1142">I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  The provision of services at Sligo General Hospital is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The Health Service Executive has informed the Department that Sligo General Hospital is reducing temporary staff in some nursing, medical and catering posts.  This does not involve any withdrawal of the core services provided by the hospital.  The circumstances are specific to each staff category and I will explain these for each.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">With regard to nursing staff, as in previous years, in the summer months additional temporary staff were employed, mainly to cover annual and other leave.  A total of 30 people were employed on a temporary basis for this reason.  This compares with a total permanent nursing staff of over 700 at Sligo General in whole time equivalent terms.  As in every organisation, small or large, public sector or private sector, when permanent staff have returned from their summer holidays, the temporary cover staff are no longer needed.  This is what happened at Sligo General Hospital.  In no organisation could this arrangement be described as a cutback in staffing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">Four temporary consultant posts, which were contracted for specific temporary purposes and time periods, have recently come to the end of their contracts.  These posts were in addition to the permanent consultant complement of the hospital, which is not affected and remains the same.  In orthopaedics, one of the three permanent consultants was a member of the Medical Council until his recent retirement.  To maintain full orthopaedic services a locum was employed while this consultant was away on Medical Council business.  Following his retirement, a new permanent consultant was appointed and has taken up full-time duty in Sligo General Hospital.  There was therefore no requirement to maintain the locum position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">In obstetrics/gynaecology, one of the three permanent consultants retired in July, his replacement having taken up duty prior to this.  To ensure a smooth transition, the retiring consultant was contracted on a short-term locum basis following his retirement.  This arrangement can now be discontinued, and the specialty has its full complement of three consultants.  In surgery and ENT, a temporary additional consultant was employed in both these specialties during 2006 to help reduce waiting lists.  They were not intended as permanent appointments.  The hospital has had the benefit of these temporary appointments in reducing waiting lists and seeing more patients.  However, within its overall funding the hospital has to make choices about which service pressures most need to be addressed from time to time, and it was decided at this time to discontinue these temporary contracts, to allow the funds to be used for other service priorities.  The recently opened new neonatal intensive care unit, for example, which provides a much better facility for newborns, required and received more nurses to staff it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">With regard to the Deputy's reference to patients waiting over 12 months, the Minister understands that to date this year, 207 inpatients have been referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Patients waiting longer than three months are entitled to apply for treatment through the NTPF.  I hope Sligo General Hospital would make every effort to reduce its waiting lists by referring appropriate patients to the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">Overall consultant staffing has been significantly enhanced at Sligo General Hospital.  An additional appointment has been made in paediatrics and radiology.  Further consultants in emergency medicine, pathology and radiology have been approved and a consultant neurologist will take up post in January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">It is clear that these measures do not entail a reduction in the hospital's core services, nor will they adversely affect the quality and safety of patient care.  Every effort is being made to ensure the hospital's resources are managed in an efficient and effective manner to protect core services and activity, and to deal with emerging service pressures.  This year, our health services are seeing significant increases in funding, staffing and patient services.  That is the record so far and will be the overall outcome at the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">The Government is clearly committed to the provision of services at Sligo General Hospital.  The HSE is fully aware that it must remain within the employment ceiling negotiated with the Department of Finance.  The Minister is confident that the measures taken by the HSE with regard to Sligo General Hospital will assist the hospital to manage its services within budget.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_521">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_1150">Is é seo an chéad uair a bhfuil mé ag labhairt sa Dáil.  Dá bhrí sin, gabhaim buíochas le muintir Maigh Eo as ucht an tacaíocht a thug siad dom ag an toghchán deireanach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">Twelve years ago the IDA, in association with Mayo County Council, acquired a site in Ballina to develop a technology park.  The site was acquired in the face of considerable local expert advice not to proceed with the acquisition, owing to known difficulties with the title of the site and the fact that, at the time, the site had no services.  In the intervening period Mayo County Council invested in the site to install the relevant services.  However, the title issue has still not been resolved.  Throughout that time the advice provided by the IDA to relevant Ministers and to departmental officials was that it would be sorted or was on the verge of being sorted.  That advice might be in the reply to be given this evening by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">It is local knowledge that the title issues are still outstanding and are just as far from resolution.  I call on the Minister and the Department to intervene.  We have waited 12 years for a site.  The IDA refuses to acknowledge that there are other serviced industrial sites available in Ballina for potential investors and employers.  The issue has been highlighted by recent figures from the Central Statistics Office, which show that 15.8% of the labour force in Ballina is unemployed.  It is the largest figure for a town of its size in the country.  The average comparable figure is 8.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">The reluctance of the IDA and other agencies to invest in Ballina contrasts with the private investment made by local business people in recent years.  New hotels, retail units and services have considerably transformed the town's ability to be an attractive destination.  There has been considerable Government investment in roads, broadband and currently in connecting Ballina to the national gas network.  The challenges presented to Ballina by the IDA in terms of its infrastructure are being addressed.  What is lacking is a willingness on behalf of the IDA to intervene and take a position to resolve the issue.  The attitude of the IDA to date has been incredibly disappointing.  The advice it passes to officials and Ministers is that it will be sorted.  We are extremely concerned when we consider the experience of Castlebar and Westport where technology parks were developed.  Were prizes going at the Chelsea Flower Show for the quality of the trees on display the IDA would win.  However, no jobs or units are located in the parks.  When we get a park up and running we will maintain maximum pressure to locate industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">The recent decision by Coca Cola to expand its workforce at a time when it was cutting its workforce everywhere else — and we sympathise in particular with Drogheda — demonstrates the quality of the workforce available to any potential investor in Ballina or Mayo.  It is extremely frustrating to sit down with parents who make considerable investment in their children's education only to see it used in cities and towns in other parts of the country because of the lack of industrial and other jobs in the Ballina area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">We have an extremely qualified and willing workforce.  What we lack is a proper site and the will and commitment of IDA Ireland to develop the site and Ballina as a location.  I ask the Minister of State to intervene personally to resolve the issue.  If we cannot have this specific site within the next 12 weeks, the time has come to move to another site.  Otherwise, we will have to wait another 12 years before we have a site to put on offer.  We waited 12 years and surely 12 weeks can resolve the problem.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_522">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1156">I congratulate Deputy Calleary on his election to the House.  His family has a proud tradition of representing Mayo and I wish him well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">The management of IDA Ireland's property portfolio, including the development of industrial parks in particular areas, is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency and not a matter in which I or my Department have a statutory function.  Overall, IDA invests significantly in the provision of planned and focused property solutions in the west region and specifically in County Mayo.  This is an essential marketing tool in the process of attracting potential new investors to County Mayo.  The Government through the IDA has spent almost €6 million in property development in County Mayo, a cumulative spend in the four-year period up to December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">With regard to Ballina, IDA Ireland has been engaged in protracted discussions with Mayo County Council regarding the acquisition of a 27-acre site on the Sligo road in Ballina.  The agency requires "unburdened title" to the site before it can begin development work on the land.  As the Deputy may be aware, progress in this matter was delayed due to lengthy legal proceedings over which the IDA had no control and to which the agency was not a party.  I am now informed by the agency that these proceedings have been completed.  It is in regular contact with the council and expects an early resolution of the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">The Government is determined to see the emergence of strong magnets of attraction in each region.  For its successful development each region needs to develop clear competitive reasons for companies to locate there rather than elsewhere and effective local leadership is vital in this regard.  Under the national spatial strategy Castlebar and Ballina form a linked hub.  Both these towns, together with the town of Westport, are priority locations for Government.  The IDA actively promotes them for new foreign direct investment.  The Government recognises the need to provide high-value employment opportunities in the key towns in Mayo which provide sustainable long-term jobs.  The IDA on behalf of Government is committed to the development of Mayo and works continually with its existing client base to deepen the global strategic importance of the Irish operations within their parent corporations.  At present, 21 IDA supported companies in Mayo employ more than 3,000 people in permanent employment with approximately 500 more in temporary and contract employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">Working in strong partnership with other organisations at national and local level, the IDA can support and influence the delivery of some of the conditions that are necessary to attract investment.  All of the development agencies under the remit of my Department are actively involved in the Mayo County Development Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The overall aim of Government policy is to transform Irish companies into market-focused and innovation-driven businesses to increase their exports, sales and employment.  The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, has approved funding support of more than €5.3 million and paid more than €3.1 million to companies in County Mayo in the period from 2004 to date.  This financial support will facilitate the companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development.  As part of its remit, Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies, with detailed export plans, which are establishing or expanding business in the county as part of the Border, midland and west region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">Community enterprise centres provide a much needed business infrastructure and incentive for small new company start-ups in disadvantaged areas.  Working in partnership with the local community, Enterprise Ireland has approved support for a total of ten community enterprise centres in County Mayo, some of which have received support for several different phases of development.  These centres are located in Ballina, Ballyhaunis, Brickens, Castlebar, Claremorris, Foxford, Killala and Kiltimagh.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has worked in close co-operation with Mayo County Council in the development of the broadband MANs in Ballina.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">Regarding the Deputy's assertion that Ballina has the largest unemployment problem in Ireland, my understanding is that the CSO data referred to by the Deputy is sourced from the results of the 2006 census, which indicated that, for towns with a population of more than 10,000, Ballina had the highest level of unemployment among large towns.  The standard reference used for unemployment data is the quarterly national household survey, not the census.  The quarterly national household survey, QNHS, published by the CSO, does not provide data on specific towns and is available on a regional basis only.  Under the QNHS, the unemployment rate for the State at the time the census was taken was 4.3%, and the figure for the west region of which Ballina forms part was 4.2%.  The August live register data for Ballina shows that 1,445 are on the register, practically the same level as for the same period last year.  Comparable live register figures for the six years up to 2007 show that the numbers on the live register for August decreased year on year from 1,976 in 2002 to 1,445 in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">FÁS offers a wide range of supports to people in County Mayo who are unemployed.  In Ballina town, FÁS offers a suite of five training courses providing 90 training places.  At present one carpentry and joinery apprenticeship exists and it is planned to increase the apprenticeship capacity to 44 places by adding a further two electrical apprenticeship courses in January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">Contracted training in the Mayo region has a capacity for 150 places and recruitment is taking place for eight courses commencing in October and November 2007.  Placement and progression from these courses is generally approximately 65%.  FÁS has three employment services officers in Ballina who provide a vocational guidance and job matching service for clients.  The main challenge to progressing people into employment is the relative lack of new job opportunities in the area.  Penneys was the most recent employer to come to the Ballina area and FÁS assisted with the recruitment of approximately 70 staff for its store.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">I will use my office to ensure that the issue is addressed and will respond to the Deputy if it is required.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1167">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House.  This is the Irish Deaf Society's awareness week.  The central theme of the week is the quite serious campaign to get recognition for Irish sign language.  It is the indigenous language of the deaf community and affects approximately 40,000 people.  It is a minority language which has all the attributes of an oral language in terms of complexity and composition.  The society has campaigned for this during the 25 years since its foundation.  It is high time the Irish Government seriously considered the provision of appropriate recognition for Irish sign language.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">Each country has its own sign language and there is no such thing as a universal sign language.  They are all different.  When the previous Government discussed the provision of certain disability rights in the context of new disability legislation, the disability legislation consultation group recommended that Irish sign language be enshrined in the Constitution.  The European Parliament on two occasions in 1988 and 1998 gave recognition in its voting procedures to sign language and recommended that all member states give recognition.  While it gives recognition within its own legislative parameters, the principle of subsidiarity applies and, unfortunately, this has not taken place in Ireland.  Approximately 45 countries worldwide have formally and legally recognised sign language, 24 of which are in Europe, but the Republic of Ireland is not one of them.  It is ironic that the British Government has given recognition to the British sign language and to Irish sign language in Northern Ireland, while the Irish Government has given no recognition to Irish sign language in the Republic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">We have a group of people who speak a minority language who are marginalised because there is no appropriate recognition of that language.  It is high time we decided to give appropriate legal recognition to Irish sign language.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_524" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_1170">I am responding on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science in relation to Irish sign language.  As the Deputy may be aware, section 2 of the Official Languages Act 2003 states that "the official languages" of the State are (<i>a</i>) the Irish language, being the national language and the first official language and (<i>b</i>) the English language, being a second official language, as specified in Article 8 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">The Government has no plans at present to recognise Irish sign language as an official language of the State.  However, I wish to advise the Deputy that Irish sign language has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998.  Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.  This includes provision for students learning through Irish sign language.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement Irish sign language in order that it should achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place.  These include the special schools for the deaf in Cabra, Dublin which have been encouraged in relation to the use of sign language in class.  Funding is available for training of teachers in Irish sign language.  The Department of Education and Science has provided funding for an Irish sign language weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in Irish sign language for the deaf children and pupils, their siblings and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">The Department, through the Higher Education Authority, has established and fully funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for Irish sign language English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.  The course modules include issues such as sign linguistics, bi-lingualism and socio-linguistics of sign language.  The course is delivered in seminar sessions, group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment, a project and course design.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">I again thank the Deputy, on behalf of the Minister, for the opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the Irish sign language and the relevant provisions of the Education Act.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_525">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1176">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which no doubt will be of interest to him, being a fellow Kerryman.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">Play is essential for the physical, cognitive, emotional and social development of our children.  We have an obesity epidemic in this country.  Due to the lack of proper research we do not have accurate statistics on the precise numbers and their area distribution.  However, according to the report of the obesity forum at least one in eight children is obese.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">Kerry County Council, through its community cultural and tourism SPC, developed a policy document entitled Ag Spraoi<b>.</b>  This policy document looked at developing play in Kerry and set out eight steps to developing a public playground area for the children and young people in our communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">Since the policy was adopted by members of Kerry County Council in February 2004, the community and enterprise department has actively worked with communities to establish state-of-the-art playgrounds in the county.  In each case where playgrounds have been established, such as the state-of-the art facilities in Fenit, Ballybunion, Waterville and Cahirciveen, to name but a few, a local committee was established, a site identified, advice and assistance was provided through the play appraisal team of Kerry County Council and financial assistance provided by the council through a combination of disbursal of the annual Government grant, supplemented by recreational and amenity development levies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">For the past three years a grant of €120,000 has been received on an annual basis and has been disbursed as appropriate in light of the stage of development of playgrounds throughout the county.  This funding has been absolutely vital to the establishment of playgrounds.  Last year €20,000 of the fund was spent on the completion of the Ballyheigue playground and  €100,000 was allocated to Fenit.  This was opened last April by the Minister, Deputy Roche, who promised on that occasion to open similar playgrounds around the country.  He did not mention that he had suspended the grants scheme at that time.  I understand he knew that the grants scheme was suspended then but he did not reveal that to the people present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">Kerry County Council has recently been notified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that it is not in a position to justify the initiation of another year's grant scheme.  The loss of the playground grant will have serious implications for the playground programme in Kerry, most particularly in the current year.  Kerry County Council's 2007 playground development programme is dependent on receiving €120,000 at least, similar to that for other years.  A programme had been set out for spending in this regard which would be supplemented by development levies.  The withdrawal of these funds will have immediate effect on playgrounds at various stages of development in areas such as Sneem, Rossbeigh, Kenmare, Valentia Island, Ardfert and in my own village of Lixnaw.  Kerry County Council would have required funding of approximately €200,000 from the Department to complete these projects.  Given that this funding will not be provided, the whole programme will probably have to be suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">The national development plan provided a clear commitment for a funding scheme through central Government for the development of playgrounds throughout the country.  It is clear this commitment has been reneged on.  Initially the grants scheme was provided as a two-year scheme to kick-start the national play policy, ready steady play, but it is clear that it may not be continued.  Many local authorities, apart from Kerry, will have to provide playgrounds from their own resources without any recourse to the grants scheme which was in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">The Minister of State will probably say that a number of local authorities did not use up their grant.  It is unfair that a county like Kerry with a very proactive scheme, which was availed of by locals and tourists alike, should be penalised.  I appeal to the Minister of State to go back to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to ensure he restores this grant scheme.  I recall the time when his colleague slated the then Minister, Deputy John O'Donoghue, for not providing enough funding for sport facilities.  In fact he referred to him as a pimp because young people had to go out bagging in supermarkets to get funding for sport facilities.  Now the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is reneging on this grant for a vital piece of infrastructure.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do something about it.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Tony Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1184">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">Ready, Steady, Play: A National Play Policy which was published in 2004 provides a framework for the development of public play facilities in Ireland, with the overall aim of ensuring children have access to a range of quality play opportunities to enrich their childhood.  The development of the policy by the National Children's Office was as a result of consultation with children and young people who identified the lack of play and recreational opportunities as a major quality of life issue.  As part of the implementation of this policy, the Department introduced a grants scheme in 2004, whereby allocations were made to city and county councils in respect of the purchase and delivery of playground equipment.  Installation and other ancillary costs, including surface materials and fencing, were borne by the local authority.  The location of the playgrounds benefiting from the funding is a matter for decision by local authorities.  The Department provided funding for local authorities for additional schemes in 2005 and 2006.  In all, the Department has allocated funding of over €8 million to county and city councils for the development of 167 new or refurbished playgrounds since 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">Kerry County Council has developed four playgrounds under the three playground grant schemes to date.  Financial assistance amounting to €257.822.43 has been provided for the council by the Department for this purpose.  As such, the council has effectively drawn down all allocations made to it under the schemes.  The playgrounds involved are located at Ballybunion, Ballyheigue, Waterville and Fenit.  I commend the council on its efficiency in responding promptly to the needs of these communities by installing playgrounds without delay.  I understand the council would be in a position to develop playgrounds in four additional locations in County Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">Local authorities are empowered under the Local Government Act 2001 to promote the interests of the local community regarding amenity, recreation and other functions.  This includes provision for sports, games and similar activities, as well as general recreational and leisure facilities such as playgrounds.  Apart from the direct grants already mentioned which assist local authorities in this regard, the Department also provides significant financial support for local authorities through the local government fund which is usable at the discretion of an authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">Grant aid of approximately €4.1 million in respect of more than 80 playgrounds remains to be drawn down from the Department by other local authorities under the playground grant schemes.  An assessment of the overall scheme will be made by the Department when full information is available upon completion of all the projects in those local authorities currently approved for grant aid.  The question of inviting further proposals from Kerry County Council and other local authorities in a position to develop additional playgrounds is being kept under review in the light of progress made under the existing schemes and the availability of funds to the Department for these purposes.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_527">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1194">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 126, 140, 157 and 173 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems. There are 53 independent companies nationwide employing some 230 money advice staff who deliver the service at a local level. Many local voluntary and statutory bodies, such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the credit unions work closely with the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">Last year, MABS provided services to almost 12,500 new clients throughout the country. To date, this year some 8,300 new clients have approached the service. The number of active cases at the end of August was 18,400. The demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit generally and to the quality of the service provided by MABS advisors. In 2006, €16.4 million was provided to fund the service and in 2007 the annual allocation was increased to €17.67 million to assist the MABS in dealing with its workload.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex as the report of the Combat Poverty Agency for the Financial Regulator on Financial Exclusion in Ireland illustrates. The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people encounter in managing their finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">I am particularly concerned about the unacceptably high level of interest rates currently being charged by some financial institutions, loan companies and by legal moneylenders in situations where people have no alternative sources of credit available to them. My concerns, in this regard, are borne out by the 2005 UCC Working Paper "Meeting the Credit Needs of Low-Income Groups: Credit Unions versus Moneylenders" and the recent Financial Regulator's Report on the Licensed Money Lending Industry in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">It shows that moneylenders may be charging interest rates of up to 188%. Most significantly, 71% of people surveyed in the latter report did not know what interest they were paying on their loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">The issues in this policy area are complex. The regulation of money lending comes under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995 and the licensing of moneylenders is a statutory responsibility of the Financial Regulator. My view is that MABS has a unique and expert contribution to make on behalf of people on low incomes in shaping the strategies that need to be put in place, for example, by the providers of payment services such as the Banks and Credit unions to ensure greater financial inclusion in Ireland. Officials of my Department continue to engage with the Department of Finance on the issues involved. Furthermore they are also consulting with the Financial Regulator and other key interests on the options available to me to strengthen the role of MABS in tackling the barriers which arise for people on low incomes in getting access to the full range of mainstream financial services that is available to the wider community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, I am developing proposals to establish a new structure for the MABS geared to meet the needs of people with debt difficulties in today's society. Initiatives to improve the situation of people on low incomes in securing access to affordable credit are a priority consideration in my approach to policy. I intend to bring the proposals to the Government as soon as possible in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">My proposals will build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public. They involve the continuation of local voluntary involvement in the MABS service, with strong national leadership to ensure a high quality, coordinated budgeting and advice service providing strong and confidential support for its clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">The proposals take account of the significant developments which have taken place in MABS since legislation on the matter was published in 2002. They take account of best practice in corporate governance for a customer focussed service that provides value for money for the taxpayers investment and meets the challenges posed by the rapidly changing face of debt in 21st century Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1206">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 137.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">The introduction of a personal advocacy service is provided for in the Citizens Information Act, 2007.  The Act has as its primary purpose the amendment of the Comhairle Act, 2000, to assign additional and enhanced functions to the Citizens Information Board, formerly Comhairle, which operates under the aegis of my Department, to enable it to introduce a personal advocacy service to individuals, in particular those with a disability.  The service will assist the individuals concerned in identifying and understanding their needs and options and assist them in securing their entitlements to social services.  Social services are broadly defined and include health, social welfare, education, family support, housing, taxation, citizenship, consumer matters, employment and training, equality, asylum and immigration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The development of advocacy services is a priority for my Department and in this regard additional funding of €1.9m has been provided for the Citizens Information Board in 2007 for the development of a personal advocacy service for people with disabilities and for the implementation of the Disability Sectoral Plan.  The Personal Advocacy Service will be initially located in Dublin.  When the service is well established, it is anticipated that advocates will be located in a number of key highly populated areas around the country.  However, it is not possible at this stage to give estimates of the number of advocates to be employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">An organisational structure has been developed by the Citizens Information Board to meet the needs of the Personal Advocacy Service.  Discussions between my Department, the Department of Finance and the Citizens Information Board are ongoing in relation to these structures and the additional staffing resources required for the provision of the service.  Temporary accommodation has been identified to facilitate the immediate needs of the service and it is envisaged that the post of Director of the Personal Advocacy Service will be advertised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">In 2004 the Citizens Information Board began the process of engaging the community and voluntary sector in the provision of advocacy services to people with disabilities and also produced advocacy guidelines to inform and guide organizations in the development of advocacy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">Thirty projects have been funded since 2004 to deliver representative advocacy services to people with disabilities, some of which are cross disability type, with others specifically targeting one particular type of disability.  Each of the projects poses different challenges, some requiring more intensive work with smaller caseloads while others have larger caseloads with shorter periods of client contact.  This year another 15 projects have been approved for funding.  It is envisaged that structures and staffing resources will be in place to enable the new service to be up and running in 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1215">I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 132 and 153 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or only with a qualifying dependant.  Carers allowance and carers benefit are not qualifying payments at present.  The household composition, qualifying payment and means test rules are designed to ascertain the ability of applicant households to meet their normal heating requirements out of their own resources and to ensure that the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need of the fuel allowance support.  Only one fuel allowance is paid per household.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as state pension (non-contributory), long-term jobseeker's assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance.  The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">In the case of contributory pensions such as state pension (contributory), state pension (transition) and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to €100 per week, or savings/investments of up to €58,000, over and above the maximum state pension (contributory) rate and still qualify for fuel allowance.  The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the state pension (contributory) rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">In Budget 2007, the rate of fuel allowance was increased by €4 from €14 to €18 (€21.90 in designated smokeless areas).  The income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance was also increased by €49 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">Some 274,000 people benefited from the fuel allowance in 2006 at a cost of €125.1m.  As a consequence of the increase in rate and the increase in the income threshold for eligibility as announced in Budget 2007, it is estimated that some 286,200 households will benefit under the scheme at an annual cost of €161.5m. The extension of the national fuel scheme to eligible carers, as set out in the Agreed Programme for Government, will be examined by my Department in the context of the overall package of commitments relating to carers.  The additional costs arising from improvements to the scheme will be considered in future Budgetary proposals having regard to overall resources available for social welfare schemes generally.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1230">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 118, 145, 148, 154, 164, 169 and 571 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">As the House is aware, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions policy in accordance with the partnership agreement " Towards 2016".  The preparation of the Green Paper follows a period of increased activity in the development of pensions policy, which has seen the publication of two major reports by the Pensions Board — the ‘National Pensions Review' and ‘Special Savings for Retirement'. These two reports built on the earlier report of the Board on the National Pensions Policy Initiative, published in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">The Green Paper will take account of these reports and examine the situation in a much broader way to deal with issues raised in the partnership talks, such as the operation of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes, together with a comprehensive look at issues in relation to social welfare pensions which arise from time to time, both here in the House and in representations which I receive, including questions with regard to the pension entitlements of women.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The purpose of the Green Paper is not to recommend any particular course of action but rather to set out clearly the current situation and the implications, from an economic and social perspective, of various courses of action which have been suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">The Green Paper will set out the key issues and challenges now facing the Irish pensions system including:  The demographic challenge; Issues in relation to the sustainability of the pensions system; Pensioner incomes and the contribution various elements of the pension system, including the social welfare system, can make to the adequacy of this income; Work flexibility in older age; The roles and relationships of social welfare, private occupational and public service pensions in the future; The role of tax incentives in the current system and their efficiency and effectiveness in supporting Government objectives in the area; The role of annuities and the operation of that market; The role of regulation including the charges levied by pension providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">The publication of the Green Paper will be followed by a major consultation process aimed at building consensus on the future direction of pensions policy in Ireland. This process will culminate in the Government publishing a framework for long-term pensions policy. The framework will encompass proposals to deal with the various commitments in the Government programme in relation to both supplementary and social welfare pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">The publication of the Green Paper was delayed due to the General Election and the subsequent changes in Government. I too was anxious to take time to familiarise myself with the very complex issues involved.  This process is now completed and arrangements are being made to publish the Green Paper. I expect to be in a position to confirm a publication date in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">At a general level, my Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended). The review will examine the schemes and services provided for in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate. The findings of this review, and the conclusions in the social welfare pensions area arising from the publication of the Green Paper, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of all citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_531">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1239">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs. A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment, or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels. Family Income Supplement is one of the Qualifying payments. Separately, the Department of Education and Science operate a book grant scheme for primary and secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">The rates of BSCFA have been increased significantly in recent years. From June 2006, the allowance was increased by €40 to €120 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and €190 for those aged from 12 to 22 years. In Budget 2007 , the rate of payment of BSCFA was increased by a further €60 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years old and increased by a further €95 for children aged 12 to 22 — a 50% increase on the previous allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">The new rates for 2007 are €180 for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €285 for children aged 12 to 22. Budget 2007 also increased the income limits for BSCFA by €50 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate. These improvements provide a considerable boost to families at a time of considerable expense. The annual expenditure on the scheme will increase to €38.1m as a result of these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">These improvements in BSCFA are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends. According to the Consumer Price Index for August 2007, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 3.4% over the past twelve months. Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 21.6%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain. While the improvements to the scheme in recent years provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance, further improvements to the scheme will be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities. The second is the school meals community (local projects) programme through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas who are running specific school meals projects, including breakfast clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245">The school meals programme has expanded significantly in recent years to include a large number of disadvantaged school children and this trend will continue throughout 2007 and in future years. The number of meals being provided on a daily basis to disadvantaged children through the school meals local projects scheme has doubled from 89,915 in the school year 2005/2006 to 179,660 in the school year 2006/2007. In 2006, some 1,394 schools with over 145,000 pupils benefited under the scheme and this is expected to increases to 165,000 plus pupils in over 1,800 schools in the 2007/2008 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">The Department of Education and Science has identified a total of 875 disadvantaged schools under the recent ‘Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools' (DEIS) action plan. To date, a total of 651 DEIS schools are participating on the scheme, and additional applications are expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">The school meals programme makes an important contribution to ensuring that school children receive better nutrition and contributes to improved school attendance and quality of learning. All relevant research indicates that there is a strong link between nutritional intake and cognitive ability and that inadequate nutrition impacts negatively on a child's ability to learn and benefit from education. I am satisfied that the additional funding given to the school meals programme in recent years ha s enabled the programme to expand significantly and to assist schools and projects to provide healthy, nutritious food to the most disadvantaged children in our society who, by reason of lack of food, are unable to take full advantage of the educational opportunities presented to them. I will be seeking to make provision in Budget 2008 for further expansion of the school meals scheme, to increase the number of children benefiting.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1255">I propose to take Questions Nos. 121, 124, 128, 156, 161, 165 and 179 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan were drawn up in consultation with the social partners and after a wide ranging consultation process with other stakeholders.  The NAPinclusion adopts a lifecycle stage approach, in line with Towards 2016, with specific, measurable goals set for each group: children; people of working age; older people and people with disabilities; and their communities. It sets out a demanding and detailed programme of action to meet these goals and targets during the period 2007-2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The NAPinclusion builds on the considerable progress achieved in the past decade in tackling poverty and in reducing the number of people experiencing material deprivation in Ireland.  The new goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">The goal has been set using an updated set of indicators devised by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), which is more realistic and in keeping with living standards today than the indicators considered appropriate for the earlier national anti poverty plans.  The new target reflects experience and advice that it may be difficult to bring consistent poverty down to zero, due in part to the subjective and sensitive nature of the survey questions used to identify deprivation.  The current rate of consistent poverty in the population using the new measure is 7.0 per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">The 2002 National Anti-Poverty Strategy target was to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor to 2 per cent by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty, as then defined. The consistent poverty measure used at that time had been developed by the ESRI in 1987. It identified the proportion of people, from those with less than 60 per cent of median income, who were deprived of one or more goods or services considered essential for a basic standard of living as then defined. A major discontinuity between the Living in Ireland Survey (LIIS), previously used for monitoring progress against the target and the new EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), introduced from 2003, means that it is not possible to compare trends in consistent poverty between the two surveys. However, continuing low levels of unemployment and the substantial resources devoted to social welfare and other social services, support the view that the downward trend in consistent poverty, from 8.3 per cent in 1994 to 4.1 per cent in 2001, would have continued and the target would have been reached by 2007 using the LIIS survey method.  Furthermore, the first three years of EU-SILC data indicate that the overall consistent poverty rate reduced from 8.8 per cent in 2003 to 7.0 per cent in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The NAPinclusion sets out a wide-ranging and comprehensive programme of actions over the period to 2016 to continue to reduce  poverty, achieve the overall consistent poverty goal to ensure that every person has access to income and resources (material, cultural and social) that are regarded as acceptable by Irish society.  To this end, the NAPinclusion contains 12 high level strategic goals in key priority areas supported by over 150 more detailed targets and actions.  The Plan has a particular focus on the effective delivery and implementation of quality public services for each stage of the lifecycle.  Detailed action targets cover the broad spectrum of services including education, health and long-term care, housing, income support, employment supports, early childhood development and care, transport, and sport and culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">The Government is determined to build on the progress achieved over the past ten years in reducing poverty. The social welfare commitments in the Programme for Government prioritise the objectives of the NAPinclusion. They include; improvements in support for Lone Parents; in the State Pension and the Carers Allowance, in Child Benefit and in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the School Meals Programme. Support for the Office for Social Inclusion is a key commitment, in particular, for its work to progress the use of  poverty impact assessments by government departments, local authorities and statutory agencies in the development of policies and programmes and the delivery of public services to ensure that the Government's social inclusion agenda is achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">The concern expressed by the Irish Human Rights Commission on the impact of poverty on human rights is one that the Government and I share.  Ireland, together with many other Member States of the Council of Europe,  ratified  the European Social Charter which is designed to secure to their populations the social rights specified in the Charter in order to improve their standard of living and their social well being.  In 1991 the Council of Europe adopted a Revised Social Charter in order to take account in particular of the fundamental social changes which have occurred since the original text was adopted in 1961.  The Revised Social Charter was ratified by Ireland on 4th November 2000 and came into force on 1 January, 2000. One of the main changes included in the Revised Social Charter was the inclusion of a new Article 30 which provides for the right to protection against poverty and exclusion.  I am confident that the strategies to combat poverty and social exclusion, including the current NAPinclusion, meet the undertaking required by Article 30  These include taking measures within the framework of an overall and coordinated approach to promote effective access by people experiencing poverty and social exclusion to employment and a range of other key services.  Ireland's compliance with these and other obligations under the revised Charter will be monitored on a regular basis by the appropriate Council of Europe institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">My plan, in working with Government to deliver the programme over the coming years, is to build on the significant and visible progress already made in reducing poverty and material deprivation and to deliver real improvements in living standards and well-being for the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1265">Where a person has social insurance contributions from another EEA country, or a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement, these can be combined with Irish social insurance contributions to qualify a person for a pro-rata contributory state pension. The manner in which contributions from EEA countries are to be used is laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/ 71 and the same general principles are applied in the reciprocal agreements Ireland has with a number of other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">These Regulations provide that where the conditions required by the legislation of a country for entitlement to old age benefits are satisfied only after counting the contributions made in another country, the first country shall firstly calculate the amount of pension the person would be entitled to if s/he had completed his/her full career of periods of insurance under the legislation of that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">Then a proportional pension is calculated by multiplying the theoretical amount of pension by the ratio of periods of insurance in that State to the person's full career. The objective of the system is, amongst other things, to ensure that the contributions made in each country are adequately recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">Those qualifying for pensions under this system will, more than likely, qualify for a pension from other jurisdictions, some of whose pension arrangements are more advantageous than those which exist here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">It is also, of course, open to a person living in Ireland to apply for a State Pension (Non-Contributory) if their total contributory pension entitlement is very much reduced and they will receive a payment if they satisfy a means test.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_534">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1274">I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 142, 565 and 566 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">In February 2006 as part of its reform of the Health Sector, the Government decided that the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), as well as certain other functions, would be transferred to my Department.  The SWA scheme is currently administered by the Community Welfare Service division of the Health Service Executive on behalf of my Department.  Some 1,000 staff, including approximately 700 Community Welfare Officers are engaged in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Project personnel have been appointed on a full-time basis both in this Department and the HSE and detailed implementation planning for the transfer is well advanced.  Enabling provision has been made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 for a number of technical amendments to existing SWA legislation to facilitate the transfer process.  These provisions will be brought into force by way of Commencement Order once CWS staff have transferred to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">A change of this magnitude involves a considerable range of issues to be dealt with. In that regard officials from my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE have been engaged in consultation with the unions representing the Community Welfare Service staff. These discussions are now being facilitated by an independent chairperson who was appointed in July 2007.  His initial task is to agree a framework which will allow for detailed meaningful discussions to take place between the parties on the specific issues involved.  The intention is that these intensive discussions will take place in the coming months and the chairperson will issue a report outlining progress. Any issues that are unresolved at that stage will be dealt with in accordance with the appropriate industrial relations procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">It is proposed that the transfer take place in two phases. In the first instance it is envisaged that the Community Welfare Service will transfer to a new branch in my Department with a separate management structure reporting at senior level in the Department.  For this phase staff transferring will become Departmental grade civil servants i.e. a grade which is unique to one Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">Civil Servants above clerical level are not permitted to engage in any form of political activity. This is set out in the official Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour drawn up by the Minister for Finance in accordance with the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001.  These restrictions are necessary to ensure public confidence in the political impartiality of the Civil Service.  Community Welfare Officers and other HSE staff above clerical level will have to cease any political involvement in which they may be engaged as soon as they transfer to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The envisaged first phase is an interim arrangement pending full integration of the staff into the Department as general service grade civil servants. Subject to agreement being reached with the unions it is proposed that the initial transfer will take place as soon as is practical in 2008.  It is proposed that full integration will take place within three years of the transfer of community welfare staff to the Department. There will be full consultation with all staff, including staff in my own Department in relation to all aspects of the transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The transfer of the Community Welfare Service to my Department represents a major organisational change and a key priority will be to ensure that the provision of a quality service to the public is maintained during the transitional period.  Within the income support system there will always be a need for a safety net including exceptional or emergency payments for those who are unable to meet their immediate needs.  This function and the discretionary element of the SWA scheme, as currently applied by the CWOs within the CWS, will not be removed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">I look forward to the community welfare staff transferring to my Department forming a central part of an integrated and more and customer focussed service for those members of our society who are most in need.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1285">I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 168 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">The purpose of rent supplement, administered under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists. The numbers claiming the supplement has grown considerably from 42,683 in 2000 to just under 60,000 at the end of December 2006. At the end of August 2007 some 58,675 people were in receipt of a supplement. The scheme has also witnessed an increase in the duration of entitlement with over 32,000 recipients now getting a supplement for 18 months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">One of the measures introduced to address this is the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) which among other things gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for eighteen months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">These individual needs are met through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector, and in particular, a new public/private partnership arrangement to provide rental housing for households with long-term housing needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicate that to date, local authorities have transferred some 4,840 rent supplement cases to RAS units. 2,677 of these are in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and 2,163 are in private rental accommodation. The Housing authorities have also transferred a further 3,792 recipients to other social housing options. The objective under RAS is that local authorities will have completed the transfer of rent supplement recipients with long-term housing needs to their care by the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">Budget 2007 provided for improvements in the qualifying conditions for rent supplement which will support the transfer to RAS of rent supplement tenants who wish to take up full-time employment. Under the new measures, introduced in June of this year, rent supplement may continue to be paid to a person who engages in full time employment, subject to their satisfying the standard means testing conditions, where they have been accepted as having a long-term housing need under RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">Budget 2007 measures also provided for improvements in the disregards that apply to assessing additional income for rent supplement purposes. From June the first €75 of additional income, that is, income above the standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to a person's circumstances, is disregarded for rent supplement purposes, with any additional income above €75 is assessed at 75%. These measures are positive steps in assisting tenants in achieving a long-term housing solution for their needs while also increasing the financial return from employment for those returning to work or moving to full-time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">A review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was carried out as part of the Government's Expenditure Review Initiative series of Programme Evaluation. The resulting report was published in November 2006 and included an examination of the rent supplement scheme. The report recommended that RAS should be vigorously pursued to address housing needs of people in long term supplementation. In addition to improving the housing situation for people on low incomes and delivering better value for money for exchequer, full implementation of these arrangements would allow the rent supplement scheme return to its original objective of being a short-term income support scheme, with fewer than half of the current number of recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The report also identified a number of issues relating to the incentives under the rent supplement scheme for those wishing to take up an employment opportunity. As I have already outlined, Budget 2007 has now addressed these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">I am conscious that the rent supplement scheme has become a form of social housing in its own right and for this reason, I am anxious that all avenues are explored as regards ways of providing support for those on long-term rent supplementation particularly as regards their securing home ownership. Any further changes to the rent supplement scheme including the question of mortgage support needs to be considered in the context of overall housing policy, which comes within the remit of my colleague the Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government. That Department already provides a range of housing supports through local government initiatives, including RAS. Any further initiatives in relation to mortgage support will be framed by that Department in the context of its "delivering homes — sustaining communities" strategy published earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">I intend to keep the rent supplement scheme under review and my Department will be working closely with the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1310">I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 151 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">According to CSO statistics for Q2 2007 there are about 2,194,000 in the workforce including 1,255,000 males and 939,000 females. The most recent statistics available in relation to pensions coverage relate to Q4 2005 and suggest that 58.3% of males and 50.6% of females have a supplementary pension. On that basis, we can estimate that there are about 731,000 males and 475,000 females in the workforce covered by a pension with 524,000 and 464,000 respectively without coverage. There are no statistics available in relation to pensions coverage for those who are not in the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">Male workers continue to have a higher coverage rate than their female counterparts. However the gap between males and females reduced from 11% in the first quarter of 2002 to 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Increased coverage rates were evident across all age categories over the same four year period. Workers in the 35 to 44 age group continued to have the highest pension coverage at just over 65%, followed closely by those aged 45 to 54 at 64.0%. The pension coverage rate for those in employment aged 30 to 65, which increased from 57.8% to 61.8%, in the period in question  is still somewhat below the 70% target suggested in the National Pensions Review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1316">I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 147 and 149 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">The merging of family income supplement and qualified child increases provides an opportunity to further target income support at the poorest families. However, the issues involved are complex and there are technical and policy challenges to be overcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with qualified child increases and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support. Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement ‘Toward 2016'.   NESC research on the subject is expected to be available soon. The Council's analysis of these issues will, when received, be of assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320">The importance of targeted income support to families and children continues to be a high priority for this Government and the significantly improved and targeted measures announced in Budget 2007 represent substantial improvements in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">Family income supplement income thresholds were raised in Budget 2007, increasing the weekly payments of almost all existing FIS recipients by €9 for a one child family, to €111 for a family with eight or more children. Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families and this improvement continues the re-focusing of thresholds towards larger families which started in Budget 2006, thereby further targeting resources at low-income households.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">In Budget 2007 all three qualified child increase rates which had remained unchanged since 1994 were increased to a single rate of €22 per week. In addition, the annual back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides income support for the poorest families at a particularly difficult time of the year, was increased by €60 for children aged 2 to 11, and by €95 for children aged 12 to 22, bringing the rates of payment to €180 and €285 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">These changes represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened. Maintaining this balance will remain a priority in consideration of future policy changes in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1325">EU migrant workers have an entitlement to Child Benefit and other "Family benefits" including Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Where a national of an EU State with a family is working in Ireland, the worker is entitled to payment of such benefits, even if the children are resident in the worker's home country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">Applications for family benefits from EU migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation. Entitlement to Child Benefit is based on the applicant satisfying the Habitual Residency condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">Currently there are over 43,700 EU nationals in receipt of Child Benefit for 75,400 children who are resident with them in Ireland.  Of these recipients, some 17,300 are UK nationals, some 10,100 are from Poland, with a further 11,300 recipients from the other States that joined the EU in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what if any family benefits are payable there.  This process can take a number of months to complete and, as a result, the number of claims that has been finalised to date is relatively small. The number of claims to Child Benefit in respect of non resident children of EU nationals averaged 300 per week in 2006 of which some 40% would also have had on entitlement to the Early Childcare Supplement.  To date in 2007 the average is 220 per week, with the average over the last 2 months being 160 claims per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">Child Benefit is currently in payment under EU regulations to 1280 families, in respect of 2985 children resident outside of the Republic of Ireland.  Some 45% of these children are resident in UK with a further 40% resident in Poland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">The total child benefit expenditure for EU migrants with non resident children in respect of 2008 based on continuing average intake 220 per week is estimated at €114m or 5.2% of overall child benefit expenditure. The corresponding figures for early childcare supplement in respect of 2008, is €23m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">It is not possible to accurately predict how many of these cases will be put into payment as many of the claimants leave the country before their claims can be processed.  The ongoing levels of immigration and the number of workers returning to their countries will impact on the levels of benefit to be paid.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         his views on whether the State non-contributory pension personal rate of €200 per week is adequate for an adult when taking into account the cost of living.

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_540">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1333">One of the key objectives of the 2007 social welfare package was to protect and enhance the value of weekly rates of payment for pensioners in relative terms by giving increases which were well in excess of the projected rate of inflation for this year.  The State Pension Non-Contributory was increased by €18 per week or 9.9% in the Budget. This level of increase was more than double the expected increase in the cost of living this year. The increase also met the Government's objective of bringing the rate of the basic State pension to €200 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">In considering the level of support available for pensioners, account must also be taken of other benefits available for pensioners, including the Household Benefits Package, Fuel Allowances, the Over-80 Allowance and, for pensioners living alone, the Living Alone Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">As and from last January, the number of free units of electricity and gas paid under the Household Benefits Scheme increased by 600 units a year to 2,400 units, thereby protecting pensioners from the impact of increased electricity charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">Also from January, the fuel allowance was increased by €4 per week to €18. This means that this allowance has doubled since January 2006.  By any standards, the levels of increases and other improvements announced in the 2007 Estimates and Budget were exceptional and a further demonstration of this Government's commitment to pensioners in our society by delivering social welfare increases which are well in excess of inflation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">The new Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to further enhance income support for pensioners including a commitment to increase the rate of the basic State pension to €300 by 2012. I look forward to progressing this and other commitments for pensioners in a Budgetary context, having regard to available resources and the wider Government agenda.</p>

            <p eId="para_1341">I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 141 and 610 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">Approximately 76 per cent of workers pay PRSI Class A and Class H at the rate of 4 per cent; their employers pay 10.75%.  A further 11 per cent of workers pay social insurance contributions at the Class S rate.  These contributions which are subject to various thresholds, allowances and ceilings, accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes. The current employee PRSI ceiling stands at €48,800 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">It is estimated that a decrease in the employee PRSI rate from 4% to 2% would reduce Social Insurance Fund income by some €720 million in a full year. The abolition of the PRSI ceiling for ordinary employees would yield some €295 million in additional contribution income. A decrease in the self-employed PRSI rate (Class S) from 3% to 2% is estimated to cost approximately €220 million in a full year.  Of course if introduced as a package, the combination of measures would give rise to a compound effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">The effect over a five year period would be dependant on the sequencing of any changes to the PRSI rates. Clearly however, any reductions to PRSI rates would have the effect of reducing corresponding contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">Traditionally social insurance spending has been funded on a tripartite basis with contributions coming from the exchequer, employers and employees. It should be noted that legislation provides that the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Fund and that Exchequer contributions to cover any shortfall in contributions were the norm for over forty years.   No Exchequer contribution has been required since 1996 as the fund has been in surplus on foot of contributions from employers and workers. Any future shortfall in the cost of benefits paid would in the normal way be addressed by exchequer subvention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">Changes in PRSI contribution rates are considered in a budgetary context and any such changes would be announced in future budgets.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1348">Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU.  This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes and other social inclusion programmes.  The latest such statistics were published on 24 July 2007 and cover developments up to and including 2004. No comparable figures are yet available for 2005 or 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">When examining such data, it is important to remember that gross expenditure measures do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits after they are paid, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions, as opposed to direct cash payments. For example, tax relief on contributions towards occupational and private pensions, which are an important feature of Ireland's pension system, is not counted as expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">The EUROSTAT release draws attention to the fact the EU average masks major national differences in the structure of social protection funding, partly related to differing levels of wealth between countries, and also reflects differences in social protection systems, demographic trends, unemployment rates and other social, institutional and economic factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">The level of expenditure is also significantly influenced by the age profile of the population. Ireland, currently with the youngest population in the EU, needs to spend less on pensions and healthcare/care of the elderly than most other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">In 2004, social protection expenditure accounted for 27.3% of GDP in the EU-25 countries. The corresponding ratio for Ireland was 17% — up almost 3 percentage points from 2000 (14.1%). Eurostat acknowledges that the very significant growth in GDP means that the large real increases in benefit rates and child income support introduced in recent years is somewhat masked. It further notes that the level of expenditure in Ireland is also significantly influenced by the lower proportion of pensioners and the reliance on private pension provision to supplement the State pensions and lower spending on unemployment benefits in the light of sustained low unemployment figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">The fact is that under this Government there has been a sustained and substantial increase in social protection expenditure. The EUROSTAT report states that the increase in Ireland's per capita expenditure (7.8% per annum and the second highest of all EU countries, behind Hungary) from 2000 to 2004 in comparison to that of the EU as a whole (2.2% per annum), was "particularly marked". Moreover, it should be noted that social welfare expenditure will have increased substantially during the three year period from 2005 to 2007, Following the improvements announced in the 2007 Budget, overall spending on social welfare in Ireland in 2007 will be over EUR 15.316 billion — an increase of more than 13% from 2006. This is the highest ever spend on social welfare, and represents expenditure of nearly two and a half times the social welfare budget of EUR 6.2 billion in 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">This Government will continue to address the scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure, guided by the new National Anti Poverty Strategy, and the National Development Programme while at the same time continuing to take the measures necessary to maintain economic growth and competitiveness and thereby generate the resources for further social investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1356">The second Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is required under Section 10 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, is being finalised. This is in accordance with the requirement that such reviews be carried-out at five-yearly intervals and be completed not later than five years after the date of completion of the previous review. The first Actuarial Review was published in 2002, and reflected the position of the Fund at the end of 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">The second Actuarial Review was completed by Mercer Human Resources Consulting in June, 2007. It was received by Government in July, 2007, and is currently under consideration. Under legislation it must be laid before the Oireachtas by early December, 2007; however it is anticipated that this will happen well in advance of this date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1358">The Social Insurance Fund provides insured contributors with pension benefits upon retirement — as a result of old age or incapacity — as well as a range of shorter term social welfare benefits. The Fund covers nearly all employees and the self-employed in Ireland — although some contributors are only covered for a limited range of benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">The current review was carried out by independent consultants who examined the financial condition and sustainability of the Fund at the end of 2005 — when SIF expenditure was €5.6 billion, income to the Fund was €6.1 billion and some 2.8 million persons were contributing into it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">In line with the Terms of Reference provided to the consultants the review covers the period from 2006 to 2061 and investigates the impact of increasing benefit rates and contribution limits in line with prices and with earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">In addition, the effects of adjusting the retirement age are explored, as are the potential financial impact on the social insurance system of a number of possible future developments. The review does not provide recommendations for policy action but rather attempts to illustrate likely trends over the period to 2061. The review was overseen by a steering committee comprised of officials from my own Department along with others from the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Economic assumptions relating to the period of the review were agreed between the steering committee and the consultants — who also engaged an independent economist to assist in this process.

            <p eId="para_1368">The living alone increase is an additional payment of €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements like the living alone increase. The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups. This approach was continued in Budget 2007 with increases of up to €16 and €18 per week granted on personal rates. The policy is subject to review and I will consider the position in the context of the next budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_1371">Child benefit may be paid in respect of every child under the age of 16 years, who is ordinarily resident in the State. Payment can be extended to the 19th birthday if the child is in education, or incapable of self-support. The benefit is paid to the qualified person with whom the child resides and the qualified person must satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States, without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States. The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">EU Regulations provide that EEA nationals who are migrant workers, i.e. who are employed or self-employed in this country, or who are receiving Irish Jobseeker's benefit since being in employment here, are entitled to payment of family benefits in respect of their families who reside in another Member State.  Under these Regulations the family members are treated as if they are habitually resident in Ireland for the purpose of child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">Between January and the end of August 2007, a total of 28,542 decisions were made on new child benefit claims.  Of these 3,430 (12%) required particular examination of the habitual residence condition.  90% of these satisfied the condition and only 341 (10%) were refused as this condition was not satisfied.  In effect just over 1% of the total number of decisions on new child benefit claims failed to satisfy the habitual residence conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">Those who are refused child benefit are mainly persons whose claim to asylum has not yet been decided, others who have not obtained a work permit, or persons who have had only a minimal or no attachment to the workforce since coming to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">I am satisfied that the habitual residence condition is achieving its intended purpose, allowing access to our social welfare schemes to persons who are genuinely and lawfully making Ireland their habitual residence, while preventing unwarranted access by persons who have little or no connection with the State.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1378">The recommendation of the Law Reform Commission arose from one of two important pieces of work regarding different types of partner relationships and how they should be treated and recognised in Irish society. The first report an ‘Options Paper, presented by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, focuses on different types of cohabiting relationships, both same and opposite sex, and presents a range of options with regard to giving legal recognition to these relationships. Officials from my Department contributed to the work of this Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">The second report — the ‘Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants' — makes substantial recommendations for reform of the law concerning cohabitants including both opposite sex or same sex couples who live together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">These reports come at a time of wide public debate on the question of according legal status to cohabitants generally, and same sex couples in particular, and will contribute to the informed debate on these important topics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">My own Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended). The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">This work, together with the reports I have referred to, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1386">I propose to take Questions Nos. 152, 155 and 613 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">As the BSCFA scheme will be running to the end of September, final figures in relation to the numbers of applications received and awarded for 2007 are not yet available from the HSE.  Current indications are that more than 82,000 families with 174,000 children will benefit from the scheme this year at a cost of some €38m.  This is an increase on the 2006 figures when 78,750 families with 161,450 children benefited at a cost of €23.5m.  This increase can be mainly attributed to improvements in income disregards introduced this year and the significant level of publicity given to this scheme in the media and through the information services operated by my Department.  The Department has increased its publicity in this area to ensure that as many families as possible are aware of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year. In dealing with the large volume of applications received, the Health Service Executive deploys additional staffing resources for the duration of the scheme during the June to September period. This period was designated as it is the time that parents are preparing and budgeting for back to school expenditure.  As the principal objective of the scheme is to assist eligible families with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn, the most practical time to implement the scheme is in the lead up to each new academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">The HSE may under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme make exceptional needs payments in the case of late BSCFA applications. Accordingly, I have no plans to extend the period of application beyond September.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1392">The report to which the Deputy refers was produced by the Social Welfare Appeals Office (SWAO) of my Department in accordance with legislative requirements. It contains details of the activities of the office in 2006 as well as commentary on other issues which arose during the year. As I previously stated on 29 June 2007, I welcome the continued commitment of the SWAO to provide an accessible and independent review mechanism for people who wish to appeal against decisions made by my Department. My Department makes every effort to deliver entitlements to people in accordance with the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">However, considering that in 2006 my Department made over one million payments per week that benefit more than 1.5 million people, and received 1.75 million claims for statutory social welfare schemes, it is understandable that there will be some people who will not agree with decisions made on their entitlements. The number of appeals received (13,800), when viewed in the context of the number of claims received, less than 1% of all new claims, is small. In 2006, slightly more appeals were processed than were received and of the 14,006 appeals finalised, favourable decisions were made in 6,439 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">The report highlights that 46% of appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant. It refers to the fact that of the 6,439 favourable decisions on appeal cases, almost half of these decisions (3,199) were in fact revised decisions made by statutorily appointed Deciding Officers of my Department, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance. These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his /her claim. In such cases an Appeals Officer decision was not necessary. In addition, it should be noted that of the 9,100 appeals decided by Appeals Officers, a total of 5,860 (64%) upheld the original decision of the Deciding Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Customers whose claims are disallowed or who are disqualified from payment or awarded social welfare at a reduced rate are informed that if they have any new fact or evidence that has a bearing on their case, they should send it in the first instance to the Deciding Officer for re-examination and, if appropriate, for revision of the decision. They are informed that this right is in addition to their right of appeal to the SWAO. They can seek a Deciding Officer review before making an appeal or can do both concurrently. The right of appeal to the SWAO remains an option if the review by the Deciding Officer is not fruitful.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The success of the Deciding Officer review process has been highlighted in a number of annual reports of the SWAO. In the Annual Report 2002, for example, the contribution which the Deciding Officer Review process made in reducing the overall number of appeals that were received in the SWAO was noted. The 2005 Annual Report also highlighted the success of this strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">The role of the statutorily appointed Deciding Officer is to decide entitlement to statutory social welfare schemes and insurability of employment in accordance with the legislation. To assist Deciding Officers in their role, guidelines relating to all aspects of decision-making and Social Welfare legislation are issued and regularly updated by my Department. In addition, training is provided to Deciding Officers on their statutory obligations and the application of principles of natural justice and fair procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">The need for transparency in the decision-making process by Deciding Officers is also provided for in legislation. Regulations provide that decisions on social welfare claims must be set out in writing and, where the decision is unfavourable, the reasons for the decision must also be recorded and included in the notification to the person concerned. Therefore, when a Deciding Officer has reached a decision, which is unfavourable to the claimant, s/he must give the grounds for the decision, that is, the statutory condition which is not fulfilled; and the reason why the grounds are not met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">In its guidelines and training, the Department incorporates instructions relating to Appeal procedures. Deciding Officers and Social Welfare Inspectors are advised to attend, or arrange for a representative from the area to attend, an oral hearing when so requested by the Appeals Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">My Department has regular meetings with the Social Welfare Appeals Office to discuss matters of interest and concern. These ongoing discussions are referred to in the Annual Report. Arising from such discussions, guidelines, procedures and practices are reviewed and changed where necessary. The conditions of entitlement are kept under review and my Department has been involved in various reviews of schemes as part of its annual business plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_1402">The CORI review Addressing Inequality, which was published earlier this year, is currently being examined by my Department. The review analyses the current social and economic position in the country under twelve different headings including income, taxation, work, public services, migration, social participation and sustainability.  It sets out a wide range of recommendations under each of these headings to ensure economic development, social equity and sustainability in the medium to long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">Building an inclusive society continues to be a key priority of the Government. This is evidenced in the National Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, which was agreed last year by Government and the social partners, including CORI as a member of the Community and Voluntary pillar. The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) which was published earlier this year and the social inclusion elements of the National Development Plan, set out a detailed programme of action and demanding targets for achieving greater social inclusion during the period 2007 to 2016.   The preparation of the NAPinclusion involved a wide ranging consultation process with key stakeholders including CORI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">The new Agreed Programme for Government builds on these programmes and contains important commitments in relation to pensioners, carers, children and others relying on social welfare incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">We will continue to face the challenges of tackling poverty and social inclusion. Significant and visible progress has been made over the last 10 years and I am confident that we can continue to achieve a similar scale of progress in the coming years towards achieving the fairer Ireland sought by CORI.</p>

            <p eId="para_1408">I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 182 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">The annual report of the Combat Poverty Agency for 2006 which I launched on 4 September, 2007 contains details of the progress made by the Agency on its strategic plan ‘Working for a Poverty-Free Ireland'. It contains inter alia details of its findings in relation to child poverty and it highlights the importance of services such as health, education and services for families in tackling poverty and promoting social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">The reduction and eventual elimination of child poverty is a top priority for the Government. It is at the core of the strategic process to combat poverty and social exclusion and this is reflected in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan (NDP). This strategic process was developed in consultation with the social partners and after wide ranging consultation with other stakeholders. The NAPinclusion adopts a lifecycle approach, in line with Towards 2016 . The purpose is to promote a coordinated and integrated approach to dealing with the specific needs of each lifecycle group across all relevant policies and among the institutions at both national and local levels responsible for implementing these policies.  Specific measurable goals are set for each group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">State support for children and their families is essential, especially in the case young couples in the early stages of their working lives when earnings are lower and outgoings higher than is the case at later stages of the lifecycle.  Four of the twelve high level goals in the NAPinclusion, therefore, focus on providing significant real increases in income supports for children and on targeted education initiatives. Children growing up in low income or jobless households are the most vulnerable to poverty. Care of children can create obstacles to accessing employment, especially employment that is full time and well paid. The most vulnerable groups in this regard are lone parents and larger families with 3 or more children. The most effective approach is to remove the obstacles to employment and create real incentives that will enable these parents to achieve a satisfactory work/life balance. This approach requires facilitating both care for children and employment participation that provides a decent income. The NAPinclusion provides in the case of the Working Age lifecycle for a case management approach that will put the necessary supports in place to enable parents in vulnerable situations to overcome obstacles to achieving this work/life balance. It requires, in particular, appropriate income support, child care services, and education and training, all of which are being provided for in the NAPinclusion and the NDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">The Combat Poverty Agency report compares child poverty rates across Europe using the relative income poverty or ‘at risk of poverty' measure, which is used extensively for international comparisons. However, the limitations of this poverty indicator, based just on income, are now recognised internationally. There is a consensus emerging that it should be complemented by an indicator that measures non financial material deprivation. It is considered that this approach would provide a clearer and more accurate measure of actual poverty and the vulnerable groups who are experiencing it. A recent OECD Study is one of the first to provide international comparisons of the proportion of households experiencing non financial material deprivation and some of the findings are included in its 2006 edition of Society at a Glance.  It uses a much wider series of deprivation indicators than that used, for example, for the consistent poverty indicator in Ireland and is not confined, as in Ireland, to those classified as a t risk of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">It shows nevertheless that the levels of material deprivation in Ireland across virtually all the various indicators are below and, in some cases, well below the average for OECD countries. Virtually all countries with low levels of deprivation also shown to have high levels of GDP per capita and Ireland is among that group of countries. This underlines the key importance of economic growth and the high levels of employment it creates in reducing poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">Significant progress has been made in reducing child poverty over the past decade. The latest EU-SILC survey shows the proportion of children in consistent poverty has reduced from 12.2 per cent in 2003 to 10.2 per cent in 2005. The Government is determined to build on this progress. The social welfare commitments in the Programme for Government prioritise the objectives of the NAPinclusion. They include; improvements in support for Lone Parents; in the State Pension and the Carers Allowance, in Child Benefit and in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the School Meals Programme. Support for the Office for Social Inclusion is a key commitment, in particular, for its work to progress the use of poverty impact assessments by government departments, local authorities and statutory agencies in the development of policies and programmes and the delivery of services to ensure that the Government's social inclusion agenda is achieved. My plans, in working with Government to deliver the programme over the coming years, are to build on the significant and visible progress already made in reducing child poverty. This will be a key part of the commitment in the NAPinclusion to reduce consistent poverty to between 4% and 2% by 2012, with the aim of eliminating it by 2016. It will involve, in particular, delivering real improvements in living standards and well-being for the most vulnerable in our society, especially our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1416">It is important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.   Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and can be beneficial to the individual. The Green Paper on pensions will include an examination of the issues surrounding retirement age and the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">In the context of the Green Paper on pensions and the Agreed Programme for Government, I will be seeking to introduce flexibilities into the social welfare pensions and social insurance systems to encourage and facilitate longer working.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">In order for changes in the pensions area to have an impact we require a change in attitudes in relation to longer working from both employers and employees. At the workplace level employers must seek to retain older employees and create the working conditions which will make longer working both attractive and feasible for older workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">These issues, together with the question of allowing employees choices in relation to the age at which they retire, are matters for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">A recommendation for the introduction of a new social assistance payment was included in the Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents." The discussion paper also put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare and improved information services for lone parents. It also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">The proposal for the new social assistance payment arose from a review of the One-parent Family Payment (OFP) carried out in my Department. This review focused on the effectiveness of current income support arrangements with due regard to:</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">the needs of lone parents and their children,</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">the desire to avoid long term dependency on social welfare income support and</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">the appropriateness of the current scheme in light of the changing external environmental in which it is operating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The new payment which is proposed for lone parents and other low income families will replace the current one payment family payment and the qualified adult allowance in social assistance. The details of the scheme and how it might operate are being addressed by a working group in my Department. Proposals being examined include time limiting payments, possibly up to the time the youngest child reaches 8 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Other issues being examined include an activation programme which would involve engagement by a facilitator with the customer from an early stage, to examine and identify their education and skill needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">Parents not in employment when the child reaches age 8 will be entitled to apply for job seekers allowance, back to work allowance or back to education allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">A test of the non-income and activation elements of the proposal is due to commence shortly. Decisions regarding the new payment scheme will follow completion of this test.</p>

            <p eId="para_1432">My Department delivers a front-line service to its customers through a network of 59 Local Offices and 66 Branch Offices countrywide. The services provided from these offices include jobseekers payments, One-parent Family Payment and a customer information service. The 59 Local Offices are staffed by departmental staff. The 66 Branch Offices are run by branch managers who are employed under a contract for service by the Department to administer certain Social Welfare services to members of the public in their catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">Due to the sad and untimely death of the Branch Manager in Dunmanway an arrangement had to be put in place immediately to ensure continuity of service to customers. The number of customers involved include approximately 230 in receipt of a jobseekers payment and a further 120 on farm assist, back to work and pre-retirement allowance.  These customers are being facilitated by neighbouring local offices and branch offices closest to where they live.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">In keeping with normal procedures when a branch office post becomes vacant, a review of the delivery of social welfare services in the area served by the branch office is undertaken to determine the most effective way of providing these services in the future. The review in respect of Dunmanway is expected to be completed in a month or so.</p>

            <p eId="para_1442">I propose to take Questions Nos. 167, 175, 616 to 620, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">According to Census 2002 almost 3,000 people between the ages of 15 and 17 are providing unpaid care in the home of which over 2,600 or 89% are still in formal education.  Over 300 people aged in that age group provide over 4 hours of care per day with over 200 young people provide a minimum of 43 hours of care per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">My Department provides income support to carers by way of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  The respite care grant, which is an annual payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, is payable from age 16.  The payment is made regardless of the carer's means or social insurance contributions but it is subject to certain qualifying conditions.  From June 2007 the value of the grant was increased from €1,200 to €1,500 per year in respect of each care recipient.  Carer's allowance, which provides income support to people who are providing certain older people or people with a disability with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit, is payable from age 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">My officials have examined the report "Caring Before Their Time? Research and Policy Perspectives on Young Carers" which was published by Barnardos and the Children's Research Centre.   I accept that special help, advice and support is essential for young carers in particular and that services must be put in place to support the household and to ensure that young carers remain at school.  These include the services of home helps, public health nurses and home care packages generally, which are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  Recent Budgets have provided for a significant increase in the funding of these services.  Indeed, one of the recommendations of that report was that policy relating to young carers should be a matter for the Department of Health and Children with services being delivered by the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">As you are aware the Working Group on Long Term Care was established by the Minister for Health and Children and my predecessor Minister Brennan in January 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care.  It comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my own Department. My officials have brought the issue of young carers to the attention of the Working Group.  The report of that Working Group is being considered by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">The national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" includes a commitment to a study of the extent to which children undertake inappropriate care roles in order to establish the extent and degree to which this issue arises and the levels of impact it has on the lives of children concerned.  This commitment to further research is in line with the recommendations of the Barnardos report.  Based on the outcome of this study and an analysis of the issues identified, a programme of in-home supports will be developed to alleviate specific problem areas identified for children.  It is intended that all relevant Departments will be involved in this study.  My Department which does not have the lead role with regard to this research will engage with it as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me.  However, I consider that it is through the provision of health and education services rather than income that we can best support young carers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1450">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, also receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">Legal advice indicates that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality. More recently, the European Commission has indicated that to extend the scheme to people in receipt of an Irish pension could also be considered discriminatory.</p>

            <p eId="para_1456">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) provides income support for employees on low earnings with families.  This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments.

There are currently some 20,250 people in receipt of FIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The reasons for the lack of take-up of FIS have been the subject of significant Parliamentary and other enquiry. In response, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign in March 2006 to promote and encourage increased take up of the scheme for working families on low incomes. This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press.  A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.  As a result, the take up of FIS was substantially increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The second element to address FIS take up issues is the commissioning of  research to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  A procurement process was initiated for consultancy assistance with this project but following a review a new procurement process has been initiated.  A request for tender (RFT) for consultancy assistance is being finalized by my Department and is expected to issue during the month of October via the e tenders website.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">My immediate plans entail the progression of two legislative initiatives over the coming months. These are the Social Welfare Bill 2007, and the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">Immediately following the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance in early December, I will introduce the Social Welfare Bill 2007 to the House.  This Bill will provide for the implementation of Budget increases in social welfare payments, any amendments to PRSI, consequent on Budget 2008, and any other changes to the Social Welfare Code which would, in the normal course, be scheduled to take effect from January, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The second Bill, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2008 will provide for any residual amendments to the Social Welfare schemes consequent on the Budget 2008 which are not provided for in the Social Welfare Bill 2007, and any additional measures requiring a basis in legislation.  This Bill will also provide for any amendments to the Pensions Act 1990, which are required in relation to occupational pensions and personal retirement savings accounts, as a result of the on-going consultation between the Department and the Pensions Board. This Bill is provisionally scheduled for publication early in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">It is also my intention to submit a Memorandum to Government, seeking permission to draft legislation to enact the proposals contained in the Government discussion paper on "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents".  The purpose of this Bill will be to provide for the introduction of a new means-tested payment for lone parent and other families on low incomes, which will replace the One-Parent Family Payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1467">A disregard of €100 per week of earnings from employment was introduced at the end of September 2006 for the purposes of the State Pension Non-Contributory. To further encourage State pensioners to participate in the workplace, the disregard was doubled, from €100 to €200 per week with effect from January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">While labour force participation by people aged 55-64 years is increasing in Ireland and is the sixth highest of the twenty seven EU countries, participation by people over 65 years has been declining over many years. I would expect that the doubling of the disregard should act as a further incentive to pensioners to return or remain in the workforce. It should also help address the concerns of pensioners about reductions in pensions and benefits, along with affording them the opportunity to increase their weekly income and standard of living.  An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to further extend the amount those in receipt of the State Non-Contributory Pension are allowed to earn without it affecting their pension entitlement. I look forward to progressing this commitment in a Budgetary context, having regard to available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st of May 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">The basis for the restriction is the applicant's habitual residence.  The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">Decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by Deciding Officers at local level throughout the country.  Complex cases that require detailed consideration are sent to a central section in Dublin or are examined in dedicated units in the scheme areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">For the period from 1 May 2004 to 31 July 2007, the number of habitual residence complex cases decided was 56,366. The number of applications decided in respect of Irish citizens was 14,358, of which 1,387 (10%) were disallowed. The number of cases decided in respect of persons other than Irish nationals was 42,008 of which 12,505 (30%) were disallowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.  Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">Nationals of the European Economic Area (EEA) who take up employment in the State are protected under the EU Regulations governing social security for migrant workers.  Migrant workers from outside the EEA qualify for social insurance benefits in respect of the unexpired part of their work permits if they satisfy the normal qualifying conditions.  The habitual residence condition does not apply in these cases.  Such workers may also satisfy the habitual residence condition for receipt of social assistance payments and child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The habitual residence condition is being operated in a careful manner to ensure that Ireland's social welfare system is protected, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the system have access to it when they need it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">The reason for the introduction of the habitual residence condition in May 2004 was to ensure that persons who have not worked in Ireland or who have not established   habitual residence in Ireland should not avail of assistance schemes or child benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The operation of the condition was reviewed by my Department in 2006 and it is not proposed to introduce any changes to the current policy in this regard as the original reason for the policy is still valid.</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to ‘Increase the basic State pension by around 50% to at least €300 per week by 2012'. Changes to pension rates are considered in a budgetary context and will be announced in the forthcoming budget.  It is estimated that the cost of increasing contributory pensions, which are financed through the Social Insurance Fund, to €300 would be €1,705 million in a full year.  The exact effect of such an increase on the Social Insurance Fund would be contingent on the sequencing of changes to pension rates of the period to 2012 but, in the short term, the Fund has sufficient resources to provide for such an increase. However, over the medium term such a change would have the effect of eroding the current surplus of the Social Insurance Fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_1482">The Warmer Homes Scheme is operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland and matters relating to that scheme are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The aim of the national fuel scheme, administered by my Department, is to assist householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season.  It is estimated that some 286,200 households will benefit under the scheme in 2007 at an annual cost of €161.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">Given the significant annual cost of the fuel allowance, Budget 2006 provided for a grant of €2m to Sustainable Energy Ireland for fuel poverty research.  The rationale was that while my Department was making payments to people to meet their heating needs through primary social welfare payments and the Fuel Allowance scheme, the benefit of these payments was considerably offset where people were living in poorly insulated homes.  The budget grant was intended to complement the Fuel Poverty Action Research Project which is being carried out in Cork and Donegal in a joint operation funded entirely by Combat Poverty Agency and Sustainable Energy Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">Sustainable Energy Ireland are using the €2m grant to undertake a project for owner occupied dwellings in Waterford city and county. The work being carried out includes both insulation and heating measures (a "whole house" approach) and is broader in approach than their current Warmer Homes Scheme which provides insulation only. The grant is to cover the cost of setting up the project, arranging for remedial work to be carried out on approximately 460 houses, conducting research surveys, analysing the resultant data and submission of a formal report.  The report will, among other things, assess the impact of the work undertaken in individual homes at a point twelve months after the work is undertaken.  As the remedial work stage is now being completed, the report will be compiled towards the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">The grant of €2m to SEI is a once-off payment for research purposes.  Any expansion of this initiative would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of the eventual research results from the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">My Department through its various social insurance and assistance schemes provides income supports to people to meet their basic living needs, including food, clothing, heat and light.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">Supplements are also payable in certain circumstances for specific needs, for example fuel allowances, rent supplements, living alone allowance for older people or the household benefits package for pensioners, eligible disabled people and carers. Where people on low incomes have particular medical conditions or dietary requirements, diet supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. It is expected that expenditure on diet supplements will amount to €5.5 million this year and benefit over 10,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">My Department also provides funding for school meals through two programmes, the urban school meals scheme and the local projects scheme. The urban school meals scheme operates in conjunction with certain local authorities and is co-funded by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">The local projects scheme provides funding to secondary, national, pre-schools and community groups in both urban and rural areas who provide school meals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">For families with school-going children, school meals can make a real and important contribution to ensuring that children receive better nutrition. Such services can also contribute to improved school attendance and quality of learning. Expenditure on the schools meals programme for 2006 was €13.6 million and benefited some 125,000 pupils in approx 1,400 schools in 2006. Expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will exceed €20m benefiting over 165,000 pupils in over 1,800 schools. The number of meals being provided on a daily basis to disadvantaged children through the school meals local projects scheme doubled from 89,915 in the school year 2005/2006 to 179,660 in the school year 2006/2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">A report entitled "Food Poverty and Policy" published in 2004 by the Combat Poverty Agency, Crosscare and the Society of St Vincent de Paul defined food poverty as "the inability to access a nutritionally adequate diet and the related impacts on health, culture and social participation". The Healthy Food for All Initiative awareness campaign followed a report entitled "Food Poverty and Policy" published in 2004 by the Combat Poverty Agency, Crosscare and the Society of St Vincent de Paul defined food poverty as "the inability to access a nutritionally adequate diet and the related impacts on health, culture and social participation". The Healthy Food for All Initiative awareness campaign followed on from the Food Poverty and Policy report. My Department is currently involved with the Healthy Food for All Initiative in plans to draw up a best practice code for school meals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">Healthy eating is affected by dietary and nutritional awareness, cultural attitudes and access to good quality grocery shopping, as well as to the adequacy of social welfare income supports. In recent years, budgetary increases in social welfare payment rates have consistently exceeded increases in the cost of living. This key policy is the primary focus of Budget allocations to my Department each year, and it has helped ensure that those depending on social welfare experience real improvement in their ability to meet their basic needs, including provision of adequate food, heating, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">In this regard, consumer price index information from the Central Statistics Office indicates that the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages has increased by 2.7% over the past 12 months. From December 2001 to date, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by just 6.6% in aggregate while increases in social welfare payment rates increased by between 61% and 77% in the same period. As overall total inflation for the main categories of beneficiaries amounted to less than 23% in that period, there has been a very significant real increase in purchasing power for people on social welfare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">I am satisfied that the policy of providing substantial real increases in primary social insurance and assistance payment rates has been effective in ensuring that those who depend on social welfare income have sufficient income for healthy food.</p>

            <p eId="para_1501">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer. My Department has consistently publicised the scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families. Following significant improvements in the qualifying income limits in the 2006 budget, my Department undertook a week-long, nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme. This, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims. There are currently 20,247 people in receipt of FIS payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">Family Income Supplement is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions but a claim for renewal may then be made. The upward trend in new claims is also reflected in renewals.  This has resulted in an increase in the number of claims to be processed in my Department. To date in 2007, my Department has received 26,898 new and renewal FIS claims and has decided a total of 20,916 cases. At 14/09/2007 there were 10,604 claims awaiting decision; 4,317 new claims and 6,287 renewal claims. The average time it takes to award a FIS claim or renewal in 2007 (up to end of August) is 14.52 weeks. My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. Measures have been taken to improve claim processing times for FIS:  A review of existing processes and procedures has been completed by my Department with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing; Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment; The ongoing staffing requirement was recently reviewed in the light of the current volumes of claims and renewals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand. The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1505">My Department has taken a lead role over the years in developing and implementing identity management policies and procedures based on the use of the Personal Public Services (PPS) number. This number was previously known as the Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number. The name was changed to indicate the broadening of its role to one which supports delivery of a broader range of public services but it is also still used for its original core purpose of providing a common identifier for the Revenue Commissioners and this Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">As well as facilitating wider-scale exchange of information, the PPS number also has a role in the development of on-line services for individuals. My Department provides identity related services to a number of agencies in accordance with legislation. Building on these services, the Department constructed Public Service Identity (PSI) services to assist agencies in basic on-line identity management. The initial deployment of PSI services, through the Reach agency, supports the registration and authentication functions of the Revenue Commissioners PAYE on-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">The overall Government strategy is to realise the potential of the Information Society through innovation and modernisation of public services. As part of this, the  Standard Authentication Framework Environment programme, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance, builds on PSI Services to provide the basis for a consistent set of registration and authentication services for customer interaction with public services. The Revenue Commissioners are also participating in this programme of work and we will continue to develop PSI and other relevant services in conjunction with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">My Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are currently engaged in finalising a renewed Memorandum of Understanding between our organisations concerning co-operation and mutual assistance. The objective of the proposed revised Memorandum is:</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">to provide a basis for the continuance, enhancement and expansion of the existing administrative and operational arrangements</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">to better reflect the missions, modern operating realities and totality of the relationship between the two organisations</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">to recognise the growing interdependencies between the two organisations in achieving the delivery of services to the highest standard</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">to strengthen liaison structures with a view to monitoring service delivery and control aspects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">It is expected that the Memorandum will be finalised before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">My Department will of course continue to explore on the basis of these significant ongoing developments how greater data and money transfer efficiencies could be realised in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1521">I am aware of the Financial Regulator's concerns that some lending activities (including those of some sub-prime lenders) fall outside the scope of the Consumer Protection Code and therefore some borrowers do not benefit from the additional safeguards which that Code provides.  I have already indicated my intention to bring forward legislation to ensure that all consumer lending can be brought within the ambit of the Code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">I have initiated consultation with interested parties on proposals which my Department has developed in consultation with the Financial Regulator. A consultation paper setting out these proposals has been circulated to interested parties and is published on the Department's website site.  The object of these proposals is to establish a regulatory regime for non-deposit taking lenders which would enable application of the Code to the relevant activities of firms in that the sector and provide also for the supervisory regime required under the EU 3rd Money Laundering Directive.  The paper can be found on the Department of Finance website at the link below: http://www.finance.gov.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=5016</p>

            <p eId="para_1525">I am aware of the Financial Regulator's recently published review of the licensed moneylending industry. The purpose of this review was to gain a greater understanding of the industry and to determine whether it is appropriate, necessary and reasonable to change current regulatory policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">It is not my function or that of the Financial Regulator to endorse any type of credit provider as being socially beneficial.  Responsible use of credit clearly can have advantages for consumers in terms of their lifestyles but the decisions can only be made on an individual basis in the light of the consumer's needs and means.  The Financial Regulator recommends that consumers take on the right type of credit for the right purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">The Financial Regulator provides information about the different forms of credit available to consumers, including credit cards, overdrafts, hire purchase, personal loans and money lending.  The Financial Regulator also recommends a number of steps that borrowers should take including shopping around for the cheapest loan, reading all loan agreements, reviewing their debts from time to time and not taking on more debt than they can afford.  Borrowers should immediately get in touch with the lender if they have any difficulty in meeting repayments, or contact their local MABS centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">I strongly endorse these recommendations.  In particular, I would urge all consumers to shop around for credit, to examine the scope to borrow from community based lenders such as credit unions, and to avail of the more detailed information which is available through the Financial Regulator's publications, help-line (Lo call 1890 77 77 77) and website:  http://www.itsyourmoney.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_1538">The essential point at issue here appears to be the tax treatment of the reimbursement of the cost of travel and taxi fares in respect of travel between home and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">It is a long established principle of tax case law that the expenses of travelling from home to work and work to home are not expenses of travelling necessarily incurred by an employee in the performance of the duties of his/her office or employment and hence are not tax deductible.  It follows from this that where the employer reimburses (directly or indirectly) the cost of travel between home and work, such reimbursement is taxable.  Revenue has the same obligations as any other employer and is accordingly legally obliged to deduct tax under PAYE in respect of the cost of taxi fares paid or reimbursed and of car expenses paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">For the sake of completeness, it should be noted that Revenue guidelines provide that the charge to tax does not arise in exceptional circumstances, e.g. where an employee is on-call to deal with certain emergencies and is called out only on an exceptional basis, or where an employee is required to work very late on an occasional basis.  However, this exception could not be extended to reimbursement of expenses for travel between home and work, which is rostered, predictable and occurs on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1542">The position has been that individuals aged 65 years or over and individuals who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining themselves, can claim a refund from DIRT where the income of the individual (inclusive of the deposit interest) is below the appropriate income exemption limit for tax purposes.  In the 2007 tax year the exemption limit for a single person aged 65 or over is €19,000 per annum, and in the case of a married couple, the exemption limit is €38,000.  A partial refund may be due to such individuals whose income (inclusive of the deposit interest) does not greatly exceed the appropriate income exemption limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">The Deputy may wish to be aware that changes have recently been made in this regard to simplify arrangements considerably.  The Finance Act 2007 introduced new arrangements which allow account holders whose total income does not exceed the exemption limit and are either aged 65 years of age or over or permanent incapacitated, to have any interest earned on money on deposit credited to their savings account by their Financial Institution without deduction of DIRT.   Appropriate declaration forms, which are available from Financial Institutions, must be completed by the account holder and submitted to the relevant Financial Institutions to benefit from these arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">The main focus of the tax exemption for foster care payments in section 192 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended, is to help underpin the system of foster care services for children in support of the policy objectives set out in the National Children's Strategy (2000) and the Report of the Working Group on Foster Care (2001).

            <p eId="para_1556">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that The Value Added Tax (Refund Of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 allows for VAT paid on qualifying goods to be refunded where the goods are purchased for the use of disabled persons suffering a specified degree of disablement. Qualifying goods are defined as "goods other than mechanically propelled road vehicles which are aids or appliances, including parts and accessories, specially adapted for use by disabled persons and includes goods which, although not so specially constructed or adapted might reasonably be treated as so constructed or adapted having regard to the particular disablement of that person".</p>
            <p eId="para_1557">The person concerned made an application to the Revenue Commissioners for a refund of VAT incurred on the provision of a gas fired central heating system complete with radiators for his home. The Revenue Commissioners consider that it would not be reasonable to treat a gas fired central heating system as being specially constructed or adapted having regard to a person with the specific health condition concerned and therefore regret that they are unable to grant this application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1562">When the Decentralisation Programme was announced in December 2003 the Programme included the intention to relocate 30 State Agencies to locations outside of Dublin. The Sector represents just over 20% of the overall Government's decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The Government has always recognised that this aspect of the programme presents different challenges from that of the Civil Service. I remain confident that through dialogue and negotiation, progress can be advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1564">The Labour Court recommendation in relation to the dispute between FÁS and SIPTU provides a renewed opportunity for both unions and management to address the relevant issues.  As part of their recommendation, the Court states that it believes that the stated policy of effecting decentralisation on a voluntary basis could best be achieved if individuals who are unwilling to relocate are provided with realistic alternative career options, which take account of the proprietary rights and legitimate expectations which they have accrued in their current employments.  The Court goes on to say that it believes that the appropriate authorities should address the issues arising in the broader context of decentralisation of non-commercial State Bodies overall.  This aspect of the Labour Court finding is very much in line with the previously expressed view of the Decentralisation Implementation Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">In relation to the state bodies generally, it is now a matter, in the first instance, for each body together with its parent Department, to manage their approach to implementation taking account of the implications of the Labour Court recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">My Department has written to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to establish how progress can be made on this aspect of the Labour Court recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">I have also made it clear that recruitment of staff to FÁS Headquarters and to other State Agencies for new decentralised locations will continue in line with the Government's policy on decentralisation.  Already this policy has assisted in approximately 25% of staff now being in place for the new locations across the State Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">The existing arrangements in the Civil Service in relation to promotions will not be affected by the Labour Court recommendation in the FÁS case.  It is the Government's view that the recommendation is firmly rooted in the context of the State Agencies and has no implications for the Decentralisation Programme in the Civil Service.  There are detailed arrangements in place to discuss any staff concerns in the Civil Service with staff representatives.  The key forum in this regard is the General Council Subcommittee on Decentralisation which meets monthly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">The position is that a special income tax exemption was introduced in Budget 2006 for those minding up to three children, who are not their own, in the minder's own home.  Under the scheme, the relief may apply provided the earnings from such childcare do not exceed €15,000 per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">The rationale for the scheme was to encourage stay-at-home parents or those working part-time to provide childcare services on a small scale.  It was one element in a suite of measures adopted by the Government in recent years to address the issue of childcare.  Apart from the significant increases in Child Benefit, the relevant support measures included the Early Childcare Supplement of €1,000 per annum for each child up to his or her sixth birthday, a new five-year National Childcare Investment Programme which aims to fund an additional 50,000 childcare places by 2010, as well as extending paid and unpaid maternity leave.  I have no plans to extend the tax exemption scheme as suggested by the Deputy.</p>

        <b>Deputy John Curran</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance</b>
         his views on removing VAT to cars being converted from petrol to biofuels. 
        [19992/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_583">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1576">The position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can retain the zero rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible to apply a zero rate to the supply of cars converted from petrol to biofuels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">In addition, while a reduced rate can be applied to certain goods and services, there is no mechanism which would allow for the reduced rating of alternative fuel consumption systems for cars.  The VAT Directive does not make any distinction between different types of fuels or methods of production of energy. The supply of all fuel consumption systems, including environmentally friendly ones, is therefore chargeable at the standard VAT rate of 21%.  Any change in the standard rate would apply to the sale of all fuel consumption systems and indeed products at the standard VAT rate.  A reduction in the standard VAT of 1% would cost the Exchequer in excess of €440 million and have little or no effect on price.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">However, under the VAT system, VAT registered businesses can claim a deduction for fuel, other than petrol, e.g. diesel, LPG or bio-fuels. In addition, VAT on the conversion of a vehicle is allowable as a deduction provided the conversion is an expense suffered in the course or furtherance of business and used for a taxable activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1579">I would draw the Deputy's attention to the significant measures in other tax areas, provided for in Finance Act 2006, which have served to promote biofuels in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">The excise relief scheme for biofuels, which received the necessary EU State Aid approval, commenced in November 2006 and:</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">provides for excise relief on up to 163 million litres of biofuels per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">costs over €200m over 5 years;</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">when fully operational, will result in CO2 savings of over 250,000 tonnes per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">will contribute towards meeting a target of 5.75% transport fuel market penetration by biofuels by 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">will help reduce our dependency on conventional fossil fuels, and</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">will stimulate activity in the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">As a complementary measure, I provided in Finance Act 2006 for a 50% VRT relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles (cars designed to operate on biofuels) for an initial period of two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">The Deputy may also wish to note that there are additional non-fiscal measures that can be used to promote biofuels and reach the targets referred to. To provide further market certainty and encourage biofuel projects of scale, in March 2007, the Government announced its intention to move to a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, with targets for market penetration for biofuels of 5.75% in 2009 and 10% by 2020. This measure is included in the Programme for Government in conjunction with a commitment to work with our EU partners to require biofuels used in transport to comply with an environmental certification system which incorporates sustainability criteria in terms of biofuel production.</p>

            <p eId="para_1608">I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">Following heavy and persistent rain in December and January last, flooding occurred at a number of locations in South Mayo.  The main areas affected were Clyard and Thomastown, Kilmaine, the Neale and Hollymount.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">The Office of Public Works is currently working with Mayo County Council and other relevant bodies to devise solutions to the flood risk in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">With regard to Kilmaine, it was agreed, following contact between the OPW, Mayo County Council, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Western Regional Fisheries Board, that overflow channels from Clyard and Thomastown turloughs would be run into a scheduled OPW channel of the Corrib-Headford Drainage Scheme to reduce flood risk. The Clyard link has been excavated by OPW maintenance staff and it is expected that the Thomastown work will be completed by the end of October, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">In the case of the Neale, no solution to the flooding problem has been identified to date.  All surface water drainage in the area affected is by way of underground channels and there are no rivers or streams near enough to divert flood waters to. The OPW has commissioned a topographical aerial survey of the area to provide information towards a possible solution and this will be carried out as soon as weather conditions permit. Mayo County Council have engaged an expert hydrogeologist to advise on underground flows and to possibly identify linkages between the various turloughs in the Neale area. It is not possible to know at this stage when a viable solution will be found.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">I understand that a number of houses in the Hollymount area, including the property of the family referred to, were at risk due to the flooding, and roads were also flooded at a number of locations. While this Office has identified a possible route to divert waters into a scheme channel, further survey works are required to determine the feasibility and cost effectiveness of such a solution. This Office is actively engaged with Mayo County Council in gathering information and data. Any resultant proposal will have to be referred to both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Western Regional Fisheries Board for consideration from an environmental perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">In addition to the specific actions above, it is understood that Mayo County Council are pursuing the possibility of undertaking road-raising works at various locations throughout Mayo.</p>

The memorandum also provided for the signing in May 1996 of Operational Guidelines implementing the Government decision for the Customs and Excise Service and the Garda Síochána, in consultation with the Naval Service, to operate a Joint Task Force to deal with intelligence-driven drug smuggling operations and "controlled deliveries."

         if he has plans to ease the burden on farmers in the farm retirement scheme who lease their holdings to relatives and are not able to avail of the tax exemption associated with a qualifying lease that could be entered into with a non-relative, entitling them to a €20,000 exemption for a lease of 10 years or more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1627">Under Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax on leasing of land in respect of the first €12,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than 5 years, in respect of €15,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than 7 years and in respect of €20,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than 10 years.  The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 40 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, "qualifying lessee" specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">This restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure and such measures are common throughout the tax code.  It should also be noted that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as  by gift or sale.</p>

There are no special favourable tax arrangements for cohabiting couples with dependent children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1654">The Working Group Examining the Treatment of Married, Cohabiting and One-Parent Families under the Tax and Social Welfare Codes, which reported in August 1999, was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further. However, it acknowledged in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples that a key issue is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">There are a number of recent reports which will help to inform the Government's deliberations in this general area including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">the Tenth Progress Report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution entitled ‘The Family' which was published in early 2006;</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">the Options Paper presented to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 2006 by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership (the Colley Group); and</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">the Report of the Law Reform Commission on the rights and duties of cohabitants which was published in December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">I would also point out that An Agreed Programme for Government contains the following provision in relation to civil partnerships:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1660">"This Government is committed to full equality for all in our society. Taking account of the options paper prepared by the Colley Group and the pending Supreme Court case, we will legislate for Civil Partnerships at the earliest possible date in the lifetime of the Government."</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">I have previously indicated to the House that I would view as problematic and unwise a situation where changes in the tax code relating to the treatment of couples would set a headline in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy such as in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships.  I am still of that view.</p>

            <p eId="para_1663">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they work very closely with other Agencies in limiting and attempting to prevent the importation of drugs into the State.  In the control of coastal smuggling, the co-operation of the Navy, the Garda Síochána, fishermen's organisations, harbour authorities and of coastal communities is hugely valuable. The Customs responsibility is for the coast itself and coastal waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">As part of its strategy, Revenue purchased a 23 metre cutter, the RCC Suirbhéir, with full sea-going capability.  This vessel began active work in 2005, with a specially trained and highly skilled crew of Revenue officials.  Since then, it has proved its usefulness in patrolling coastal waters, drug seizures and building stronger ties with coastal communities.  It has taken part in several operations, including international operations to track and investigate suspicious vessels.  Its role was crucial recently in the recovery of drugs at Dunlough Bay in Cork, and off the Galway coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">The RCC Suirbhéir provides critical support to Customs activity, as does other equipment, such as the container scanner based at Dublin.  Their effectiveness however, depends on support, especially in the form of intelligence, from their Revenue colleagues, from other agencies (including international counterparts) and from members of the public.  In the case of the RCC Suirbhéir, its greatest value is in providing a rapid and effective response when suspicious activity is reported.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">Revenue is currently engaged in preparing a new Statement of Strategy for 2008-2010 and will also be reviewing its strategy in relation to smuggling, especially drug smuggling.  This review will include investigation of the most effective methods of monitoring coastal traffic, using the most modern available methods.  Consideration of the acquisition of new marine craft, whether of the same type as the existing cutter, or of different types for specific purposes, will be an intrinsic part of that review.  The experience of the past two years, including recent drug finds, will of course be taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1681">The Irish League of Credit Unions, (ILCU), has since 1989, operated a savings protection scheme, (SPS), for credit unions. The SPS aims to protect the individual savings of members by ensuring that credit unions are financially and administratively sound and provides for savings protection for each individual credit union member up to a maximum of €12,700. It is important to note that no member of a credit union has experienced any loss of shares and deposits and no credit union has become insolvent. The SPS has only been called upon in a very limited number of cases, and it has never been necessary to make savings protection payments to individual credit union members.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">The design and operation of the SPS for credit unions is consistent with the specific regulatory approach adopted for credit unions under the Credit Union Act 1997. However in line with changes in the regulatory environment for financial services generally, the need for modernisation of the organisational structure and governance arrangements for the credit union SPS has become evident over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">Earlier this year the Registrar of Credit Unions commenced a structured series of meetings with the ILCU to examine certain SPS reform proposals put forward by them. The Registrar of Credit Unions has advised that these discussions identified common ground with regard to how savings protection based on the ILCU's proposal should work. I understand that, since the conclusion of these discussions at the end of March, ILCU have been consulting with their membership and it is expected that they will revert to the Financial Regulator shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">The Deposit Guarantee Scheme applicable to Irish licensed banks and building societies provides for payments, up to a maximum of 90% of the aggregate deposits held by that depositor, subject to a maximum compensation payment of €20,000, in circumstances where a bank or building society is unable to repay deposits due to its financial condition.</p>

To facilitate a smooth transition for childcare services in receipt of staffing support funding in 2007 to the new Scheme, and subject to compliance with reporting/contractual requirements and audit/verification recommendations, there will be a transitional period in the first half of 2008 during which existing staffing grant beneficiaries, including the Group in question, will be able to avail of grant funding at their existing 2007 level.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1725">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement  the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent and/or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme will not discriminate against rural services and the number of parents in rural areas supported by the new scheme is not expected to be lower than in urban areas.  Per capita, the majority of the social welfare benefits which are referenced by the new schemes are availed of by more people outside the Dublin area than in it and parents in receipt of Farm Assist will attract the higher level of subvention.  Data available from EOCP grant applications also suggests that the costs of running a rural service, and therefore the costs charged to parents, are lower than those for services in urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">Given the advantages of the new scheme, the increase in the level of funding available under it, and given that a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces, I do not propose that the Government row back on its commitment to increase these supports for disadvantaged parents, which would be the effect of what the Deputy proposes.  Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  I have also signalled that the more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated by the new scheme will be monitored by officials in my Office over the coming months and, if appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1751">I propose to take Questions Nos. 253, 306, 369 and 439 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">The Report of the Expert Group on Mental Health Policy, "A Vision for Change", which was launched in January 2006, provides a framework for action to develop a modern, high quality mental health services for a seven to ten year period.  The Report represents Government policy and is the basis for the future development of our mental health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">An independent Monitoring Group was established in March 2006, to monitor and assess progress by the Health Service Executive, government departments and other agencies in implementing the recommendations set out in the Report. The Monitoring Group's first annual report was published in May 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">Implementation of the individual recommendations of "A Vision for Change", is a matter primarily for the HSE.  In July 2006, the HSE established an implementation group to ensure that mental health services develop in a synchronised and consistent manner across the country and resource service managers and clinicians in making the recommendations in "A Vision for Change" a reality. The HSE intend to publish their implementation plan by the Autumn which is to include a timed and prioritised set of short, medium and longer term goals.  In acknowledging the need to provide a dedicated and coordinated response to "A Vision for Change", the HSE appointed a full time Project Manager to progress the implementation plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">Since 1997, significant additional revenue funding has been invested in mental health services. Approximately €1 billion will be spent on mental health services in 2007. This includes an additional €51 million which was allocated in 2006 and 2007 for the development of our mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change". The estimated cost of implementation of "A Vision for Change" is approximately €150 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">Future funding will be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2008 and subsequent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1758">The Drugs Payments Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs, is available to non-medical card holders. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.

            <p eId="para_1762">I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 273 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">The Health Contribution was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on the 6th April of that year. The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance of the Health Contributions Act and are paid over to the Minister for Health and Children in respect of the Vote for the Health Service Executive. The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income up to €1925 per week or €100,100 per annum and 2.5 % on the balance of income in excess of those amounts in a contribution year. Subject to exemptions, the rate of contribution is applicable to all persons over the age of sixteen with reckonable income, earnings or emoluments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">The exemptions, as outlined in Section 11 of the Act, are those whose income does not exceed €480 per week, those who are fully eligible for health services as set out in Section 45 of the Health Act 1970 (i.e. medical cardholders in this State, including those workers covered under EC Regulation 1408/71), recipients of a Social Welfare Widow's/Widower's Pension, One-parent Family Payment or Deserted Wife's Benefit/Allowance, as well as those in receipt of a Widow'/Widower's pension acquired under the social security legislation of an EU member State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">When the primary legislation was enacted no upper age limit applied to the health contribution. However, as the Deputy is aware, following the announcement in Budget 2001, full eligibility for health services under Section 45 of the Health Act was granted to those aged 70 and over, effectively placing an upper age limit of 69 years on liability to pay health contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">There are no current proposals to alter any of these exemptions or to provide an exemption from paying health contributions to those aged between 65 and 69.</p>

            <p eId="para_1769">I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 275 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">The law provides that persons aged 70 years or more are required to undergo a medical review for driving licence renewal purposes. As you will be aware, this requirement is one which is determined by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is therefore outside the responsibility of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">In making arrangements for the provision of publicly funded GP services, under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, an agreement was negotiated between the Department of Health and Children and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract. This contract is a treatment-based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide GP medical and surgical services without charge to eligible persons; this includes persons aged 70 and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card. The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect  of certain certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences". As these non-treatment type services are outside the scope of the GMS GP contract, it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular service to agree a fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">While certificates for various applications are provided by medical practitioners, they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1774">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_1780">I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million to the National Cancer Screening Service for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  BreastCheck appointed the Clinical Directors for the South and West last November and has also appointed four Consultant Radiologists, two Consultant Surgeons and two Consultant Histopathologists, all with a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of Radiographers and other staff is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of seven additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The static units at University College Hospital Galway and the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork are due to be completed in late Autumn and BreastCheck has confirmed that the programme will commence national roll-out in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">The BreastCheck clinical unit in the Western Area at University College Hospital Galway will have three associated mobile units.  BreastCheck has already commenced screening in the West, with the provision last May of a mobile unit at Roscommon County Hospital.  The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to the Western region will cover counties Clare, Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, and Tipperary North Riding.  There are approximately 58,000 women in the target age group in these counties.  Screening in individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck's management and operational considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The expert advice from BreastCheck and from the National Cancer Forum, as contained in its National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the current programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69 years.  The priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened and accordingly it is fully focused at present on the commencement of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1801">Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services continues to be the Government's top priority in health.  The new Programme for Government contains a number of additional measures which will build on the progress made to date and which are designed to bring about further improvements in the quality and accessibility of A &amp; E services. These are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">To increase the number of A &amp; E consultants available around the clock in A &amp; E departments;</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">To further develop chest pain and respiratory clinics; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">To establish a national network of Local Injury Clinics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">The over-riding objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A &amp; E and do not require admission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">The Health Service Executive's activity statistics continue to indicate significant reductions in the number of patients awaiting admission as compared with the previous year.  Over the first eight months of 2007, the average number of patients awaiting admission each day was 95.  This compares with an average of 173 patients over the first eight months of 2006.  This represents an average reduction of 45%.  There has also been a significant reduction in the number of hospitals reporting incidences of patients waiting unnecessarily long times for admission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">The majority of the hospitals which had been identified as experiencing difficulties in relation to the delivery of Emergency Department services have for some time been meeting initial performance targets set by the HSE.  The HSE has indicated that it will introduce revised performance targets in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">The report of the HSE's Emergency Department Task Force recommended that the issues in Emergency Departments be examined on a whole-hospital and whole-system basis.  It identified the requirement for hospital-specific initiatives as well as the development of national responses in relation to key structural issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1809">A key requirement is the development of strong internal management control processes at hospital and community levels to ensure that capacity is fully optimised and that measures designed to unlock capacity are supported by strong controls which enable an appropriate balancing between emergency and elective workloads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">My Department is assured by the HSE that a series of additional measures are being put in place to ensure the delivery of an improved service for patients and to reduce pressure on A &amp; E departments.  These include a number of hospital avoidance measures such as:</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">the expansion of the Hospital in the Home scheme to the Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals;</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">the Rapid Access Clinic for the elderly at the Smithfield Centre in Dublin;</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">the development of Community Intervention Teams;</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">the roll-out of more primary care team;</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">the expansion of out-of-hours GP services; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">the expansion of community diagnostic services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">Measures being taken to improve and optimise acute hospital capacity and capability include the development of:</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">Seven new Community Nursing Units in Dublin;- Additional long-stay beds outside of Dublin;</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">Additional Admission Lounges;</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">Acute Medical Assessment Units at Navan and Naas;</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1825">I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 416 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">Changes to the medical card assessment guidelines are made from time to time, primarily to ensure that people whose general circumstances have not changed can maintain their entitlement.  Such periodic adjustments have not involved a linkage with the social welfare system.  Under the current assessment arrangements, persons whose sole income is derived from Department of Social and Family Affairs payments or HSE payments, even if these exceed the assessment guidelines, qualify for a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">My Department and the HSE monitor the number of medical cards and GP visit cards on an ongoing basis and the need for changes to the guidelines is kept under review, having regard to factors such as changes in income levels generally, the nature of typical household outgoings and also changes to the various social welfare schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">Since the beginning of 2005 I have introduced a number of significant changes to the manner in which the assessment for medical cards and GP visit cards is undertaken.  The assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work.  In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive (HSE) a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">Between January 2005 and September 2007 a net additional 188,308 people have qualified for access to GP services free of charge.  This figure comprises an additional 114,723 people with a medical card and a further 73,585 people with a GP visit card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">The Programme for Government commits to the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage;</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards;</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">My Department is at present considering the steps required to enable these commitments to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">My Department is also examining the steps necessary to give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
            <p eId="para_1837">The Government is committed to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability as illustrated by the substantial investment in the disability sector over the last number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">As part of this commitment the National Disability Strategy was launched in September 2004.  It provides for a framework of new supports for people with disabilities.  The Strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in several pieces of equality legislation.  It puts the policy of mainstreaming of public services for people with disabilities, which was adopted by Government in 2000, on a legal footing. The main elements of the Strategy are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">The Disability Act, 2005;</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004;</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">Six Outline Sectoral Plans published by Government Departments;</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">The Citizens Information Act, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">Funding of Multi-Annual Investment Programme (2006-2009): An integral part of the National Disability Strategy is the Multi-Annual Investment Programme, MAIP, announced in the 2005 Budget, which provides for an additional €900m to support the development of high priority disability services over the period 2006 to 2009.  The programme covers both current and capital spending. These commitments include the development of new residential, respite and day places for persons with intellectual disability and autism and the development of new residential places and extra hours of home support and personal assistance for persons with physical and/or sensory disabilities in each of the years covered by the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">In 2007 additional funding amounting to €75m was provided to meet costs associated with the 2007 element of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme and in particular to enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for people with disabilities.  This is in line with the Government's commitment to build capacity within the health services to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the National Disability Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">The MAIP provides that, by the end of 2009, 1290 new residential places, 430 new respite places, and 2,540 new day places will have been commissioned for intellectual disability services and those with autism. In the same period 380 new residential places and 1,200,000 extra hours of home support and personal assistance will be provided for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">In addition, an extra €2m is being provided each year of the programme to cover the cost of additional staffing needs in order to transfer about 600 persons with intellectual disability / autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">Disability Act 2005: The Disability Act 2005 is a central element of the National Disability Strategy. The Act is a positive measure designed to advance and underpin participation by people with disabilities in everyday life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1848">Part 2 of the Act commenced for children aged under 5 years with effect from 1st June 2007 and provides for an independent assessment of need for such persons and for a formal statement of the services that will be provided to them arising from the assessment. This prioritisation reflects the importance of intervention early in life, which can have a significant impact on the disabling effects of a condition or impairment. Part 2 will be commenced in respect of children aged 5-18 in tandem with the implementation of the EPSEN Act. The statutory requirements of Part 2 of the Disability Act will be extended to adults as soon as possible but no later than 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">In the meantime, services for adults with a disability will continue to be developed over the next number of years. The primary focus of many of the elements of the Multi-Annual Investment Programme is on meeting the identified needs of adults with disabilities.  Enhancements in multi-disciplinary support services for both adults and children will also be put in place progressively over the coming years.  In advance of the commencement of the Act for all age groups, the HSE will be promoting the practice of assessment of individual needs and the provision of service statements for all service users, as capacity permits.</p>

          <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_638">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_1851">Government Policy: Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">Services for Older People are a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  In 2006, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full year cost of €150m.  In 2007 a full year package of €255m has been allocated for services for older people.  This gives a total of over €400m added to services for older people over two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">Significant new community-based initiatives have been provided in recent times to support older people. In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of €55m (prior to this date only 1,100 packages had been in operation on a pilot basis).  A further €55m made available in 2007 will allow new packages to benefit some 4,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">In relation to the Home-Help service, an extra €18m was provided in Budget 2007 to enable the HSE fund some 780,000 additional home helps hours this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">Additional funding provided by the Government this year will also allow for a further 1,100 day places per week in Day Care centres around the country, and enhancement of the Meals-on Wheels services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">The Fair Deal: The new nursing home care support scheme a Fair Deal starts in January 2008. It will provide uniform financial support for individuals in private and public nursing home beds. The new scheme involves a co-payment arrangement between the individual and the State.  At the time of receipt of care, the individual will contribute 80% of disposable income towards the cost of care.  In addition, a capped contribution towards care costs based on an individual's asset wealth will be payable at the time of settlement of the individual's estate.  The Heads of a Bill are currently being drafted and will be brought before Government in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">Standards: The Health Act, 2007 provides for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes — public, private and voluntary.  Inspections will be carried out by the Social Services Inspectorate, part of Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  The existing inspection and registration systems for residential services will be replaced by a strengthened and expanded system and the Act strengthens and modernises the registration and de-registration process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">Statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services for inspecting and registering children's residential centres, residential centres for people with disabilities and residential centres for older people, including private nursing homes.  Residential Centres will be inspected against standards set by HIQA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">Improvements to Subvention: From 1st January 2007 there are no longer three separate rates for subvention.  Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of €300 per week.  Additional funding of €55 million was provided for this purpose in Budget 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">In addition to the increased rate of basic subvention, additional funding of €30 million has been made available in 2007 for enhanced subvention. This is a supplementary subvention, paid by the HSE, to a person in or entering private long-term care. The amount of enhanced subvention paid is at the discretion of the HSE and varies according to the cost of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">The additional enhanced subvention funding will be used (i) to develop a consistency between the payment of subvention during 2007 and the new nursing home support scheme for 2008, and (ii) to work towards equalisation of the level of support paid to people in different areas (taking local prices and a person's means into account).</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">Palliative Care: The provision of a world class palliative care service, remains a priority of this Government and is reflected in the significant development in services and policy in recent years.  As outlined in Towards 2016, the Government is committed to further developing palliative care throughout Ireland with particular reference to the 2001 Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Funding of €18 million has been provided in 2006 and 2007 to develop palliative care services. This funding is being used to improve services in consultation with the newly established Regional Development Committees and in line with the recommendations made in the report of the National Advisory Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">The Department of Health and Children has convened a working group to develop a policy for children's palliative care, and a draft policy will be ready by the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">Dementia: The Action Plan for Dementia, published in 1999, describes a model of best practice for the provision and planning of dementia care in Ireland. There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers. The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with dementia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">Elder Abuse: The Government continues to attach priority to combating elder abuse, and the HSE has recruited 26 of the 32 senior case workers needed to give effect to policy in this area. Elder abuse officers have been appointed in two of the four HSE regions and elder abuse steering groups have also been set up in each of the regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">Programme for Government: The Government's commitment to older people is set out in the new Programme for Government.  A new National Positive Ageing Strategy will be developed in conjunction with the recognised voluntary groups in this area and will include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">The development of operational plans by Government Departments clearly setting out objectives relating to older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">Joined up thinking on initiatives serving older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">Ongoing mechanisms to monitor progress and identify challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">Liaising with recognised voluntary groups in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">And giving consideration to the appointment of an Ombudsman for Older People.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">The Department of Health and Children is currently considering the mechanisms to develop the new Strategy for Positive Ageing and details will be announced when this work is finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1899">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_1905">The consensus of scientific opinion to date regarding possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure from mobile phone masts is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between such exposure and ill health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposures below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in their 1998 Guidelines do not produce any known adverse health effects. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all peer-reviewed scientific literature and include thermal and non-thermal effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906">In 1999, the European Community introduced recommendations on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, based on the ICNIRP guidelines. Ireland complies with these recommendations. The Commission for Communication Regulations (COMREG) monitors compliance with regard to telecommunication masts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">The Deputy may wish to note that approval for the erection of a mobile phone mast in a particular area is a matter for the local planning authority.

            <p eId="para_1911">At the end of August the HSE was over its planned budget by €222 million on its Vote.  In order to deal with this the HSE has put in place a ‘Breakeven Plan' which consists of a number of corrective measures to ensure a balanced budget at year end.  Accordingly, HSE Management has decided that:</p>

            <p eId="para_1975">As the Deputy may be aware, my Department's policy in relation to assistance for low income families in order to access health services is the provision of medical cards.  Medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants. A medical card allows a person, access to a range of health services, free of charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">The current system of eligibility divides the population into those with full eligibility (medical card holders) and those with limited eligibility (all others).  Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who have full eligibility regardless of means, entitlement to a medical card is determined by reference to undue hardship measured in the first instance by means. The Executive has discretion to grant a card in cases where income guidelines are exceeded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1977">Those with full eligibility receive all services free of charge, with the exception of a co-payment in respect of long-stay institutional care and home help services. Speech and Language therapy, whether provided in the out-patient department of a public hospital or through a public health clinic is, under the current legislation, free of charge to all, irrespective of whether the person has full or limited eligibility.  If a person decides to access speech and language therapy in a private capacity, they move outside the public system, and any fee charged is a private contractual arrangement between the patient and the therapist.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">If the Deputy is referring to an individual case, the relevant details should be forwarded to the Health Service Executive who, under the Health Act 2004 have responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services including the provision of speech and language therapy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2022">The DTSS Review Group was established in May 2006 to undertake a comprehensive review of Primary Care Oral Health Services provided under the DTSS.  Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Irish Dental Association (IDA).  The Group is chaired by Mr Finbar Flood.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">Since the Group was established, a legal issue has arisen with regard to the Competition Act 2002 as it relates to the negotiation of professional fees.

            <p eId="para_2024">The existing contractual arrangements with private dental practitioners under the DTSS for provision of dental services to eligible patients remain in place although I am aware that some dentists have indicated that they wish to resign from this scheme. It should be noted that dentists withdrawing from the scheme are obliged to work a three months notice period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">If an eligible patient cannot access the services of a dentist because the dentist has resigned from the DTSS, that patient may approach any dentist within the Scheme for treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2105">The HSE National Management Team has developed a financial break-even plan aimed at remaining within its Vote for 2007.  The plan includes a pause in recruitment for an initial period of one month beginning on 5 September.  The position is due to be reviewed by the HSE on 1 October in the light of the financial situation then pertaining. Other features of this plan include</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">cancelling all foreign travel for the remainder of the year</p>

            <p eId="para_2109">There are over 120,000 people working in the public health system and the temporary pause in recruitment must be viewed in that context. I share the concern of the HSE to ensure that patient care is not affected during the recruitment suspension. It is the HSE's clear intention that these measures, which involve 200-300 posts, will not impact on ‘front line' services and it has made provision for critical or essential vacancies to be filled by re-deployment of existing staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_2117">Both contract types contain provisions which were agreed between the parties on a range of issues, including retirement age.  The terms of the Capitation contract, which was agreed between the parties, provide that GPs who entered into contracts on the date of its commencement could hold the contract up to age 70 and that all subsequent GP contractors could hold the contract up to age 65.  General Practitioners may, subject to continued registration with the Medical Council, continue to practice and to treat private patients following retirement from the GMS scheme.A review of the contractual arrangements for the provision of services under the GMS scheme and other publicly funded schemes is being undertaken at present.  In this context, I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, to review the current arrangements regarding the age at which GPs must retire from the GMS scheme.</p>

For an item to be reimbursed it must comply with a published list of criteria.  These criteria include authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product.  In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.  As nebulisers do not require a Product Authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board, they cannot be considered for reimbursement under the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.</p>

There are approximately 8,180 people in receipt of subvention at present. When the Fair Deal commences, these people can choose to retain their existing arrangements or they can apply for support under the new scheme. The Fair Deal is likely to be more beneficial for these people, and nobody will be made worse off as a result of the new scheme. In addition, many people who do not currently receive any financial support from the State — an estimated 3,700 — will now be eligible to apply for the Fair Deal.  There is no intention to apply an indexation to the current rates of subvention at this time.</p>

In the interest of equity, the Department of Health and Children responded to the Fás decision by introducing a similar payment (the rehabilitative training bonus) for rehabilitative trainees. As the Department of Health and Children's payment is linked to the Fás payment, any consideration of a change in the rate would need to be taken in the context of the rate paid by Fás to its trainees.</p>

The NCIP has a funding allocation of €575 million and aims to create an additional 50,000 new childcare places.  It is expected that approximately 22,000 of these places will be in the private sector and 28,000 in the community/not for profit sector.

            <p eId="para_2313">The first Pharmacy Act was passed by the Oireachtas on 5th April this year and will be commenced in 3 stages.</p>
            <p eId="para_2314">Stage 1 of the Pharmacy Act implementation process has been completed and the Council of the new PSI has been established.  The Society's Council has been working on reviewing current procedures, and on the preparation of new procedures to allow the commencement of those sections of the Act included in Stage 2 of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2315">Stage 2 will deal with the new procedures which will apply to the registration of pharmacists and pharmacy businesses as outlined in Part 4 of the Act.  This stage will also set out the conditions which must be met for the conduct of a retail pharmacy business.  It includes the conditions applying to the necessity of having an experienced (3 years post-registration) pharmacist in personal control of the sale and supply of medicinal products in that part of a pharmacy business which consists of the management and administration of such products.  It will also put in place Part 7 of the Act dealing with the investigation, and related issues, of any offences, breaches of codes or professional misconduct which may be alleged to have occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">Once these new policies and procedures, and the changed regulatory regime for pharmacists and pharmacy businesses, are put in place by the Council it will be possible to revoke the Pharmacy Act, 1962 and affect the removal of the derogation.  This new regime will include regulations relating to the supervision of the sale and supply of medicinal products, and new conditions relating to the registration of pharmacists in terms of their forensic and linguistic competency, both in the interest of public safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">Stage 3 will deal with the Complaints, Inquires and Discipline (Fitness to Practice Provisions) regime — Part 6 of the Act.  Part 6 includes the provisions concerning the regulation of the beneficial interest between pharmacists and doctors.  As the matters dealt with in Part 6 are being introduced for the pharmacy sector for the first time, and there are many new procedures and policies to be put in place in other areas, it is considered prudent that the new Council of the PSI be permitted to establish all of the necessary registration and inspection functions procedures to enable the proper conduct of any fitness to practice procedures.  This is particularly important as Part 6 includes, under sections 63, 64 and 65, the matter of conflict in beneficial interest between pharmacists and doctors.  It should also be noted that the proper conduct of Part 6 requires that the other Parts of the Act are functioning efficiently.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">The second Pharmacy Bill will follow on from the Pharmacy Act 2007 and will deal with other changes in the regulatory framework for pharmacy and pharmacy services, not addressed in the 2007 Act, and remaining recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group.  Preparation of a framework for, and the publication of, the second Bill, is dependent on the progress of the enactment of the first Pharmacy Act.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2320">My Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI) Agreements, representing the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice that this was a contractual matter between individual wholesalers and retailers. Subsequent advice to the HSE, confirmed by the Attorney General's office and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General, indicated that, under section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">Given the above position, and the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations would place these bodies at risk of prosecution. Accordingly, negotiation with the IPU on fees, as has been done in the past, is no longer possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">In light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, the State negotiating team re-considered how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.  Following consultation with the IPU, a procedure was agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process is being chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC. Both parties have tabled proposals and this process is continuing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members. However, negotiations with the Union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, in compliance with competition legislation. The negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health for review of the pharmaceutical supply chain.  I am satisfied that this process  is progressing effectively.</p>

The HSE has informed my Department that the estimate for total past interest retained up to the end of 2005 is approximately €31m.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_805">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2435">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2437">In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent and/or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</p>
            <p eId="para_2438">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  I have also signalled that the more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated by the new scheme will be monitored by officials in my Office over the coming months and, if appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2490">Transport 21, which is a €34.3 billion capital investment framework for the period 2006-2015, is predicated on delivering a more sustainable transport system.  It aims to promote modal shift from private cars to public transport through the significant rebalancing of investment in favour of public transport. Overall €18.5 billion will be invested in the national roads programme, while €15.8 billion will be provided for public transport projects and for regional airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2491">Funding for a range of initiatives linked to sustainability is also provided for under Transport 21, including grant assistance for the provision of cycle paths, schools and workplace initiatives to change travel behaviour. A specific heading in Transport 21 refers to sustainable transport measures.  Two projects are being funded under this heading at present.  The first is a pilot scheme to convert 50 selected vehicles to run on pure plant oil, which is being carried out under the aegis of the German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce. The cost to the Department is €227,000. In addition, funding is being made available to Dublin Bus to lease a hybrid bus to test its performance in operating conditions at an estimated cost of €500,000 over three years.  I expect that this bus will be delivered in early 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2514">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Dail Questions 57, 72 and 144 on 28th June, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">Iarnród Éireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where real opportunities present and returning the rail freight business to profitability. Iarnród Éireann has made progress in recent years in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, e.g. large volumes or trainloads over long distances.  For example, Iarnród Éireann has:</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">re-introduced the trainload pulpwood business for Coillte between the West of Ireland and the South East;</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">altered rail schedules and is currently providing four additional trains per week for Tara Mines with a potential to carry an extra 100,000 plus tonnes of lead and zinc between Navan and Dublin Port per annum;</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">modified surplus platform wagons to provide a trainload service for containers between Ballina and Waterford Port.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">Iarnród Éireann has undertaken extensive engagement with industry and transporters but had genuine difficulty in identifying business opportunities that offer reasonable volumes of business on a regular basis.  It is not feasible to run trains with one or two containers and Iarnród Éireann has not identified sufficient business, with the exception of the Ballina to Waterford service, to group a number of separate activities together to form a viable trainload.  Most Irish industry is focused on ‘just in time' transport which is particularly suited to our expanding and improving road network. Rail freight generally involves road movements at each end of the logistics chain and given the often short distances in Ireland it is difficult to develop a business case.  The experience across Europe is no different.  Rail freight activities are most economic over long distances with large volumes and where the freight to be carried is not time sensitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2520">As part of the engagement with industry Iarnród Éireann works closely with port authorities to identify opportunities. Rail freight is fully liberalised since 1st January, 2007, and while no serious representations have been made to my Department for entry to the market to date, I would welcome any expressions of interest.  In the absence of real opportunities or proposals for viable long term rail freight business, the development and use of fiscal incentives has not been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2522">The Memorandum of Understanding between my Department and Iarnród Éireann contains no provision in relation to parking charges for the use of car parks at railway stations. The provision and management of car parks at railway stations is a matter for Iarnród Éireann, taking account of the guiding principles for the implementation of rail-based park and ride adopted by the Dublin Transportation Office in their strategy for park and ride in the Greater Dublin Area. These were approved by my Department in 2005. These principles are:</p>
            <p eId="para_2523">Park and ride should improve rail accessibility without disimproving road congestion,</p>
            <p eId="para_2524">Rail users only should use park and ride spaces, and may have to pay to use them,</p>
            <p eId="para_2525">Complementary parking controls in the areas around stations may be required,</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">Those who benefit from park and ride should contribute to the cost of it by way of a separate charge; the cost should not be absorbed into rail fares generally,</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">Rail services must be able to serve the demand generated by Park and Ride provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">Park and ride facilities can and do have a positive impact on public transport use and have an important role to play in encouraging people to transfer from private cars to public transport.  In considering whether to impose charges for the use of park and ride facilities, providers are expected to take into account a variety of factors and these would include consideration of the likely impact of charges on use of the facility and, by extension, on public transport use.</p>

            <p eId="para_2544">The re-opening of the Clonsilla to Navan line is proposed under Transport 21 in two phases: Clonsilla to Dunboyne/Pace by 2010 and Pace to Navan by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">The current position in relation to Phase 1 is that Iarnród Éireann applied to An Bord Pleanála  on 7th September 2007 for a Railway Order — the equivalent of planning permission for a new rail scheme — to construct the 7.5 kilometre line from a spur at Clonsilla on the existing Dublin-Maynooth commuter line to Pace, north of Dunboyne.  Subject to the granting of the Railway Order, Iarnród Éireann expect that construction would commence in late 2008 to ensure the line reopens in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">In relation to Phase 2, the Pace-Navan section — Iarnród Éireann is currently carrying out route alignment and feasibility studies in consultation with Meath County Council.  I understand from Iarnród Éireann that this work will be completed shortly.  My Department has paid grants totalling €221,831 to date to Iarnród Éireann in respect of this project.</p>

            <p eId="para_2548">The provision of services is an operational day-to-day matter for Iarnród Éireann.  However, Iarnród Éireann have informed me that its Dublin commuter business is continuing to grow at up to 20% per annum on the northern, western and south-eastern commuter routes and accordingly that the current commuter rolling stock fleet is being fully utilised in the peak periods and allocated to services in order of greatest demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">The imminent introduction of the first of the new InterCity railcars on the Dublin-Sligo services, will enable the commuter railcars, currently used on the Sligo services, to be immediately reallocated to commuter operations for which they are best suited.  Through this process of reallocation, Iarnród Éireann intends to increase the amount of commuter rolling stock available for the commuter services to counties Wicklow and Wexford.</p>

            <p eId="para_2551">I was officially notified of this Serious Incident by the Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of my Department on the 21 Aug 2007.  Following their initial investigation, the AAIU issued a Preliminary Report on the 21 Sept 2007.

            <p eId="para_2552">The first Safety Recommendation stated that the IAA should promulgate to pilots and operators the possibility of confusing the obstacle at Santry Cross, Dublin with the approach lighting of Runway 34 at Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2553">The IAA have accepted this Safety Recommendation and have already issued an Air Traffic Operations Notice (047/07) to that effect.  The second Safety Recommendation stated that the IAA should review the suitability of obstacle lighting as installed on the 52 metre-high building situated at Santry Cross, Dublin.  The IAA has accepted this Safety Recommendation. The IAA have reviewed the lighting scheme installed on the 52m high hotel at Santry Cross and have been in contact with the Building Management Company to have the lights changed from fixed red obstacle lights to flashing red obstacle lights. The company has commenced the process of acquiring the necessary fixtures to alter the lights as soon as possible.  The AAIU's Investigation into this Serious Incident is on-going and a Full Report will be published in due course.</p>

Services will be further improved when the remaining peak period services operating with 4 carriages on the Dublin-Maynooth line are extended to 8 carriages during 2008.

            <p eId="para_2723">The person to whom the Deputy refers was arrested in 2004 at Mumbai Airport and charged with drug trafficking offences. Following his trial he was sentenced to ten years in prison. I understand that the individual alleges that he confessed to the charges under duress and is appealing the guilty verdict. He is currently detained in prison in Rajasthan pending the hearing of his appeal. No date has yet been set for this appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">The person concerned travelled to India on a British passport. Therefore he is considered to be a British citizen, under law, by the Indian authorities and they will only engage with the consular mission of that country.</p>

The British High Commission also informed the Embassy that they have attended throughout to his rights to legal representation and to fair and prompt due process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2726">The Deputy should also be aware that our Embassy in London has made known our interest in his case to the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office and has been in direct contact with his mother.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2728">Relations between Ireland and Cuba have developed in recent years, particularly since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1999. Our Ambassador in Mexico City is accredited to Cuba. In 2001, Cuba established a resident Embassy in Dublin, which has been headed by a resident Ambassador since October 2005.  Prior to that the Embassy was headed at Chargé d'Affaires level, with the Cuban Ambassador to Ireland resident in London.  The Cuban Chargé d'Affaires and, subsequently, the Cuban Ambassador have been very active in seeking to promote links between our two countries based, inter alia, on people-to-people contact and cultural activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2729">My Department and our Embassy in Mexico City also support the development of such links. In July 2005, the International Joyce exhibition, commissioned by my Department, was opened for display at the National Library in Havana and a donation of Spanish translations of the plays of Samuel Beckett was also presented on the occasion. And of course, many Irish people have visited Cuba in recent years. I welcome these developments and I would certainly wish to see the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Cuba develop further.</p>
            <p eId="para_2730">As the Deputy will be aware, the European Union's 1996 Common Position on Cuba remains the basis of both the European Union's and Ireland's approach to relations with that country. The overriding objective of Ireland and our European Union partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage, but not to enforce by external coercion, a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">The Common Position was most recently reviewed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 June 2007, at which I participated. The Council's Conclusions deplored the fact that the human rights situation in Cuba has not fundamentally changed, and noted that the Cuban Government continues to deny its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms. We also recognised the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2732">While the European Union will continue to pursue its dialogue with Cuba's civil society and to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, the Council also emphasised the Union's willingness to resume a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities on all areas of mutual interest. In order to sound out the potential for such a dialogue, which should take place on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, the Council decided to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2733">The Council Conclusions represent a balanced approach, which is in accordance with the principles of the Common Position. The decision which we took in Council to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels would provide an opportunity for establishing an open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities.  While the Cuban authorities initially rejected the invitation, we remain hopeful that such a dialogue will be established in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2735">The issue to which the Deputy refers concerns a long-term dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom regarding the question of sovereignty over the territories of the Falkland (Malvinas), South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, to which both countries lay claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_2736">Since 1965, the United Nations General Assembly has adopted ten Resolutions on the question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). The most recent Resolution was adopted in 1988, in which the General Assembly requested the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to initiate negotiations with a view to finding the means to resolve peacefully and definitively the problems between both countries, including all aspects of the future of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas), in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2737">The question of the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) has also been the subject of successive Resolutions adopted by the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization, most recently in June 2007. The Special Committee on Decolonization expressed its regret that, despite widespread international support for talks between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to resolve the issue, implementation of the General Assembly resolutions aimed at peacefully ending that dispute had not yet begun.  Ireland is fully supportive of the Resolutions adopted under the aegis of the United Nations. I would encourage both countries to resume their negotiations in the interest of pursuing a peaceful solution to this dispute, as provided for in the relevant Resolutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2739">The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its commitment to bringing to an end all terrorism in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law. This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. Since the process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), began in 2003, between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants have been demobilized. The Government of Colombia is currently engaging in dialogue with the left-wing guerrilla group known as the Ejército de Liberación Nacional de Colombia (ELN) in pursuit of a negotiated peace agreement. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union most recently adopted Conclusions on Colombia on 3 October 2005. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these Conclusions, which principally addressed the Justice and Peace Law. The Council considered that the Justice and Peace Law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, struck a difficult balance between peace and justice. The Council recognised, and indeed shared many of, the concerns expressed by, amongst others, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that the law did not take into sufficient account the principles of truth, justice and reparation in accordance with internationally agreed standards. However, the overall assessment of the Council was that, if implemented effectively and in a transparent manner, the Law would have a positive effect on peace-building in Colombia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2741">In this regard, international support is crucial to underpinning the success of the peace process in Colombia at this critical political phase. In support of the peace process, Ireland, along with a number of other European Union Member States, has given financial support to initiatives aimed at ensuring the effective and transparent implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. Ireland undertook in June 2005 a commitment to contribute €390,000 over a three year period to the Organization of American States' Mission to Support the Peace Process in Colombia (OAS/MAPP). The mission's mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process, with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law. In accordance with our commitment, Ireland has provided a total of €260,000 to the OAS mission to date, with the final tranche of €130,000 due to be made available later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2742">I also attach the highest priority to the humanitarian and human rights dimension of the OAS mission's role. With this in mind, an additional €130,000 was donated to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) in December 2005 for the independent monitoring of human rights issues in support of the OAS mission. Following a review of the IACHR's progress report, a further €127,000 was provided in support of IACHR activities related to human rights aspects of the implementation of the Justice and Peace Law in late 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2743">My Department continues to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. Ireland is fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia. In this regard, I welcome the convening of the Third International Conference on Colombia, which will be held in Bogotá in November 2007 and in which Ireland will participate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2745">The Government and our EU partners share the strong international concern that Iran has not complied with its international obligations in respect of its nuclear programme. We remain committed to the search for a diplomatic solution. The EU has pursued this course steadily and with great patience, including in cooperation with the United States, Russia, and China.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">The essential elements of this diplomatic approach are a sustained engagement with Iran to persuade it to meet its responsibilities and obligations, and the offer of a substantial package of proposals for improved relations in all fields, which was presented by the EU in June 2006, and which remains on the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">The UN Security Council has three times issued a clear demand that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment programme, most recently in Security Council Resolution 1747 of 24 March 2007. The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that Iran continues to ignore the demands of the Security Council. Security Council Resolutions 1737 and 1747 have therefore progressively introduced a range of sanctions targeted specifically at the nuclear and military sectors in Iran. In giving force to the Security Council Resolutions, the EU has both implemented the minimum measures set out in the Resolutions, and designated a number of additional names of persons and entities to whom they apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2748">In view of Iran's failure to meet its obligations, the UN Security Council is now considering what further measures might be adopted under the UN Charter. There have also been suggestions, in particular from the French Foreign Minister, that in order to maintain pressure on Iran to negotiate seriously to resolve these issues, sanctions outside the UN framework might be adopted by the EU. It is important to note, however, that no such proposals have been presented for discussion within the EU and that the focus remains on the deliberations within the UN Security Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_2750">The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9th August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence. The Miami District Attorney duly filed an appeal against the decision of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Following an appellate hearing on 14 February 2006, a 10-2 decision to uphold the 2001 convictions was issued on 9 August 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">It is my understanding that a number of appeals lodged on behalf of the defendants remain under active judicial review within the framework of the US domestic legal system. As I have previously informed the Deputy on several occasions, the Government has no standing in this matter, which is a bilateral consular question between the US and the Cuban authorities and, consequently, I do not intend to raise this matter with the US Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">With regard to the question of family visits, as I have previously informed the Deputy, I am aware from the 2005 Report of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention that, as of October 2005, sixty visas had been issued for visits by family members but that visas had not been granted to the wives of two of the convicted men on the stated grounds of US national security. I am also aware from media reports that the US authorities recently turned down further requests for visas from the two women in question. Again, I do not believe that this is a matter on which I have any standing and I do not intend, therefore, to raise it with the US authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2754">I do not share Deputy McGrath's alarm over recent comments on the European Union by the President of the Commission. President Barroso was clearly referring to the geographical scale of the Union. The European Union has nothing in common with empires built by force and ruled undemocratically. As President Barroso made clear, the Union is based on a voluntary coming together of 27 countries that have freely decided to pool aspects of their sovereignty for their mutual advantage. It has helped establish the unity of a region once ravaged by war and divided by ideology.  I would also like to emphasise that EU decisions are arrived at with the full participation of the Governments of the Member States and the directly-elected European Parliament. This represents a unique, democratic achievement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2762">I propose to take Questions Nos. 525 and 526 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2763">I understand from FÁS that there are no plans to increase or decrease the number of places on Community Employment in the above-mentioned geographical areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2764">All applicants who meet the eligibility criteria for Community Employment are entitled to apply for vacant positions, this includes people with disabilities and those on pre-retirement.  I further understand from FÁS that there is no formal ring fencing of places for pre-retirement or for those with disabilities.  Nationally there are 1,000 places ring fenced for drug rehabilitation. As set out in the Programme for Government, the recommendations of the Working Group on Drug Rehabilitation in relation to extra community employment places will be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2765">In April 2000 limits were introduced on the amount of time that a person could participate on CE (3-years total time on CE from 3rd April 2000 — participation on CE before this date is disregarded).  CE capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, avail of the programme.  However, participants with disabilities are eligible for one additional year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">All participants who are over fifty-five years of age are eligible to participate for a total term of six years.  However, persons with disabilities who are over fifty-five years of age are also eligible for an additional year and have a total eligibility term of seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">At present 6,053 (29% of total participants) participants on CE are aged 55 and over (excluding Supervisors).   In addition, there are a total of 5,569 (26.5% of total) participants on CE who have a Department of Social and Family Affairs disability linked payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">In conclusion, I refer the Deputy to the following table, which displays the number of participants on Community Employment in the Dublin 8, 10, 12 and 22 areas for the period 2003-2006 and to date in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_2807">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis.

            <p eId="para_2817">Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">In April 2000 limits were introduced on the amount of time that a person could participate on CE (3-years total time on CE from 3rd April 2000 — participation on CE before this date is disregarded).  CE Capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, avail of the programme.   Recent changes to national policy introduced significant extensions to CE participation limits for older participants (aged 55 and over) and participants with a disability.  These changes were made in recognition of the fact that these workers may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2819">Within the context of the Education and Qualifications Act (1999), certified learning has become a key objective for all FÁS funded training.  In this context, as part of its continuous improvement processes, FÁS has introduced a new Individual Learner Plan approach to the Community Employment programme.  This approach, aimed at systematically supporting the progression of programme participants, is currently being rolled out nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2820">The ILP sets out a profile of the learner development needs both in relation to project skills training and progression training.   Career planning and exit strategies form an integral part of the plan.  Significant changes have been made to the programme to reflect the needs of the labour market.  The programme will be continuously reviewed to ensure it meets the needs of its participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2821">I would like to highlight that FÁS and Local Employment Service Offices are available to provide information on other employment and training opportunities which may be available to those in local communities exiting or ineligible for Community Employment Schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2822">CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  The overall operation of the scheme is therefore kept under constant review.</p>

         the progress to date with regard to the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [19761/07]

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_860">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2824">The Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006-2013 sets out ambitious targets for placing Ireland firmly on the global map in terms of the excellence of our research and its application for the benefit of our people and our economy.  We are investing in Ireland's R&amp;D infrastructure and human capital as the cornerstone underpinning our future competitive place in the world. It is a challenging goal given that we were starting from a relatively low base vis à vis EU and OECD peers.  The Strategy provides us with the means to achieve convergence, coherence and complementarity in our national innovation system and to ensure maximum economic and social benefits are derived from the Government's commitment of €8.2 billion to this area under the National Development Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2825">One year on from launch of the 7-year Strategy the early indicators are of success.  Total R &amp; D spending across all sectors of the economy reached €2.33 billion in 2006, up over 14% on 2005. Between 2004 and 2006 gross expenditure on research and development (GERD) increased by over 26% in nominal terms. Notwithstanding rapid economic growth, the overall GERD / economic activity intensity ratio rose to 1.56% of GNP compared to 1.48% in 2004. This suggests a real turning point has occurred which places research and development, innovative activity and the commercialisation of knowledge as a real driving force behind our future well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">It is very encouraging to see that R &amp; D expenditure by business grew strongly in 2005 and 2006. R&amp;D spending in the business sector (BERD) rose by almost 10% from 2004 to 2005, and is estimated to have increased by a further 17.3% in 2006 to reach €1.56bn.  BERD intensity as a % of GNP is growing too (from 0.82% in 2004 to 0.90% in 2006). This reflects a robust R&amp;D spending performance by both Irish and foreign-owned firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">The establishment of a strong research base in Ireland by the research programmes of SFI, PRTLI and the IDA is proving to be a vital driver of major investment decisions by both overseas and indigenous companies.  Investment in research &amp; development continues to increase. In 2006 alone 54 R&amp;D investment projects were supported by IDA Ireland involving a total investment of almost €470m. This has grown at a dramatic rate from just €140m in 2004 and €260m in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">Ireland's investment through Higher Education R&amp;D (HERD) was one area Government could impact directly and rapidly and has done so. The investments in building the science base through SFI, PRTLI and enhanced Enterprise Ireland and sectoral spending on R&amp;D in the third level sector has seen the level of R&amp;D quadruple from €153m in 1996 to an estimated €600m in 2006. Ireland's HERD spend of 0.4% of GNP has moved from well behind to the OECD average and now exceeds that of the EU27 average.  The number of full-time equivalent researchers stands at 5,600 which places Ireland close to the EU27 average.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">The point of the Strategy, of course, is that we do not want to be at EU or OECD averages but by the end of the Strategy to have caught up with the leading investing countries in each case.  It is, undeniably, a challenge to realise the ambitious set of goals in the STI Strategy by 2013 but these goals are underpinned by a commitment of €8.2bn in the NDP, by a coordinated and proactive approach with buy-in from Government Departments, the enterprise agencies and the higher education sector, and by a strong political commitment to realise a competitive knowledge-driven economy in Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2834">I propose to take Questions Nos. 532 and 541 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">Primary responsibility for this sector rests with the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Transport. I can advise the Deputies however that the terms and conditions of employment on board ferry vessels are linked to the State in which the ship is registered.  In the case of workers employed on Irish registered vessels, the terms and conditions of those employees on the vessel are subject to the provisions of Irish law whether the ship is in Irish territorial waters or on the high seas. This would include legislation dealing with minimum wages.  The conditions of employment, including minimum wages, of workers on board vessels under the Irish flag are governed by a comprehensive corpus of Irish employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">Primary responsibility for the inspection of ships rests with my colleague the Minister for Transport.  I understand that where a vessel is engaged in a scheduled Roll-on Roll-off passenger service it is subject to inspection under the EU Directive 99/35/EC prior to the ship entering service.  Any such inspection, covering safety issues, will entail a joint inspection involving surveyors from the Department of Transport and their counterparts in the UK or elsewhere within the EU, depending on the routes being served.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">If the vessel is not registered in Ireland, it will also be subject to port state control inspections in Ireland by the Department of Transport.  Such inspections cover safety, environment protection and International Labour Organisation Conventions.  The latter covers the welfare of the crew (food, accommodation, hours of work etc) but excludes rates of pay.  Regarding the first question, at this stage I understand that the Minister for Transport has not had any indication from the shipping company that this ship will be registered in Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2839">A revised Code of Practice, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, for employers and employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Workplace Bullying, was published in April 2007.  It replaces and updates the previous Code in operation since 2002 and it provides practical guidance for employers on identifying and preventing bullying at work arising from their duties under the 2005 Act as regards managing and conducting work activities in such a way so as to prevent, as far as is reasonably practicable, any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety, health and welfare at work of their employees at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_2840">The 2005 Act also applies to employees in relation to their duties not to engage in improper conduct or behaviour likely to endanger their own safety, health and welfare at work or that of any other person.</p>
            <p eId="para_2841">The Code emphasises that the best place to deal with a complaint of bullying is at the level of the workplace.  A significant element of the Code places an emphasis on the resolution of incidents of bullying using an informal process and professional mediation services.  Only if internal processes fail, should it be necessary to get outside support.  In that event, the Code states that an appeal should be referred to the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Acts.  If the decision of the Rights Commissioner is not acceptable, an appeal may be made to the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2842">It should also be noted that a Code of Practice under the 2005 Act may be admissible in evidence before a Court where it is alleged that the Code had been contravened or not complied with. Statistics on the number of bullying cases dealt with will be available directly from the Health and Safety Authority, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court.</p>

            <p eId="para_2849">The Report of the Small Business Forum published in May 2006, sets out a comprehensive agenda designed to ensure that the small business sector achieves its full potential and continues to play a key role in our economic development over the next decade. The Forum's recommendations were focussed on three fundamental objectives: creating a better environment for small enterprises; stimulating growth of small enterprises; and encouraging more and better start-ups.  Since the Report was published, considerable progress has been made in respect of the implementation of the Report.  Examples of actions taken to date include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">The threshold for the exemption from the requirement that companies have their accounts audited has been increased from €1.5m to €7.3m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">The Budget included a package of measures designed to help the small business sector including the extension and radical improvement of the Business Expansion and Seed Capital Schemes up to 2013 and important increases in the VAT Cash Accounting and VAT Registration Turnover Thresholds from 1 March 2007 to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements on small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2852">The Innovation Voucher Scheme was launched.  This scheme provides an incentive to small businesses to explore new ideas within their businesses and should help drive levels of innovation within the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">The "Tech-Check" Programme has been launched.  This programme provides small businesses with the opportunity to access a highly subsidised independent technology check-up and help them to identify ways to boost their productivity and profitability through the better use of technology. This Programme is being delivered by the County and City Enterprise Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">The Management Development Council has been established to drive levels of managerial capability within the enterprise sector.  The Council will benchmark Ireland's current management development provision while also developing a coordinated approach to building appreciation in the SME sector for the value and need of leadership and management skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">The first "Small Business in Ireland" Report was published by the Central Statistics Office On 30 May 2007.  This publication brings together for the first time a comprehensive set of statistics that clearly demonstrates the importance of the small business sector to our economy and has been widely welcomed by the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">Reflecting the concerns of the Forum, new Guidelines to Local Authorities on the implementation of Development Contribution Schemes under the Planning and Development Act 2000, issued by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government earlier this year, have emphasised the need for the impact of such Schemes on our competitiveness to be taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_2857">The extent of the Government's commitment to the small business sector should be clear from the real and substantive changes that have already been implemented in response to the Forum's Report.  It is my intention that we will continue to work on this agenda and ensure that there is a supportive environment for small business in Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2872">There is no age discrimination in employment rights legislation and there are no provisions in employment or equality law that impose a compulsory retirement from employment.  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004, among other things, protect against discrimination on the ground of age in relation to access to employment.  However, they also permit an employer to decide on a retirement age in a particular employment to give flexibility to employers and employees, having due regard to the nature of the work being performed.  There is therefore no single fixed retirement age for employees in Ireland.  Retirement age is set out in a person's contract of employment, some of which do have a mandatory retirement age.  However, it is open to the employee and employer to negotiate another contract.  The usual retirement age is 65.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">Many employment contracts have provisions for early retirement from age 60 or in some cases from age 55 and most have provision for early retirement on health grounds.  Where an employee is subject to a mandatory retirement age in their job, there is nothing to prevent them taking up a different job when they retire or taking up self-employment.  With effect from 1 April, 2004, it is not compulsory for new entrants to the public service to retire at a particular age if they are fit and willing to remain in employment.  The existing retirement conditions, in agreement with the relevant unions, have been retained for existing employees.  To do otherwise would be a breach of the terms and conditions of employment of employees.  To encourage longer working and to improve income support for older people, the new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years featured an employment earnings disregard incentive amounting to €200 per week in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2874">The National Pensions Review, published last year, made a number of recommendations to encourage people to continue working after normal retirement age.  This included allowing people to defer receiving their social welfare pension at normal pension age and to grant them an actuarially enhanced payment when they claim.  The Government is shortly to produce a Green Paper on Pensions with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy.  This will include an examination of the issues surrounding pensions and retirement age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">In the absence of specific data, it is difficult to quantify the numbers who wish to work past the fixed retirement age.  However, the employment rate for people aged 60-64 would indicate that most people opt out of the labour force by choice before 65.  The employment rate for those in the 60-64 age category is 45.3%.  This compares to an overall employment rate of 68.9%.  In addition to facilitating people to work past 65, a major challenge is to encourage people to remain in work at least up to the age of 65.</p>

            <p eId="para_2879">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas, including Waterford and Dungarvan, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">I have been informed by the Agency that from the beginning of September 2006 to date there have been a total 15 site visits to Waterford City, within 30 miles of Dungarvan.  There have not been any site visits to Dungarvan or to the rest of County Waterford in the same period.  In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA Ireland is focussed on advancing the economic development of the South East region primarily through the Gateway of Waterford City, the hub towns of Wexford and Kilkenny and the other key centres of Carlow and Clonmel.  Waterford has a long and strong track record as a centre of manufacturing expertise.  The County has a key strength in engineering, in both indigenous and overseas sectors.  In more recent years however, these have been giving way to newer, more advanced manufacturing, particularly in the Life Sciences sector and also to International &amp; Financial Services activities.  When marketing County Waterford for new foreign direct investment, IDA Ireland is focussed on attracting overseas companies in the services and knowledge-based industries (including advanced manufacturing).  At present there are 31 IDA Ireland supported companies in Waterford employing approximately 6,100 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2881">To enable Waterford City and County to compete both nationally and internationally for FDI, IDA is focusing on the provision of world-class property solutions of scale in the Waterford City area and in the development of property solutions in the county town of Dungarvan, e.g. the Waterford Business &amp; Technology Park and the Dungarvan Business Park.  In addition, a 55 hectare Greenfield site, specifically targeted for larger scale utility intensive overseas investments, has been developed in Belview, while a further 20 hectare site on the Kilmeaden road in Waterford city is also available for greenfield investment.  In parallel with developments on the property solutions side, IDA Ireland continues to work closely with third level educational institutes in the region so that the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment to the County are being developed.  In addition, IDA maintains a close relationship with FÁS so that the requirements of industry in the areas of training and up-skilling are being met.</p>

The Board was allocated a total budget of €19.6m to carry out these functions in 2007 and €17.126m. in 2006.  This funding enabled it to provide production and development support to 290 projects in 2006.

The Deputy will be aware that in that context the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.

Under the Arts Act, 2003, the general functions of the Council include the following: to stimulate public interest in the arts; to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts; to assist in improving standards in the arts.  The Arts Council is a statutorily independent body, funded by my Department and independent in its day-to-day operations, including in relation to its funding decisions.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased significantly in recent years from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007, an increase of almost 68%.  This funding has transformed the arts, has increased access to the arts, and provided an excellent platform for future development.</p>

            <p eId="para_2943">I am conscious of the need to facilitate persons in receipt of social welfare payments when taking up employment opportunities. To ensure that social welfare supports are structured to support this objective, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work.  These measures include easing of means tests through income disregards, tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.  Examples of this approach are the jobseeker's allowance disregard of 40% which applies to net earnings from employment when a recipient of jobseeker's allowance takes up work, and the one parent family payment weekly cash disregard and 50% assessment up to €400. People with disabilities can also avail of earnings disregards when engaging in work of a rehabilitative nature.  The most recent Budget also saw the introduction of enhanced disregards of earnings in relation to the rent allowance scheme which complement the rental accommodation scheme that was introduced in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2944">In addition, the in-work income support provided through the family income supplement scheme provides ongoing income support for people in low-income employment with children.  These measures have succeeded largely in removing many disincentives to work or to increasing employment where previously, in certain circumstances, there may have been little or no incentive to take up employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">Further progress in removing poverty and inactivity traps is shown in the two important reforms which I have introduced today.  These reforms improve the methods by which a person's earnings from employment (or the earnings of their partner) are assessed and will facilitate persons in increasing their levels of employment and income.  Under the previous assessment procedures a trap existed whereby the loss in benefits to a household could exceed the gain in income attained by a partner increasing their earnings.  The new assessment of a spouse's or partner's earnings introduces a system whereby both adults associated with a jobseeker's allowance claim are assessed in a similar manner and will result in an assessment which is simpler and easier to understand and which ensures that the families will gain when earnings increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2946">These changes are designed in particular to be progressive for women, who currently make up the majority of qualified adults in the social welfare system, rewarding increased labour market participation and encouraging qualified adults to move beyond long-term part-time employment.  They also remove an anomaly in the assessment of means which discriminated against people with children, through the introduction of a daily earnings disregard of €20, benefiting many part-time workers, but particularly those with children.  For example, a couple earning €290 per week over three days with two children could gain over €112 per week jobseekers allowance under the new arrangements.  In contrast, previous arrangements discouraged all but a small level of attachment to the workforce.  The new arrangements also apply to the disability allowance, farm assist and pre-retirement allowance schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2947">Notwithstanding these improvements, it should be appreciated that poverty traps can feature in any contingency-based system which features income thresholds.  However, the measures outlined, including those just introduced, will have the effect of greatly reducing the incidence and extent of poverty traps and ensure that they will only arise at significantly higher income levels than previously applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2948">My Department will continue to monitor the operation of its schemes with a view to ensuring that poverty traps and disincentives are removed.</p>

        <b>Deputy Denis Naughten</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         his views on the fact that pensioners who worked in semi-State companies do not qualify for the State pensions; if he plans to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2950">The class of social insurance applicable to people in semi-state companies who were recruited prior to 6 April 1995 is PRSI Class D, paid at a modified rate. This provides social insurance coverage for a limited range of benefits as it was considered that the sick pay and occupational pension arrangements available to people employed in semi-state companies were such that they did not require such cover under the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2951">People employed after April 1995 pay full rate insurance contributions and are eligible for the full range of social welfare benefits, including contributory pensions. However, their occupational pension arrangements have been adjusted to reflect this change, with the occupational pension and the social welfare pension integrated to provide the overall level of pension promised, which in most cases is 50% of final salary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2952">The basic qualifying conditions for contributory pensions have been eased considerably in recent years to enable as many people as possible to qualify for contributory social welfare pensions. Special pensions based on pre-1953 insurance have been introduced, and arrangements made so that people with a mixture of insurance at full and modified rates may qualify for pro-rata pensions based on the percentage of full rate contributions in their overall insurance record. These measures have been implemented in a way that ensures that people have sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social welfare system by achieving a minimum standard of contributions, both in terms of the number and type of contributions paid.  In addition to the changes in the conditions for the state pension (contributory) the means test for state pension (non-contributory) has also been improved which should assist those receiving small occupational pensions to qualify for a social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2953">Some 125,000 people are insured in the three main modified insurance classes in addition to large numbers already receiving occupational pensions. Accordingly, any proposals to allow modified rate contributors to qualify for a state pension would have very costly and long-running implications for the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2954">The Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions under Towards 2016.  The discussion in the Green Paper will, amongst other things, deal with the question, in the wider sense, of those who do not qualify for any support, contributory or non-contributory, under the social welfare pensions system and will set out the implications of making provision for them. I expect that the Green paper will be published shortly. Following publication a consultation process will take place prior to Government deciding on a framework for long-term pensions policy in all areas of pension provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2956">The Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents," put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children. The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2957">One of the proposals in the report was that the upper income limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week. In Budget 2006, the upper income limits on the one parent family payment was increased from €293 to €375 per week, moving a substantial way towards this limit. In Budget 2007, this element of the proposal was completed by increasing the upper income limit for the one parent family payment to €400 per week. In addition, the report recommended increasing the qualified child increase for recipients of the one-parent family payment. In Budget 2007 the three rates of qualified child increase, which had been maintained at the same levels for a number of years, were combined into a single rate of €22 per week in respect of over 340,000 children of welfare families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2958">The new social assistance payment, under development in my Department, will have the long term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment — the avenue that is widely agreed to offer the best route out of poverty. Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and Agencies. The Government has instructed the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations of the report in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme. Work on the development of this implementation plan is continuing. Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures continue to be discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">To further develop the process, my Department, with the co-operation of FÁS, the Office of the Minister for Children and the Department of Education and Science, are to test the proposals in both an urban (Coolock, Dublin) and rural (Kilkenny) setting. These tests, due to commence in October, will focus on identifying and resolving the practical and administrative issues that may arise in advance of the scheme being introduced. This will allow for operational and logistical co-ordination between the relevant Departments and Agencies to be considered and will facilitate the development of the new scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2961">Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan were drawn up in consultation with the social partners and after a wide ranging consultation process with other stakeholders. They set out clear goals, demanding targets and a detailed programme of action to meet these goals and targets during the period 2007-2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">The overall poverty goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016. It adopts a lifecycle approach, in line with Towards 2016 , with specific, measurable goals set for each group: children; people of working age; older people and people with disabilities; and their communities. Four of the twelve high level goals in the Plan focus on education initiatives and adequate income supports for children. Detailed action targets cover health, education, income support, early childhood development and care and participation to ensure that children reach their true potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">The social welfare commitments in the Programme for Government prioritise the objectives of the NAPinclusion. They include; improvements in the State Pension and the Carers Allowance, in Child Benefit and in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the School Meals Programme. The Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) in my Department is responsible for progressing the use of poverty impact assessments by government departments, local authorities and statutory agencies in the development of policies and programmes to ensure that the Government's social inclusion agenda is achieved. I am confident that OSI will continue to support Departments and agencies across the public service in addressing the social inclusion agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">My plans, in working with Government to deliver the programme over the coming years, are to build on the significant and visible progress that has been made in reducing poverty in the past 10 years and to deliver real improvements in living standards and well-being for the most vulnerable in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_2966">The PRSI system is designed to provide income protection to employees and the self employed in insurable employment, with entitlement to benefits based on a person experiencing certain contingencies and satisfying prescribed contribution conditions. Insurable employment is employment which involves earnings from €38 per week and so the accumulation of contributions is relatively easy under the Irish system. While the link between employment and self-employment is an essential aspect of the system, nevertheless, a number of arrangements are in place to protect the position of those who leave the workforce to care for children or adults who need care and assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2967">The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in, and took effect from, 1994. The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied. Those carers who receive carer's allowance or benefit can, subject to conditions, receive credited social insurance contributions. There is also a system of voluntary contributions in place which allows people who have left the workforce to continue to make social insurance contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2968">Overall, the range of options available under the system to deal with caring issues, the availability of the voluntary contributions system and the very low level of earnings qualifying for social insurance contributions make it relatively easy for someone to maintain an adequate social insurance record.</p>
            <p eId="para_2969">The Government is committed to publishing a Green Paper on pensions under Towards 2016. The discussion in the Green Paper will, amongst other things, deal with the question, in the wider sense, of those who do not qualify for any support, contributory or non-contributory, under the social welfare pensions system and will set out the implications of making provision for them. The Green Paper will be published shortly.

            <p eId="para_2977">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  The Community Employment (CE) scheme is included, among others, as one of the qualifying payments for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.  Income from CE schemes is assessed as earnings for the purposes of all Social Welfare means tested payments, including Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2978">The income limits for the BSCFA scheme for 2007 are based on the maximum rate of State Pension (contributory) (under 80) plus  €100 in the case of married and cohabiting couples; and the maximum rate of Widow's/Widower's Contributory Pension (under 80) plus €100 for Lone Parents, plus child dependant allowance in each case.

            <p eId="para_2995">The limit is increased by €22.00 for each additional child in each case.  There is no question of discriminating against lone parent families. The rationale for the different income limits for lone parents and couples is to take account of the fact that there is an extra adult in the couple household who has to be provided for.  The income limit for couples reflects this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2996">Participants in a CE scheme are assessed under the standard rules for BSCFA.  The weekly income limit for a single person with one child is €331.30.  This limit increases by €22 for each eligible child.  A person who has income both from one-parent family payment and CE will not qualify for BSCFA on means grounds. However, a person in these circumstances is still significantly better off for having taken up a CE place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2997">A single parent may earn up to €146.50 per week and still qualify for the full payment of one parent family payment; and may qualify at a reduced rate if their earnings are between €146.50 and €400 per week. For example, a lone parent with one child is approximately €195 per week better off on taking up a CE place (equivalent to €10,140 per annum), while a lone parent with two children is some €207 per week better off (equivalent to €10,764 per annum).</p>
            <p eId="para_2998">Any changes to the current income limits for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budget context and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3000">In accordance with Social Welfare legislation the weekly rate of jobseeker's benefit payable is graduated according to the earnings of the claimant in the governing contribution year.  The governing contribution year is the second last complete contribution year before the benefit year in which the claim is made.  A claimant with no reckonable earnings in the governing contribution year is deemed to have average weekly earnings of less than €80.00 and qualifies for a reduced payment of jobseeker's benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3001">The person concerned claimed jobseeker's benefit on 27 June 2007 while awaiting a decision on her appeal against the disallowance of her illness benefit.  As she has no reckonable earnings in the contribution year governing that claim, i.e. 2005, payment was made to her at the reduced personal rate of €83.50 per week, which is the appropriate maximum rate payable in her case.  Where a claimant who qualifies for a graduated rate of jobseeker's benefit has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance at a higher rate of payment, it is open to him/her to opt to receive jobseeker's allowance in lieu of jobseeker's benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3002">If the person concerned wishes to have her entitlement to jobseeker's allowance examined she should advise her local office.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3006">It is a fundamental principle of our social insurance system that those qualifying for benefits must satisfy a range of contribution and other conditions.   In the case of contributory pensions this involves commencing payment of contributions 10 years before pension age, payment of a minimum number of contributions at an appropriate rate and reaching a minimum average annual contribution rate.  The state pension (contributory) is a valuable benefit and the conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying have had a sufficient and ongoing attachment to the social insurance system. The case reported on by the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) involves a couple who were over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory social insurance for the self-employed was introduced.  Accordingly, they were unable to satisfy one of the basic requirements for pension as they did not commence paying insurance 10 years before pension age.   In 1999 a special half-rate pension was introduced for this group based on the payment of 260 contributions and, again, the couple involved did not satisfy the qualifying condition.  While one of the couple could have qualified had they paid the necessary contributions, because of advanced age the other person would not have been able to contribute the necessary level of contributions before reaching pension age.  A refund of part of the social insurance contributions was available to such people.</p>
            <p eId="para_3007">Having considered the case, the IHRC has recommended that a reduced benefit should be paid to people who, because of advanced age, could not satisfy the conditions for the special pension introduced in 1999.   The recommendations of the IHRC are based on its assessment of the situation under the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Code of Social Security.   In relation to the European Code of Social Security, the IHRC places particular emphasis on provisions in relation to the position of people, who by reason of age when provisions are introduced, cannot satisfy contribution or employment conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3008">The Department makes annual reports on compliance with this Code to the Council of Europe, summarising changes to the social welfare system.  These reports are then referred to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Committee of Experts for their examination.  The Department's 1999 report included details of the self-employed provisions which are now the subject of the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) investigation.  At that time the ILO Committee confirmed that Ireland met its obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3009">Accordingly, as an initial step in its review of the IHRC report, my Department has asked the ILO Committee of Experts for its views on the way in which the IHRC has interpreted the relevant articles.  While the Department has received an informal opinion which is at variance with the conclusions of the IHRC, it has asked the Committee of Experts for a formal review of the situation in the context of our annual report on compliance with the European Code of Social Security which my Department submitted recently.   The annual report has drawn specific attention to the IHRC report and the manner in which it interprets our obligations under Article 29.5 of the Code.</p>
            <p eId="para_3010">The views of the supervising committees have been sought on the conclusions of the IHRC report and as soon as these are received the position will be reviewed.   My Department is anxious to finalise this matter and will press for an early response from the supervising committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_3022">The person concerned was awarded Family Income Supplement (FIS) for a period of 12 months from 25th May 2006 and payment continued to 23rd May 2007.  He made a renewal claim on 17th April 2007.  Due to high volumes of claims in the FIS section, there have been delays in processing claims with the result that this claim was not examined until the 8th August. When the case was examined, it was found that the spouse of the person concerned had income from self-employment and it was necessary to refer the case to a Social Welfare Inspector for investigation of this aspect before a decision could be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3023">On completion of the investigation and a decision was made on 5th September 2007 by a Deciding Officer of my Department.  The person concerned was awarded FIS at the weekly rate of €291 from 24 May 2007.  The first payment, including arrears of €4,656 from 24/5/07 was made on 12 September 2007. The delay in finalising this claim is regretted.</p>

            <p eId="para_3030">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families. FIS is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions and a claim for renewal may then be made.  There are currently 20,247 people in receipt of FIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3031">Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer. My Department has consistently publicised the scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families. Following significant improvements in the qualifying income limits in the 2006 budget, my Department undertook a week-long, nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme.  This, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims and consequently, claims for renewals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3032">To date in 2007, my Department has received 26,898 new and renewal FIS claims and has decided a total of 20,916 cases.  At 14/09/2007 there were 10,604 claims awaiting decision. These were comprised of 4,317 new claims and 6,287 renewal claims.  The average time it takes to award a FIS claim or renewal in 2007 (at end Aug) is 14.52 weeks.  My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Measures have been taken to improve the efficiency of claim processing for FIS:</p>
            <p eId="para_3033">A review of existing processes and procedures has been completed by 	my Department with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;</p>
            <p eId="para_3034">Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to  ensure continuity of payment;</p>
            <p eId="para_3035">The ongoing staffing requirement was recently reviewed in the light of the current volumes of claims and renewals. In view of the efficiencies that the processing improvements are expected to generate, an increase in the staffing level was not warranted at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3036">These measures will lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3046">An application for Family Income Supplement was received from the person concerned on 15/02/2007 and was disallowed by a deciding Officer of my Department on 09/05/2007 because the means exceeded the prescribed weekly family income limit of €625 applicable in his case. His family income was assessed for FIS purposes at €689.57 per week. This was derived from his net earnings of €503.77 per week and the Illness Benefit of his spouse at €185.80 per week. Notification of the decision was issued to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">The person concerned lodged an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The appeal was disallowed on 3/8/2007 but the Appeals Officer advised him that any new documentation he might have of a reduction in earnings due to a downturn in overtime should be submitted to my Department. He submitted five recent payslips and a Deciding Officer of my Department reviewed the case in light of these. The figure for earnings was revised to €464.38 per week.  This, together with €185.80 (Illness Benefit of his spouse) gives a revised income of €650.18 for FIS purposes. This is higher than the prescribed weekly family income limit of €625 in his case. Accordingly, the Deciding Officer disallowed the claim. The person concerned was notified of the outcome of the review by the Deciding Officer on 24 September 2007. It is open to him to make a repeat claim for FIS in the event that his earnings are further reduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_3051">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer. My Department has consistently publicised the scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families. Following significant improvements in the qualifying income limits in the 2006 budget, my Department undertook a week-long nationwide awareness campaign in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme.  This, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims. There are currently 20,247 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3052">Family Income Supplement is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions and a claim for renewal may then be made. The upward trend in new claims is also reflected in renewals.  This has resulted in an increase in the number of claims (new and renewal) on hand.  Up to 14 September 2007, my Department had received 17,310 renewal FIS claims of which 6,287 were awaiting decision.  The performance standard for FIS is set at 70% within 3 weeks but this has not been met in any of the past six months. The average time it takes to award a FIS claim or renewal in August 2007 was 14.52 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3053">My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Measures were introduced to directly address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS. Renewal applications are now issued to existing FIS recipients 8 weeks before their entitlement is due to cease, with the aim of having repeat claims processed by the time their 12 month payment cycle expires.</p>
            <p eId="para_3054">A review of staffing requirements and processes has been completed in the light of the current volumes of new and renewal claims.  Process improvements have been identified and are being implemented.  These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of renewal claims on hand.  The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3056">In March 2006 my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign to promote and encourage the take up of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  An extensive week-long campaign included advertising on television, on national and local radio and in national and regional newspapers.  A nationwide poster campaign was also undertaken.  The cost of this campaign was approximately €300,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3057">In addition to the advertising campaign, FIS information booklets and application forms were distributed on behalf of my Department to GPs surgeries and health centres throughout the country and were displayed there from March to August 2006 and January to June 2007.  This cost in the region of €23,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_3058">The FIS scheme, as well as a number of my Department's other schemes and services, was advertised on ‘Info TV' in almost 80 Credit Union branches nationwide at various stages throughout 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">My Department aims to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their rights and entitlements.  In this regard, Information Officers are available in Social Welfare Local Offices to assist customers enquiring about the scheme.  Callers to my Department's Information Services enquiry line, 1890 66 22 44, are advised of the Family Income Supplement scheme, as appropriate.  Information booklets promoting FIS are distributed to local Social Welfare Offices, Citizens Information Centres, Post Offices and voluntary organisations.  In addition, information on FIS and all social welfare schemes and services is available on my Department's website, www.welfare.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_3065">My Department actively promotes the uptake of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme.  Following improvements to the scheme in the 2006 budget and an extensive advertising campaign, the number of people applying for a FIS payment increased substantially, so that some 26,900 new and renewal claims have been received in 2007.  This increase resulted in delays in processing claims and as a consequence higher volumes of telephone calls were received in FIS section.  The number of incoming calls to the section for the period from early May 2007 to mid September 2007 totalled some 71,500 and this has put pressure on the telephone service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3066">As part of its commitment to providing a quality service to all its customers, my Department operates a formal customer complaints system that enables customers to register complaints on any aspect of the service across all its schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3067">The principal measure introduced in relation to delays in answering calls is the setting up of phone bank system.  All incoming calls from the general public will be routed through a dedicated phone bank manned by a designated number of staff on a rota basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3068">There is a direct line to the section for TD enquiries with responsibility assigned to one staff member and there is a back-up number when the line is busy.  TD queries will continue to be dealt with on one direct line but a further five extensions will be available as backup in case the line is busy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3069">In response to the difficulties being experienced in the section a number of organisational and procedural changes have been implemented this, together with measures aimed at reducing the number of claims on hand, will enable FIS section to improve the quality of its telephone service.  The position will be closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3087">All workers, both employed and self-employed are obliged to pay PRSI contributions as a percentage of their personal reckonable income. These contributions provide entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments under various social insurance schemes — including pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3088">Self-employed workers — including taxi drivers — aged between 16 and 66 years and with reckonable income that exceeds the current insurable limit of €3,174 per annum pay PRSI contributions at Class S. The contributions are due at 3% of reckonable income, or €253, whichever is the greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_3089">PRSI Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments</p>
            <p eId="para_3090">Widow's or Widower's (Contributory) Pension;</p>
            <p eId="para_3091">Guardian's Payment (Contributory);</p>
            <p eId="para_3092">State Pension (Contributory);</p>
            <p eId="para_3093">Maternity Benefit;</p>
            <p eId="para_3094">Adoptive Benefit, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3095">Bereavement Grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3096">The range of benefits to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work and this is in turn reflected in the rate of contributions that they pay.  Self-employed persons pay PRSI Class S contributions at a rate of 3% and are eligible for a narrower range of benefits than employees who, together with their employers, are liable for a total contribution of 14.05% under PRSI Class A.</p>
            <p eId="para_3097">Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions which self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.  Class S contributors who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments by satisfying certain conditions including a means test.</p>

            <p eId="para_3137">Eligibility for deserted wife's benefit was discontinued with effect from 2 January 1997 with the introduction, on that date, of the one parent family payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3138">For claimants prior to 2 January 1997, deserted wife's benefit (DWB) was a payment made to a woman deserted by her husband. Entitlement was based on social insurance contributions paid by the wife or the husband. Wives who were in receipt of payment prior to this cut-off date retained their entitlement to payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3139">In order to continue to qualify for a DWB a person must continue to satisfy the following conditions to retain entitlement to the payment. She must:</p>
            <p eId="para_3140">Have at least 1 qualifying child residing with her if she is under 40 years of age, or</p>
            <p eId="para_3141">Be over 40, if she has no qualified child and (for those who applied for DWB after 31 August 1992) have earnings not exceeding €20,000 per annum,</p>
            <p eId="para_3142">Be inadequately maintained by her husband,</p>

            <p eId="para_3146">Prior to 31 August 1992, there was no earnings limit in place for DWB claimants.  An earnings limit was introduced by the Social Welfare Act, 1992.  For current DWB recipients who first claimed payment on or after 31 August 1992, an earnings limit of €20,000 applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3147">Claimants with income under this amount are entitled to payment of DWB in full.  Claimants whose annual income exceeds this threshold will retain entitlement to a half rate payment for a period of six months to ease the impact of losing entitlement to the payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3159">With regard to backdating the Fuel Allowance, the customer concerned resides in a Local Authority complex with communal heating arrangements.  Such customers could only qualify for a Fuel Allowance from the 2005/2005 fuel season if they satisfied the other conditions of the scheme.  As the person concerned had an income which exceeded the means allowed to qualify for the fuel allowance in 2005 and 2006 he would not be entitled to a Fuel Allowance.</p>

         his plans to allow persons to continue to work and pay PRSI pension contributions beyond pension age to gain eligibility for an old age contributory pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3248">The State Pension (Contributory) is a social insurance payment made to both employed and self-employed persons aged 66 or over who started paying social insurance contributions before reaching age 56.  The standard qualifying conditions for contributory pensions require a person to enter insurance 10 years prior to pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time that they enter insurance until they reach pension age.  These conditions are designed to ensure that those qualifying for pensions have had an adequate and sustained commitment to the social insurance system as well as to uphold the contributory principle that underpins the qualifying conditions for all social insurance payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3249">There is no legal basis on which to accept contributions — retrospective or otherwise — apart from where a worker has a liability that is set out in legislation.  Any such practice would be outside the scope of the legislative provisions that are currently in force.</p>
            <p eId="para_3250">People of working age who are no longer liable for PRSI contributions may opt to protect their pension entitlements by applying to become a voluntary contributor.  In order to be admitted to the voluntary contributions scheme, a person must have a minimum of 260 weeks of PRSI paid in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of being insurable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3251">The requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the scheme is essential in that it ensures that the requisite number of paid contributions required is in place to establish a contributory pension entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">It is important that those who wish to continue in employment after the normal retirement age should, as far as possible, be facilitated and supported.  Longer working lives can prove to be beneficial to the individual and, more significantly, can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">The National Pensions Review — published in January, 2006 — includes recommendations from the Pensions Board aimed at encouraging people to continue working after the normal retirement age.  The measures suggested involve allowing people to defer the receipt of their social welfare pension at the normal retirement age and granting them an actuarially-enhanced payment when they claim.  The Pensions Board also considered that, if this was combined with allowing those with less than full entitlements to count contributions made after age 65 or The National Pensions Review — published in January, 2006 — includes recommendations from the Pensions Board aimed at encouraging people to continue working after the normal retirement age.  The measures suggested involve allowing people to defer the receipt of their social welfare pension at the normal retirement age and granting them an actuarially-enhanced payment when they claim.  The Pensions Board also considered that, if this was combined with allowing those with less than full entitlements to count contributions made after age 65 or 66 in order to improve their contribution record, this would complete the incentives for longer working within the social welfare pensions system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3254">It should also be noted that the Government is currently committed, as part of the ‘Towards 2016' social partnership agreement, to develop a Green Paper on all aspects of the pensions system — including social welfare pensions.  It is expected that the Green Paper will be published shortly.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3256">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3257">A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  The scheme is specifically targeted at people on social welfare or Health Service Executive payments as they are most in need of support.</p>

A person who satisfies the income test for BSCFA will also satisfy the income test for Family Income Supplement.  A person in these circumstances whose income derives from employment and who is not in receipt of a social welfare payment may qualify for BSCFA once they claim family income supplement.  If their income is such that they qualify for BSCFA, they will qualify for both family income supplement and BSCFA.</p>

            <p eId="para_3263">Maternity Benefit is an income maintenance payment awarded by this Department to eligible women for a twenty-six-week period on foot of a confinement.  Entitlement to this benefit for employees is contingent on entitlement to statutory Maternity Leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">The right to Maternity Leave is established under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 — legislation for which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Any changes to current Maternity Leave provisions are a matter for him to consider in the first instance — and entitlement to Maternity Benefit would normally follow suit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">Under the provisions of social welfare legislation, the 26-week period of core statutory Maternity Leave attracts a payment from my Department — subject to certain social insurance contribution conditions being fulfilled.  Maternity Leave legislation also provides an option for a woman to take an additional sixteen-week period of Maternity Leave that does not attract a benefit payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">Some employment contracts allow for additional periods of leave to be taken or for an additional top-up payment to be made above the normal entitlement to Maternity Benefit.  These arrangements are discretionary private contractual arrangements agreed between the employer and the female workers and, as such, are outside the realm of social welfare legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3267">With regards to the potential expansion of maternity leave and benefit arrangements, the scheme has experienced significant improvements, notably in the last few years, in terms of both the duration of the payment and the level at which it is paid.  In 2000, the rate payable was the euro equivalent of €219.41 per week over 14 weeks — or €3,071 for the duration.  Maternity Benefit is now paid at a weekly rate of €280 over 26 weeks — or €7,280 for the duration.  This represents an increase of some 90% over a period during which average industrial earnings increased by just 67% per cent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3268">In line with the Maternity Leave (Amendment) Act, 2004, further changes have been made to the Maternity Benefit scheme.  The period of leave that must be taken before the end of the week during which the baby is due has been reduced from 4 to 2 weeks.  Also, the final 4 weeks of Maternity Benefit can now be postponed in the event of a child being hospitalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_3270">I am in regular contact with my colleague Michéal Martin T.D. Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding employment opportunities for both Waterford City and County. My Department participates in tri-partite meetings regularly with FÁS and the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment on a National level to discuss Live Register management related issues and to develop systems to support the unemployed. In the Waterford Region officials from my Department are actively engaged with the County and City Development Boards and associated sub-committees around issues of unemployment and social inclusion. In addition, officials in Waterford meet regularly with local FÁS officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_3271">One of the key interventions in supporting the unemployed is the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) under which persons aged 18 and under 64 years who are approaching three months on the Live Register are identified by the my department and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training. For those customers who are not regarded as ready for progression to work or training, a High Support Process is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3272">The objective of this process, which is provided by FÁS Employment Services Officers and Local Employment Service Mediators to identify the intervention most appropriate to the needs of the customer. This support is arranged in consultation with my Department, the Department of Health and Children, and the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_3273">I consider that the National Employment Action Plan has played and will continue to play an important role in assisting unemployed persons enter or return to the labour force.</p>
            <p eId="para_3274">My Department offers a range of services to facilitate and encourage customers to avail of training and further education. This includes the Back to Education Scheme where customers are actively encouraged to continue their education while continuing to receive payment. Customers can avail of short courses as well as more formal courses in second and third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3275">In addition, my Department through its Employment Support Service provides funding for special projects run by third parties to assist unemployed and other welfare recipients, as well as members of their families, to improve their employability through education, training and personal development. The Department sees the fund as a means of supporting innovative responses to increasing employability and tackling social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3276">Since 1 January, 2007 nine projects have been funded in the Waterford area, expenditure totalling €203, 577. The fund is operated in a manner that enables a quick response to any needs identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_3281">The Deputy will appreciate that primary responsibility for drug treatment rests with my colleague, Mary Harney T.D., Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3282">However, I understand that the Health Service Executive (HSE) provides addiction services in 9 locations in the Midlands region.  The range of services provided includes methadone maintenance, counselling, education/ awareness programmes and referral services to community, mental health and hospital services.  The HSE also provides intervention programmes for the families of substance misusers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">As of July this year, 8,474 people were in receipt of methadone treatment nationally and 136 of those were being treated in the Midlands Region.  I understand that there were 64 people on the waiting list for treatment in the Midlands — 43 in Athlone and 21 in Portlaoise.  The HSE is working to address this waiting list, particularly by trying to encourage GPs into the methadone treatment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3284">Meanwhile, the on-going implementation of the Action Plan of the Midland Regional Drugs Task Force will result in an increase in initiatives that will complement the mainstream addiction services.  Over €1.6m per annum is being provided from my Department to support the full implementation of the Plan.  It is also open to the Task Force to apply for capital funding under the Premises Initiative funded by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3285">Further midlands towns may also benefit from the commitment in the Programme for Government to extend the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund to further towns mainly in Leinster.  This issue is currently being considered by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3288">The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 has achieved considerable success across a range of different areas and will continue to do so in its remaining fifteen months of operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3289">In particular, the Deputy should note that:</p>
            <p eId="para_3290">The level of drugs seizures by the Gardaí and the Customs Service have been well in excess of the targets set out in the Strategy and they include a number of significant operations;</p>
            <p eId="para_3291">Under the prevention pillar, the SPHE and Walk Tall programmes have been rolled out to all schools; awareness campaigns have been organised and tremendous achievements have been made under the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF);</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">Treatment facilities have increased significantly, with approximately 8,500 in receipt of methadone in July, and a range of services are being provided across the statutory, voluntary and community sectors for various types of problem drug use; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">Research in areas such as drugs prevalence, the outcome of heroin treatment, families and drugs, the effect of drugs on communities and cocaine issues have all helped to inform our progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_3294">The specific achievements of my own Department under the Strategy include the establishment of the Drugs Task Force network across the country, at both local and regional levels. In all, over 440 community-based projects have been established through the Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs), employing more than 300 people. Each Regional Drugs Task Force has prepared a strategic plan to address gaps in service provision in their regions and these are now being progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">I referred above to the valuable work being done through the YPFSF.  I was delighted, therefore, to announce earlier this week an additional capital allocation of nearly €7m to support 42 projects under this Fund.  To date, allocations of just over €125m have been made to almost 500 facility &amp; services projects in LDTF areas and in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_3296">Priorities in tackling drug abuse over the next five years will include those set out in the Programme for Government, increased availability of treatment for cocaine users, implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation, further development of the Drugs Task Forces and the continuation and expansion of the YPFSF.  Another key priority is the development of a new National Drugs Strategy from 2009 onwards and this will be developed in collaboration with a wide range of relevant stakeholders over the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3297">Tackling the problem of drugs misuse is a key priority for Government and will continue to be so. This commitment is evidenced by the ongoing increased funding in my Department's Vote. The allocation of €50m this year represented an increase of 16% on the 2006 figure and was an increase of 87% over the corresponding figure for 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3298">I am, or course, determined to ensure that adequate resources will again be provided in the coming years so as to maintain the progress that is been made in tackling the drug problem in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_3314">Arising from the joint Ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 designed to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and improve cohesion and focus across various measures.  I have led the cohesion process, which is informed by the following guiding principles:</p>
            <p eId="para_3315">Improving on the ground services</p>
            <p eId="para_3316">Streamlining structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">Bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development measures;</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">Strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and service providers in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">Informed by proposals developed by Partnership and LEADER companies on the ground, the Government in July confirmed the arrangements that will ensure full coverage of the State by the local service providers and agencies that operate local development programmes on behalf of the Department. In order to give effect to the new arrangements, LEADER and Partnership groups in 27 areas of the country have been asked to form new companies by the end of October.  The intention is that the LEADER and Partnership companies will transfer into the new legal entities when they are established.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">The European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 131 of 2003) apply to any transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business from one employer to another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger. Subject to the application of these rules, the appointment of the chief executive officer will be a matter for the board of the new legal entity when established.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_3335">To ensure that the legal issues raised by Comhairle na Tuaithe, in its report on the National Countryside Recreation Strategy, were addressed as a matter of priority, I established an Expert Group earlier this year.  I asked the Group to report to me by 30th April.</p>
            <p eId="para_3336">Due to the short timeframe available, the Group was requested to initially consider issues in three broad areas:</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">1.Indemnity and addressing the Insurance issue;</p>
            <p eId="para_3338">2.Constitutional Issues on right to roam law and would farmers have to be compensated and a preliminary view as to whether the right to roam could confer wider access rights; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">3.Bare Licence and whether Bare license should be put on a formal statutory basis.I received their report in early May and members of Comhairle na Tuaithe were given until the end of August to put forward their comments/ observations. The comments received are now being examined by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">As the Deputy will appreciate, the Report is an objective legal opinion or legal advice. It is a report of legal experts, but every legal opinion is subject to what a court would decide.  It is very useful in that regard, but it is not a policy proposal.  Rather, it sets out what the legal possibilities are and informs our options for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">It appears that there are two ways to address the issue of countryside recreation — firstly through legislation or secondly, through community agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3342">I have always made clear my view that an agreed community approach offers a "win-win" situation for everyone with an interest in countryside recreation.   Everyone in Comhairle na Tuaithe seems to be in agreement on the need for the protection of landholders and the need for reasonable access.   There is a huge consensus within Comhairle on preparing a scheme for the development and maintenance of agreed walks and work on the framework of this scheme is currently on-going in my Department, in full consultation with Comhairle members.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">In addition to the work of the Expert Group and arising from my consideration of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy, I have also taken a number of other initiatives.  These include putting in place a system of rural recreation officers to act as facilitators for farmers, landholders and walkers alike on agreed walking routes and developing and marketing additional agreed looped walks, in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland, local communities and other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">I wish to assure the Deputy that I will continue to recognise the commitment of Comhairle na Tuaithe's members to developing countryside recreation and it is my clear intention to continue working with them to find the best way forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_3351">Due to the significant increase in assistance for Local Improvement Scheme Roads (L.I.S.) from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the past number of years (approx €11m in 2002 &amp; 2003, €12.1m in 2004, €12.5m in 2005, €25m in 2006 and €30m in 2007), my Department has decided to place a greater emphasis on funding water and sewerage schemes during 2007 under the CLÁR Programme.

            <p eId="para_3453">Conditions for trade in animal products with third countries follow the principles established under agreements of World Trade Organisation and the International Organisation for Animal Health. The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Community and, through its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to monitor their compliance in  third countries it has approved for trade with the EU. This approval is on the basis that the Commission adjudges the third country's controls offer an equivalent level of guarantee for the protection animal and human health to those being operated in the Community. Where there are risks to the public or animal health in the Community from disease outbreaks occurring in approved third countries Safeguard Measures are invoked restricting or banning imports from the affected country or region until the risk has been eliminated. The following South American countries, or regions of these countries, are currently approved to export fresh beef into the EU: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay.</p>
            <p eId="para_3454">In 2005 Safeguard Measures were introduced following outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Brazil restricting imports to non-affected regions. The FVO has undertaken a number of missions to monitor these foot and mouth controls as well as those on residues, traceability and on public health that are applied in particular to animal products destined for export the EU. While these reports, published on the Commission's website refer to certain shortcomings the Commission has to date not adjudged these to be of risk in relation to the import of meat into the EU. http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/ir<u/>search<u/>en.cfm.</p>
            <p eId="para_3455">I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers. As the Deputy knows Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU Directives on such matters as traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection. I am firmly of the view that our farmers who respect and produce to the highest standards deserve fair play in the market place. In this context I have been in regular contact EU Commissioner for Health Mr. Markos Kyprianou. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants. I intend to continue to pursue this matter with the Commission in the light of the forthcoming EU Food and Veterinary Office missions to Brazil.</p>

            <p eId="para_3499">To ensure that all planners offering planning services to REPS applicants are qualified to do so, my Department established minimum educational qualifications for planners.  As well as having the necessary qualifications, a planner must submit a training plan for assessment to my Department and make himself or herself available for training courses organised by my Department.  Only when my Department is satisfied with the standard of the training plan will a planner number be issued and the planner be included on the list of approved planners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3500">A farmer is free at any time to change his or her REPS planner if the farmer is not satisfied with the level of service being provided by the planner.  As the contract for the delivery of a REPS planning service is between the farmer and his planner any suggestion of non-performance in relation to the contract is a matter, in the first instance, for negotiation between the farmer and the REPS planner and failing a satisfactory conclusion is then a matter between the farmer's legal adviser and the planner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">The list of approved planners is reviewed on a regular basis.  A selection of all REPS plans submitted under the REP Scheme is subject to detailed assessment by my Department and planners not reaching the necessary standard are required to submit up to three training plans for critical assessment by my Department and where necessary attend a one-day training course.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3504">I approached Commissioner Fischer Boel earlier this year, seeking her agreement to have payments made with effect from 16 October rather than 1 December as is provided for in the relevant EU regulations. While the Commissioner indicated that she could not agree to this request at this time, she did make it clear in her written response that she agreed with the need to work for greater simplification, proposing that the matter be further pursued in the broader context of the CAP Health Check, scheduled to commence later this year. The commitment by the Commissioner to pursue this matter is important to Ireland, as we will be seeking, as part of the Health Check negotiations, a change in the Regulations to provide for a Single Payment Scheme payment commencement date of 16 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_3505">I subsequently approached the Commissioner a second time, outlining the adverse weather conditions that pertained during June, July and August, which seriously affected farming. I was particularly conscious of the difficulties caused for farmers, with significant delays in production of winter fodder, fodder intended for use next winter being fed to animals and some animals being housed early, as land was too wet to graze. I am pleased to say that, in response to this approach, a proposal to provide for advance payments, at a rate of 50%, was unanimously approved by the Direct Payments Management Committee at its meeting last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_3506">Work in my Department is at an advanced stage to maximise the number of payments that will be made on 16 October and thereafter and, in this regard, I would urge any applicants who have received correspondence from the SPS Unit of my Department in relation to specific problems on their SPS applications, to reply to these letters immediately. Until such time as a given query is resolved, no payment can be made. I might add that the level of errors on this year's applications is much higher than might have been expected, with many applicants making minor errors. Each of these requires to be resolved in order to allow payment to issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_3507">In view of this, I have again arranged to have a series of Lo-call telephone numbers set up, to assist farmers who wish to contact the SPS Unit, in order to resolve outstanding queries. These numbers are as follows: 1890 252 235: Clare, Cavan, and Limerick; 1890 252 236: Cork, Westmeath; 1890 252 242: Kildare, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Waterford and Wicklow; 1890 252 243: Carlow, Kilkenny, Louth, Monaghan, and Sligo; 1890 252 244: Donegal, Dublin, Offaly and Wexford; 1890 200 502: Galway, Kerry, Mayo, Meath and Roscommon; and 1890 250 598: Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3508">In view of the high level of queries identified, however, it is likely that large numbers of farmers will seek to telephone the SPS Unit, particularly in the days immediately following the initial issuing of payments. Again, I would stress that these farmers should, in the first instance, ensure that they have adequately replied to any correspondence, which they have received from the Unit in relation to problems with their applications.</p>

I received a detailed response and assessment from the Commission.  While I fully accept the Commission's reassurance that all appropriate measures would be taken to protect EU consumers, I have noted that certain deficiencies highlighted by the IFA were recognised by the EU Food and Veterinary Office. I have also noted that further FVO missions are being undertaken to Brazil and that the Commission would reassess the authorisation of exports from Brazil in the light of the outcome of these missions.  I have impressed on the Commissioner the need to ensure that the deficiencies noted are properly and promptly addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_3524">The Single Payment Scheme was introduced in 2005.  Under the scheme, farmers were required to lodge an application under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme in order to activate their single payment entitlements. In order to use entitlements, each farmer was required to declare one hectare of eligible land for every entitlement held. Once entitlements were activated in 2005, farmers then had to use them within three years or they would be surrendered to the National Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_3525">In March 2007, my Department wrote to farmers who had not used their entitlements in 2005 or 2006, reminding them that if they did not use them in 2007, these unused entitlements would be lost to the National Reserve. The final figure for the value of entitlements unused over the three years will not be known until the processing of the 2007 Single Payment applications is completed.   This processing is ongoing. It is estimated that when entitlements that were never activated in 2005 and entitlements that were activated but not used in the three years 2005, 2006 or 2007, are taken into account, there will be approximately €5 million surrendered to the National Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_3526">Under the 2007 National Reserve there were 4 categories under which farmers could apply: Certain types of inheritance; New Entrants; Certain Sheep farmers; and Offshore island farmers.

            <p eId="para_3529">The objective of the scheme is to make financial assistance available towards the cost of the construction and acquisition of buildings, new machinery and equipment and, consequently, assist the industry in improving efficiency and competitiveness and in so doing, not only strengthen primary processing but also underpin agricultural incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3530">As regards the operation of weighing scales I would point out that officials of my Department carry out regular inspections of meat plants to ensure that weighing equipment is operating efficiently and that weighing procedures are being correctly carried out in a consistent manner.  In some meat plants, farmers have a clear view of the scales readout, where the plant has installed a special viewing area specifically for this purpose. In some instances, however, it might not be practical for the meat plant to install a viewing area because of building design.  In such cases it would be a matter for the plant to decide, taking account of hygiene and health and safety concerns, whether a farmer would be permitted access to the scales area during processing of his or her animals.</p>

            <p eId="para_3535">As the requested transfer was based on inheritance, an official from my Department requested a copy of the Will of the deceased person and a copy of Probate.

            <p eId="para_3536">The requested transfer can only be completed if those persons who inherited the residue of the estate waive their rights in favour of the first named person. Consequently on the 11th May 2007 the person named was asked to supply waivers from those persons. On the 23rd June 2007 a reminder was forwarded. To date, no such waivers have been received and consequently it is not possible to process the requested transfer.</p>

            <p eId="para_3539">Fireblight is a bacterial disease caused by Erwinia amylovora. It is a serious disease of apples, pears and other trees and shrubs in the family Rosaceae.  The disease is native to North America and was introduced to Europe in the 1950s. It has since spread to most countries in Western Europe. Fireblight was first recorded in Ireland in 1986, but to date the disease has not become established here.  An eradication policy coupled with co-operation from the public succeeded in reducing infection to a minimum level.  Sampling of suspect material by the Department of Agriculture and Food has continued each year since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_3540">There are over 1,500 samples submitted for laboratory testing yearly and upwards of a dozen positive findings principally in Dublin and Cork Suburbs, along with a number of findings on nursery stock are detected.</p>
            <p eId="para_3541">All infected plants must be destroyed under the supervision of the Department of Agriculture and Food. It may also be necessary to destroy other adjacent host plants in order to control spread of the disease due to the issue of latency, where the plants may already be infected but have not yet expressed symptoms and so are sources of inoculum. The source of the infected material is then traced so that other infected plants may also be destroyed. The plant passport system facilitates the tracing of Fireblight host plants traded within EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_3542">With regard to the current situation in the Fingal area, trees that the Department has tested as positive for fireblight in the laboratory following sampling by staff from this Department, have been removed and destroyed. Host trees in the same stand are also removed to prevent further spread of the disease. To date it is estimated that Fingal County Council have removed approximately 450 host trees in the areas Sutton, Portmarnock, Malahide and Howth following positive findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3543">This Department is currently endeavouring to demarcate the zone of infection that appears to be primarily linked to older roadside plantings of Whitebeam and Mountain ash.  Residents in all the areas concerned have been circulated with detailed information and encouraged to contact this Department if they are aware of any suspect material, to date there has only been one finding in a private garden but extensive follow up is ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_3547">The full cost of training 150 physiotherapists over a four year period is estimated at €7.4m. There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, physiotherapy services over the last number of years. A particular priority for the Department of Health &amp; Children and my Department has been the expansion of the supply of physiotherapy graduates and, in this regard, training places have increased significantly in recent years and currently stand at 145.  In addition, the number of physiotherapists employed in whole time equivalent posts in the public health service has increased from 593 at end Dec 1997 to 1,410 at end June 2007 (an increase of 138%).  My colleague, the Minister for Health &amp;  Children is aware that some physiotherapy graduates have had difficulty in obtaining employment. Her Department is addressing this situation in a proactive manner and is working closely with the HSE to tackle the various factors which are contributing to this situation.  A working group made up of representatives from the Department of Health &amp; Children, the HSE and the profession itself, including nominees from the unions, is continuing to work to manage this situation. This group, working in close partnership, has identified all the contributing factors to this complex matter and has developed a comprehensive Action Plan to address the matter. The group is now working through prioritised actions.</p>

The Fund is intended to be a major catalyst in bringing about substantial change and quality improvement in our higher education institutions and promoting system-wide collaboration that draws on all institutions collective strengths.  The objectives of the SIF include  — the enhancement of the delivery of core activities of education and research, through effective and creative institutional and inter-institutional collaboration and, where necessary, appropriate internal restructuring and rationalisation efforts; to support innovation and quality improvement in teaching and learning, including enhanced teaching methods, programme restructuring, modularisation and e-learning; to support access, retention and progression at institutional level and through inter-institutional and inter-sectoral collaboration.  Awards under the Fund are made on the basis of competitive calls for proposals. The results of the first call, amounting to €42 million, were announced in October 2006.  The second call for proposals amounting to €130 million issued in August 2007 with a closing date of 19 October 2007. It is anticipated that the awards under this call will be made later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3557">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this. Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.  A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared with 280 in 2006/07. The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_3559">A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. The wide variety of measures in place for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflect these concerns. These measures include preschool interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants, measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community. In addition, there are interventions in support of youth, access to third-level and in providing "second chance education" for young people and adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_3560">My Department's approach to addressing educational disadvantage and social exclusion is set in the context of Towards 2016, and the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-16. Both Towards 2016 and the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion adopt a life cycle approach in addressing issues of social exclusion, including educational disadvantage, in the context of a ten year framework. The key life cycle phases include children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities. Under Towards 2016, the Government and the social partners have agreed to work together over the next ten years towards a number of long-term goals for children including the goal that every child should leave primary school literate and numerate and complete a senior cycle or equivalent programme appropriate to their capacity and interests. The total provision for educational inclusion programmes in 2007 is nearly €730 million across all levels of education. This represents an increase of nearly €90 million on the comparable 2006 figure. This includes additional funding for the implementation of measures under the DEIS action plan at preschool, primary and second-level, additional funding for further education programmes as well as an increase in provision for third-level student support schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3561">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion that I launched in 2005, focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from preschool through second-level education (3 to 18 years). The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multifaceted and more integrated approach. The key principle of early intervention underpins both the early childhood education measure and many of the literacy and numeracy measures and those to address early school leaving being adopted under the action plan. The plan will place a renewed emphasis on the involvement of parents and families in children's education in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3562">Measures under the action plan rolled out in the 2006/07 school year included additional financial supports for schools, reduced class sizes in urban primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities, expanded literacy supports and programmes such as Reading Recovery, extension of Home/School/Community Liaison (HSCL) and School Completion Programme services, enhanced support for the School Books Grant Scheme and expansion of the rural coordinator service.</p>

            <p eId="para_3564">The level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs has grown significantly in recent years. A significant development is the establishment of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which has been in operation since 1 January 2005 with over 90 members of staff working exclusively in supporting students with special educational needs. The NCSE was established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children. Since it was established in 2005, the NCSE has been responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs. The NCSE has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents. SENOs are responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports and they convey decisions on the applications directly to the schools. These supports include resource teaching hours, special needs assistant (SNA) support and assistive technology and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3565">Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes/units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports. At primary level, there are now over 6,000 teachers working directly with children with special educational needs, including those requiring learning support, compared with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.  At post-primary level, over 2,450 whole time equivalent teachers support special needs students compared with 200 in 1998. This includes 566 learning support teachers. Significant progress has been made in relation to increasing the number of SNAs in our schools who specifically cater for children with care needs. There are over 8,800 whole time equivalent SNAs in primary and post-primary schools supporting the care needs of these students compared with approximately 300 in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_3566">As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment. For example, more than €3 million was spent last year on specialised equipment and materials and nearly €50 million on school transport for special needs pupils. In addition to the developments outlined above, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally. The SESS now has 13 full time seconded teachers and 16 part-time associates and had contact with some 15,000 teachers in the last year. Furthermore, the SESS will be undertaking a recruitment drive in the near future to facilitate an increased level of training.</p>
            <p eId="para_3567">Going forward, the NCSE has produced an Implementation Report regarding the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 which is currently receiving detailed consideration within my Department. As part of this process, my officials have met with the education partners to obtain their views on the report and its recommendations. I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_3569">During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006 my Department accelerated the school building programme with record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems. An aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. This was the largest investment programme in the history of the State and delivered over 7,800 building projects in addition to investment in site purchases; the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, dust/asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, contingency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment including improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT.</p>
            <p eId="para_3570">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible. My Department also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects. My Department has improved forward planning through greater cooperation between the Department of Education and Local Authorities and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans.  The budget for 2007 is the first year of the roll-out of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school building infrastructure over the next 7 years to ensure that school places are available where needed. This funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation particularly in developing areas. This year alone around over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme. Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.  The main focus of the school building programme is to deliver additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas. It is projected that 100,000 additional school places will be required over the next number of years, with over 10,000 extra children entering our schools each year. I am conscious of the need to provide more school places quickly and these are being delivered.</p>

Those considered potentially suitable for the provision of a school building for the amalgamation were then discussed with Cork County Council. Following that exercise and to date, no site has been identified that is suitable from the perspectives of my Department, the Office of Public Works and Cork County Council. The Office of Public Works is continuing to work with my Department to identify and secure a suitable site for the proposed amalgamated school. Once a suitable site has been secured, the project will then be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3592">I welcome that students in our primary and secondary schools have opportunities to explore the original meaning of Irish place names (logainmneacha). It is clear that this exploration benefits students linguistically and culturally as well as giving them a greater appreciation of the past and the environment. The primary curriculum for Irish includes the exploration of place names and their meaning as one means of enhancing the language awareness of pupils in middle and senior classes. An understanding of place names helps to instil pride among pupils in their locality. The curriculum advises that teachers stimulate pupils' interest in local place names and extend this to national place names. Even where Irish is not the normal language of communication, seeing the language in the names of towns, rivers, mountains and lakes helps pupils to appreciate the influence of the Irish language on English in Ireland.   The study of place names can enhance pupils' learning in other areas of the curriculum, notably in geography and history. Discussion of the many words associated with place names such as baile, caisleán, cill and dún can increase pupils' understanding of the human environment and help them improve their range of Irish language vocabulary. In exploring Irish place names such as Cill Dara, Baile Átha Luain and Léim an Bhradáin and the stories associated with them, pupils in senior classes can develop a deeper understanding of the place and its history.</p>
            <p eId="para_3593">The syllabus for Irish at second level, at both junior cycle and senior cycle, promotes Irish place names as an appropriate area of study within the Irish curriculum which teachers may choose to include in their teaching and learning programmes. Raising students' awareness of the culture and traditions associated with the Irish language is a common thread throughout each Irish language syllabus at second level.  The enduring repository of Irish to be found in Irish place names to this day provides a ready source of enquiry that can engage the interest of students as it relates to their own place. The study of place names also provides opportunities for cross-curricular study and co-operation among teachers — notably in the areas of Irish, geography and history — and therefore fits very well with the innovative approaches to learning promoted by the Transition Year programme. The study of place names undoubtedly enriches the learning of students in our primary and post-primary schools.</p>

The number of additional teaching hours allocated would range from three to five hours per week depending on the pupil's special educational needs including the level of general learning disability.

            <p eId="para_3601">The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website.  Where there is no psychologist available through NEPS, a school may access psychological assessments through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Under the SCPA, such schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process.  The Deputy's question does not state which school the individual concerned currently attends so I am unable to advise on whether the school is covered directly by NEPS. Perhaps the Deputy might supply this detail to me so that my Department's NEPS service might make the appropriate enquiries in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3605">I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. The person referred to by the Deputy was a student in one of two post-primary schools in the Dingle Gaeltacht. Both of these schools were classified as All-Irish schools in which the language of tuition was Irish. Schools in this category receive almost 40% extra in per-capita funding. The two schools amalgamated at the end of the last school year and the students of both schools transferred to Pobalscoil Choirche Dhuibhne which is also classified as an All-Irish school in which the language of tuition is Irish. In the context of the amalgamation this issue arises from the reaffirmation by the Board of Management of the characteristic spirit of the new school as an All-Irish Gaeltacht school in which the language of tuition is exclusively Irish. My Department has written to the Board of Management and to the Trustees of the new Community School requesting that they bring forward proposals to ensure that students can complete their post-primary education without substantially altering the conditions of tuition under which they have hitherto been enrolled. The student referred to by the Deputy is now enrolled in and attending a post-primary school in Tralee and has been approved for school transport on a scheduled Bus Eireann service from Dingle to Tralee.</p>

            <p eId="para_3609">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30 September, 2006 was 305 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a  Principal and 11 mainstream class teachers. In addition to the mainstream class teachers, the school also has 2 permanent learning support/resource teacher posts, 1 special class post, 1 shared resource post for Travellers and 1 temporary language support post.</p>
            <p eId="para_3610">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn. It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">The Appeal Board holds three meetings per year to consider appeals. Meetings of the Board were held in May and July 2007 and a further meeting will be held on 23 October, 2007. The closing date for receipt of appeals for that meeting is the 12 October 2007. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final.</p>

The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child. Children with dyspraxia may be entitled to additional provision in school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the educational psychological assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular. In circumstances where a child with dyspraxia has other associated needs and would fall into the low incidence disability category, this would automatically attract additional resource teaching support.  Applications for this support are made to the local special educational needs organiser by the school. The provision of therapeutic services is a matter for the Health Services Executive (HSE) and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes.</p>

Where there is no psychologist available through NEPS, a school may access psychological assessments through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Under the SCPA, such schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. It should also be noted that in common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. It is the responsibility of the school Principal in the first instance to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process. I would suggest that the parents of the pupil in question should discuss the matter with the school Principal who will advise them about the possibility of a referral to NEPS or accessing a psychological assessment through the SCPA (whichever is appropriate). The Principal will advise about service availability and appropriateness of a referral.</p>

            <p eId="para_3628">The primary school capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €163.58 with effect from 1st January, 2007. This represents an increase of over 186% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_3629">Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.

            <p eId="para_3630">The capitation grant is in addition to the Ancillary Services Grant which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme was increased from €102 per pupil in 2002 to the current rate of €145.50 per pupil.  This Government has shown a strong commitment to improving primary school funding in recent years and I will continue to prioritise this area in the context of available resources.</p>

The NBPC produces educational materials in braille, large print format and text only for children who are blind or visually impaired. It is an essential service to children and young people who are blind or visually impaired and without it many of them would not be able to access mainstream education or be able to undertake the Junior and Senior Cycle examinations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3634">Due to the technical processes involved, the NBPC requires a significant notice period in relation to orders for the materials in question. In the case of late orders or other unforeseen circumstances where a delay occurs in the provision of books, officials from the NBPC, in conjunction with the parents of the pupil/student and the VTVI, work together to establish solutions to provide the books in a timely manner. It is accepted practice generally that the Braille books are delivered in volumes throughout the school year, due to the lengthy transcription process.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3639">Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) were established in 1974 to provide basic compensatory education for Travellers between the ages of 15 and 25, although the upper age limit has since been abolished. There is a network of thirty-three centres throughout the country catering for just over 1,000 learners. The Senior Traveller Training programme is a positive affirmative action by the Department of Education and Science which seeks to provide an opportunity for members of the Traveller community and other learners to: engage in a programme of learning that affirms their cultural identity; acquire the knowledge, skills and confidence to participate fully in society — Traveller community and settled community — enhance their employability and progress to further education, training, employment or other life choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3640">The target group is people over 15 years who have left school with either minimal or no qualifications. Particular effort is made to encourage parents on to the programme, given the impact this can have on their children's subsequent participation in mainstream primary and post-primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3641">The centres have been successful in imparting the essential skills of literacy, numeracy, social and life skills, woodwork, metalwork and home economics, among many others, for Travellers who have left school after primary level or who may not have gone to school at all.  Many adult Travellers are now availing of second chance education in these centres.  They recognise the value  education provides in the context of breaking the cycle of educational and social disadvantage that their community has experienced for many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3642">The programme is designed to be two years long encompassing a foundation and a progression phase. In exceptional circumstances learners may attend the programme for three years, if for example they are completing the Leaving Certificate Applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3643">After completing their programme in a STTC, a learner has the option of progressing on to other Further Education and training  courses provided by the VEC or FAS in their area. These courses may include the part time Back to Education Initiative, full-time Post Leaving Certificate courses, or they may chose from a number of FAS options.  A learner during their time in the centre and on completion of a programme at a STTC, can avail of the Adult Educational Guidance service in a VEC to explore options in terms of progression to further education and training.</p>

            <p eId="para_3661">I propose to take Questions Nos. 716 and 717 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">Contracting Authorities have an obligation to ensure that, as part of suitability assessment for placing on tender lists for projects, Contractors have adequate economic and financial capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">One of the key criteria for assessing financial and economic capacity is the average annual turnover of the contracting company over the previous three years.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the firm has adequate capacity and will not be overstretched if it is successful in winning the tender competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">My Department's Technical Guidance Document (TGD) 014, Guidance for the pre-selection of Contractors for Capital Works Projects, sets an average annual turnover requirement of 2 to 2.5 times the estimated Contract value.  As very few of the projects for which small to medium contractors would be applying would exceed 12 months in duration, in practical terms what this requirement means is that any firm applying would be capable of taking on two projects of similar size at the same time.  This is not unreasonable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3665">The contract periods on this Department's projects are set at a reasonable level in compliance with health and safety requirements; however, there is usually a strict requirement to meet the completion date in order to comply with school term times.  This imposes a requirement on the contractor to carefully programme the project to ensure timely delivery.  Where a Contractor does not have adequate economic and financial capacity and is consequently overstretched, he/she may not be able to meet these targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_3666">It will be noted from my Department's website that TGD014 is due to be reviewed in the near future and my Department's Building Unit will re-examine the turnover requirements as part of that review; however, it is not anticipated that there will be any major change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3667">I should mention that in addition to major projects I approve hundreds of smaller building projects each year, most of which could be tendered for by smaller builders.  For 2007 I approved over 1,100 projects under the Summer Works Scheme, together with 250 projects under the Small Schools and Permanent Accommodation Schemes. In addition approximately 500 projects have been approved under the Emergency Works Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3684">Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if he or she resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her or his local post primary education centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_3685">The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3686">These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3687">The Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Clare and Bus Éireann have advised that the pupil referred to by the Deputy has been issued with a catchment boundary ticket for this service. However, I must emphasise the concessionary basis on which the ticket has been issued and the family is advised to liaise with Bus Éireann on a regular basis regarding the continued availability of catchment boundary seats.</p>

            <p eId="para_3689">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 377 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 14 mainstream class teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3691">The school also has the following other posts for the 2007/2008 school year.  These are: 3 Learning Support/Resource Posts; 1 Temporary Resource Teacher for Travellers Post Shared, with this post is based in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3692">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_3693">It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website. Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3694">The Appeal Board meets holds three meetings per year to consider appeals.  Meetings of the Board were held in May and July 2007 and a further meeting will be held on 23 October, 2007. The closing date for receipt of appeals for that meeting is the 12 October 2007. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_3697">As the Deputy may be aware, my Department's position is that as each child with autism is unique, they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. Applied Behavioural Analysis, or ABA, is one of the methodologies used in special classes for children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_3698">Advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS and the Inspectorate inform my Department's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research — including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism — supports this approach too, while Autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method.</p>
            <p eId="para_3699">Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers who are trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3700">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for the establishment of special classes for autism and for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_3701">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_3720">In general, the view of my Department and the evidence from research in Ireland and internationally is that mixed-ability classes are preferable, particularly in the junior cycle.  This issue is dealt with through provision by the Second Level Support Service of whole-school inservice on mixed-ability teaching, through the work under the School Development Planning Initiative, through the ongoing work of the Inspectorate in evaluation and quality enhancement, and through dissemination of research findings of the ESRI/NCCA Report.  An information leaflet for schools and parents summarising the key findings and recommendations of the research has been launched, and this will inform school practice and planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_3721">The Report by ESRI/NCCA examines the experiences of students in their first year at post-primary school. It shows that although students have both positive and negative feelings about moving to a new school, most students settle into post-primary school quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3722">Among the findings in the report are the possible negative effects that streaming of students by ability may have on how students settle into school.  It is encouraging that the research indicates that the prevalence of streaming in first year is declining, and that the great majority (70 per cent) of schools surveyed used mixed-ability classes in first year with 16 per cent using banding and only 14 per cent using streaming.</p>
            <p eId="para_3723">We should keep in mind that "streaming" can take different forms and that sometimes different ability groupings may be helpful for the individual pupils at a later stage in their education. For example various syllabi are available at Higher, Ordinary and Foundation levels and it may be appropriate for classes to be organised along these lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_3724">Schools have discretion in how they organise their classes, and this is essentially an organisational issue for principals and school boards of management.  The School Development Planning Initiative, supported by a full time support service, has an important role in advising schools on this matter with a view to achieving the best organisational arrangement for all pupils.</p>

            <p eId="para_3734">Teacher education programmes provided in approved third level institutions, are recognised for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme.

            <p eId="para_3735">My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees. The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.</p>
            <p eId="para_3736">An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year's duration pursued in an approved institution. The Schemes outline the respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3737">In addition, my Department allocates funding each year to third level institutions under the Student Assistance Fund. This fund is available to assist students who may be experiencing difficulties in continuing their studies due to financial hardship. The disbursement of this funding is a matter for individual institutions in line with guidelines issued by my Department.</p>

In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 16 mainstream class teachers. This is an increase from a mainstream staffing in the 2006/07 school year of a Principal and 15 mainstream class teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3781">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</p>
            <p eId="para_3782">Based on data submitted to my Department the school referred to by the Deputy has been sanctioned a developing school post for the 2007/08 school year based on a projected enrolment of 458 pupils for the 30th September 2007. The school authorities were notified of this in a letter dated 3 July 2007.</p>

Hard copies of this circular have issued to primary schools.</p>

Meetings of the Board were held in May and July 2007 and a further meeting will be held on 23 October, 2007. The closing date for receipt of appeals for that meeting is the 12 October 2007. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.

            <p eId="para_3842">The Schools Broadband Access Programme is being undertaken in partnership with industry.  The Agreement with IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) provides for a three year €18m joint Fund, with industry contributing €5 million per annum and the Government contributing €1 million per annum, and meets the costs of schools local connectivity.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, which provides managed Internet access, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process.  A Broadband Support Service Desk has also been established to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">Following a public tendering process, contracts were finalised in 2005 with six Service Providers for the provision of local access connectivity to schools and with a further Provider for the installation of a broadband router at school level where appropriate.  Roll out of the local connectivity and router installation commenced in June 2005.  The installation process has two stages starting with the local broadband connectivity installation (involving DSL, satellite or wireless technology) followed by the installation of a high-speed router and circuit and acceptance testing.  A school then must confirm that it has an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in place and it must indicate which content filtering option it requires prior to the activation of the school's connectivity via the Schools National Broadband Network.  The costs associated with the Project are paid by my Department directly so there are no grants issuing to schools for broadband services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3844">HEAnet has established a Network Operations Centre to channel and control the broadband access to schools and it provides centrally managed services for schools such as security, anti-spam/ anti-virus and content filtering.  The national helpdesk and HEAnet work with the individual schools and service providers involved to address service issues on an on-going basis.  Having regard to the usage levels observed by HEAnet, my Department has recently procured additional bandwidth from its two satellite providers which should result in improved broadband connection speeds for schools on this portion of the Schools Broadband Network.  My Department will also be tendering for a programme evaluator to independently evaluate the deployment of broadband access to schools and the impact of such deployment within schools over the period of the Schools Broadband Access Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3847">In relation to the Girls school it is proposed to provide a new school on a new site.  The OPW, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, is considering a number of site proposals with the intention of acquiring a suitable site to facilitate the development of a new school building.  Due to the commercial sensitivities of the site acquisition process the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment any further.  In relation to the Boys school the Patron has offered to provide a site to accommodate the new school and I understand is in discussions with the County Council in relation to same.  As soon as these site issues are finalised, the building projects required to deliver the appropriate accommodation will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</p>

Similarly tuition fees, under the Free Fees Initiative, are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance on a course at the same level.  These restrictions apply to every student who already holds a qualification at the same level, irrespective of where that qualification was obtained or whether or not funding was previously awarded.  Clause 7.6 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme refers in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3899">There are no plans at present to extend the nationality clause of the maintenance grant schemes.  Any extension to the scope of the schemes can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3900">Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved full/part-time courses in both private and publicly funded third level Colleges and Universities in the State and any other E.U. Member State.  Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from one's local Revenue Commissioners Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_4355">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4356">Applications for review were received and thoroughly examined by the Review Group, from four of the eight schools referred to by the Deputy.  In accordance with the recommendations of the Review Group, the schools were not identified for inclusion in DEIS and the schools were informed by letter in August 2006.  Unsuccessful schools were advised in May 2007 that they would retain the supports they had under previous schemes, including schools included in the School Completion Programme,  for the duration of the DEIS action plan.</p>

The main conditions are that students must (a) be first-time undergraduates; (b) hold E.U. nationality or official refugee status; and (c) have been ordinarily resident in an E.U. Member State for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.  Eligibility is determined at date of entry to the course of study.</p>
            <p eId="para_4359">The Non EU spouse and dependent children of an EU migrant worker resident in the State may also be considered for free fees once they meet the other criteria of the scheme.  The third level institutions are autonomous bodies and, as such, may determine the level of fees to be charged in any cases where the Free Fees Initiative does not apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_4360">My Department funds three maintenance grant schemes for third level students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992.  Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4375">As the Deputy may be aware, the National Braille Production Centre (NBPC), an integral part of the services provided by St. Joseph's School for the Visually Impaired in Drumcondra, Dublin, was established in 2000 to provide blind/visually impaired pupils at first and second level with textbooks in braille and other alternative formats. The NBPC produces educational materials in braille, large print format and text only for children who are blind or visually impaired. It is an essential service to children and young people who are blind or visually impaired and without it many of them would not be able to access mainstream education or be able to undertake the Junior and Senior Cycle examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4376">My Department's Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired (VTVI) has a significant role to play in the process of ordering books or materials on behalf of a particular pupil/student. In 2006, a protocol was agreed between the NBPC and the VTVI regarding the provision of educational materials in alternative formats.</p>
            <p eId="para_4377">Due to the technical processes involved, the NBPC requires a significant notice period in relation to orders for the materials in question. In this particular case, the order was placed in July 2007. A significant proportion of the books required has already been made available for the pupil. I understand that, taking the special circumstances of this particular case into consideration, the NBPC are working towards having the order for the remaining books completed by the end of the current school term. It is accepted practice that the Braille books are delivered in volumes throughout the school year, due to the lengthy transcription process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4378">I also understand that officials from the NBPC have been in contact with the parents of the pupil referred to by the Deputy and have invited them to a meeting in their Head Office to discuss their concerns.</p>

         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that assessments carried out by privately employed educational psychologists take a half day while those carried out by National Educational Psychological Service psychologists take a number of school visits; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [20646/07]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1080">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4386">The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Where there is no psychologist available through NEPS, a school may access psychological assessments through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Under the SCPA, such schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4387">Pending the expansion of NEPS coverage of schools the SCPA was specifically introduced to minimise delays for those children who need to be assessed on an urgent basis. SCPA allows one assessment per 50 pupils enrolled in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4388">The SCPA psychologist's remit essentially entails a once-off request to conduct a formal assessment of an identified pupil. This process typically includes (1) the administering of both cognitive (I.Q.) and educational attainment tests (literacy &amp; numeracy) (2) the scoring of those tests (3) interviews with parents and teachers  and (4) the drafting of outcome report and recommendations. The process involves an estimated eight hours in-put by the chosen panellist including 4 hours to conduct the test and interviews.</p>
            <p eId="para_4389">In common with many other psychological services, NEPS encourages a staged assessment model, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4390">The NEPS psychologist's engagement with his/her assigned schools represents a holistic approach to supporting pupil's psychological well-being. It involves the provision of a range of advisory supports to school authorities and teachers in the application of the staged model, in-service training support, general consultations on matters of concern, on-going consultation/ review of specific pupil's issues and direct observation, as well as the application of formal assessment routines.</p>
            <p eId="para_4391">While it is difficult to generalise regarding the nature of formal assessments, due to the wide variety and complexities of individual cases presenting in schools, the broader context in which the NEPS psychologist interacts with schools can result with different attendance patterns in relation to individual pupils.  However in relation to the carrying out of formal assessments the range and time in-put are comparable and both achieve the aim of the provision of the most appropriate resource and educational support for the individual pupil concerned.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4429">Significant progress has been made in progressing a range of areas highlighted in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences e.g.</p>
            <p eId="para_4430">A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1000 per school plus €10 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4431">A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and it was examined for the first time in June 2006. Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects — Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) — is well advanced. The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4432">Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme. In that context, €16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4433">Investment in the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutes (PRTLI) is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4434">My Department does not allocate provision for laboratory technicians/assistants in second level schools. The recommendation made by the Task Force Report in this area, in 2002 prices, was costed at €18.8m annually. The current cost of such provision is estimated at c. €24.6m for science subjects only, but could exceed €120m annually if applied to other practical subjects. While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visiting the issue. A decision on this issue can only be made in the context of the resources available from time to time in the Estimates. As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_4435">Other aspects of the Plan include:</p>
            <p eId="para_4436">reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age,</p>
            <p eId="para_4437">strengthening teacher training in this area</p>
            <p eId="para_4438">reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula</p>

            <p eId="para_4441">Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4458">The Joint Committee Report of the Provision of Educational Services in a Multiethnic/Multicultural Society, which was published in April of 2004, is an important snap-shot of the educational needs of newcomers at a particular point in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">I am pleased that since its publication, a great deal of work has been done in this area, which addresses the issues highlighted in the Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">The importance the Government attaches to this area is emphasised by the establishment of the Office for Integration and my appointment as the first Minister for Integration. This development of this Office will greatly help the development of a coordinated and cohesive response to the integration of newcomers to Ireland. In particular, it will focus upon the work undertaken by three Government Departments: Education and Science; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4461">Since the publication of the Joint Committee's Report, my Department has secured a number of achievements in regard to the educational integration of newcomers. These achievements are as follows:Language Support Teachers are provided at primary and post-primary levels to those schools which have newcomer pupils who do not have English as their first language. As Minister, I removed the ‘cap' of two Language Support Teachers per school and extended the provision of language support beyond two years. As a result, some schools with a large number of newcomer children without English as their first language have up to 6 Language Support Teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">Towards 2016 provides for the provision of an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 including 200 teachers (175 primary and 25 post-primary) in 2007, with a further 150 in 2008 and 200 in 2009. This will bring the overall number of such teachers to approximately 1,800 by 2009 (there are currently 1,450).</p>
            <p eId="para_4463">Language assessment kits, based on best international practice are to be provided to all primary schools during the 2007/08 school year.

The announcement followed a call for proposals for the establishment of a Podiatry programme organised by the HEA on behalf of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science.  Proposals were received from Athlone Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology, NUI Galway, University College Cork, University College Dublin, and University of Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_4483">An expert panel of independent external assessors was set up to evaluate and make recommendations on the proposals.  The panel was made up of three expert members: a podiatrist holding a Head of School position in a UK University, a podiatrist who formerly held a Head of School position in a UK University and a consultant professor of rheumatology in a major hospital in the UK.  In evaluating the proposals, the panel had regard to the criteria outlined in the call for proposals namely: curriculum content, clinical training, strategy and value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_4484">The panel noted the work already done by the institute to develop an existing curriculum, and the links fostered with Plymouth University.  They also noted that the programme has already been accredited. The documentation and presentation did not convince the panel on how inter-professional learning will be facilitated.  The panel were also concerned that the staffing and other resources proposed by the institute would be inadequate to deliver the curriculum proposed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4499">Under the requirements of the Education Act 1998 each recognised school is required "to establish and maintain systems whereby the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations can be assessed."  A range of supports is available to schools to assist them in undertaking self-evaluation and improvement of their work.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">External evaluation by the Inspectorate can also help to enhance the quality of the learning experience for students when the school uses the outcomes of whole-school and other evaluations to complement its self-evaluation process.  Responsibility for the implementation of recommendations and improvements rests mainly with the board of management and the principal and staff of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">The patron of the school also has a responsibility to ensure that effective action is taken.  Following the in-school evaluation phase of WSE, the evaluation team discusses the findings and recommendations of the WSE at meetings with the board of management, principal and staff of the school.  The inspectors from my Department use these opportunities to draw the attention of staff and school management to issues that require improvement, including any issues of serious concern if such have been identified.  The inspectors also provide practical advice on how improvements can be achieved.  Prior to the publication of the WSE report on the website of my Department, the board of management of the school has an opportunity to respond to the findings of the evaluation. In the standard School Response form, the board is encouraged to show how it intends to address the issues raised in the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4502">Many boards use this opportunity to record how their schools will implement changes. In the vast majority of cases, the post-evaluation meetings and the written report are sufficient to ensure that improvement takes place.  A copy of the report is also sent to the patron of the school for his/her attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_4503">If the whole-school evaluation shows that there is a serious issue of concern in the school, the Department ensures that this matter is brought to the attention of the board of management and the patron of the school for appropriate action. In exceptional cases, the Education Act provides that the patron of the school may dissolve the board of management at the request of the Minister, if the Minister is satisfied that the functions of the board are not being discharged effectively or that the board is neglecting to comply with an order or regulation made under the Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_4713">The school referred to by the Deputy applied and was approved funding for four extra classrooms under the devolved Permanent Accommodation Scheme for 2007.  The alternative to a school participating in a devolved scheme is to apply for consideration for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating.  The Permanent Accommodation Scheme (PAS) was originally introduced in 2003 on a pilot basis and was extended to cover more schools in subsequent years.  I increased funding for the PAS in 2006 by an average of 20%.  This increase follows an increase of up to 25% in 2005. The feedback has in general been very positive — the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included.  To maintain this momentum I approved over 140 additional schools to participate in this scheme in 2007.  The present position of the project in question is that the school's management expects to apply for planning permission in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4721">I am aware that Naas continues to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision.  However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by the Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.  At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee, Naas.  In addition, a brand new 16 classroom school has been provided for Naas together with the provision of temporary accommodation at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth's and St. Mary's NS, St. Conleth's Naofa and Mercy Convent in Naas.  A major building project is at Stage 3 of architectural planning to provide Caragh NS, Naas, with an additional 12-classrooms and ancillary accommodation.  Gaelscoil Nás na Ríogh has recently been approved to commence architectural planning for the provision of a new 16-classroom school.  On top of this, approval has been given for the provision of a new 32-classroom school for Kill.  Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David's National School and Two Mile House National School.  The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Convent of Mercy and Scoil Corbán in Naas and Scoil Pádraig in Johnstown are also being assessed.  At Sallins National School, a seven classroom extension is completed and this extension has increased capacity from 9 classrooms to 16 classrooms.  An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms has commenced architectural planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_4722">At post primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick's Post Primary School, Co. Kildare VEC, is progressing plans to relocate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupil places.  Additionally, an extension project is completed at St. Mary's College, Naas which increases capacity at the school to 900 pupils.  A similar extension was recently completed at Meánscoil Iognaid Rís, Naas and a further extension at the school is in architectural planning.  All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the area concerned.  The School Planning Section of the Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</p>

The assessment as to the probability that a death has actually occurred is a matter for the individual coroner concerned, who must satisfy himself in this regard prior to seeking a direction from the Minister, but I can inform the Deputy that such directions have issued in the past in respect of deaths at sea.  There is no connection between this statutory provision and the jurisdiction of the Courts to declare that a missing person may be presumed dead.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4753">In April 2005 my predecessor as Minister launched a public consultation process on the subject of immigration.  The vehicle for this consultation process was a policy document, Immigration and Residence in Ireland, which he published outlining the Government's proposals for addressing Ireland's immigration system in a comprehensive way.  More than 120 organisations and individuals made submissions as part of this process reflecting a wide range of concerns and interests in the migration system.  In addition to dealing with the individual areas of the immigration system from initial visa application to long-term residence, the document also set out the core principles underpinning immigration policy, including maintaining the safety and security of the State and its residents, promoting the common good, managing migration in an orderly fashion to serve the economic and social needs of the State and its residents, protecting human rights, protecting and developing Ireland's international relations, ensuring fair treatment of persons, achieving reasonable standards of clarity and transparency, and providing satisfactory standards of service.  These principles were reflected in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007, which was published by the outgoing Government in April of this year.  The Bill is being reviewed and refined at present with a view to publication in the autumn.  The Bill will set out a comprehensive legislative framework within which our immigration system can be managed in a flexible manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_4754">As regards policies on integration, the Deputy will recall that in June 2007, the Taoiseach appointed Deputy Conor Lenihan as Minister of State with responsibility for the development of integration policy.  The Minister of State is based in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with links to the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science.  The Minister of State's office is still being established.  Staff from the Integration Division of the Reception and Integration Agency have already assigned to it and are co-located with the new Minister of State.  As part of developing a broad co-ordination and policy development role, I understand that the Minister of State proposes to establish a Task Force on Integration in early 2008 to run for a year.  The task force will identify key issues affecting immigrant communities, consult widely with immigrants and Irish people, visit communities, examine existing research and report back with recommendations.  In the interim, the Minister of State with responsibility for integration will build on and accelerate the progress that has already been made in the integration area.  He proposes to adopt a mainstream policy of service provision which places special responsibility on all Departments to consider and formulate integration proposals in their own area of competence.  To this end he will co-ordinate Departments' integration activities in the integration area through a special cross-departmental group on integration.  A range of ongoing strategic studies including English language training, interpretation, funding and information provision will also inform policy development.</p>

My Department's view is that the European Patent Office does not come within the definition of "public service" as set out above.  Therefore, for the purposes of the above Act my Department does not regard employment with the European Patent Office as being employment in the Irish public service, as defined, and consequently an Irish citizen employee of the European Patent Office is not regarded by my Department as being employed in the public service.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4760">I propose to take Questions Nos. 883 to 885, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4761">While the crime of human trafficking is a despicable one, and clearly a violation of human rights, there is little evidence of a significant human trafficking problem in this country.  Indeed the US State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report, which was issued in June 2007, highlighted that Ireland had a potential human trafficking problem rather than a significant problem.  I should take this opportunity to mention the confusion that is being caused in the media in relation to the term "human trafficking". Immigrant prostitutes are only trafficked if they were recruited or transported to Ireland by means of the threat or use of force, coercion, fraud or deception for the purpose of exploitation.  A person who chooses to work as a prostitute in Ireland is not necessarily a trafficking victim.  Similarly, an immigrant worker who is not being paid the minimum wage is not a trafficked victim if there is no threat, force or coercion keeping him or her in that position.  They are simply victims of labour exploitation.  While I do not condone such exploitation, it does not amount to what is accepted worldwide as constituting human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_4762">Legislation creating an offence of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or knowingly arranging or facilitating the entry into, travel within or departure from the State of a person for the specific purpose of the trafficked person's sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I expect to publish this legislation shortly.  In addition, it is intended that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007 will, subject to enactment, provide the necessary framework for addressing the immigration aspects of trafficking so as to comply with the relevant protection provisions in the Convention.  In particular, in the context of the treatment of victims, it is intended that a framework will be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State and also, in circumstances where he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings in the matter, a further period of residence to enable him or her to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_4763">On enactment of this legislation, which I am treating as an urgent priority within my Department, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the international instruments on trafficking in persons.  My officials are actively participating in all relevant international fora on this issue.  Ireland is appropriately represented at EU, Council of Europe, UN and OSCE meetings on this topic.  My officials are liaising on a bilateral basis with colleagues in Northern Ireland, Great Britain, other European countries and the United States.  Both my Department and the Garda Síochána are identifying best practice in both policy and operational enforcement matters.  This summer the Garda National Immigration Bureau has successfully trained more than 100 officers in victim identification issues.  A number of actions are being taken by the EU under its Action Plan.  A network of contact points in Member States is being established.  The first EU Anti-Trafficking Day will take place on 18 October 2007.  The Portuguese Presidency will shortly hold a conference on human trafficking and gender specific issues.  The European Commission has prioritised trafficking in human beings prevention projects for funding under the "Prevention of and fight against crime" programme for 2007.  These are just some of the actions taking place this year at EU level.  My Department is also participating in the UN Global Initiative to fight human trafficking, a two-year programme launched by the UN earlier this year with the support of the United Arab Emirates.  I assure the Deputy that I am in no way complacent about this issue and my officials are working on a comprehensive programme of measures that will be announced later this Autumn.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         if, with regard to a student currently attending a State funded school as a dependent of a parent residing in the State on a self sufficiency basis, a facility exists whereby an equivalent fee or payment can be made to the school attended or the Department of Education and Science in order to meet self sufficiency requirements and enable continued attendance at a State funded school.

            <p eId="para_4769">The entitlements of foreign nationals in the State and the conditions applicable to them depend on their immigration status.  A foreign national may be granted permission to remain on the basis of self-sufficiency.  The underlying principle regarding self-sufficiency is that the foreign national who is here on that basis would not need to avail of State funds or State funded services nor would any dependant family members who were allowed enter the State require such State benefits.  If the student child of a parent who is in the State on the basis of self-sufficiency were to be enrolled in a State-funded school that would conflict with the principle of self-sufficiency.  Under immigration law where permission is granted to reside in Ireland on a basis that excludes access to State funded services, placing dependant children in State schools would be in breach of the conditions of the person's permission to be in the State.  I understand that it is not possible for schools or the Department of Education to levy the sort of fee set out in the Deputy's question on the basis of nationality or status.</p>

            <p eId="para_4771">I am informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that the visiting privileges in respect of the person in question have been suspended following a serious breach of security.  The circumstances of this breach and subsequent suspension arose in July 2004 following complaints received from a family member of a prisoner (since released) in relation to attempts made by this person to pass material from the prisoner to them.  The then Governor of Arbour Hill Prison conducted an investigation into the matter and following same made the decision to suspend his visiting privileges under the following rules, as contained in The Rules for the Government of Prisons 1947 (S.I. 320/47).</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4772">Rule 22. (2) No person shall without authority convey or introduce into a prison or convey or throw out of a prison, or convey to any prisoner, or deposit with a view to its coming into the possession of any prisoner, any money, clothing, food, tobacco, letter, paper, book, tool, or other article whatever. Anything so conveyed, deposited, or thrown without authority, may be retained by the Governor.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4773">Rule 60. (2) If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that any person who comes to the prison for the purpose of seeing a prisoner brings in or takes out any articles for an improper purpose, or contrary to the prison rules, or that his conduct may tend to subvert the discipline or good order necessary to be maintained in the prison, the Governor may suspend his visit and remove him from the prison, duly recording the fact in his journal, and reporting it to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">I do not doubt that this person has only the best of intentions.  However, the Irish Prison Service has a duty of care to the prisoners in their custody and must account for the persons who it allows into prisons.  Also, they have an obligation to serve the community with full respect for the human dignity and rights of every person, both in custody and in the wider community including the families of prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4775">I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that they did not take this decision lightly and having reviewed the circumstances of this case, it is the still their position that visiting privileges should remain suspended.</p>

            <p eId="para_4797">The Victims Charter entitled "Victims Charter and Guide to the Criminal Justice System" provides a written framework against which crime victims can measure the level and standard of treatment received in their dealings across all sections of the criminal justice system.  It sets out, from the victim's perspective:</p>
            <p eId="para_4798">a general description of the overall criminal justice system</p>
            <p eId="para_4799">a concise summary of the role and functions of each of the main bodies/agencies involved</p>
            <p eId="para_4800">the entitlements of the victim in terms of standards of treatment, rights and complaints procedures in each area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4801">A guiding principle of the Victims Charter is a commitment to giving victims of crime a central place in the criminal justice system. As indicated in the Charter, victims of crime are entitled to dignity and compassion from all the services involved in supporting victims of crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_4802">Against a background of a need to review the mechanism and services put in place by specific agencies to assist victims my predecessor established the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime (CSVC) in March 2005.  The members of the CSVC are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4803">Mr. Jim McHugh, retired Assistant Commissioner, An Garda Síochána, (Chairman)</p>
            <p eId="para_4804">Ms Nora Owen, former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</p>
            <p eId="para_4805">Mr. Sean Lowry, former head of the Probation and Welfare Service,</p>
            <p eId="para_4806">Mr. Michael Whelan, Gemini Consulting,</p>
            <p eId="para_4807">Ms Marian Finucane, broadcaster.</p>
            <p eId="para_4808">The CSVC has a three year remit to disburse funding for victim support measures and to develop a framework for victim services going forward.  Its remit also includes the examination of all aspects of the provision of services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system.  The CSVC is at present carrying out a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the Victims Charter as part of its work programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4809">In its first two and a half years, the CSVC concentrated mainly on funding non-governmental organisations that provide front-line services to victims of crime, in order to ensure continuity of services to victims on the ground   To date, it has allocated close to €2million in funding to organisations engaged in providing support to victims of crime.  Such funding ranges from €4,000 to the smaller voluntary groups to €100,000 per annum to the large well established non-governmental organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4810">Over the period CSVC has provided an allocation of funding amounting to €85,000 to Support After Homicide (SAH) —  a non-governmental organisation which aims to provide emotional support and practical information to people whose lives have been affected by homicide.  Funding has also been provided to AdVIC in the amount of €35,000.  AdVIC is another non-governmental organisation which was formed to ensure that the rights of families of homicide victims are not ignored within the Criminal Justice System and to bring about a fairer legal system for such families.</p>
            <p eId="para_4811">As I understand it,  the CSVC has recognised that one of the primary functions that an organisation supporting victims of crime can provide to a victim is support by way of accompaniment, where the victim has to attend Court.   Such support can make a real difference to the experience that victim has in court, and of court processes.  In this regard, the CSVC prioritised the funding of activities at ground level that provide supports for victims of crime, such as court accompaniment services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4812">In addition to the disbursement of funds to organisations that support victims of crime, the CSVC is required to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future. I am informed that the CSVC is currently actively engaged in this work.  The CSVC was also tasked with updating the Victims Charter and that process is currently under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_4813">As the Deputy will be aware, as early as my first public engagement as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I announced my intention of moving ahead immediately with measures to enhance support for victims of crime, consistent with the commitment contained in our Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4814">I am also informed that An Garda Síochána has set out its policy and procedures that apply where members of the public are victimised as a result of crime and other traumatic incidents that require Garda intervention.  Garda Family Liaison Officers are appointed to keep victim's families informed of the progress of the investigation and to ensure that they are afforded appropriate and relevant emotional, psychological, informational and practical support.  The District Officer will appoint a Garda Family Liaison Officer to families of victims who have been or are being subjected to emotional or psychological trauma relating to:</p>
            <p eId="para_4815">Homicide</p>
            <p eId="para_4816">Kidnappings</p>
            <p eId="para_4817">False imprisonment</p>
            <p eId="para_4818">Hostage siege situations</p>
            <p eId="para_4819">Crime (other than above) where violence or an immediate threat of violence has been visited upon the family</p>
            <p eId="para_4820">Suicide and road traffic fatalities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4821">In cases of homicide the District Officer will initially assume the role of ‘Garda Family Liaison Officer'. As the case progresses the role will be delegated to a nominated Garda Family Liaison Officer whom the District Officer is satisfied, has the necessary skills, experience and competence. Garda Family Liaison Officers will also advise family members of support services available through the Crime Victims Helpline 1850 211 407.</p>
            <p eId="para_4822">The Garda Charter for Victims of Crime sets out the services and service delivery standards which An Garda Síochána is committed to delivering to victims.  The charter is available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4823">A Superintendent has been appointed to the position of Family Liaison Officer at Community Relations, Garda Headquarters, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2.  Formal training of Garda Family Liaison Officers is ongoing at the Garda College and is being rolled out nationwide.  Where the victim's family resides in another Garda district, the investigating officer will make the appropriate arrangements to contact the victim's family and keep them informed of the progress of the investigation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4825">The case referred to by the Deputy falls under the scope of the Dublin II Regulation, (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003).</p>
            <p eId="para_4826">This Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Member State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another regulation state.  At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had previously pertained in Europe.  Under the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.</p>
            <p eId="para_4827">Following investigation by ORAC, it was determined that the persons concerned had previously made asylum applications in the United Kingdom.  As a direct result of the ORAC determination, Transfer Orders were signed in respect of them on 19 July, 2007, obliging them to present to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, (GNIB), on 4th September, 2007, for arrangements to be made for their return to the United Kingdom. Flights were arranged for their transfers on 5th September, 2007.  However they failed to present thereby evading their transfers and became illegally present in this State.   The persons concerned continue to evade their transfers and remain illegally present in the State.  I would therefore urge the persons concerned to come forward and present themselves to the GNIB without further delay.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4830">I propose to take Questions Nos. 897 and 1026 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4831">The person concerned arrived in the State on 4 September, 2002 and claimed asylum. His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4832">The person concerned  was informed by letter dated 6 July, 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_4833">His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the Sate. On 26 August, 2004 my predecessor refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this Order was served by registered post requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 3 February, 2005, in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4834">Since then further representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned, and the Deportation Order signed in respect of him has been affirmed twice, first by my predecessor on 14 December, 2005 and more recently by me on 18 July, 2007. The person concerned was informed of my decision to affirm the Deportation Order by registered post letter dated 31 July, 2007. He was required to present himself to Henry Street Garda Station, Limerick on Thursday, 16 August, 2007 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. He presented as requested and was given a further presentation date of 13 September 2007 which he kept. He is due to present again on 18 October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4835">By correspondence dated 3 September 2007 the legal representative of the person concerned wrote to my Department providing up to date country of origin information and advising that her client would be at risk of serious harm if deported. The correspondence also included a request that I exercise my discretion  under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006 to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_4836">Following consideration of the information submitted, it was concluded that sufficient new facts and circumstances were presented which would warrant the exercise of my discretion under Regulation 4(2). A letter dated 21 September 2007 has issued notifying the person concerned, and his legal representative, of this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4837">The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. However, in view of the foregoing, the GNIB have been requested not to proceed with the enforcement of the Deportation Order until an application for Subsidiary Protection has been received and considered.</p>

In addition plain clothes Gardaí are placed on covert surveillance duties in areas of high prevalence of this type of crime.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4847">As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. There are specific procedures in place in both Offices to deal with claims from unaccompanied minors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4848">The statutory framework for dealing with asylum claims from unaccompanied minors is contained in the Refugee Act, 1996. Section 8(5)(a) of the 1996 Act provides that where it appears to an immigration officer or an authorised officer of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that a child under the age of 18 years, who has either arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State, is not in the custody of any person, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the Health Service Executive and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, shall apply in relation to the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_4849">Section 8(5)(b) provides that where it appears to the Health Service Executive, on the basis of information available to it, that an application for a declaration should be made by or on behalf of a child covered by section 8(5)(a), the Service shall arrange for the appointment of an officer of the Service or such other person as it may determine to make an application for asylum on behalf of the child. In the event that an application is made, the HSE will then assist the minor throughout the asylum process, including accompanying them to any interview or hearing that may be scheduled.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">In this regard, a total of 1,956 asylum applications by unaccompanied minors were received during the period 1 January, 1998 to 31 August, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4851">All applications for refugee status are processed having regard to the definition of a refugee contained in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996. The processing of applications for refugee status from unaccompanied minors has a number of child-specific features and has regard to a number of distinct factors including the UNHCR's Guidelines on Policies and Procedures in dealing with Unaccompanied Children Seeking Asylum and the EU Children First Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4852">A number of staff in both agencies have received specialised training in dealing with cases of unaccompanied minors. This training is currently facilitated by the UNHCR and involves presentations to practitioners from child care experts focusing on issues such as psychological needs, child specific aspects of the refugee process, the role of the social worker and other issues particular to refugee determination for separated children. A multi-agency approach is adopted in this training, in that this programme is attended by staff of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the Health Service Executive and the Refugee Legal Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">A representative of the Refugee Legal Service is present at all stages of the asylum process and provides legal advice to the applicant, as appropriate. Interpretation facilities are also provided where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">Accordingly, I am confident that unaccompanied minors in the asylum process are dealt with appropriately and sensitively by properly trained and resourced staff and that their asylum applications are dealt with in a fair and comprehensive manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_4858">I can inform the Deputy that the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill 2007, which will give effect to key recommendations of the Auctioneering/Estate Agency Review Group, including establishment of the Property Services Regulatory Authority to control and regulate the provision of property services provided by auctioneers, estate agents and property management agents is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Details of the proposed legislation are available on my Department's website at www.justice.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4859">The new legislation proposes fundamental changes to the system of licensing for auctioneers and estate agents and introduces, for the first time, a new licensing system for property management agents.  In addition the legislation will provide, also for the first time, a new system of control and regulation for all those providing property services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4860">Pending enactment of the legislation, a Chief Executive designate has been appointed and an Implementation Group established to assist and advise on practical maters relating to the establishment of the new Authority.  The Chief Executive designate, in consultation with the Implementation Group, is currently involved in establishing the basic organisational structures, systems and procedures, necessary to enable the Authority to fully discharge its statutory responsibilities once the legislation has been enacted.  As part of this process a number of specific issues, fundamental to the long term functioning of the Authority, have been identified which can be addressed in advance of it being established on a statutory basis.  These include the acquisition of accommodation for the Authority in Navan, Co. Meath, the development of a code of practice for the industry, the creation of a National Public Register of Property Services Providers and the development of consumer information packs.  To date significant progress has been made in each of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4861">A total of five permanent staff, who will be relocated to Navan to work with the Authority once it has been established on a statutory basis, have been assigned to work with the Chief Executive designate and a budget of over €0.5m has been made available in this financial year.</p>

This initiative involves the removal of graffiti from sites within the pilot areas of Dublin City, Galway City and Bray, Co. Wicklow.

            <p eId="para_4912">Neighbourhood Watch is a crime prevention programme which aims to enlist the active co-operation of the community in a neighbourhood by observing and reporting suspicious activities and by so doing reducing the level of criminal behaviour.  Since its establishment, the Garda authorities have sought to encourage the active participation of the public in Neighbourhood Watch by encouraging and supporting communities to establish and maintain such initiatives. An Garda Síochána has been a strategic partner in driving and supporting Neighbourhood Watch through its Community Relations Section and local Garda management and has deployed Crime Prevention Officers and Liaison Gardaí to assist schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4913">I am strongly of the view that voluntary community organisations have, through their support for and work with the Garda Síochána, an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety.  I very much support the work being carried out by Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert Schemes throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4914">The Garda authorities have conducted a high level review of Neighbourhood Watch which involved consultation with local communities, Neighbourhood Watch Coordinators, operational Garda personnel and a wide range of internal and external stakeholders.

            <p eId="para_4915">I am informed by the Garda authorities that under this strategy funding will be provided.  This will enable Neighbourhood Watch materials, such as manuals, booklets, stickers and other promotional items, as well as training to be provided to Neighbourhood Watch Schemes.

            <p eId="para_4928">The average processing time for applications for naturalisation is approximately 30 months.  This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.  The table shows the total number of applications received in the years 2003 to date. These figures illustrate a significant upward trend in the number of applications received.  With over 5,000 applications received to date in 2007, this trend looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4941">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is an honour and applications must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_4942">The procedures employed to assess an applicant for naturalisation are as set out in summary form below.  Upon receipt, each application is examined to determine if the statutory application is completed fully.  Incomplete application forms are returned to the applicant for amendment.  Valid applications are then examined to determine if the applicant meets the statutory residency criteria set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.  Passports and other documentation are examined in detail and enquiries with the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also be necessary.  Since this procedure was introduced on 1 April 2005, over 3,500 applicants who applied since that date have been found to be ineligible.  All such applicants are informed of any shortfall in their residency and will be able to reapply when they have the required residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_4943">The next stage of the process involves assessing an applicant's financial status in respect of their ability to support themselves in the State.  Enquiries with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs may be necessary in this regard.  At the same time enquiries are also made with the Garda Síochána to clarify if the applicant can be deemed to be of good character.  There may also be circumstances in individual cases  which require a greater level of investigation than other cases.  Once all enquiries are completed, the file is referred to me for a decision.  The Deputy will appreciate that these processes can take a lengthy time to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_4944">The above procedures have been developed and refined over a number of years and I am satisfied that they are necessary to maintain the integrity of the naturalisation process.  Consequently, there is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_4946">I refer the Deputy to my previous reply to parliamentary question no. 687 dated 26th June 2007 regarding the person in question.  Application was made on 16th May 2007 for a permanent residence card in accordance with EU Treaty Rights. The application was incomplete and it was returned to the applicant in order that he could provide evidence that his spouse is exercising EU Treaty Rights in the State.  The applicant to date has not provided evidence that his spouse is currently residing and exercising EU Treaty Rights within the State.  The application is therefore deemed to be incomplete and cannot be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4947">It is my Department's understanding that the person he is relying upon to exercise his eligibility under EU Treaty Rights no longer resides in the State and accordingly the applicant is ineligible to apply for residency under EU Treaty Rights.  My Department has written to the applicant informing him of this and indicating that he will be issued with a notification under section 3(4) of the Immigration Act, 1999. As an unsuccessful asylum seeker the applicant will be given the opportunity to apply for subsidiary protection and to make representations for permission to remain in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_4971">The Refugee Appeals Tribunal considered the person's appeal, following which the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's earlier recommendation to reject her claim.  The outcome of the appeal was made known to the applicant by letter dated 30 April, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4972">A complete read of the Tribunal's report clearly shows that the member in arriving at his decision to refuse her asylum appeal was fully aware of her country of origin, Angola, which is mentioned no less than 16 times in the text.  A single reference to "Romania" was clearly an unintended typographical error which I am satisfied did not in any way prejudice the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4973">In accordance with normal procedures, the applicant's file was forwarded to my Department for final processing of the Asylum claim.   A letter issued to the person in question on 20 September, 2004 informing her that her asylum claim had been rejected and that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4974">This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.</p>

However the person's circumstances changed in 2002 and a review of his case took place.  Further periods of permission to remain were granted on the basis that the person concerned continued  actively discharging the role of parent to the Irish child and his ongoing compliance with an informal maintenance agreement in place with the mother of the child.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5159">I am aware of the proposal for a Council Framework Decision on certain procedural rights in criminal proceedings throughout the European Union.  The proposal has been before the JHA Council for over three years and an overall consensus has not been reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_5160">A number of Member States, including Ireland, have difficulties of various kinds with the proposal.  Our difficulties have always concerned legal competence and certainty rather than substance.  We are not opposed to effective procedural safeguards.  Indeed Ireland has a comprehensive set of procedural rights in place which exceed those in the current proposal.  Our position, formulated in consultation with the Attorney General, is that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5161">(i) there is no legal base within the Treaties for procedural safeguards and therefore the Union lacks the competence to legislate in this area, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5162">(ii) there is already a set of procedural safeguards enshrined in Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all Member States of the Union are party and over which the European Court of Human Rights has jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_5163">The cited legal base, Article 31(1)(c) of the Treaty of European Union, provides for measures to improve judicial cooperation by ensuring compatibility between Member States' rules as may be necessary for that purpose.  It has never been demonstrated that this measure is necessary for the purpose of judicial cooperation and mutual recognition, as is required by that Article.  Furthermore the proposals which are on the table add nothing to either domestic law or the European Convention on Human Rights.  Bearing this in mind, we are unwilling to accept the risks arising from a potential conflict of jurisdiction between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, increasing complexity for practitioners, and legal uncertainty.</p>
            <p eId="para_5164">Notwithstanding our fundamental objections to the proposal, we have actively supported initiatives to promote improvements in the standard of procedural safeguards throughout the Union.  We have cosponsored a resolution with the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Malta and Slovakia which would promote a package of practical measures to enhance compliance with the existing ECHR standards on procedural rights.  In addition, we indicated our willingness at the JHA Council in April to consider a binding proposal for proceedings with a cross border dimension.  Regrettably the Presidency initiatives which followed sought to encroach on the domestic jurisdiction of Member States through time clauses and other procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5165">This proposal was last discussed at the JHA Council on 12/13 June.  At that time Ireland, and several other Member States, took the view that progress could be achieved by means of the adoption of a political resolution on practical action to implement the ECHR benchmark on procedural rights.  Such an approach would  avoid the potential for legal conflicts between Union law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.  However no agreement was reached. I now await any further proposals from the Presidency on how the matter might be progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_5167">The entitlements of foreign nationals in the State and the conditions applicable to them depend on their immigration status.  A foreign national may be granted permission to remain on the basis of self-sufficiency.  The underlying principle regarding self-sufficiency is that the foreign national who is here on that basis would not need to avail of State funds or State funded services nor would any dependent family member who was allowed enter the State require such State benefits.  If the student child of a parent who is in the State on the basis of self-sufficiency were to be enrolled in a State funded school that would conflict with the principle of self-sufficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5168">In relation to the individual who is the subject of this Parliamentary Question, I understand that he initially presented at Immigration Control at Dublin Airport on the basis that he was coming to the State to study and that his wife and child were availing of a two-week vacation.  However, when questioned by an Immigration Officer it transpired that the family members intended remaining in the State for longer than a short-term vacation and that arrangements had already been made for their daughter to attend a non-fee paying secondary school in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5169">On this basis and having regard to the provisions of the Immigration Act 2004 in relation to the need for foreign nationals to be self-sufficient, the Immigration Officer decided to refuse the application to land in respect of the individual's wife and child.  There was no issue with regard to the individual himself, but he chose not to enter the State without his wife and child.  The situation was fully explained to the individual at the time and was subsequently set out in detail in a letter from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_5170">It is incumbent upon any person embarking on a journey to another jurisdiction to be aware of the conditions of entry to the jurisdiction concerned and, in particular, if he or she is entitled to enter the State for the duration and purpose intended.  In this regard Irish Immigration law, to a significant extent, is similar to that of most other countries including the USA.  The fact that the individual's wife and daughter were refused permission to enter the State on this occasion does not prevent them from making another application for a permission in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_5174">The question of providing an alternative access to the proposed prison site was raised by members of the local community with my predecessor following the purchase of the Thornton Hall site in 2005.  Notwithstanding the fact that the existing access road had been assessed as suitable and of adequate capacity to service the proposed development, it was agreed to afford full consideration to any alternative proposals received.</p>
            <p eId="para_5175">Subsequently, following approaches from local landowners, a viable alternative access route to the site was identified.  In addition to addressing the perceived concerns of local residents in relation to the existing access road, it was recognised that a separate designated access to the site would greatly facilitate the construction phase of the development as well as removing all future traffic generated by the prison complex from the existing local road.  The cost of the lands in question amounts to €1,305,000 for 8.7 acres which equates to €150,000 per acre.  I am pleased that my Department has been able to respond positively to the concerns expressed by local residents.</p>

The proposed scheme will also take into account certain recommendations arising from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) third mutual evaluation report (2006) on Ireland's measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.  The proposals will update current legislation in this area and strengthen Ireland's existing anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legal framework set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_5224">Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, and promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5225">The recent establishment of 12 new Garda Youth Diversion Projects brings the current total to 93 projects operating throughout the country.  This represents significant progress towards fulfilling the pledge made by the Government to increase the number of Garda Youth Diversion Projects in Ireland to 100 by the end of this year.  I am confident that this target is an attainable one.</p>
            <p eId="para_5226">The 12 recently announced projects are based in the following areas, three in Dublin, Store Street, Dublin 1, Brookfield in Tallaght, and Swords, Co Dublin, two in Cork, Douglas and Youghal and one in each of the following areas; Limerick City, Galway City,  Falcarragh, Co Donegal, Portarlington, Co Laois, Drogheda, Co Louth, Tramore, Co Waterford  and Enniscorthy Co. Wexford.  Each of these projects, including the newly established Garda Youth Diversion Project in Galway City, will be provided with an annual budget of €75,000 minimum to provide for their operation costs each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5227">The project on the westside of Galway city to which the Deputy refers was suspended in May 2005 following the withdrawal of the services of the management company funded to operate the project.  Prior to the establishment of another project in the area, an independent evaluation was carried out on behalf of the Garda Commissioner to assess the need for a Garda Youth Diversion Project in the Galway area.  I am pleased to advise you that the new Garda Youth Diversion Project in Galway is to be established in the westside area of Galway City.  This project will be managed by Foróige and a new Project Management Committee has been established.</p>

        <b>Deputy Enda Kenny</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the reason funding was withdrawn for the Irish missing persons helpline which closed in 2005; if he has plans to re-instate funding to enable them to operate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5234">The National Missing Persons Helpline was established in October, 2002.  Initially funding of €65,000 (to include set up costs) was made available by my Department to establish a dedicated National Missing Persons Helpline, to be operated and administered by Victim Support an independent, non-governmental organisation with charitable status.  Further funding of €45,000 was provided to Victim Support to operate the Helpline in 2003.  This funding was in addition to the ongoing funding that the organisation Victim Support received for the provision of services to victims of crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_5235">This funding was provided subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be implied and audited accounts should be provided to my Department on a calendar year basis.  The Missing Persons Helpline operated from the headquarters of Victim Support alongside Victims Support's own helpline for victims of crime.  The Victim Support organisation received financial support from my Department from 1985 to 31 March 2005, during which period € 8.3 million was made available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_5236">In March 2005, my predecessor decided that continued funding of the Victim Support organisation could no longer be justified due to serious concerns in relation to governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels, after a lengthy period of instability within the organisation.  I understand that Victim Support closed down its headquarters operation during 2005 and that a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the Missing Persons Helpline.  My Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support to make a number of its staff redundant, other than to insist that statutory requirements (notice, holiday pay, etc.) be met and that the interests of the staff be protected.  Also in March 2005, my predecessor established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5237">I am informed that funding to support the operation of a missing person's helpline and to provide such ongoing supports as are necessary to operate such a helpline  is being considered by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, on foot of an application to them by Missing in Ireland Support Services (MISS) on the 1st  February, 2007.  The Commission has been in ongoing contact with the Chairperson of MISS over the past months and its Chairperson and a member of the Commission met with representatives of MISS on Wednesday, 20 June 2007 to discuss their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_5238">I am further informed that the Commission are awaiting clarification on a number of issues by MISS before their application can proceed.  It should be borne in mind that the Commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.  I should also point out that the Commission is entirely independent in the performance of its functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment or intervene in any way with a decision taken by the Commission in relation to the allocation of funding.</p>

The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_5247">Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.

It was refused by the Visa Officer on 14th March 2007 for a number of reasons: There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application; no evidence of finances was shown; the applicant had previous visa refusals; and it was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the granting of the visa may result in a cost to public funds and public resources.</p>

The Government decided in September 2001 to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the Commission on Public Service Pensions and to establish a Working Group to advise on implementation, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.  Parallel structures with the same remit were established in the case of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  The operational details of the implementation of the Commission recommendations have been agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the Implementation Working Group and a report from Garda Parallel Working Group.</p>

The Commission also examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for members of An Garda Síochána and others, as part of its deliberations, but having assessed the arguments, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved.</p>

A total of 780 recruits have commenced training in the Garda College since the beginning of 2007 and a new rolling recruitment campaign has just begun — advertisements in relation to it were placed in last Sunday's national newspapers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5327">Specifically in relation to anti-social behaviour, An Garda Síochána are identifying local public order and anti-social behaviour hot spots and developing responsive actions and plans.  The measures outlined in the Programme for Government to tackle anti-social behaviour will be introduced. A number of initiatives for early intervention in anti-social behaviour have begun including improved CCTV systems, warnings from members of An Garda Síochána, good behaviour contracts, the Juvenile Diversions Programmes  and ultimately a behaviour order from the  Children Court. In addition to the foregoing, the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee (JPC) in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.  There are currently 22 committees established as part of a pilot project, with a further seven being established.  It is intended to establish JPCs in all local authority areas by early 2008.  I am convinced that the work of these committees will make a significant contribution to reducing anti-social behaviour.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5405">In May 2006, my predecessor launched the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy and Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs out of Prison. The implementation of this Policy and Strategy has seen an intensification of efforts to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons.  A key part of these efforts is the introduction of mandatory drug testing which will commence across the prison system once the new Prisons Rules are introduced on 1 October, 2007.  Other elements include enhancement of CCTV, introduction of an agreed visitor system, installation of video scope camera systems, installation of facilities for screened visits and enhanced security generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_5406">As regards enhanced security, the Deputy will also be aware that I have recently announced a range of security measures aimed at keeping contraband out of our prisons.  These measures include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5407">the establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 staff and an appropriate number of dogs.  The Deputy will be aware that a pilot drug detection dog service has been in place since 23 May 2006 and is currently running in the Midlands/Portlaoise area, Wheatfield/Cloverhill Prisons and in the Mountjoy complex;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5408">the establishment of an Operational Support Group dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific problem areas;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5409">the introduction of enhanced security screening and searching of all persons (prisoners, visitors and staff) entering our prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5410">Specific developments in the area of drug treatment include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5411">A tender for 24 addiction counsellors to cover all Prisons has been awarded to Merchants Quay Ireland and counsellors are already coming on stream.  This will, in conjunction with other developments, lead to an increase of nearly 1000 hours per week of prisoner access to addiction counselling.  Addiction Counsellors are already in place in some institutions and are expected (subject to successful recruitment) to be in place in all institutions by end 2007.  This service will provide individual and group counselling supporting the range of drug treatment options (detoxification, maintenance etc.) available in the prison system.  This is in addition to the prison based services such as the Psychology Service and Probation Service, as well as the large number of community based groups which provide psycho-social support to drug addicted prisoners.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5412">7 Nurse Officers and 5 Prison Officers have been allocated to Dedicated Drug Treatment Teams in prisons with significant needs; this will improve service quality in prisons which receive a large number of prisoner committals with addictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5413">The Dormant Accounts Fund has provided funding for 4 community groups to provide addiction counselling and support to prisoners while in prison and on release in the community, this will build on their success in becoming drug free in prison when the prisoner returns to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_5414">Additional Consultant Psychiatrist in Addictions and Registrar prisons sessions have been established and resourced, significantly improving the quality, coordination and availability of drug treatment in prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_5415">A Consultant led Infectious Disease Service has been contracted from St James' Hospital to provide treatments to prisoners who suffer from these diseases.  It is hoped to expand this service to other sites, and it is intended that a tender for Dedicated Drug Treatment Pharmacy Services will issue in the coming weeks, again supporting improved quality and availability of treatment services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5416">A counselling psychologist dedicated to drug treatment has been appointed at Mountjoy Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_5417">The imminent introduction of a Nursing Management Structure should greatly streamline the provision of healthcare within prisons specifically in the area of drug treatment where multi-disciplinary team working is critical to success.</p>
            <p eId="para_5418">I am committed to the aim of making all prisons drug free in line with commitments in the Drugs Policy and Strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_5422">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_5423">With regard to both adult and children, a behaviour warning remains in place for three months from date of issue.  With regard to children specifically, a good behaviour contract lasts for six months, but may be renewed for a further three months. The approach which the legislation adopts is to make every effort for the child and his or her parents or guardian to address the child's behavioural problems in a way that minimises contact with the criminal justice system.  The Act ensures that there is full parental involvement at all relevant stages.  It is therefore highly unlikely that a Garda officer would apply for a civil order or a behaviour order before the end of these periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_5424">I am informed by the Garda authorities that 145 behaviour warnings have been issued in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) in the first eight months of 2007.  There was one good behaviour contract issued in the DMR in this period.</p>

These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children, the first step of which is the issue of a behaviour warning by a member of An Garda Síochána, which remains in place for three months from the date of issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5427">A behaviour warning allows the person who is subject of the warning, and where appropriate parents and guardians, to address the behavioural problem which resulted in the warning to be issued, so that the issue of a civil order (in the case of an adult) or a behaviour order (in the case of a child) is not necessary.</p>

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency. This particular long term permission does not grant an exemption from employment permit requirements to any such dependants. Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency. While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residence from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in July 2007.

The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</p>

A mother can now decide how she would like to take the remaining weeks and this can be flexible with regard to mothers of premature babies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5503">The Planning and Development Regulations 2007, which provide exemptions from planning permission requirements in respect of certain classes of micro-renewable technologies for use in the home, came into effect from 28 February 2007. The exemptions apply to solar panels and other micro-renewable technologies such as wind turbines, heat pumps and biomass, subject to certain conditions in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_5504">The exemption in respect of solar panels provides for the installation of up to 12 sq. metres aperture area, or 50% of total roof area, whichever is less. This is subject to conditions that restrict the height of the panel to 15 cms above the plane of a pitched roof or to 50 cms above a flat roof. In addition, the panels must be more than 50 cm from the edge of the roof or wall on which it is mounted. Free-standing solar arrays up to 2 metres in height can also be installed at the side or rear of a house subject to certain conditions.Where householders wish to install solar panels of greater surface area than that allowed under the Regulations, then planning permission should be applied for in the normal way. Planning authorities have been advised that such applications should be considered on their own merits, having regard to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5505">My Department is currently engaged in research into the possible extension of planning exemptions for micro-renewable technologies to such other areas as industrial estates, agricultural sites, and the commercial sector. I expect to be in a position to initiate a consultation process on this issue shortly, with a view to making new Regulations early in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_5507">The Programme for Government provides for a Revision of the Building Regulations to "introduce new national building standards in 2007 to ensure that new housing has 40% lower heat energy demand than existing buildings standards and revise them again in 2010 to achieve a 60% target in further years".</p>
            <p eId="para_5508">In keeping with that commitment, I published draft Building Regulations under Part L of the Building Regulations on 21 September 2007. These draft Regulations provide for a reduction of, on average, at least 40% in primary energy consumption and a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions. In addition, for the first time, the measures will introduce: a minimum requirement for the use of renewable energy sources; energy-efficient boilers; energy-efficient artificial lighting systems; and improved airtightness of the building fabric. The draft Regulations provide for a commencement date of 1 July, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5509">The draft Regulations and associated Technical Guidance Document are now the subject of a public consultation process, which will continue to 26 October, 2007. On completion of the consultation process, all submissions received will be comprehensively assessed and given due consideration prior to finalising new Building Regulations before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5522">Government policy has been informed, over recent years, by a range of reports and recommendations, including three reports on the housing market by Peter Bacon and Associates in the period 1998 to 2000, The National Economic and Social Council report on the housing sector in 2004 and the Sustaining Progress and Towards 2016 Social Partnership agreements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5523">My Department collects and disseminates a wide range of private market and social housing statistics through its quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins. It also produces an index to monitor the impact of changes in house prices, taxation, and interest rates on the affordability of new houses, which is published in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins. In addition, my Department commissions an independent economic assessment by DKM Economic Consultants of construction activity and prospects each year. The latest "Review of the Construction Industry 2006 and Outlook for 2007-2009" was published on 24 September 2007. DKM Economic Consultants also produce a regular update of "Construction Industry Indicators" throughout the year on behalf of my Department.  These provide the most up to date independent assessment of all of the available data on the housing market in terms of both output and prices.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5557">All beverage containers are packaging.  Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life.  Under the Directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.  Practical implementation of the Directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reported in its National Waste Report 2005 — published in January 2007 — that packaging waste recovery increased to 59.9% in that year, indicating that Ireland continues to exceed the current target recovery rate of 50% set by the Packaging Directive.  This compares with a recovery rate of 14.8% in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_5558">The Programme for Government commits the Government to a review of waste management plans, practices and procedures.  I am currently considering the terms of reference for this review including the question of whether it should address the issue of deposit and refund for beverage containers.  At present, the arrangements for recovering packaging waste from consumers and householders consist principally of segregated collections for dry recyclables and an extensive network of bring banks and civic amenity sites.   In considering whether deposit and refund has a role to play, account would have to be taken of the possible impact on existing compliance arrangements and national performance in recovering and recycling packaging waste.</p>

            <p eId="para_5563">Specific state support for the accommodation needs of older people or people with special housing needs ranges from grant schemes which allow people to remain in their homes to the provision of specific sheltered housing options.</p>
            <p eId="para_5564">Both the local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sectors are providing an expanded range of social housing options and a wide range of accommodation types to meet special housing needs, including those in need of sheltered housing with low-level, on-site supports. Sheltered housing usually comprises a group scheme of dwellings with provision for on-site delivery of services to allow for assisted independent living. For most vulnerable groups, interventions in this area generally require an inter-agency response particularly where there is a care dimension to the supports required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5565">My Department's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, sets out a new approach to social housing provision and a new focus on meeting the needs of individual residents by providing them with homes for life in safe and well-planned neighbourhoods.

For older people, grants to adapt their homes to address mobility problems can supplement other supports to enable them to remain living independently in their home for as long as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5570">The final report of the Status of Hares in Ireland — Hare Survey of Ireland 2006/07, is available and may be downloaded from the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department [www.npws.ie/en/media/Media, 5119,en.IWM30].</p>
            <p eId="para_5571">The survey was carried out nationwide over two years and the results confirm that hares are widespread throughout the country.  The national population was estimated at 233,000 hares in 2006 and 535,000 in 2007. The scale of this change between consecutive years reflects the ability of the hare to respond well to favourable breeding conditions and is consistent with recent surveys of the hare populations in Northern Ireland. The drivers for such population fluctuations are poorly understood, but are likely to include an interaction between weather conditions and land management practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_5572">The report also reviews the exploitation of hares through coursing and highlights the significant improvement in hare survival brought about through compulsory muzzling in 1993.  While I am pleased that the improvements made by the Irish Coursing Club are having an effect, the results of the survey highlight the need for further research into the impacts of hare coursing at a local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5573">The Irish Red Data Book for vertebrates was published in 1993 and my Department is at present working with the Environment and Heritage Service of Northern Ireland to prepare an updated version, taking into account recent changes in the IUCN assessment system and the new data gathered for many of Ireland's vertebrate species.</p>

            <p eId="para_5598">There are various legislative provisions applicable to noise nuisance, as well as a number of practical arrangements to reduce the instances of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.</p>
            <p eId="para_5599">Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise.  In the case of a faulty alarm, a local authority may serve a notice under this section.  Where the Council receives a complaint, an advisory letter is issued to the owner/occupier advising of the terms of the current standards for intruder alarms systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_5600">Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.

            <p eId="para_5601">A European Standard for external intruder alarms (EN50131) has replaced all national standards, and incorporates considerably stricter controls, regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms.  The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum duration from the sounding of external alarms in buildings; the alarms must cease automatically after the maximum duration.  This standard has been applied by the National Standards Authority of Ireland for intruder alarms installed by certified installers since 1 March 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_5602">The Private Security Services Act 2004 provided for the establishment of a Private Security Authority to licence, control and supervise all alarm installers of security equipment, and for the Authority to have powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms. I understand that with effect from 1 November 2005, installers of alarms were required to register with the Private Security Authority and with effect from 1 August 2006, installers cannot operate without a licence, the granting of which will require proof that the installer has attained the EN 50131 standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5603">The current European Standard along with improved equipment and the co-operation of the installers certified by the NSAI, should together ensure that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off will be significantly reduced.</p>

In its response the Department raised a number of issues, the primary concern being that any proposed development near the Casino must be fully in sympathy with and should seek to enhance where possible the amenity and setting of the national monument.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">It is also of relevance that provision has been made under my Department's 2007 Fire Service Capital Programme for supporting the modernisation of the Dublin Fire Brigade Training Centre at the O'Brien Institute in Marino which is also adjacent to the Casino. In March of this year, following a detailed capital appraisal by Dublin City Council, my Department gave approval in principle for the Council to prepare and submit a detailed design brief and drawings and the initiation of the planning process for this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">In discussions my Department has advocated the development by the City Council of a conservation plan for the grounds at Marino to create a framework within which issues relating to appropriate development could be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_5611">To assist in the planning process for the medico-legal centre, Dublin City Council applied for Ministerial consent to carry out archaeological test excavations on land in proximity to the Casino. As required under the National Monuments Acts, the Director of the National Museum of Ireland was consulted and raised no objection to the grant of consent in this case. I subsequently granted my consent to Dublin City Council's application for the test excavation programme on 27 August 2007. Conditions were attached to the grant of consent seeking to determine, if possible, the accurate location of certain landscape features formerly associated with the Casino.</p>
            <p eId="para_5612">My Department is of the view that the two proposed developments by the Council should be taken forward on a co-ordinated basis. To this end a further meeting has been arranged between my Department and the Council to discuss the heritage issues arising from both proposals including the desirability and practicalities of the preparation by the City Council of a conservation plan.  In the context of these discussions my Department will continue to seek to ensure that the Casino and its setting are fully protected and enhanced where possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5622">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to agree an all-party approach on climate change targets and, in advance of this, to set a target of a 3% reduction per year on average in Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions over the lifetime of the current Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5623">At this year's Spring meeting of the European Council, EU Heads of State and Government agreed to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% on 1990 levels by 2020. They also committed to a reduction of 30% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 as the EU contribution to a global and comprehensive agreement for the period beyond 2012, provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions, and economically more advanced developing countries adequately contribute to the global response according to their responsibilities and respective capabilities. The Council also agreed that a differentiated approach to the contributions of individual Member States would be used, which takes account of fairness and national circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_5624">In confirming that developed countries should continue to take the lead by committing to collectively reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases in the order of 30% by 2020 compared to 1990, the European Council noted that they should do so with a view to collectively reducing their emissions by 60% to 80% by 2050 compared to 1990.</p>
            <p eId="para_5625">Given the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions required by 2050, I consider that it is important to develop a broad national consensus on longer-term targets to reduce Ireland's emissions. I envisage that an all-party approach to considering and agreeing such targets is appropriate. This process will take place over a period of time and I am open to considering the mechanisms by which such agreement may be found, including the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas group.</p>

            <p eId="para_5633">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the setting of new ambitious waste management targets for maximum prevention, re-use, recycling and modern waste treatment to ensure that we match the best performance in the EU for recycling with the objective that only 10% of waste or less is consigned to landfill.</p>
            <p eId="para_5634">This will require significant further improvements in diverting municipal waste from landfill. So far national reliance on landfill has fallen from 91% in 1998 to 65% in 2005. The principal factors underpinning progress in diversion of waste from landfill have been the provision of financial support for bring banks and recycling centres, successful Producer Responsibility Initiatives in areas such as packaging waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), the extension of segregated collections for dry recyclable material to larger numbers of households and awareness-raising through campaigns such as Race Against Waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_5635">A key factor in making further progress will be the successful implementation of the National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste, published in April 2006. In 2004, almost three quarters of municipal (household and commercial) waste sent to landfill was biodegradable. The Strategy sets out measures aimed at the separate collection, recovery and recycling of biodegradable waste with a view to achieving the progressive diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill by 2016 to 35% of the amount of biodegradable municipal waste generated in the baseline year of 1995. Interim targets for the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste to 75% and 50% of baseline levels are to be achieved by 2010 and 2013 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_5636">The review of regional waste management plans provided for in the Programme for Government should also better equip Ireland to achieve these ambitious targets and ultimately to progress to a situation where a maximum of 10% of waste is consigned to landfill. My Department is carefully considering the form which this review of waste management planning should take. It is important that the review is properly structured so as to make a lasting contribution to the manner in which Ireland undertakes waste management planning and the achievement of international best practice in this area, while meeting challenging national objectives and EU requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_5651">My Department reviews the effectiveness of the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2003 on an ongoing basis.  Local authorities submit data to my Department every six months on their anti-litter enforcement actions under the Acts.

            <p eId="para_5662">I presume that the Deputy is referring to the requirements on farmers arising from the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5663">The EU Nitrates Directive aims to protect all waters against pollution from agricultural sources.  Particular care is required for the protection of public health in the case of waters which serve as the source of drinking water.  The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006, implement the Directive in Ireland and provide statutory support for good agricultural practice to protect waters against pollution. These Regulations were developed in close consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, and Teagasc, and are supported by an enhanced package of financial supports for farmers, together with cross-compliance systems operated by that Department.  Significant funding is being provided under that Department's Farm Waste Management Scheme to support investment by farmers to meet the requirements of the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5664">The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 contain appropriate and necessary provisions to allow for verification by the relevant authorities of compliance with the Regulations. These largely standard provisions allow for matters such as the entry to premises by an authorised person with the consent of the occupier or, for example, where there is a significant immediate risk to the environment, by court order; the inspection of premises; the taking of samples and other matters considered essential to ensure compliance with, and to support implementation of, the Regulations. Similar provisions are to be found in environmental legislation generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_5665">I believe that these measures relating to the agricultural sector, together with a range of other measures I propose to take in relation to waste water and other discharges to water, will result in higher standards of water quality over the coming years in line with the overall objectives of the Water Framework Directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_5674">In March of this year the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government hosted a meeting of Environment Ministers from Iceland, Norway and Austria. They were joined by the Parliamentary State Secretary of the Environment for Germany, who also participated in the discussions on shared concerns in relation to nuclear energy, and its future role particularly in the context of climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">The Ministerial Statement after the meeting declared that, while it remains the sovereign right of each country to decide on its energy mix, there were shared serious concerns that nuclear energy is being presented as a solution to climate change. The Ministers said "It is our collective view that the current debate seeks to downplay the environmental, waste, proliferation, nuclear liability and safety issues and seeks to portray nuclear energy as a clean, safe and problem free response to climate change. The inherent risks and problems associated with the nuclear energy option remain and it can not therefore claim to be a clean alternative to fossil fuel."</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">The Ministerial Statement also referred to the risks associated with the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, and to the planned reopening of the THORP Plant. The Ministers called on the UK Government to desist from reopening it, requesting that, at a minimum, the safety case for such reopening be subject to an international expert peer review.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">It was agreed that the Dublin meeting had been very productive and worthwhile, and that a further meeting of the Ministers and other interested States would take place in Vienna in the autumn of 2007.

            <p eId="para_5699">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1123, 1160 and 1165 together. Details of the revised housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability were announced in February 2007 as part of the Government's new housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5700">Three new schemes are to be introduced: a Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, a Mobility Aids Grant, and a Housing Aid for Older People Grant.  The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability will assist in the provision-adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of people with a disability.  Under the new scheme, the grant will be increased from the current effective maximum of €20,320 to a maximum of €30,000, which may cover up to 95% of the cost of works.  The Mobility Aids Grant Scheme will provide grants to cover a basic suite of works to address mobility problems, primarily but not exclusively, associated with ageing.  The maximum grant available will be €6,000 and may cover 100% of the cost of works.</p>
            <p eId="para_5701">The Housing Aid for Older People scheme, which will provide targeted support to improve conditions in the existing housing of older people, amalgamates the provisions of the existing Essential Repairs and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly grant schemes. The maximum grant available will be €10,500 and may cover 100% of the cost of works.</p>
            <p eId="para_5702">Under the revised framework, the grant levels will increase annually in line with the building cost index, thus protecting the value of the grants into the future. It is expected that the revised schemes will come into operation later this year.  The existing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability will continue to operate until the new schemes become effective.</p>

            <p eId="para_5709">The general purpose allocation from the Local Government Fund allocated to Meath County Council for 2007 is some €28.6 million.

            <p eId="para_5710">I consider that the Council's general purpose allocation for 2007, together with the income available to it from other sources such as commercial rates, charges for services and grants for specific purposes, will enable it to provide an acceptable level of services to its customers.

In addition to this, a further discount of €3,809 is provided.  Thus, a local authority house with a market value of €140,000 would be available for purchase at some €94,200 by a tenant of ten or more years' standing.  By any account, this is a generous discount.</p>
            <p eId="para_5713">The proceeds of the sale of local authority houses to tenants are used to part-fund improvements to, and planned maintenance programmes in, the local authority housing stock.

While I have no proposals to amend the financial terms of the current scheme, I will continue to keep them under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5779">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1150, 1151, 1153, 1155 and 1167 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5780">The national Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of houses. The related Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations. Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the builder and the owner of the building.</p>
            <p eId="para_5781">Part C/TGD-C of the Regulations set out the legal requirements/technical guidance for Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture. Part C stipulates "the floors, walls and roof of a building shall be so designed and constructed as to prevent the passage of moisture to the inside of the building". The Regulations also require that " the hardcore bed should be at least 150mm thick and should be of broken stones, broken brick or similar suitable material well compacted and clean and free from matter liable to cause damage to concrete".</p>
            <p eId="para_5782">Part D/TGD-D of the Regulations set out the legal requirements/technical guidance for Materials and Workmanship. It requires that "all works to which these Regulations apply shall be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner". Proper materials are defined as "materials which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used".</p>
            <p eId="para_5783">Under the European Communities (Construction Products) Regulations, 1992, as amended by the European Communities (Construction Products) (Amendments) Regulations, 1994, a product is defined as "any construction product to which these Regulations apply which is produced for incorporation in a permanent manner in works". The Regulations require that "a person shall not place a product, other than a minor product, on the market unless it has such characteristics that the works in which it is to be incorporated, assembled, applied or installed can, if properly designed and built, satisfy the essential requirements when, where and to the extent that such works are subject to regulations containing such requirements". In the case of hardcore filling, the relevant Regulations are the Building Regulations highlighted above.</p>
            <p eId="para_5784">Enforcement of the Building Regulations is the function of the thirty-seven local Building Control Authorities in the State. In this instance, I understand that the relevant Building Control Authority, Fingal County Council, has been in direct contact with the developers and the quarry concerned to ascertain the full extent of the problem and to ensure that there is no further use of this material for house building.</p>
            <p eId="para_5785">Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body in the matter, my Department, on 16 August 2007, issued a Circular Letter BC 6/2007 to each County Manager and local Building Control Authority with a view to bringing the issue to their notice and requesting their co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements. This Circular letter also brings to their attention a Notice Issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_5786">I understand that, in relation to appropriate protocols for testing underfloor infill material, the National Standards Authority for Ireland is giving urgent consideration to publication of additional guidance on this issue, whether by way of a new standard, amendment to an existing standard or a standard recommendation, as found appropriate. It is my intention to adopt any recommendation of the NSAI in this regard, when available, in the relevant Technical Guidance Document to the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5787">In relation to compensation, this is a matter between a homeowner, the relevant developer and the latter's insurer, whether that is Homebond or another insurer. Consequently, I have no function in this regard.</p>

Although voters must sign a declaration of identity which accompanies the ballot paper in the presence of a witness (who is personally known to them in the case of university voters or a specified witness in the case of panel voters), there is no specific provision in Seanad electoral law with regard to assistance for voters with a visual impairment.  While electoral law is subject to on-going review, there are no proposals at present to alter the existing arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_5794">On publication of the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 on 17 September 2007, I outlined the measures being taken by my Department, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, to develop a systematic and accelerated response to the cryptosporidium risk, as well as to persistent E-Coli failures, in public water supplies. These measures include a new contingency funding arrangement to deal with priority infrastructural upgrades.</p>
            <p eId="para_5795">My Department and the EPA are examining the latest drinking water quality results with a view to cataloguing those supplies at greatest risk from cryptosporidium and also supplies that are subject to continuing E-Coli or other chemical exceedences. This analysis is expected to be completed within the next few months.  The objective is to develop an action programme that identifies an appropriate solution in each case.  This may involve, <i>inter alia</i>, abandoning or replacing sources, upgrading treatment facilities or improving operational and maintenance arrangements.  The contingency funding arrangement will apply where infrastructural works are urgently required that have not already been provided for in the current or previous phases of my Department’s Water Services Investment Programme.  The EPA will oversee implementation of any necessary remedial actions as part of its enhanced supervisory function under the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations (No.2), 2007 (S.I. No. 278 of 2007).</p>
            <p eId="para_5796">In the immediate term, local authorities have been asked by my Department to review the operation of all water treatment plants (and associated infrastructure) to ensure that the installation of continuous chlorine alarms and turbidity meters at appropriate locations at the treatment plant or in the distribution network (including at reservoirs) is progressed without delay.  Authorities have also been asked promptly to complete and return an amended Cryptosporidium Risk Assessment to be issued shortly by the EPA.  Reliable risk profiling of individual schemes will become available following completion of the joint Departmental/EPA examination referred to above and submission of amended Cryptosporidium Risk Assessments by all local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5820">Over the years, the Government has committed significant resources, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), to assessing the incidence of radon throughout the country, to creating enhanced public awareness of radon and to highlighting the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5821">Since the 1990's the RPII has also carried out a nationwide survey of radon in domestic dwellings; it has issued almost 120,000 radon measurement detectors (this is just RPII activity and does not include any private sector services on radon); it has undertaken measurements in almost 33,000 houses, more than 3,800 schools (in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science) and about 2,250 workplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_5822">There is a summary of the results, on a county basis, of the radon measurements carried out in houses up to end December 2006 available on the RPII website (www.rpii.ie). About 13% of houses measured were above the Reference Level where remediation works would be recommended.</p>
            <p eId="para_5823">The RPII consistently urges householders and others, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon, and where necessary, to undertake remediation works.</p>
            <p eId="para_5824">Government efforts and resources, together with those of the RPII, will continue to focus on enhancing public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial works effectively and economically.</p>

            <p eId="para_5826">Section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that planning authorities may apply to the High Court for authorisation to refuse to grant planning permission to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with the conditions of a previous permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5827">This power was significantly strengthened in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which effectively reverses the burden of proof in relation to the refusal of planning permission to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.  Under the amended provisions, the authority may refuse permission in such a case and the developer will have to go to the High Court if he or she wishes to apply to have this decision annulled.  I am satisfied that planning authorities now have very substantial powers to compel the completion of housing estates by developers in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.</p>

            <p eId="para_5831">The Government is firmly committed to the development of an Irish biofuels market and to the development and deployment of bioenergy generally in Ireland.  A range of initiatives is already in place to support the development of the biofuels sector.  The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes are geared towards those producing biofuel.  The second Scheme runs until 2010.   We are focusing now on non-fiscal measures which will increase the market penetration of Biofuels.  The planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation by 2009, will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">The Bioenergy Action Plan sets out a series of cross-Governmental and inter-agency actions to support the development and deployment of bioenergy in Ireland, including measures aimed at encouraging farmers to grow energy crops.   In formulating the plan, it was agreed that while excise relief is an effective short-term measure to stimulate the biofuels market, other policy initiatives, such as a renewables obligation, would be beneficial in the longer-term.  The obligation will also give all market players the necessary long-term certainty to make appropriate investment decisions.   The move to a biofuels obligation and our ambitious targets, will jointly create opportunities for the farming community to diversify into energy crops.  The Programme for Government underlines our commitment to maximise the potential of bioenergy crops.</p>
            <p eId="para_5833">My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who has responsibility for incentivising the production of energy crops, has already put measures in place that are designed to encourage the growing of energy crops.</p>

            <p eId="para_5835">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector. Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5836">The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services, by competing private sector service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5837">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government. In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).</p>
            <p eId="para_5838">Despite these Government initiatives there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is underway. The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5839">The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four Candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting Candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process. The Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter. This timeline is subject to negotiations with Candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5843">The Programme for Government has set targets of 15% of gross electricity consumption from renewable energy sources by 2010 rising to 33% by 2020 which exceeds the targets set out in the EU Renewable Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5844">The Government has already introduced a range of measures to incentivise the development and deployment of renewable sources of energy.  These include the Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) Scheme, the mineral oil tax exemption scheme, the Greener Homes Bioheat and CHP Support Programmes, and support for RTDI in renewable technology together with funding for a range of work by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).</p>
            <p eId="para_5845">At least €270 million will be invested under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 through Sustainable Energy Programmes and Schemes overseen by SEI, as part of investments and support measures of over €670 million in renewable technologies. We are also supporting research projects to develop the use of agriculture products in the biofuels sector as well as energy crops and wood energy.  Strategic planning and investment in electricity infrastructure has, as a key priority, the accommodation of renewable energy growth.  EirGrid's Grid Development Strategy 2007-2025 will fully reflect this priority.  The Strategy will also be informed by the All-Island Grid Study, which is currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_5846">A target of 15% approximates to 1650MW.  Currently Ireland has over 1000MW of renewable capacity connected.  This consists of approximately 793MW of wind powered plant, approximately 234MW of hydro powered plant with the balance (circa 34MW) made up of different biomass technologies.  The additional new capacity required to achieve the target will be delivered by projects already selected under the previous AER V and AER VI competitions and the REFIT programme.  The longer term prospects for renewable energy are excellent as is exemplified by the fact that currently there is over 3,500MW of renewable generation in the grid connection application process, the vast bulk of which is wind generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_5856">I issued a press release on 3rd September last announcing that Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme had fulfilled all of its initial objectives and surpassed its targets ahead of schedule. My Department's website was updated accordingly.  Sustainable Energy Ireland's website was also updated on that day with information on the scheme and all suppliers were notified directly by SEI.  Dissemination of the details on Greener Homes was by way of leaflets for Phase I and was made available to all applicants.  A similar approach will be adopted for Phase II.</p>
            <p eId="para_5857">The number of approved applications for the technology referred to by the Deputy is 4,517 of which 1,830 have already been paid and 2,687 have received a Letter of Offer but have not yet submitted a claim for payment.  The first phase of the scheme achieved all of its objectives ahead of time and within budget.  To ensure a steady market development the grant levels are being reduced for some technologies including the technology in question, where it is considered that the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.  Other grant levels remain unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_5858">The objective in Greener Homes Phase II is to consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly in a robust manner and that consumers continue to be guided towards discerning choices. Continuing the scheme will help secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and stable growth across the renewable heating industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_5859">The new building regulations announced last week by my colleague, John Gormley T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, will mandate the use of renewable heating systems in all new buildings which should provide a further boost to the development of these technologies.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5868">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1183, 1184, 1202, 1206 and 1207 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5869">The Greener Homes Scheme has been hugely successful since its launch in March 2006, with 16,000 grants approved since its inception.  The aim of this scheme was to stimulate demand for renewable heat technologies in homes.  The demand is clear and the sector is now on a firm footing.  Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme has delivered in 18 months what was originally envisaged as a five-year programme and all of the €47m budget is now committed.  Since Phase I was launched, the number of registered renewable energy installers has increased dramatically and there has been a ten-fold increase in products available on the Irish market.  This clearly demonstrates the very significant level of market development since the scheme was first launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_5870">The first phase of the scheme has achieved all of its objectives speedily and within budget.  Consequently, the grant levels are being reduced for some technologies where it is clear that the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.  Other grant levels remain unchanged.  Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme was concluded on Monday 3 September and is closed for applications from that date.  There will be a pause of 28 days ahead of Phase II being launched on 1st October.</p>
            <p eId="para_5871">The overall level of funding for Phase II of the Greener Homes Scheme will be decided in the context of the 2008 Estimates and Budget process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5872">The Greener Homes programme is aimed specifically at the renewable heat sector.  The House of Tomorrow programme delivered by Sustainable Energy Ireland has been providing support to developers of new housing, both private and social, to encourage the incorporation of a suite of significantly higher than normal energy efficiency and renewable energy features in their developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5873">Funding support under the first phase of this programme was typically at up to €8,000 per unit, subject to an energy and CO2 performance of at least 40% better than required under existing Building Regulations.  Influenced by the success of that programme, my colleague John Gormley T.D., Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced the revised building regulations that will strengthen the mandatory energy performance provisions in law for new housing by 40% and which will require renewable heating technologies to be used in all new buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5874">Having fully, achieved its objectives, the first phase of the House of Tomorrow programme has now been closed.  However, we need to continue this process of innovating and improving housing standards further still, to contribute to national policy targets.  A second phase of the House of Tomorrow programme will be launched in the near future, under which funding will be available for developments delivering a 60% energy performance improvement over current regulations — equating to around a 20% further improvement over the new regulations.  This next cycle of projects will provide vital learning and experience to inform and accelerate the introduction of even higher mandatory standards in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5875">The level of grants support in the upgraded programme has yet to be finalised, but will be related to the degree of innovation and energy performance being pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_5876">Both the White Paper on Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government commit to developing Ireland's clear and undoubted potential for distributed generation, including micro-generation, as a long term alternative and supplement to the existing centralised energy distribution system. My Department is already working with all relevant agencies including Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, to put in place the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices to underpin the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies.  The question of grant aid for domestic wind turbines will be considered as part of this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5878">The €25m Salmon Hardship Scheme adopted by Government is intended to provide a measure of relief to individuals in line with the level of hardship likely to be experienced on foot of the cessation of mixed stock fishing for wild salmon.  The overall sum takes account of the levels of payment recommended by the Independent Group, based on the recorded catch history of the eligible licensees.    The scheme is being administered by BIM and applicants, who have been notified of their entitlements, have until the 31 December 2007 to take up the offer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5880">The Regional Fisheries Boards and the Marine Institute are closely monitoring wild salmon stocks on a river by river basis with a view to identifying the extent of stock recovery, if any, arising from the cessation of the harvesting of salmon and any stock rehabilitation works undertaken.</p>

Indiscriminate or mixed stock interception of salmon at sea will not be permitted in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_5889">The use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. Furthermore, the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government make it clear that the Government fully intends to maintain this statutory prohibition on nuclear generation in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5890">This prohibition does not include the importation of electricity generated by nuclear energy.  Legal advice received by the Department states that such a prohibition would be in breach of Article 28 of the EC Treaty which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect between Member States. I am therefore advised that a prohibition on the importation via interconnection of electricity generated with the use of nuclear energy would be highly unlikely to have a legal justification even if it were technically feasible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5891">It is not technically possible to guarantee that electricity imported over an interconnector is not generated from nuclear sources as it is not physically possible to prevent the flow of nuclear generated electricity onto the network.  Nor is it possible to distinguish the flow of electricity across interconnectors by reference to the original source of supply/generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_5893">The Programme for Government has set targets of 15% of gross electricity consumption from renewable energy sources by 2010 rising to 33% by 2020 which exceeds the targets set out in the EU Renewable Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5894">The Government has already introduced a range of measures to incentivise the development and deployment of renewable sources of energy.  These include the Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) Scheme, the mineral oil tax exemption scheme, the Greener Homes Bioheat and CHP Support Programmes, and support for RTDI in renewable technology together with funding for a range of work by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).</p>
            <p eId="para_5895">At least €270 million will be invested under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 through Sustainable Energy Programmes and Schemes overseen by SEI, as part of investments and support measures of over €670 million in renewable technologies. We are also supporting research projects to develop the use of agriculture products in the biofuels sector as well as energy crops and wood energy.  Strategic planning and investment in electricity infrastructure has, as a key priority, the accommodation of renewable energy growth.  EirGrid's Grid Development Strategy 2007-2025 will fully reflect this priority.  The Strategy will also be informed by the All-Island Grid Study, which is currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_5896">A target of 15% approximates to 1650 MW.  Currently Ireland has over 1000 MW of renewable capacity connected.  This consists of approximately 793 MW of wind powered plant, approximately 234 MW of hydro powered plant with the balance (circa 34 MW) made up of different biomass technologies.  The additional new capacity required to achieve the target will be delivered by projects already selected under the previous AER V and AER VI competitions and the REFIT programme.  The longer term prospects for renewable energy are excellent as is exemplified by the fact that currently there is over 3,500 MW of renewable generation in the grid connection application process, the vast bulk of which is wind generation.</p>

We will undertake a series of consultations later this year with stakeholders on the specific details of the scheme and this will be followed by the introduction of appropriate legislation.  We have set 2009 as the date for introduction of the obligation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5910">The 2005 pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels has resulted in eight projects being awarded excise relief for a two-year period under the scheme.  The Biofuels Mineral Oil Tax (MOT) Relief Scheme II was introduced in 2006, valued at over €200m.  Under this scheme sixteen projects have been awarded excise relief to the period 2010.  The scheme will enable us to reach an initial target of over 2% market penetration of biofuels by 2008.  As a result of this scheme, biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets.</p>

            <p eId="para_5913">Actions to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector will be set out in the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, which I am publishing for public consultation very shortly.  The Action Plan will set out details of current and planned initiatives taken to achieve a 20% reduction in energy demand across the whole economy by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_5914">The revised Building Regulations will lead to a 40% improvement in the energy performance of houses built to the new standard compared to the existing standard. This was made possible by the House of Tomorrow Programme run by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  That Programme has, for a number of years, been preparing the house building sector for higher energy performance requirements.  Having achieved its objective, the next step is to prepare the market for even higher energy performance requirements, leading in a relatively short number of years to zero carbon housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_5915">Other critical actions on energy efficiency in the residential sector include raising awareness and achieving real behavioural change through the Power of One campaign and the Programme for Government commitment to have smart meters installed in all homes throughout the country.  We have other challenges to overcome in the transport sector and other sectors of the economy, which will be highlighted in the Energy Efficiency Action Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_5916">I expect the full range of our actions in the residential sector to contribute more than half of the energy savings required to achieve our 20% savings target for 2020.  We will also introduce in 2008 a new support measure to ensure improved insulation in peoples homes as proposed in the Programme for Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_5922">Energy Research and Innovation is a key part of both the Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy 2006-2013 and the National Development Plan, reflecting the vital importance of the energy sector and the imperative to deliver sustainable, competitive and secure energy supplies for the economy and society.  Our ambitious targets for renewable energy and climate change as reflected in the Programme for Government require a step change in research and innovation in the energy research sphere.</p>
            <p eId="para_5923">The National Development Plan makes provision for investment of €149m in energy research over the period to 2013.  The investment will be underpinned by an energy research strategy for the medium to long term, which delivers on Ireland's strengths and tackles specific national priorities, while ensuring that Ireland benefits from international energy research and innovation.  The Energy Policy Framework commits to the development of a comprehensive energy research strategy, which will be finalised by end year under the auspices of the Irish Energy Research Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_5924">In line with the Programme for Government, particular priority will be given to R&amp;D on renewable technologies, including biomass, ocean, solar and wind.  Other key energy research priority areas in the Energy Policy Framework include energy efficiency in transport, the built environment and industry, electricity storage projects and grid integration for renewables.  The National BioEnergy Action Plan also highlights R&amp;D priorities for second generation biofuels and research forestry and energy crops.</p>
            <p eId="para_5925">The development of a national energy research capability has already been identified as an area for priority attention. Awards made to date under the Charles Parsons scheme will progressively develop energy research capacity across all disciplines in third level institutions across the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_5926">Detailed research priorities and further design of schemes and programmes will be pursued as the energy research strategy is developed with the Irish Energy Research Council.  The Programme for Government also commits to amending the remit of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) to include a third research pillar in the area of sustainable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and discussions are under way with SFI accordingly.</p>

            <p eId="para_5936">Last year, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) directed Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which determines the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network. The new policy allows for the appraisal of a new town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns. Having regard to this new policy I am informed that, BGÉ is carrying out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network. The review is being carried out in three Phases, the second Phase of which is currently under way.</p>
