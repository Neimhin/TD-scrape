It is proposed that we suspend at 10.30 a.m.  It was hoped that we would resume at 6 p.m. but as there is a difficulty, we will resume at 7 p.m. and continue until 8.30 p.m.  We will return immediately after the vote and make good progress I hope thereafter.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I move amendment No. 240:
In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"PART 14CRIMINAL LAW CODIFICATION ADVISORY COMMITTEE163.—There stands established a body, which shall be known as the Criminal Law Codification Advisory Committee and is in this Part referred to as the "Committee", to perform the functions assigned to it by this Act.".By way of background, the programme for Government included a commitment to codify all substantive criminal laws in a single crimes Act.  As a first step in fulfilling that commitment, I established an expert group on the codification of criminal law in January 2003 to consider possible approaches to codification and advise on the scope and extent of such approaches, in particular to identify areas where the group considered codification might give rise to policy difficulties.  In the report entitled, Codifying the Criminal Law, published in November 2004, the expert group outlined the overall structure and style of a criminal code and recommended that codification be undertaken on a phased basis, using the tools of restatement, consolidation and law reform in developing and maintaining the code.In emphasising the need for long-term commitment to the codification project the expert group recommended that a new committee to oversee the codification project be established on a statutory basis.  The Government accepted that recommendation and I decided to make provision in this Bill for the establishment of a new committee which is to be called the criminal law codification advisory committee.  The expert group distinguished the additional functions and responsibilities of the proposed committee as compared with, for example, the Company Law Review Group, a statutory body, in terms of the law reform involved and the potential complexity of the policy issues likely to arise.  I understand the Company Law Review Group is now on the cusp of producing a single statute for all Irish company law, which will be a huge undertaking.  Its chairman, Dr. Thomas Courtney, and his group have done fantastic work on what will be a huge achievement.  The Bill should go through the drafting and legislative process this autumn.Additional challenges will need to be considered by the codification advisory committee, not least because of a number of failed attempts at codification in other common law jurisdictions.  For example, in the 1860s an attempt was made to codify English criminal law which resulted in a very good code being drawn up.  However, it was set aside because Irish politics cut across English government in the 1870s.  More recently the United Kingdom made another attempt but has run into obstacles.  For this reason the committee will require the necessary administrative and research support to undertake and complete the project.Two parallel support mechanisms will be made available to the codification advisory committee.  There will be a permanent secretariat provided by my Department and a research support function, in the form of a codification research support unit, which will be sited in a third level institution.  In the latter regard, the Department will shortly invite expressions of interest from third level institutions prepared to establish the unit.  I expect the larger universities to be asked to express a view on the matter.  The detailed research tasks to be undertaken by the unit will be a matter for decision by the codification advisory committee as the project evolves.  In the main, it will involve making available the necessary research expertise to support the codification advisory committee in carrying out the functions assigned to it in the Bill.  I would like to see the unit established by the autumn.The amendment provides for the establishment of the codification advisory committee on a statutory basis as recommended by the expert group.  In the meantime, however, I am giving consideration to the question of the membership of the advisory committee which, in keeping with the recommendations of the expert group, will be drawn from key centres of criminal law expertise within the legal community.  I would also be interested in any suggestions members of this committee may have in that regard.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The idea is a good one and I support it because it will be helpful in the future, although I do not underestimate the size of the job involved.  The historical perspective is helpful.  I am not entirely clear, however, why it is necessary to establish the committee on a statutory basis.  What are the advantages of doing so?  Will the committee have a limited lifespan, at the end of which it will be functus officio?  I do not necessarily object to it being established on a statutory basis.The historical account of the Irish problem in the 1860s was interesting.  What obstacles were met in the United Kingdom as it embarked on a similar project recently?  Is there a danger we could run into the same obstacles and is there anything we can do to overcome them?  To borrow racing parlance, is there anything we can do to vault the fences?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is an interesting topic.  On the reason the codification advisory committee should be placed on a statutory basis, the Company Law Review Group was established under Mr. James Gallagher under a previous Government but it ran into the sand because the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had limited drafting resources.  It was asked to review consumer credit Acts and European legislation, etc., but the project was put on the back burner.  Since the procedure has been changed and we have moved to having a statutory committee, a group of people who are working on the project are publicly obliged to be supported.  Effectively, it becomes too embarrassing for a Department not to do the work involved if a committee is placed on a statutory basis, as people may wonder what happened to a project.  If an annual report is required——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is.  As recent events show, if emergency legislation must be introduced and draftsmen are needed in a Department, it may take months to get around the problem they are dealing with when the draftsmen must drop their pens and tackle the emergency legislation.I mentioned Dr. Thomas Courtney's group in comparison with Mr. James Gallagher's group.  It has been placed on a statutory basis and must report every year.  It must maintain its momentum.  If, on the other hand, a consultative committee is established and left, so to speak, in the bottom drawer of a desk in the Department, meets once in a blue moon or when inspired to do so, it will rapidly go off the rails and the idea will sink.The expert group considered the extent of codification in the United Kingdom.  It came to the view that, as happened in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the best action to take was to deal with substantive law and put aside for another day any effort to codify the law relating to criminal evidence, criminal procedure, sentencing, etc.  If one was living in a perfect world, such law would be codified also, with the rules against hearsay evidence in criminal trials or exceptions being stated.  They would all be laid out in a long treatise.The net was laid too wide in the United Kingdom and I do not state this to be critical.  It dealt with the procedure issue.  It is a bog and one will sink if one tries to deal with it.  A relevant crimes Act in Canada codifies the law on murder, assault, kidnapping, theft, etc.  Once we go down the road of using the term "constitutionally obtained evidence", indicating who would speak first and last in a jury trial, how one should panel a jury, etc., it will become a bog.  Perhaps another generation will try to codify it.  If we can start with substantive law, we will do a good job.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	7	In principle, I strongly support the objective, which is major.  From my reading of the amendment the Minister has tabled and his contribution this morning, it does not appear to be a once-off, with the committee having a timeline.  It is a permanent quango, although I do not use the term in a negative sense.  It will be a permanent institution which will be given a work programme every two years.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	8	On Deputy O'Keeffe's point of having a timeline, even if the committee gets this done chapter by chapter and builds a structured code, it will be like the Forth rail bridge.  It will have to work on the first bit again while still looking to finish it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Repainting before it is finished.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	10	That is the truth.  There will be developments in law.  It is a permanent task to keep it up to date.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It will be a permanent structure.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That is what is envisaged in the amendments.  If it pans out in the way the Minister envisages, we must have more detail on how it will be constructed.  It will not be an ad hoc committee, with a timeline.  The choices we make should be a little more inclusive than what the Minister proposes in amendment No. 165, where the membership and its number will be determined by the Minister, without having regard to the views of this committee, for example.  The categories in the Minister’s mind might differ from those in the mind of any subsequent Minister.  There should be a broader remit in terms of who will shape the work programme, other than the Minister himself.My final point is that it does not sound as if it will be a cheap process.  Will salaries be paid?  Has a budget line been provided, or will there be one this year?  What scale of annual expenditure is envisaged?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Some €100,000 has been provided in the Estimates for this year.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	14	That will not go too far in lawyers' fees.  They might open a file.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is not envisaged that it will be a full-time body.  I do not know if Dr. Courtney and his colleagues receive an honorarium, but it is envisaged that they will largely be engaged in pro bono work.  With regard to company law, one would have to search to find patriotic people willing to do this work.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	16	They would have to be patriotic and competent.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Undoubtedly, many will leave that impression.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	18	If it turned into a cash cow, a chapter would be produced every ten years.  It would turn into a cul-de-sac.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	19	What will the Minister offer a third level institute?  Will it just be the glory of doing this?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Finance will also be offered.  Once there is an agreement — it will not happen in this financial year — significant funding will be given from the Department's research budget.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	21	On Deputy Howlin's last point, is it envisaged that there will be a full-time director?  There would surely have to be one bright person who could direct matters in the committee.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The model we propose to follow, with the exception of the third level institution, is that of the Company Law Review Group.  It has a secretariat furnished from the parent Department.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	23	It is not a permanent entity.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is, for which I claim credit.  The Deputy may recall that I produced a report on company law enforcement and compliance.  Mr. James Gallagher's group failed because other people's priorities did not coincide.  It was on foot of the report produced by me that the group was placed on a statutory basis.  It is a permanent statutory group which reports every year.  The justification was that Ireland needed a top corporate law structure.  It needed company law which would attract American and other foreign investors.  Lawyers could study the Act rather than rummage through a series of Acts and European regulations to try to work out the system.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	25	What about the other question relating to membership and democratisation of the process?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will come back to the committee on the matter of membership.  One could say there should be three men and three women, for example, or specify that two should come from higher education or be practising lawyers, but there is a requirement for flexibility.  It is a fair point.  I will come back to the committee when there is more time, either later in the summer or early in the autumn, and lay out my precise plans.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	27	It is probably the loosest formula I have seen to create a body.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	28	It is pretty loose, I agree.  On the other hand, if, for instance, UCD were the location of the unit there could be a very brilliant person in Trinity College who we would want to put on the committee.  I need a degree of flexibility to get an effective group.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The flexibility the Minister possesses sees that he may appoint any number of people to do as he determines.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I am referring to the key centres of legal expertise.  There could be a brilliant official in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, or there might not, but I do not want to commit to someone from that office automatically taking a place on this body.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	31	That is the example of the moment.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I do not want to criticise any office.  I am merely saying there may be a person there ideal for this or there may not be.  The ideal person may have other commitments.  I do not want to put a highly structured committee in place and then find that it does not work.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The idea is to have a committee and I would like to see the best and brightest do their bit for the country from that point of view.  There will also be a secretariat within the Department.  Is that everything?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I envisage there will be a centre of excellence in a third level institution and we will pay a substantial portion of the salary of the director of the centre of excellence.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Three different units will be involved.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I do not want to cast something in stone permanently only to find that it does not work.  I could establish a highly complex model on paper only to find it did not work, the Department did not service it properly and so on.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	37	One concern is who will drive this committee.  I hope a good chairperson will do this, but if that person is very talented he or she will probably be very busy.  Will the chairman have time to drive it forward or will it be necessary to have a director in the middle to pull it all together.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	38	There will be a high-power committee of experts and it will have a secretariat of public servants that will work for it.  The committee will be twinned with a centre of excellence in a university where some of the staff will act as the intellectual powerhouse of research for it, on the basis of a contract with the Department.  I do not want this to be an exercise for academics.  I want it to be a supervisory committee whose members will bring their collective wisdom to an agenda that will be constantly fed by the centre of excellence.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Deputy Ó Snodaigh, we are discussing amendments Nos. 240 to 246, inclusive, regarding the criminal law codification advisory committee.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I have a single amendment.  As this work is done older areas of law may be identified that are contrary to human rights and I ask that someone with expertise on human rights law be part of this committee.Another concern is that there is no maximum or minimum number mentioned for the committee other than the chairman as a minimum.  It does not mention whether remuneration will be involved.  The secretariat will be provided by the Department, but holding meetings and so on involves a cost.  Is this cost to be borne by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law reform?
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	41	We have already discussed that matter.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 240:

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I have a small amendment to the Labour Party's amendment No. 1 to 240.  Insert "an Coiste Comhairleach um Chódú" in place of "Coiste un Códú".  I will give the text to the committee clerk.I have no problem with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's amendment relating to human rights.

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:"164.—(1) The function of the Committee shall be to oversee the development of a programme for the codification of the criminal law.(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the Committee shall—(a) monitor and review the implementation of a programme for the  development of a criminal code (“the code”),(b) advise and assist the Minister on consolidation of areas of criminal law for inclusion in the code,(c) advise and assist the Minister in relation to the amendment and future maintenance of the code,(d) undertake or commission, or collaborate or assist in, research projects relating to the codification of criminal law,(e) consult, on any particular matter which the Committee considers relevant, persons qualified to give opinions thereon,(f) monitor, review and advise and assist the Minister on international developments in the codification of criminal law in so far as they may be relevant to the development of the code,(g) advise and assist the Minister on any other related issues, including issues submitted by the Minister to the Committee for consideration.”.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	45	One question on amendment No. 241.  The primary function of the committee is to monitor and review.  Is that not a somewhat weak opening shot?  Should we not prescribe a more proactive primary function than this?  We will be asking the committee to examine, draw up, prevent and produce.  The way it is drafted is a little——
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	46	It is written in very polite language, I suppose on the basis that it is for the Oireachtas to do this work and it is a policy matter.  It is written in language deferential to the Legislature.  I could change it to "to plan, monitor and review the implementation".  The word "plan" is more active, the others may imply passivity.  Can we take that as a speaking amendment, to add the word "plan"?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I move amendment No. 242:

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Is there a legal basis on which to make payments?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I will consider this between now and Report Stage.  I am reluctant to involve the Department of Finance in schemes.  There is a degree of latitude, for instance, in the case of a person who does some work for a Department an ex gratia payment may be made.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	53	That is a contract payment.

Sometimes people do work and a Department will not pay them for that work but in order to honour them they will give them, say, €5,000 or some such figure.

To make it "annually" would add hassle to the process from the Department's point of view.

I produced an amendment on the offence of corporate killing in two different enactments, one of which was a companies Bill, and I was told it was inappropriate.

We are now told it is inappropriate for a criminal justice Bill.  May I ask the distinguished Minister and lawyer what sort of legislative vehicle would be appropriate?

The Law Reform Commission made serious recommendations on establishing the offence of corporate manslaughter.  It arises when talking about causing the death of anybody through gross negligence.  The ideas behind these amendments are not off the top of the head.  They are largely drawn from the very detailed Law Reform Commission well.

This is the appropriate vehicle through which the work of the Law Reform Commission, taking into account the other issues we have incorporated in the Bill, can be brought into statutory law.On the argument as to the ambit of the Bill, we had the original Long Title, which covered a range of issues in the criminal law area.  That was subsequently expanded considerably.  I would have prepared more arguments for the Minister but I had not been aware that these amendments were to be disallowed.

However, in regard to related matters, the Dáil takes a fairly narrow view, and one must get permission from it if a related matter is broader than what a narrow definition would infer.  This group of amendments has been ruled out of order.

I appreciate the technicalities involved, but I record this is an area that needs to be tackled.  There is growing concern about cowboy operators who do not give tuppence about the safety, security and health of workers in many instances.  They need to be brought to book.  We need to put into statute law the offence of gross negligence by management in causing the death of people, in particular workers.  I cannot bring the matter any further at this stage other than to indicate my desire to have these recommendations from the Law Reform Commission debated and passed into law at the earliest possible time.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I move amendment No. 247a:In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 5, to insert the following new section:"24.—(1) In this section—"abuser" means an individual believed by a person who has authority or control over that individual to have seriously harmed or sexually abused a child or more than one child;"child" means a person under 18 years of age, except where the context otherwise requires;"serious harm" means injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes permanent disfigurement or loss or impairment of the mobility of the body as a whole or of the function of any particular member or organ;"sexual abuse" means an offence under paragraphs 1 to 13 and 16(a) and (b) of the Schedule to the Sex Offenders Act 2001.(2) A person, having authority or control over a child or abuser, who intentionally or recklessly endangers a child by—(a) causing or permitting any child to be placed or left in a situation which creates a substantial risk to the child of being a victim of serious harm or sexual abuse, or(b) failing to take reasonable steps to protect a child from such a risk while knowing that the child is in such a situation,is guilty of an offence.(3) Where a person is charged with an offence under subsection (2), no further proceedings in the matter (other than any remand in custody or on bail) shall be taken except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.(4) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.".This amendment relates to the crime of reckless endangerment of children and was tabled by my party's previous spokesperson on justice.  It creates an offence for failing to take reasonable steps to protect a child from risk, while knowing of a child being in such a situation, and set out severe penalties for that crime.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on this amendment.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am very much of the view that this is an appropriate amendment to make.  I said in the House that I was minded, in the context of this legislation, to address the question of reckless endangerment, as recommended by Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, in the Ferns report.  It is important to have a legal provision of this kind.  I am satisfied that the wording advanced by the Deputy is apt for this purpose and I am disposed to accepting the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I move amendment No. 247b:In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 5, to insert the following new section:"24.—(1) Where a person is the subject of an unexecuted bench warrant, it shall be lawful notwithstanding anything in the Data Protection Acts 1988 to 2003 for a member of the Garda Síochána to require any data processor (whether in the public or private sector) to communicate with the member any information relevant to the person for the purposes of apprehending the person, or to notify the member or another member when the person interacts with the data processor, or both.(2) In this section "bench warrant" includes any instrument, warrant or order requiring a person to surrender to a court, prison or member of the Garda Síochána.".This amendment addresses an anomaly where, for example, a bench warrant is issued for an individual who is signing on for social welfare benefit and a check of the social welfare record would show that the warrant has not been served.  Notwithstanding the current provisions of the Data Protection Act, the amendment would allow for a member of the Garda Síochána to require any data processor in the public or private sector to communicate with that member any information relevant for the purposes of apprehending that person for whom a bench warrant has been issued.  It strikes many people as strange that legitimate bench warrants for the arrest of individuals for, on occasion, serious enough offences cannot be executed because the individual cannot be found.  That individual does not simply disappear and he or she may be in receipt of State benefit.  It is a cause of concern and bemusement to people that the State authorities cannot help one another to find an individual for whom a bench warrant has been issued and who has a case to meet.

This amendment suggests that one could approach the ESB and inquire if it has Aengus Ó Snodaigh on a list and that one could hunt for anybody with that name.  What this amendment is driving at, in a slightly circular way, is the notion that we should have ID cards and that when one is being prosecuted and there is a warrant for one's arrest, the identify of the person on the warrant could be flashed up across the system and a co-ordinated drive be undertaken to search for that person wherever they turn up.

That is the advice I have.

Is a garda to ring up the Bank of Ireland or a building society and inquire if it has a Michael McDowell on its books?

The Minister's first response of bundling the discussion into the issue of ID cards was a little off key.  The amendment does not have much relevance to ID cards.  It could be the case that if we had ID cards in the future, it would facilitate data sharing with regard to bench warrants.  However, Deputy Howlin's amendment does not appear to require the introduction of ID cards.  That is a separate area in which I have an interest, not from the point of view of pressing for their introduction but because I have compiled a report on the issue.  Incidentally, that report concludes that we should not rush into introducing them.What is before us is a proposal that if a member of the force is pursuing somebody to execute a warrant, the member can access the data in, for example, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to get addresses and so forth.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	130	There would not be a problem with that.  I doubt that the Garda would be refused that information by the Department of Social and Family Affairs if gardaí were hunting for somebody.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Every building society, bank and telephone company which falls into this category would also be involved.  Deputy Howlin makes the point that somebody could be signing on for the dole.  That is true.  One can go to a bank, building society or telecommunications company and ask them about a Michael McDowell who lives in Ranelagh but the Garda should be able to get to Michael McDowell in Ranelagh.  This is the point I was making with regard to ID cards.  If they have a name and address, they should go to that address because the bank is unlikely to have more information about where one lives than one's name and address.I was outlining a slightly different scenario, for example, where one has date of birth material.  This would be relevant because there are often cases where fathers and sons are mixed up because they have the same address.  The Garda must be very careful executing a warrant to ensure they do not take away the father or the son when the other person is the subject of the warrant.  From that point of view a PPS number would be more clear——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I would be willing to hear an argument on that.  There is disquiet about the number of unexecuted warrants.  People move from place to place with much greater freedom now.  Rented accommodation is more a feature of life than it was 30 years ago and there is certainly a case for a debate on ID cards.  The PPS number is held from cradle to grave.  We must have a mechanism because people can be visible in the community but not be amenable because they have moved address or to a different town.

However, when one goes beyond the public sector, for example, if a garda approached a Deputy, there is confidentiality between the Deputy and a client.  There is also confidentiality if, for example, somebody was attending Alcoholics Anonymous.  It would obviously have a list of its members.  If somebody was in psychiatric treatment and a garda came seeking the information——

In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 5, to insert the following new section:"24.—Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of court, a bench warrant issued by a judge of any Court shall continue in force until executed or cancelled by the judge or another judge.".This is a separate issue.  The current lifespan of warrants is six months.  We should have a separate debate on it.

The issue is the duration of warrants in order to reduce the problem of unexecuted bench warrants, which we discussed on the last amendment.  We are suggesting that the six-month expiry currently in place is an obstacle to the enforcement of warrants.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on my suggestion that warrants should remain extant until executed, or discharged or cancelled by a judge in that court or another court.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The intention behind the amendment is not very clear.  It seems to provide that a time limit may not be imposed on the execution of bench warrants, and that a bench warrant which is normally understood to mean a warrant to arrest somebody who failed to appear in court, either on bail or in response to a summons, does not have to be executed within any set time limit.  There is no time limit on the execution of a bench warrant for good reason.  Where a court issues a bench warrant, it wants that person brought before it without delay.  I acknowledge that this is not possible in all cases due to the difficulty in locating individuals.  Deputy Howlin, however, having regard to the definition of bench warrants under the previous amendment, which seems to include committal warrants and fine warrants, appears to want to abolish the six month time limit which applies to the execution of those warrants under the rules of the District Court.  After that time, they can, if the court is satisfied, be reissued.  The reason for that is that it would be bad practice to have a situation where such warrants remain unexecuted for long periods without a court being satisfied as to the reason for the delay.  It could potentially lead to an abuse of the system in that warrants, which could have been executed promptly, would remain unexecuted until it suits the person executing the warrant.  It occurs to me that it might be better to provide in the rules of court that unexecuted warrants are automatically relisted before the court for an explanation.  It does not need a statute.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Okay.

I take the point that it is amazing how many of them are shelved and one never hears what happens to them.  Maybe there should be finality one way or another.  If a person who applied for a warrant and got it, had to come back to the court at some stage and say, either in writing or otherwise, "I haven't been able to execute the warrant for the following reason...", that may be a stimulus either to do something with it, do nothing with it or not apply for it in the first place.

In other words, if someone is done for having no insurance and appeals the case but never turns up, a committal warrant could be issued instead of simply a bench warrant to bring a person before the court.

One of the frustrations is that so many warrants are issued, not only is that the end of them but nobody knows that is the end of them because they just lapse and there is no more to be said of it unless somebody starts the process again.  Should there be a reporting mechanism?

There could be many explanations or the person could simply have moved to Kerry and left no forwarding address.

The fact that those warrants do not always move to finality is not an indictment of the Garda or a statement of laziness.  If, for example, a garda stops somebody for driving without insurance in Ballsbridge and the person gives an address in rented accommodation in Rathmines, subsequently the garda goes to court where the person does not turn up and where the garda gets a warrant, and Rathmines gardaí go looking for the person and there is no person of that name at that address any more, then it is not laziness on the part of the gardaí if they do not work out that the person is now in Tralee or Wolverhampton.  It is easy for us to sit here stating that something should happen with that warrant, but from the Garda point of view I ask members to be understanding.  Sending gardaí off trying to work out the person's forwarding address may be a considerable consumption of Garda time and a pointless exercise.

There is no point in blaming a garda, who, in the case of such a relatively minor offence, has other tasks.  For example, there might even by a multiplicity of warrants of different kinds involved.  Is there a system using modern technology where such warrants would be registered centrally, either through the Courts Service or through PULSE?

Those are ideas worth exploring.  All I am saying is that I see a slight problem with Deputy Howlin's particular amendment.  I am not stating that there is not a problem here but I also want to make clear it is not a simple issue to solve.  It is not as if one afternoon a Minister can wave a magic wand and thereafter all warrants will be executed and the problem will go away.  It will not be that easy.

The point was made to me that there are now a variety of different time periods, depending on the particular Act under which an individual is detained even for committing a serious offence.  The time and detention periods are different, whether under the Criminal Justice Act, the Offences against the State Act or the Criminal Justice (Drugs Trafficking) Act 1996.  It was put to me strongly by people in the area that there should be some standardisation.  It is not always easy and I did not want to standardise the detention periods in line with the maximum periods allowed for drug trafficking offences.I suggest in my amendment that the Criminal Justice Act be brought in line with the Offences against the State Act.  It can be a technical matter whether somebody is charged for a serious offence under the Criminal Justice Act or the Offences against the State Act.  If the Oireachtas deemed it appropriate to question people for significant periods of time — I listened to the Minister speak on the restatement motion on the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 and he certainly made the point that in comparison to other European jurisdictions, much less internationally, our detention regime is not draconian — I wonder whether, in the light of the growing seriousness of the coaching of crime gangs on how they deal with periods in custody, we should move towards bringing the periods allowed for questioning for serious matters under the Criminal Justice Act parallel to those under the Offences against the State Act.

The matter is not as easy as Deputy Howlin's amendment would make it appear.  By substituting "24" for "6" wherever it appears in the 1984 Act, Deputy Howlin is providing for the following, that a period from a maximum of 24 hours including any rest periods would increase to 60 hours excluding rest periods.  That is the first problem.Section 8 of the Bill which has been agreed amends section 4 of the 1984 Act to provide for increased powers of detention for arrestable offences.  Section 8 provides for a further period of detention of up to 12 hours if authorised by a garda not below the rank of chief superintendent.  In providing for a maximum period of 60 hours, including rest periods, the Deputy's amendment seeks to go further than what was recommended in the Leahy report.  It recommended a period of 48 hours, including rest periods.  I consider that the amendment agreed in this section is reasonable, particularly when considered in conjunction with the regulations relating to custody and video recording already in force in the new regime introduced by the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  We should, therefore, stick to section 8.  What the Deputy is seeking to do is to increase the period to 60 hours.  He will recall from the discussion this morning that the period provided for in the Offences against the State Act ranges from 48 to 72 hours.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment and I am surprised the Deputy succeeded in having it tabled.

In such cases there should be a mechanism for correcting miscarriages of justice.  The provision of new compelling evidence allows for the revisiting of a case where there has been a miscarriage of justice involving a wrongful conviction.  However, I suggest that where there is new compelling evidence, there should be some avenue open to the Director of Public Prosecutions to revisit an acquittal.  The form of words I suggest are:In the case of an accused person tried on indictment for an offence carrying a maximum or mandatory sentence of life imprisonment [this confines us to the most serious crimes of murder, serious sexual assault and similar crimes], who has been acquitted, where at any time following such acquittal the Director of Public Prosecutions comes into possession of significant new evidence which demonstrates that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, he or she may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal for an order setting aside the acquittal and directing a retrial.I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on the amendment and how it would fit into international obligations and the Constitution.  In common justice terms, there is a compelling case for it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	203	As he acknowledges, the Deputy's amendment is based on the UK provision in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which came into force in April last year and provides for an exception to the double jeopardy rule in the case of very serious offences.  The Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales is empowered to authorise a police investigation and give written consent to enable a case to be referred to the Court of Appeal for retrial if certain conditions are met, including that there is new compelling evidence and that it is in the public interest.I have an open mind on this issue.  It is a cornerstone of common law that the prosecution has only one bite at the cherry and if it fails, that is the end of the matter.  I recognise that the Deputy is concerned with the most grave offences, although some offences incurring a life sentence would not be that grave.  For example, the offence of robbery and false imprisonment can carry a life sentence, yet some such offences might not be all that serious.  For instance, the average mugging is a robbery.  Accepting that in principle we could tie down the issue to murder, rape and other serious offences, the proposal is worth considering.I know of one case in which an individual was convicted of a very serious offence — the capital murder of a garda — and sentenced to prison.  He appealed the decision at a late stage to the Court of Criminal Appeal and, on the basis of the non-disclosure of records, was acquitted.  He then commenced proceedings for a wrongful miscarriage of justice.  In the course of the State's defence, as I understand it, DNA evidence was obtained which was not available at the time of the original conviction which proved his blood had been found at the scene of the crime.  I do not know whether there has yet been an outcome to the case but it is a strange one.All I can say is that it would be a far reaching change if the position on murder cases was to be changed in this way to accommodate the amendment.  I accept the Deputy's suggestion that it would only occur where there was compelling new evidence.  However, would that compelling new evidence amount to the statement of the accused or an accomplice who suddenly came forward ten years after the event and said he or she had lied to the police at the time but now wanted to say he or she had seen——

It is something on which we would definitely require a Government discussion or Second Stage debate.  It is such a radical change that I could not make it alone.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	206	When I saw the amendment, I was taken by it and my immediate reaction was to think of the concept of double jeopardy.  I went to the trouble of contacting a criminal lawyer and said to him that I thought it would make sense.  I asked him, as someone schooled in the principle of double jeopardy, whether there would be a problem in that regard.  His answer was that the principle was not set in stone.  I then asked whether it would have constitutional implications, but he said it would not infringe on the Constitution.  We should, therefore, give the proposal serious consideration.  With modern technology, it is possible that new and, in some instances, compelling evidence will become available.If we look at the development of our criminal law system, there is probably a case for rebalancing it, taking into account a range of societal and other factors.  If we go back as far as the 18th century, an unfortunate accused person was not even able to speak in his or her own defence.  At the time most accused persons were probably illiterate and not defended in court.  Rules ultimately emerged to provide for a sense of fair play as far as an accused person was concerned.  If we look at developments in our society and legal system since, the balance has tilted the other way.  Often the accused is well educated and invariably well defended, either at the expense of the taxpayer or because he or she has access to large sums of money, the provenance of which might be doubtful.  I think I read in an article lately that, from the point of view of the prosecution, every stage of the process was an opportunity for the accused to be acquitted for some technical or other reason.  One slip on the part of the prosecution means the accused can bound away.  If the accused is convicted, he or she can appeal.  We need to take into account the change in the situation and our duty as legislators to try to ensure, without going overboard, that we put in place legal mechanisms to protect the public as far as possible in cases involving very serious crimes.  The amendment would provide such a legal mechanism.  The proposal is confined to an offence that carries a maximum or mandatory sentence of life imprisonment to ensure we would not go overboard.The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which would have a role in this regard is sometimes the subject of criticism in newspapers.  Since it was established in 1975, the office has developed a major role as an independent prosecutor on behalf of the State.  Significant new evidence would be needed in cases of this nature.  It would then be a question of submitting an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal for an order setting aside an acquittal and directing that a retrial take place.  Many hurdles have to be crossed if we are to ensure we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater in this instance.I was one of the first Members to speak about the leniency of sentences.  Some time has passed since.

When I tabled a Private Members' motion on the issue, the reaction was that the idea was incredibly wrong because it was contrary to principles of civil liberties, human rights and God knows what else.  However, the proposal was ultimately accepted and is now established as part of our criminal justice system.  A change such as that proposed by Deputy Howlin in this instance would be a reasonable rebalancing of the law at this stage.  I support the amendment for that reason.

The provision whereby people can be freed after a minimum term has been served is leading to people who have been sentenced to life imprisonment being freed after five years.  The life sentence is, in effect, being used in terrorem in such cases.  People who are freed in such circumstances are on licence for the rest of their lives because they are repeat violent offenders.  I am sure the Home Secretary who came up with the idea and piloted through the Bill in question thought it was a vote-winner.  I presume my good friend, Dr. John Reid, blanched when he heard that it had been reported this morning that 52 people sentenced to life imprisonment had served five years or less.

I suppose that is the new way of putting something off sine die.  I was impressed by the case made to me by those who wanted me to table the amendment.  It is possible, as technology continues to improve, that people might be identified who have gone through the legal system having committed heinous crimes, in some instances, and have the potential to reoffend.  It would be wrong if there were no mechanism to deal with this.  The State should have such a mechanism.  The Minister has spoken about the need to have a Second Stage debate on all of this.  He made the point, not long after I became a member of this committee, that it was dealing with a great deal of material.

If it emerges after a jury trial that there was a miscarriage of justice owing to the intimidation of a juror, the person on trial can be put on trial again.

It will have to travel some distance before it finds itself in statute law.  I am not naive enough to believe everyone will nod assent to it now.  For that reason I will withdraw it.

Many of us were a little surprised to discover in recent times that what we had thought was a register of sex offenders did not in fact operate as an actual register.  I hope it will be brought into operation at some future date.  Similarly, a violent offenders' register should be introduced because the perpetration of acts of violence against individuals is a significant problem.  A case was reported on the news at 6 p.m. in which a publican going about his normal business in County Roscommon had suffered a terrible assault by three youths who had terrified their victim and necessitated his having 30 stitches to his face.  Those who commit such offences need to be monitored on release.  The perpetrators received a two year prison sentence and will be released long before the period of the sentence elapses but the disamenity and suffering they caused will last forever.  A monitoring mechanism should be in place, particularly for repeat offenders.

We could achieve much of the aim of this procedure in Irish law by suspending a portion of a sentence for a period and providing, as a condition of the sentence being suspended, that a person notify the Garda of his or her whereabouts.  A creative Judiciary, once it has grasped the concept of a partly suspended sentence, could achieve much of the effect of the proposal.  For example, a judge could sentence a person to six years' imprisonment, direct that he or she serve three years and suspend the balance for six years on condition that he or she be of good behaviour and notify the Garda of his or her whereabouts during the six year period.  It may not be necessary to have a separate register to achieve the purpose of the amendment.I will observe with interest what the Home Secretary comes up with, whereupon I will have to ask the Garda whether it adds value and would, in the circumstances, be superior to the model I have just mentioned of making it a condition of a suspended sentence.  All these matters need to be examined.

Having criminals in terrorem would not worry me and a strong case can be made for having such a register.  I am not sure, however, that the approach outlined by the Minister is on a par with that proposed in the amendment.  The former is another instrument available to the courts which they might use in a limited number of cases.  The latter, on the other hand, is a register of offenders which could be used for a range of purposes, including checks to protect innocent members of the public from further activities by registered violent offenders.  If I were to be critical of Deputy Howlin’s proposal which I do not intend to be, I would ask whether any such register should be confined to offences under the Non-fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.

I am sure Deputy Howlin would accept an amendment to tighten up his amendment.  A schedule of offences to which the register would apply could include common law manslaughter and other offences of that nature.  The basic question, however, is whether it would be beneficial to have a register of violent offenders.  If the UK authorities appear to be moving in that direction, I see considerable potential for following suit here.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Some years ago the prevailing view was that a sex offenders' register was required.  The Minister obviously shared this view because he has in his proposals created a new drug offenders' register.  I presume, therefore, that such a mechanism has a deterrent or, at least, monitoring effect.  The analysis done by the Labour Party found that people are most concerned about violence, specifically the casual violence perpetrated by small groups of thugs in communities who wantonly lash out and cause terrible harm.  Often the tariff meted out by the courts does not correspond to the life-changing effect of the trauma visited on the victim, particularly in the case of elderly people but also some very young persons.  We need to come to terms with the growing problem of violence.How would a register work?  Does the Minister share my view that a PULSE-type system should, for example, contain a register of all sex offenders which would be readily accessible to those authorised to access it and enable them to find out where an individual sex offender resides?

The wording is very straightforward.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	271	A poor person might be fined €100 ten times and have no money at all.  I discussed the matter with our own legal people because I had strong views about it.  One of the things I did to try to get gardaí out of the courts and onto traffic detail was to introduce on-the-spot fines when I was in the Department of the Environment.  I thought it was a good idea, but to borrow a phrase, on mature reflection I am not sure it was as good as I thought it to be because for many people a fine of £50, as was, did not bother them in the slightest.  People did not mind being caught twice and paying fines.  This was before penalty points were introduced.  It had no impact on them.  The same fine imposed on somebody where it constituted up to one quarter of his or her weekly wage had a different order of impact.Some jurisdictions have regard to the person's ability to pay.  If justice is to be applied even-handedly in setting a monetary value on a fine, it must have some relationship to what that pain would mean for the individual required to pay the fine.  We have overcome the difficulty with fines alone, especially in the case of motoring offences and others in the District Court, largely by the introduction of the penalty points system.  As soon as that system gets properly up and running there will be a much deeper sting.  However, for other issues, a monetary penalty alone that is not related to the ability to pay is a most unequal instrument to use as a penalty for citizens because in that case they are not equal before the law.I am not a lawyer and I do not know what would be a better mechanism to equalise the system.  Again, I put this amendment forward, as the Minister said, as a debating point.  The core idea underlying it is an important one, namely, that the brunt of pain felt by offenders should be equal, regardless of the social standing or income of those who commit the same offence.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I have some sympathy for the Deputy's point, which is one that occurred to me when I was Attorney General.  The question arose of what the upper limit should be for fines.  A perennial issue in the Attorney General's office is what should be regarded by the High Court as a minor penalty offence.  Discussion has taken place as to whether a wealthy person should have a different threshold from a person of lesser means when it comes to what they are liable for in fines in the District Court.  It is an issue which I will put to the Attorney General again to see if there is any mechanism by which he could do this.A fines Bill is being drafted and its publication is expected very shortly in the Attorney General's office.  It will increase the fine in the District Court generally to €5,000 and will provide for an assessment of means and instalment orders which go some but not all the way towards Deputy Howlin's intention.  It is a good idea to have substantial fines payable by instalment because otherwise people will be sent to jail for relatively small sums of money.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	273	It is not so much that point, which is a fair and different one — the question is one of equality before the law.  I have known individuals who could pay €50 fines without missing it but for other poor unfortunates it made a crippling hole in their income for the week.  Is there a way of addressing that type of inequality before the law?  I refer, by and large, to the District Court.

Means are not totally income related.  If one has €5 million in the bank but sustained a loss in one's business in a particular year, one's annual income would not be a fair basis on which to make the decision.  The principle would have to be looked at also with reference to means of a capital kind to make it fair.

As somebody who practised in the District Court, I believe the problem has more dimensions than have been touched upon so far.  I generally found that District Court judges were interested to know the general position of the defendant and did not want to penalise unduly those who were not terribly well off.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	282	As the Deputy well knows, there are well known cases in which the courts have abandoned fines completely in respect of wealthy people and proposed substantial donations to a charity or the court poor box.  This achieved the same result but I am not keen on it because it is very arbitrary.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	283	That is one of the aspects that should be considered.  There are many positive aspects to the court poor box but also some down sides.  I saw proposals on this that suggested building a totally bureaucratic structure into the system.  I was not totally enamoured with this and did not believe it was the answer.I have sympathy with Deputy Howlin's point that the system can sometimes over-penalise the poor and under-penalise the wealthy.  This can arise in other ways.  The Deputy mentioned the fixed-penalty procedure.  Over-penalisation can occur where the defendant does not turn up in court and may not have the means to pay the penalty.  I recall the case of the lady who did not turn up in court on being discovered not to possess a television licence.  She received a fine of €150, did not pay, and was then arrested by the Garda and brought to prison for defaulting on payment.  We cannot operate on the basis that the court is, at all times, in a position to know the means of the defendant, who may not be able to turn up.  If the courts work according to fixed-fine procedures, there is no opportunity to assess defendants' means.  There are issues in this regard to be examined, including that of the court poor box, and there is no simple answer.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I am happy enough with the debate we have had.  The amendment is too crude to be immediately acceptable for adoption into the statute but I hope the principle will somehow be captured.  Perhaps the new fines Bill, when we see it, will establish a basis on which we can develop a fairer system in the courts.  I am happy with the debate and will withdraw my amendment on that basis.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I move amendment No. 247h:In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 5, to insert the following new section:"24.—(1) Where a defendant appears or is represented at the hearing of a complaint charging a summary offence, the court shall first state the substance of the complaint and ask whether the defendant pleads guilty or not guilty.(2) If the defendant or the defendant's representative on his or her behalf informs the court that he or she pleads guilty, the court may, if it sees no sufficient reason to the contrary, convict or make an order against the defendant accordingly, without hearing the evidence.(3) If the defendant does not plead guilty, or does not subsequently change his or her plea to guilty, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the complaint and may, after hearing the evidence and such representations, if any, as may be made to it by or on behalf of the parties, convict the defendant or dismiss the complaint.(4) In imposing sentence following conviction for a summary offence, a court shall have regard to whether the defendant pleaded guilty or not guilty to that offence and, in the event of a plea of guilt, at what stage he or she pleaded guilty to that offence.".This is a technical amendment suggested by one of my legal advisers and it makes the simple point that the accused should plead guilty or not guilty at the outset in the District Court.  It surprised me that there is no such requirement.  One can sit dumb and see the lie of the case against one.  If one spots a flaw in the notes, or other material, on which one can hop, one can defend one's case.  One should be up-front and state at the outset whether one is guilty or not, after which appropriate action may be taken, and thus there would be no further delay in the case.  The notion that the defendant has an each-way bet in that he can determine the strength of the case against him before deciding whether to contest it strikes me as wasteful.  It takes unduly from the court's time and is not just.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	286	This is interesting because Order 23 of the District Court rules provides as follows:Where the accused, personally or by solicitor or counsel appears and admits the truth of the complaint made against him or her, the Court may if it sees no sufficient reason to the contrary, convict or make an order against him or her accordingly, but if the accused does not admit the truth of the complaint, the Court shall, subject to the provisions of rule 2 hereof [which deals with non-appearance], proceed to hear and determine such complaint.The working group on the jurisdiction of the courts considered this in its report at paragraphs 707 to 710 and, in 2004, the District Court rules committee examined the working group's recommendation.  It decided, in its wisdom, not to change the current wording and leave it as it is.  A view was expressed that the proposal that pleas be recorded individually would not be practicable in view of the volume of summonses and other matters required to be dealt with in District Court lists, which can be long.The Deputy suggests in his amendment that the court may, on foot of a plea of guilt, convict or make an order against the defendant accordingly, without hearing the evidence.  There are due process issues to be considered in this regard.Judges normally ask the defendant whether he or she admits to the offence but I remember one judge who just used to say "Guilty" in a questioning tone.  It always struck me that the presumption of innocence was slightly absent.  The Deputy makes an interesting point but it was considered as late as 2004 and the District Court rules committee, comprising District Court judges, said it was not keen on it.

The practical reality is that this is not always the case.  The State would be saved much trouble and expense if witnesses did not always have to be brought to court.  It is not very meritorious or beneficial to the taxpayer or the system of administration of justice if somebody enters a plea after his case is called such that a sergeant and two other gardaí who are witnesses to the offence, in addition to a couple of civilian witnesses, for example, would have to be brought to the court together by the Superintendent.  It would be fully meritorious if a plea of guilt were made in advance such that they would not have to attend the court.In principle, our system should favour a defendant who pleads guilty rather than one who fights his or her case and is subsequently found guilty, particularly if he or she commits perjury in doing so.  I would also like to see some kind of an add-on system whereby if such pleas were indicated to the State in advance, thus saving the taxpayer a great deal of expense, saving court time and allowing gardaí to be freed for other duties, there should be a greater benefit.  The idea generally is good but to get the full benefit, it would need to be fleshed out.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I have not been practising as a barrister since 1999, when I became Attorney General, and my officials have just handed me an amendment in the law in 1999, which I was unaware of, which states:In determining what sentence to pass on a person who has pleaded guilty to an offence, other than an offence for which the sentence is fixed by law, a court, if it considers it appropriate to do so, shall take into account—(a) the state in the proceedings for the offence at which a person indicates an intention to plead guilty, and(b) the circumstance in which this indication was given.That is a general principle of our law of which I was unaware until now.  It is interesting.On Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's point, it would be very useful if the local prosecutor knew in advance whether someone was going to admit to an offence or not.  The problem is that accused persons are not usually that organised with their solicitors so that they can all get together and work out that there is a definite advantage to pleading guilty.  Many of these people, if they are as guilty as sin, might feel that the garda involved might fall and break his or her leg on the day of the court case, and the person might get off.

In principle, what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe proposes is a good idea but, in practice, one will not get accused people to face up to what they are doing.  If I were a District Court judge, I would let it be known to the practitioners in my area that, for example, with regard to drink driving offences, if the Garda were to be notified in advance that the accused would be taking a certain course at an early stage, I would always visit that with added leniency.  If the Garda knew it would not have to bring witnesses and so on, I would always do that.  However, no more than anyone in this room, I cannot dictate to judges that they must do that or in what circumstances they must do that.I agree with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  It is a good thing if potential witnesses are not brought to court unnecessarily and if the Judiciary gives a significant discount to somebody who makes the process work well.

This would be by arrangement with the superintendent whereby a plea would be entered under section 52 involving a lesser charge of careless driving.  On that basis, no witnesses would be necessary.

However, I have a fairly substantial mailbag in the Department and in my constituency office with people writing to me from time to time saying they do not like the sentences handed down for dangerous driving or drink driving where fatalities or injuries are involved.  They have the feeling that the Garda is not vigorous in exacting retributive justice.  It may be that the factors to which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe refers are real factors in those cases, but in many of these cases the victim must also be remembered.

We must be careful despite wanting to be efficient.People write to me on occasion about children who seriously assault other children and who break their teeth, for example, and who are dealt with under the youth diversion schemes.  Those people say that is wholly inappropriate.  A person's child could now be missing three teeth, and the offender is not even brought to the District Court and perhaps just cautioned under a youth diversion programme.

Under the principle I set out, whatever the views of the good and learned judges of the District Court, one would imagine more efficiency would result.  I can understand the charge sometimes levelled at District Court level, such as the disorganisation of some of the people who appear might not lend itself to the clarity which this proposal would bring about. Someone charged with an offence will either confess or will not.  If the person confesses, there is a positive impact on the penalty, and if not, the person cannot change horses.One can obviously change from pleading not guilty to guilty in the course of a trial, but the notion that one would just see the lie of the land and, perhaps, discover that the garda broke a leg just before deciding one's course of action strikes me as a wasteful one for the District Court.  I am minded to listen to what the Minister and my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, say because they have much greater experience of these matters than I.  Perhaps this discussion could be revisited with judges when they are again discussing rules, and they could be alerted that the Oireachtas believes this might be useful.

(2) In determining whether subsection (1) applies to an enactment creating an offence, regard shall be had to—(a) whether the provision concerned—(i) reduces the scope or extent of the factual outline that delineates the ambit of the offence,(ii) excludes specified persons or cases from the class of those who would otherwise fall within that factual outline, or(iii) otherwise narrows the effect of the enactment;(b) whether, notwithstanding that a particular fact is provided for as an ingredient of an offence rather than the non-existence of that fact being provided for as giving rise to a qualification, exception, exemption, proviso or excuse, the fact in question is of such a nature that its non-existence in any particular case would be exceptional and its existence in such cases generally can therefore reasonably be presumed;(c) whether there is a reasonable possibility that a state of affairs adverted to by or on behalf of the defendant may exist or may have existed;(d) the comparative ease or difficulty for the prosecution and the defendant in discharging the burden of proving the fact in question;(e) the public interest in ensuring that the prosecution should not be required to prove facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant or to disprove facts that are improbable;(f) the presumption of innocence and the constitutional rights of accused persons.(3) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) and without exhausting or limiting its meaning, the following is an example of its operation, namely in relation to a prohibition on doing an act save with the licence or permission of specified authorities, proof that the licence or permission was not given by those authorities.(4) This section applies to summary proceedings for any offence, whether the offence is a summary offence, an indictable offence that is triable summarily or an offence that is triable either summarily or on indictment"."This is a very technical amendment.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	307	The idea in essence, as explained to me, which convinced me to table the amendment, was a more straightforward one.  As I understand the case to be in any court, the burden of proof normally falls on the person who makes the assertion.  That is normally the prosecution.  The idea of the amendment is to update, restate and clarify the application of a rule not to introduce any new principles except one where a defendant introduces evidence to show he or she comes within an exceptional proviso that makes unlawful behaviour lawful.  For example, the person might not be subject to the licensing law because of being a family member, but the prosecution would not have advance notice of that and ought to be entitled to reopen the case and rebut that evidence, if possible, where the evidence is patently not true.I am advised the amendment first sets out a rule about drafting complaints.  The complaint charging the offence need not be drafted to negative every qualification, exemption, proviso and excuse and so on.  The prosecution need not disprove every proviso in its evidence.  If the defendant wishes to rely on a proviso, he must produce or point to the evidence, and the prosecution should be entitled to reopen the case to rebut it.  Essentially, where an assertion is made by the prosecution and the defendant, relying on an exemption, is required to produce evidence, the prosecution should also have the chance to rebut it.  That is my summation.  I will happily give the Minister the speaking note or, at worst, read it to him.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I move amendment No. 248:
In page 25, subsection (1), to delete lines 34 to 37 and substitute the following:"(b) an offence that is triable—(i) at the election of the prosecution, either on indictment or summarily, or(ii) either on indictment or, subject to certain conditions including the consent of the prosecution, summarily.".This is a drafting amendment to ensure that the policy intention behind section 24 of the Bill as published is clearly reflected in that provision.  That policy intention is that the six-month time limit for the making of complaints in cases of summary jurisdiction as set out in section 10(4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 shall, in addition to continuing not to apply to offences set out in the Schedule to the 1951 Act, also not apply to hybrid offences, that is, offences in respect of which the prosecuting authority makes the decision whether the offences should be tried summarily or on indictment, and "either way" offences, that is, indictable offences that the court may try summarily, subject to certain conditions.  The proposed amendment reflects that intention in a more transparent way and will aid interpretation by the courts.Deputy Howlin's amendment, No. 249, would impose a 12-month time limit on taking summary proceedings regarding an offence appearing in the Schedule to the 1951 Act and also regarding all hybrid and "either way" offences.  That would mean that summary proceedings would have to be taken within 12 months of the commission of an offence.  With regard to the schedule of offences, that would be somewhat negative since no time limit has applied to taking summary proceedings regarding these offences since 1951 and, until the Supreme Court decision in the Logan case, was not considered to apply to indictable offences either.The types of offences included in the First Schedule are a mix of common law offences such as perjury, obstruction in the administration of justice and some statutory offences such as under the Offences against the Person Act 1861.  I am aware that the value of the First Schedule has lessened in recent years with the abolition of some larceny offences through enactment of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  However, the case has been made for imposing a time limit where none has existed for more than 50 years for the prosecution of the schedule of offences.Regarding hybrid and "either way" offences generally, imposing a 12-month time limit would be unnecessarily restrictive and impractical and could lead to some injustice for victims.  There are instances where offences do not come to light until some time after their commission, for example, the simple larceny of an employee or the opening of a bank account under a false name not involving serious criminality.  By the time the owner of the business has identified a shortfall in his accounts or the bank has discovered the account holder does not exist, the time may have expired, with the consequence that the offence cannot be prosecuted, even if it is minor.Another example might be regarding a sexual assault, a complaint about which might not be made for several years.  Obviously, if the offence is not minor in nature, no time limit would apply.  However, some offences that might be seen as minor might be excluded from prosecution if not discovered or a charge not brought within the period.  Another danger from the imposition of a time limit is that, where some time has elapsed between commission of the offence and identification of the perpetrator by the Garda, the 12-month limit may have expired, ruling out prosecution on a summary basis.A further reason for not imposing a time limit is that the appropriateness of trying a case summarily might not emerge until all the evidence had been gathered, which can take some time.  It is worth noting in this context that excessive delay in bringing a prosecution in any case, perhaps owing to a delay in making a complaint sufficient to trigger prosecution, can amount to a breach of constitutional rights to fair procedure, about which we have heard in recent days.  There is ample case law on that proposal.  That gives an adequate safeguard to the accused.  I ask that the Deputy accept that my formulation is as far as we should go.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I am minded to accept the Minister's view.  However, I am not clear what offences should stand alone as open-ended.  Offences covered by the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851 have the time limit, and time limits are provided by law for some.  Others have no time limit provided by law, and that is a determination of the Oireachtas.  If the 12-month limit I suggest is not acceptable, is any time limit acceptable for those categories of offences?  Perhaps the Minister might inform the committee what the offences are and why there should be no time limit for them.

I believe this has been gone since the other day.  Also included are an offence under the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, which I believe is about not paying fines, an offence under section 11 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act — I do not know what that is — an offence under section 65 of the Road Traffic Act 1933 — that could not be right — attempted carnal knowledge in constituting an offence under section 1(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935, which is now gone, and an attempt to commit an offence which the District Court has, by jurisdiction of any enactment, jurisdiction to try summarily.  This list of offences is a dying breed.  It includes all other indictable offences that may be tried  summarily.  That was very clear.  The Deputy asked for it and that was what he got.

The principal matter at issue in the case was the validity of search warrants issued under section 14 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.  The court found that, for a warrant to be valid, it must be issued by the judge while he or she is physically in his or her district.  The court found that certain warrants in this case were invalid because they were issued by a judge sitting outside the district to which he had been temporarily assigned.  The judgment had significant implications, especially for the criminal sphere regarding search and arrest warrants which may be required urgently outside normal sitting hours.  In emergency situations, some district judges often issue such warrants from their homes.There is a need to allow flexibility for a District Court judge in issuing warrants wherever the judge is physically located.  Accordingly, my proposed amendment will allow a District Court judge to issue a warrant for his or her district in circumstances where he or she is not physically in the district.  This amendment has been the subject of very careful examination.  It is vital that procedural matters of this nature are very clearly set down and in as comprehensive a manner as possible.  With this in mind, my Department undertook a consultation with other Departments to identify matters which they considered appropriate for inclusion in the scope of the proposal.  These are matters which do not fall neatly into the classification of a criminal matter but which may give rise to the necessity for an urgent application being made to a judge of the District Court for an order or warrant.  An example of this is an application for a warrant authorising an inspector under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to enter premises and perform his or her functions under the Act.Subsection (1) sets out the powers of the District Court to which the provision applies.  The three powers identified are the power to issue a warrant for the arrest of a person, the power to issue a warrant to a member of the Garda Síochána for search purposes, as well as the power to make an order directing a person to produce documents for inspection.  Subsection (2) is the key provision.  It provides that a District Court judge may, in a district to which he or she is assigned, exercise jurisdiction regarding the powers in subsection (1) while in any place in the State.  The subsection only refers to the exercise by the relevant powers of a judge while outside his or her district, as no doubt has been cast on the jurisdiction of a judge while in his or her district.Subsections (3) and (4) provide greater clarity on the nature of warrants and orders that come within the scope of the provision.  In particular, the subsections provide guidance in the application of this section to matters which may not be considered criminal matters in the true sense and may be more regulatory in nature.  Subsection (5) is a standard provision providing for the definition of certain terms in the section.I referred to my intention to withdraw portions of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004.  These dealt with emergency search warrants arising from the report of the Morris tribunal.  A Report Stage amendment to remove the relevant sections of section 5 of the Bill is under preparation.  The amendment will entail the deletion of subsections (2), (3) and (5) in their entirety, as well as a small amendment to subsection (4), as it contains a cross-reference to subsection (5).  Section 5, as amended, will therefore amend section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 to provide that a judge of the District Court may issue a search warrant in respect of evidence of or relating to the commission of an arrestable offence.  Section 10 currently only applies to certain serious offences.  The provision will also align the wording of section 10 with other search provisions and increase the financial penalty for obstructing or attempting to obstruct an officer acting under such a search warrant.  A copy of the provisions will be circulated to the Deputies later.I mention this for the purpose of admitting an amendment on Report Stage.  I intend to withdraw the proposals for emergency search warrants, pending further consideration, which I had set out in section 5 of the Bill, and to leave only the points of section 5 which are of general application and leave the law roughly as it is.

The first relates to the fallout from the Dylan Creaven case and the second is the change of position for emergency warrants under section 5.  To a degree, the two issues are interconnected.  I take it that the Minister is now stating that he will not be pursuing the emergency warrants under section 5 and that the proposal is now being withdrawn in its entirety.

In any event, this was a necessary outcome following the Dylan Creaven case.  From that point of view, I welcome the extended jurisdiction now given to judges of the District Court to issue a warrant for arrest and search outside their district.  It is preferable that warrants be issued by judges rather than by members of the Garda Síochána.It is necessary to bear in mind the practicalities and the problems that arise.  For instance, in my area of west Cork, the judge very often lives in Cork city and only visits the area to do his job in court.

We had complaints from judges' wives that they never came home.This amendment came through so late that I did not have the opportunity to get it fully assessed by my advisers.  We are giving a judge of the District Court power, under subsection (2), to issue warrants in any place in the State outside the relevant district to which he or she may be assigned.  I am concerned about the constitutional aspect of this power and would like to have it checked.  My understanding is that judges of the District Court have a local jurisdiction.  I am not sure how far that goes under the Constitution, but I did not have the opportunity to check it out.  Although I want the power given, I do not want it given if it is unconstitutional.

Subsection (2) makes clear that the extra power given to a judge to make an order outside a jurisdiction only applies in cases where the judge would have jurisdiction if he or she were in that jurisdiction.  In other words, it does not allow gardaí to go to any judge anywhere in the country and ask for a warrant for their area because the judge could not sit in the relevant District Court area unless he or she were authorised in law to do so.

I would have a more radical view on the constitutional test.  The court must be a court of local and limited jurisdiction but the notion that a particular judge must have localised personality is not a necessary constitutional point.  That is an argument for a different day.

On another aspect, in light of the intention to limit the emergency powers under section 5 to a superintendent, a number of gardaí mentioned to me the kind of difficulties they have at night and at weekends with warrants.  That will be eased slightly if they can go to a judge's residence or otherwise, but the judge might be in Killala.  How do we cover the point of issuing warrants when a judge is not readily available?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	369	A proposal has been made by the Courts Service and the President of the District Court, Judge Miriam Malone, on the assignment of judges and the issue of search warrants, the purpose of which is to allow some flexibility on the issue of formal assignment in circumstances where an assigned judge is not available.  There is a similar provision for the charging and remanding of bail applications before a District Court judge.  The Attorney General's office has flagged some concerns with the provision and its operation.  It is intended to examine this proposal in full, bearing in mind the fundamental issue which is at the heart of the proposal, namely, jurisdiction.

The Leahy committee proposed extending that on a broad basis and section 5 was intended to accomplish this.  In view of what Mr. Justice Morris has indicated to me, I am stepping back from that for the present so I can get it right.  However, I am not scrapping the Offences against the State Act warrant procedure, about which Mr. Justice Morris also has concerns, until I can study the matter and bring forward an acceptable global solution to this problem.That may involve duty judges and using the telephone and electronic means to make complaints and depositions to get warrants.  It may involve verbally administering an oath over a telephone and these transactions might have to be recorded in particular ways.  All those are issues I want to consider.  In view of what Mr. Justice Morris has recently conveyed to me, it might appear that I was going in the opposite direction to the points he made on the reform of section 5.  I want to reconsider the issue from that perspective.

One of the senior officials dealing with this legislation has suffered a family bereavement and that has created some difficulty.

I do not suggest all these words are not required, but their import is simply to provide judges with an out-of-district authority which allows them to exercise their powers in the same manner as they do within their own district.  That is it in a nutshell.In regard to the emergency warrants to be issued by a senior garda, Opposition Members are in something of a difficulty because we have not seen the Morris report.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	415	This has implications in regard to the ongoing work of the Morris tribunal.  Mr. Justice Morris needs to know the work he produces will not only be published but published in a timely fashion that can have an impact on legislation.  It is of little use if the information is available to the Minister but to nobody else.

What I am doing is in the spirit of what Mr. Justice Morris would want.  He has said in the past that he was disappointed that some of his views were not debated and taken into account.  I am doing my best in a difficult situation.

In page 28, lines 24 to 26, to delete subsection (4) and substitute the following:"(4) An appeal from a refusal or grant of an application for an order under this section shall lie—(a) in relation to proceedings before the District Court, to a judge of the Circuit Court,(b) in relation to proceedings before the Circuit Criminal Court or a Special Criminal Court, to a judge of the High Court, and(c) in relation to proceedings before the Central Criminal Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal, to a judge of the Supreme Court,at the instance of the prosecution or the defence.".This a drafting amendment.  As currently worded, section 27(4) provides that appeals against an order under this section lie to the High Court.  This is not necessary, however, where, for example, proceedings before the District Court are concerned.  Moreover, it does not address the question of which court shall hear an appeal against an order made under this section by the Special Criminal Court, Central Criminal Court or Court of Criminal Appeal.  This amendment aims to correct these deficiencies by clarifying the different courts to which appeals lie under this section.  I will not accept Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's related amendment.

I felt that the amount of money involved was very low for certain major establishments, which might feel they could treat the fine with contempt.  Hence, I suggest the maximum fine should be increased.

It refers in particular to the issue of broadcasts.

For the Deputy's information, the problem is that if I accepted such an amendment, it might imply that other categories of people, who are included by implication, would not be included on the principle of expressio unius.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I move amendment No. 253a:In page 29, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:"(c) Where an offence under subsection (8) has been committed by a body corporate, that body shall be liable to a fine not exceeding €250,000.”.This amendment pertains to a situation in which bodies corporate are involved, as opposed to a poor journalist, who is expected to carry the rap.  While I am unsure whether it is a valid point, it has been suggested to me that there should be a provision for the proprietors, which are normally bodies corporate, to be exposed to a penalty, as opposed to the journalist.

It relates to the question of proportionality raised earlier by Deputy Howlin in one of his amendments.  It is the same issue and I will ask the Attorney General to consider it.  When I served as Attorney General, one matter that always interested me was whether a company has a right to trial by jury.  There are two schools of thought on this.  I favour the view that companies are not necessarily entitled to jury trials, although others, including Dr. Gerard Hogan, take the other view, namely, that companies are entitled to jury trials.

Why single out offences under section 28(5) in section 28(6)?  I refer to the question of trustees disclosing information which is false or misleading.  Why has this been singled out?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	448	Section 28(6) provides that information provided by the trustee in the courts shall not be admissible in any criminal proceedings, except for an offence under section 28(5).  This was included to avoid a possible charge that it is a provision for self-incrimination, which is prohibited by Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 38 of the Constitution.  It is similar to section 14C(6) of the Proceeds of Crime Act as amended by the 2005 Act.  Having regard to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights concerning Article 6, as well as the case law of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General takes the view that section 28(6) is necessary to ensure that the Constitution is not infringed.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I move amendment No. 258:
In page 31, before section 29, to insert the following new section:29.—(1) It is an offence for a person, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse to possess or control any article with the intention of using it in the course of or in connection with the commission of—(a) an offence under section 15 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, or(b) the common law offence of kidnapping to which section 2 of, and paragraph 4 of the Schedule to, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976 applies.(2) In a prosecution for an offence under subsection (1) the court (or the jury as the case may be) may, without more—(a) having regard to all the circumstances (including the type of article alleged to have been intended for use in the course of or connection with the commission of an offence under this section), and(b) where it considers it reasonable to do so,regard possession of the article as sufficient evidence of intent for the purposes of subsection (1).(3) Where a person is charged with an offence referred to in subsection (1), no further proceedings in the matter (other than any remand in custody or on bail) may be taken except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.(4) A person guilty of an offence under this section is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.(5) In this section—"article" includes a substance, document or any thing;"document" includes—(a) a map, plan, graph, drawing, photograph or record, or(b) a reproduction in permanent legible form, by a computer or other means (including enlarging), of information in non-legible form.”.This new section is one of my pet projects.  I have considered it for a long time and I will explain why to the members.  A person was arrested while casing a bank.  When the gardaí went to his home, they discovered a plan outlining the route to work of another individual, who had no connection to the bank.  They found the latter's route to work, notes on movements and points of potential interception on that person's route to work.  This gave rise to the reasonable inference that it was a document prepared with a view to kidnapping that person.This issue has gone back and forth between the Department and the Attorney General's office.  The latter was concerned that a general offence of having a document for criminal purposes could be too widely drawn.  Hence, it is now proposed to make it an offence to have an article, with the purpose of committing an offence defined under section 15 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 or under the common law offence of kidnapping.  In a prosecution under the offence, the court and jury may take regard that possession of the article is sufficient evidence of intent, for the purposes of subsection (1).  These proceedings are confined to cases in which the Director of Public Prosecutions allows the prosecution.  It is an offence carrying a five year penalty and the term, "article", includes a substance, document or any thing.I will provide the two Deputies who are present with another example of where it might be appropriate.  If one is found in a van with a garda uniform and ties in the back——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Reading the amendment, I was not happy with it.  I now understand the background to it: it was a pet project.  It would be very difficult to prove.  I do not know whether the Minister uses the Internet and has come across the www.earth.google.com and www.maps.google.com websites.  They contain a mapping device that allows one to home in on every street on earth.  That sort of detail is available to everybody.

For an offence to be committed, one must prove the intention of using it.  The only way to do so would be by catching someone carrying out the crime or having carried out the crime in which case he or she would be charged with a different offence anyway.  Charging a person for possession of a map or document seems——
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	477	A map or document alone would probably not be enough.  However, while I do not want to intrude on someone else's privacy, the proper analogy would probably be as follows.  If a sketch was drawn showing the route from Deputy Howlin's constituency office to his home, containing a clear reference to both and if the document also showed reference to the registration number of the Deputy's car and was found in a bag with tie-ups, it might at some stage be decided that this was preparatory material for a kidnap and its possession should be an offence.

While it was not clear who had prepared the document, it was very clear that the person who had it in his possession could only have had it in his possession for the purpose of a kidnap.

In page 34, before section 30, to insert the following new section:"30.—Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 is amended—(a) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):"(1) Any person who assaults or threatens to assault—(a) a person providing medical services at or in a hospital, or(b) a person assisting such a person, or(c) a peace officer acting in the execution of a peace officer’s duty, knowing that he or she is, or being reckless as to whether he or she is, a peace officer so acting, or(d) any other person acting in aid of a peace officer, or(e) any other person with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detention of himself or herself or any other person for any offence,shall be guilty of an offence.",(b) in subsection (2), by the substitution of “€3,000” for “£1,000”,(c) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):"(3) Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs or impedes—(a) a person providing medical services at or in a hospital, knowing that he or she is, or being reckless as to whether he or she is, a person providing medical services, or(b) a person assisting such a person, or(c) a peace officer acting in the execution of a peace officer’s duty, knowing that he or she is or being reckless as to whether he or she is, a peace officer so acting, or(d) a person assisting a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty,shall be guilty of an offence.",(d) in subsection (4), by the substitution of “€1,500” for “£500”, and(e) in subsection (6)—(i) by the insertion of the following definitions:"hospital" includes the lands, buildings and premises connected with and used wholly or mainly for the purposes of a hospital;"medical services" means services provided by—(a) doctors, dentists, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, paramedics (including members of the ambulance service) or other persons in the provision of treatment and care for persons at or in a hospital, or(b) persons acting under direction of those persons;and(ii) in the definition of "peace officer", by the insertion of ", a member of the fire brigade;" after "a prison officer".".This is an extremely topical issue, as listeners to "The Gerry Ryan Show" will appreciate.  In yesterday's edition of the The
 Star I was castigated for not doing this and asked whether I was waiting for someone to be killed before taking action.  This change comes on foot of representations made to me last year by SIPTU.  The purpose is to address the problems of assaults and obstruction of personnel involved in providing services.Section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 covers assault and obstruction of peace officers, who are defined as gardaí, soldiers and prison officers, acting in the execution of their duty.  The amendment now proposed would broaden the definition of peace officers to include members of the fire brigade.  Recent media reports of a vicious assault on a member of the fire brigade when he was answering a call-out demonstrate the need for the inclusion of this provision.Section 19(1) is substituted by a new subsection to cover threats as well as assaults and to cover persons providing medical services at or in a hospital or their assistants in addition to peace officers.  Nurses, paramedics and doctors in casualty units are entitled to special protection.  Section 19(2) is amended to revise upwards the maximum fine and the penalty of five years' imprisonment remains.Section 19(3) is replaced by a new subsection which provides that any person who resists or wilfully obstructs or impedes a person providing medical services or his or her assistants at or in a hospital will be guilty of an offence, which has the same penalties.  Section 19(4) outlines the penalties for persons guilty of obstruction under section 19(3) and will apply to resisting or wilfully obstructing or impeding a peace officer, or a doctor, paramedic or nurse in a hospital.Section 19(6) provides definitions for hospitals and members of the fire brigade.

My proposal was that the offence be confined to being at or in a hospital, including its surroundings.  The Deputy's amendment would mean that any person, for example a GP or a nurse providing medical assistance would be covered.  With this type of offence it is necessary to define clearly the group of people we are trying to protect.  We did not have in mind a GP having an altercation while entering a house.  We are referring to people who are sitting targets.

In that case, it was alleged that the State was obliged to allow someone to remain in Ireland where that person could make a prima facie case that he or she would be abused by people other than the state if he or she went home.  One might ask what is wrong with this allegation.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-14 00:00:00	Prelude	544	Yes, or I could say that I am in the mafia in such a place and have offended many people.  If they get me, X or Y will happen to me.  The argument was that people who could prove someone had private grudges against them that could result in torture should be allowed to stay in Ireland on the basis of a convention against state torture.We settled the Lelimo case without it being decided on because the implications were profound.  If any type of prima facie case was proved in these torture-type cases, it would be up to the State to dislodge.  One could imagine some of the criminals in the Dublin drugs trade announcing in another state that if they were returned to Ireland, they might be tortured by rival gangs.  If they got rights of residence, it would make a nonsense of the laws in those countries.  Likewise, we will not give protection to people who say there is a threat to them from a private source that would amount to torture if carried out by the state.If the applicant in the Lelimo case had succeeded, there would have been a large hole.  For example, Romanians, Nigerians, Moldovans and so on who say they are under threat from criminal gangs at home would be able to stay in Ireland in circumstances that were never comprehended by the UN convention.  We want to make it clear that our Act, which is designed to give life to the UN convention in Ireland, is restricted to the situation concerned, that is, state torture.

I am concerned about agreeing to modify or delimit the definition of torture in a way I have not considered fully.  Are there circumstances wherein people could be sent back and tortured?  I do not mean by a criminal gang or part of a criminal conspiracy.

If I was to accept the proposition that someone could be subject to female genital mutilation and that this was a reason to stay in Ireland, half the world would be here.  There are countries where female genital mutilation is practised by a small minority.  People also have State protection against the practice.

In page 37, after line 14, to insert the following new section:"39.—(1) All property (including money and all other property, real or personal, heritable or moveable, including choses in action and other intangible or incorporeal property, including funds as defined in section 12 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005) held by any person for the use or benefit of, or for use for the purposes of, an unlawful organisation in respect of which a suppression order under section 19 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 is in force is deemed, for the purposes of that Act, the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1985 and the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005, to be the property of that unlawful organisation and those Acts apply and have effect accordingly.(2) (a) This subsection applies where the income or a substantial part of the income of a business is regularly applied for the use or benefit of, or for use for the purposes of, an unlawful organisation.(b) Where this subsection applies, both the business concerned and any property that is, or is an interest in, an asset of the business concerned are deemed to be held for the benefit of the unlawful organisation concerned and subsection (1) applies accordingly.(3) In this section—"business" means a business carried on for gain by an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons and includes a business carried on in the exercise of a profession or vocation; and"interest", in relation to an interest in a business concerned, means an interest other than one acquired under a contract made in the ordinary course of business by a person acting within his or her trade, business or profession without knowledge of the fact that the income of the business is applied for the use or benefit of, or for use for the purposes of, an unlawful organisation.".The 1939 Act stated that the real and personal property of an unlawful organisation becomes forfeit to and vested in the Minister for Justice.  Such bodies, being unincorporated and secret, do not own much property registered in their name.  The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1985 states that any moneys but not other properties held for the benefit of an unlawful organisation is deemed to be its property.  The Act only applies to money and not other forms of property because it was emergency legislation to deal with a bank account that was discovered.  The Minister will recall the case.  The recent Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act extends the definition of property to include money and all other property, real or personal, heritable or moveable, including choses in action and other intangible or incorporeal property, including funds as defined in section 12.  The gap in the 1985 Act was not amended and it is still the case that the legislation divests an unlawful organisation of money held by it or for its benefit by others but divests the organisation of other forms of property only if they are owned by the organisation.  Section 39(1) of the amendment addresses that point.Where the profits of an ostensibly bona fide business are diverted to the use of an unlawful organisation, not only should the payment in question be forfeit to the Minister but the business which is effectively owned by the organisation, since that is where its profits go, should be forfeit to the Minister.
