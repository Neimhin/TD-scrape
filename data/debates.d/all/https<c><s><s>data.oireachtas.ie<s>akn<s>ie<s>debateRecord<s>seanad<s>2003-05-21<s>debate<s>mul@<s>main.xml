Because of her support for the motion, will she also allow a free vote on the issue? In my opinion a further hour – or perhaps two – should be devoted to the debate on this issue so that all voices may be heard. We must not stifle debate in the House. The Government will not shut anyone up. We want a full, free and honest debate on this issue and that is the purpose of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Will the Leader agree that, as this is a crucial time for Irish tourism, those who work within the industry need to wake up to reality in terms of pricing? An article at the weekend outlined the excessive costs being passed on to domestic and international tourists. Ireland is pricing itself out of the tourism market. Will the Leader agree to a debate on tourism in the coming weeks so that we can concentrate on this issue? The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism could explain the measures, if any, the Government can bring forward to reduce the massive price increases taking place within the industry. If the tourism industry wants to get back on its feet, it must ensure that its cost structure is competitive and that it is giving good value for money. As a result of figures that appeared at the weekend, I believe that we do not compare favourably with other countries within the EU and those outside it. I ask for an immediate debate on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come before the House to discuss a very serious issue, namely, the continued detection of cases of BSE in this country? These cases should not be occurring because meat and bonemeal were banned in 1996. I would like the Minister to outline the scientific advice he has received in respect of this matter. I am sure the Cathaoirleach is aware that, after a ten year gap, a case of BSE has been identified in Canada and this has led to the banning of Canadian beef in the United States of America. We need to consider the scientific evidence regarding this issue because it is odd that the case to which I refer should emerge at this time. In addition, instances of the disease continue to be detected here. It is all very well to say that perhaps there are old bags of meat and bonemeal lying around, but we must investigate whether there could be any other method of spread, particularly in view of the fact that the beef industry is so important to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">I support the call for a debate on the issue of tourism, but I suggest that we extend it to include the issue of competitiveness in general. I do not want to anticipate such a debate, and I apologise for anticipating the Cathaoirleach, but it is extraordinary that headlines in newspapers always relate to prices and, in particular, wage costs. However, the most recent statement on competitiveness from the chief executive of Intel complained as much about our appalling infrastructure as it did about costs. The National Roads Authority this week admitted that it has ten projects of major road investment ready to roll, but it simply cannot commence work because the Government will not provide the necessary funding. We have an obligation to look beyond the traditional scapegoat of wage costs in assigning blame for our competitiveness problems and admit that the Government is the major cause of such problems.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">The NRA produced a survey last week which showed that observance of speed limits by trucks was worse than at the time of the previous survey by a marginal percentage. The spokesman for the road hauliers assured us that was impossible because all heavy goods vehicles have a governor, which means they cannot travel above 55 mph. Unless I encountered a low flying plane and thought it was a juggernaut, somebody is codding somebody.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Who enforces the position on governors restricting the speed of heavy goods vehicles, or does anybody do so? I have previously raised the question of the enforcement of the law in this area. Do gardaí have an understanding with truck drivers to the effect that as long as they do not break the normal speed limits they will not enforce the law? Truck drivers are not supposed to drive above 50 mph. Senator Jim Walsh has told me that the vehicles cannot be driven satisfactorily unless they are driven at 60 mph, yet the representative of the hauliers association said they are not supposed to be capable of being driven above 55 mph. The drivers of those vehicles are involved in three times as many fatal accidents as the number of those vehicles on the road would suggest they should be. This is a major issue in respect of which I ask the Leader to find out what is going on.</p>

This has happened despite the expenditure of more than €10 million on flood prevention measures in the area. I am sure there are also other stretches of the river involved. There have also been incidents of people's premia being loaded by up to 50%, compared to last year, following claims. On the day when the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has successfully negotiated an agreement with a particular insurance company regarding the penalty points system, a debate on this matter is timely.</p>

There is an opinion among many planners and others that rural housing detracts from the landscape. However, properly designed rural housing can enhance it. It is important to maintain the population in rural areas. There is a strong view among people who live in rural areas that planners and others should not curtail the development of houses in rural parishes and townlands. Any survey shows that there were more houses in many rural townlands 70 years ago than there are today. It is important we debate this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Design is an important factor. There is a problem with modern design in rural areas.

Does that not sound familiar to something happening in the health service in Ireland? We read that the Mater Hospital will cut another 180 posts. We had a debate on this issue recently but not that long ago that we cannot again debate hospital closures and what is happening in the health service. The State has a responsibility towards the safety of its citizens, especially their health. A scandal is occurring in the health service. The Minister for Health and Children should attend debates in the House on this issue on a much more regular basis in which he could inform us if he has some plans for and hope of overcoming the problem of the closure of hospital beds and avoiding outrageous situations such as the death in hospital of a person who had been lying on a trolley for four or five days.

In the other House yesterday the Taoiseach said clearly in a one sentence response to a question that the Government has no proposals to amend the groceries order and I am very heartened to hear that.

I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to come to the House to explain his position on maintaining the present height of the port tunnel which will prevent this country maintaining its competitiveness.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I join Senator Bannon in calling for a debate on rural housing. I am very aware of the problems throughout the country, particularly in my county, Clare. There has been much difficulty in relation to the role of An Taisce. There was talk in the past regarding Dúchas and I am pleased the Minister has dealt with the issue – finally, I hope. I ask the Leader to include a discussion on An Taisce in any debate, including the role of An Bord Pleanála. There is lack of information on the difference of opinion between the inspectors and the determination reached by the board in some cases. I would welcome an early debate on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I hope we might have the Tánaiste here for a debate on the future of the community employment schemes. This is the time of year when people complete their participation on these schemes. Some people who may have done three years have been told they will not be going back on schemes. It is important to clarify the role of people over the age of 50 or 55 who I understood would be able to continue indefinitely on these schemes. I would like that issue to be debated in this House as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">It will be 9 p.m. so everyone should get their voices in order. The Senator sought a debate on tourism, which is appropriate. We hope to have such a debate next week, particularly on prices being charged by people offering tourist facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Senator Henry asked to extend the debate on third level fees. That debate is being extended by half an hour. She asked for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to this House to debate the rising number of BSE cases. I will contact the Minister in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Senator Ryan raised the issue of competitiveness. I take the point that infrastructure was noted as a huge factor in the competitiveness debate, including the issue of juggernauts. They must be empty because they are travelling at such a speed. The drivers do not seem to worry about the speed limit. Everyone else tries to keep within the speed limit but these vehicles do not do so. I understand a special Garda unit deals with overloading if vehicles exceed the tare load allowed. They would be subject to Garda activity just as everyone else. However, we must make inquiries in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The Senator cast doubt on our amendment which I believe is rather elegant.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">Senator Brady referred to flood relief cover. Some €10 million is being spent on the areas which encountered flooding, yet there are reports of certain insurance companies not providing cover. That is certainly the business of the Tánaiste and I will ask her to make herself available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Senator Bannon asked for an extension of time to debate the education issue and this is being allowed. He also asked about rural housing. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, will speak today about a certain aspect of that. He is very strong on that issue. Senators Bannon, Ormonde and others asked for a debate on the design, planning and so on of rural housing. Senator Dooley and other Senators asked for a debate on the role of An Taisce. We will endeavour to get the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to come before the House to discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Senator Fitzgerald indicated that he will be delighted to participate in the tonight's debate. The Senator has left the Chamber and is probably getting ready for tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">Senator Quinn asked for a debate on health and the closures. If the Minister is available he will come before the House. The Senator also spoke about the siren that went off in his car. It would be salutary if there were sirens in cars which went off if one drove at 32 mph in a 30 mph zone. There would be a lot of sirens going off. I do not mean to make a joke of this because it is a serious issue and the deaths that occurred recently were horrendous.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Senator Ormonde supported Senator Ryan's comments about trucks. She also promises a lively debate this evening. Senator Coghlan sought more time for the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Senator Coghlan also asked when the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach will speak to each other. Both were telling the truth. The Taoiseach said there was no proposal at Cabinet, so there is no such proposal. The Tánaiste said she is considering it within her Department. Both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Senator Terry spoke about forward thinking in the construction of the port tunnel if our competitiveness is to be enhanced. I also heard the radio interview to which she referred.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_117">I thank the Members of Seanad Éireann for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate on the strategic rail review report. As they will know, the review was completed on 3 April. I thank my predecessor, the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, who, when Minister for Public Enterprise, commissioned the report. Under her leadership, substantial investment was made in the rail network over a five to six year period, to the extent that over 85% of the entire track network has been renewed. That was done at the specific insistence of my predecessor, who made a substantial contribution to the future of Irish railways.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">I am pleased that the review has already created a good debate nationwide. I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate as I strongly believe in the critical importance of rail for the future economic and social development of our country. The strategic rail review is probably the most comprehensive, significant and rigorous analysis of the rail sector ever undertaken in Ireland. It is certainly the only major analysis of rail in Ireland that advocates the revitalisation and expansion of the rail network.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">The primary purpose of the review was to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland. The review follows on from, and complements the findings of, the national spatial strategy which was published by the Government late last year. Specifically, the consultants who carried out the work were asked to: prepare a strategic framework for future Government decisions on rail development in Ireland over the next 20 years; quantify the broad financial requirements necessary to implement the recommended strategy; and assess the costs and benefits of the recommended strategy</p>
          <p eId="para_120">As part of the work on the review, an extensive public consultation process was undertaken and over 150 submissions on rail proposals were received. These ranged from upgrading existing services to reopening old lines. In addition, a number of regional workshops were held with interested parties, which greatly helped the consultants in their deliberations. It was projected that the cost of pursuing all the proposals would be in excess of €10 billion over 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The review recommends a rail capital investment programme, which would cost €8.5 billion over the next 20 years, and the Government has endorsed the broad thrust of the review's key findings and recommendations. While the Government views the report as a basis for future rail transport planning, the funding implications and the timing of delivery of various projects over the period of the review will require careful consideration in the light of Exchequer demands over that period. Consideration will also have to be given to the opportunities to use alternative funding mechanisms such as, for example, public private partnerships, development levies and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The Government recognises that, over the 20 year period, flexibility and adaptability will be required in respect of the strategy to take account of emerging land use and settlement policies and practice, particularly in urban areas. In addition, the Government recognised that, in light of developing business cases for both passenger and freight traffic, it is possible that the rail investment priorities might vary over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">I am pleased that the Government also endorsed my view that elements of the investment strategy should be accelerated over the next ten years in order to alleviate growing traffic congestion, reverse increased car dependency, maintain the competitiveness of the economy with a revitalised public transport system and prioritise balanced regional development. I have already established an implementation group, which has been charged with monitoring the implementation of the programme and reporting to me quarterly on progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">I shall deal briefly with specific proposals in the review. The proposed investment programme envisages major development of the existing network of rail services from Dublin to Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Westport, Tralee, Ballina and Rosslare. The combined investment will enable the railways to make a major contribution to balanced regional development and to act as a safe and attractive alternative to the private car. The recommended investment programme would provide for much more regular services, more reliable timetables and a better level of comfort for the customer. Cork and Belfast rail services, for example, would have hourly high-speed services and the other interurban services would run at two hourly intervals when the strategy is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Given the scope for growth in rail demand in the greater Dublin area, the review envisages that Iarnród Éireann should be aiming at a "turn up and go" service on the Dublin suburban rail network. It also envisages that the four main rail corridors coming into the city of Dublin should give commuters the type of service that would make their travel more attractive, speedy and reliable. It is acknowledged that planning flexibility is required because of the need to respond to the demographic changes and housing development along the four rail corridors, which are the backbone of the suburban system, that is, the Kildare, Maynooth, north-eastern and south-eastern corridors.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Such demographic changes may well lead to changes in the timing of investment, particularly in the Maynooth and Kildare corridors. My Department will work closely with Iarnród Éireann, the Dublin Transportation Office and the local authorities on these issues with a view to maximising rail's commercial performance and exploiting the benefits of rail for compact urban consolidation in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Arising from the public consultation process and the submissions received, the consultants considered a range of new rail schemes in various parts of the country. While I will refer later to two of them specifically, I will first make a number of points regarding the generality of these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Following the analysis undertaken by the consultants, the proposals, in the main, were not included in the recommended strategy. In most cases, the consultants concluded that after considering the patronage potential, population catchments and consistency with national policies – such as the national spatial strategy – the proposals did not warrant further analysis by them. The review recognises that it may be appropriate as circumstances change to consider such proposals at a later stage. However, the development of a sound economic case, backed up by the development of supportive land use and settlement strategies by the relevant local authorities, would be needed to justify further analysis being undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Turning to two of the rail proposals considered by the consultants, the Cork suburban rail proposals were examined by the consultants in the context of the recommendations of the Cork area strategic plan and a recently completed feasibility study. The positive feasibility analysis is grounded particularly on the delivery of the Cork area strategic plan land use development strategy because, without it, the financial and economic arguments for the rail proposals are significantly weaker. The Cork rail proposals also fit well with the aims of the national spatial strategy. The strategic rail review in general affirms the positive conclusions of the feasibility study and the Cork rail scheme is included in the recommended investment strategy. I am awaiting the views of Iarnród Éireann on the feasibility study and the strategic rail review with regard to the Cork rail proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The western rail corridor is the term applied to the Sligo-Cork and the Galway-Cork rail proposals. The rail corridor was identified by the consultants as fitting in particularly well with the aims of the national spatial strategy. However, the review concludes that the proposals could only become viable if the relevant planning authorities incorporated the proposals into regional, county and local development plans and land use and transportation strategies. The viability of any rail project is critically dependent on it being supported by the adoption of suitable complementary land use and transport policies, otherwise there would not be the basis of developing sufficient rail demand to justify the very significant investment involved. These are the critical prerequisites that would first have to be taken before a detailed feasibility study could be undertaken. The appropriate decisions are ones to be considered closely at regional and local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Recognising that the western rail corridor fits in well with the aims of the national spatial strategy, I wish to be as helpful as I can in ensuring that the relevant authorities in the west are fully aware of these prerequisites. Accordingly, I have already announced that I will make consultancy advice available to the four regional authorities who would have a primary interest in the western rail corridor. This would be provided in the context of the development by the regional authorities of the regional planning guidelines, which is now underway throughout the eight regional authorities. I also propose inviting the Western Development Commission to participate in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">With regard to the relationship between the State and Iarnród Éireann, the review recommends that a clear mandate to Iarnród Éireann is necessary on its role in developing a railway suitable for a modern economy and society. Following on from the recommendations of the study, Iarnród Éireann – the Way Forward, published in July 2001, the review acknowledges that major changes are necessary within the company if it is to deliver on the proposed strategy. In helping the company to adapt to meet the challenges of the review, I will shortly bring to the Government proposals for clear and defined service level agreements between the State and Iarnród Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">My Department and the company will now set about establishing a long-term framework for investment and financing in light of the need for enhanced revenue and reduced cost per passenger kilometre and the need to: promote service integration to encourage a modal use, particularly in urban areas; establish the rail freight business as a separate entity within Iarnród Éireann; and explore the scope for greater joint ventures and greater private sector participation in the area of rail freight in particular. I have asked Iarnród Éireann to come forward in the coming weeks with a plan for a freight business based on these recommendations and to take particular account of the European Union Transport Council directive, which requires the opening up of access to the rail freight market to international services by 2006 and to domestic services by 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The recommended investment programme will cost €8.5 billion. It is clearly necessary to consider different ways of funding it, including public private partnerships and development levies. Iarnród Éireann is also considering how to process and progress the Cork rail feasibility study and I expect to hear from it shortly on that and other issues. It is anticipated that the investment under consideration will involve further upgrading of rail commuter services in the greater Dublin area, including: the provision of increased capacity on DART and out suburban services to Drogheda, Dundalk, Maynooth, Kildare and Arklow; improving the quality, journey times and frequency of all radial inter-city routes; upgrading rolling stock; additional improvements in reliability and safety; and improving station facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The strategic rail study is a valuable blueprint and input into policy, which it will help to guide. I hope the revitalisation of the railways will continue strongly in the years ahead. In accepting the broad thrust of the review, the Government does not regard it as a set of handcuffs but an input and valuable guide into our consideration of the future of the railways. I have already made clear publicly that in many respects I do not consider it to be ambitious enough. There is no mention of TGVs or bullet trains, even in 20 years' time. In that context, I have said publicly that I regard the review as an input into policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">I am pleased that the Government has agreed to my proposal that many aspects of the 20 year strategy would be brought forward immediately. The Government is currently investing €400 million the rail service. In the past five years, approximately €1.5 billion has been invested. I am pleased to inform the House that the budget for the next five years is also approximately €400 million per annum. This amounts to an investment of approximately €3 billion over ten years. We are doing this because we believe in railways. I am a great believer in developing the railway system. Some Senators, including Senator Mansergh, will recall my electioneering and campaigning for the reopening of the Harcourt Street line.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_138">Over the years I have tried to convince many Ministers with responsibility for transport of the need to reopen the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">In considering the position of Ireland today and what it may be like in ten or 15 years, it is necessary to be pro-railway. Greater economic growth will lead to more car ownership and greater congestion. No matter how much is invested in the road network, it will always be a case of trying to catch and keep up with the growth in car ownership. It, therefore, behoves us to invest in the rail system for the long term, especially in the area of freight, which will lead to a reduction in the number of trucks on the road, and in the area of public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I am also pleased that the strategic rail review fits in with the national spatial strategy, about which the Minister for Environment and Local Government has spoken. I also have a message for the local authorities. Senators will doubtless refer to lightly used lines and lines that should be considered for reopening. My door is open with regard to the consideration of these projects, but the local and regional authorities must take the tough decisions necessary to realise them. There is no point in approaching me with a request to open a railway line and then agreeing at a council meeting to rezone property 20 miles away which has nothing to do with the railway. Policies must be joined up and integrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Contrary to the recommendations of the consultants, I have kept the door open for communities, local and regional authorities and local businesses to make a case to the Government on any particular rail in a hard-headed way that will show the investment input from the private sector and the land settlement policies, including the planning and zoning strategies, that are necessary to make it happen. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot have a wish list which includes the opening of railway lines while making decisions which fail to support that goal. I send that message loudly and clearly to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I do not plan to close any railway lines, but I am conscious that lightly used lines represents a challenge to the marketers. If Iarnród Éireann and everyone else involved wishes to keep lightly used lines open, they will have to do better than point to 20 or 30 users per day. Sleeves will have to be rolled up to begin attracting business on these trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">I refer in particular to the track from Waterford to Limerick. I fail to see why two of our major cities should not be able to maintain a proper rail service into the future, but to do so is a major challenge for marketers in Iarnród Éireann and elsewhere. If Iarnród Éireann cannot do it, we should discuss the matter and examine our options, though I have enough trouble at the moment without travelling down that particular track.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">I thank Senators for this debate. I will stay to listen for as long as I can, but I must depart in about 20 minutes to answer parliamentary questions in the Dáil. I will take careful account of what Senators say, but my message is straightforward. This is the first report to recommend revitalising the railways. Every other report recommended shutting them down in some way or other. I am pro-railways and I want to continue to invest in them. We will put in about €2 billion over the next five years. With regard to lightly used lines and the new lines we should continue to look at, the door is open but people should only come through if they have hard-headed proposals to make things happen.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_148">I welcome the Minister to the House. This Government has a tendency to produce reports which it believes to be the end of a matter whereas in my view that is only the beginning. There is a great deal of fine information in this report and many ideas. I am impressed by the Minister's speech in which he has admitted that some parts of the report are flawed and can be improved upon. He says he will use the report as a guideline, but it will not be his bible.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">We must remember that the 2002 census figures revealed that up to 70% of the population lives within 15 minutes drive of a railway station, which is food for thought for all of us. In 2002, €1.2 billion was spent by the NRA on roads, yet only €1.25 billion has been allocated to the rail system over 20 years for the Dublin area. We need to get our priorities right. We must examine the funding we provide to different infrastructural elements and question the value for money we get. We must be realistic. We cannot put railway stations everywhere, but while we depend on cars and roads, we should encourage people to use public transport as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">I am encouraged by the reference in the Minister's speech to the zoning of land, a matter on which everyone in the House will agree with him. However, I ask him to be helpful to the local authorities involved. He should issue a letter to the local authorities, many of which are compiling new development plans, informing them of his and his Department's viewpoint. He should encourage proper zoning in the context of existing railways lines. Without that encouragement, local authorities will be reluctant to zone in advance of the construction of new stations. The Minister might give a commitment that he will ensure the opening on time of a station if a certain number of houses are built in an area. That would be helpful and it would encourage better planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I am very encouraged by the references to freight services in the Minister's speech. When we previously debated the issue every Member was unhappy with Iarnród Éireann's attitude. The company has basically thrown its hands in the air and declared that the service is not working, but it has no enthusiasm for making it work. I appreciate that Ireland is different in that it is an island, but there is still scope to improve rail freight services. If Iarnród Éireann cannot do it, someone else should be allowed to have a go, which is why I am encouraged by the Minister's statement regarding the possible privatisation of the freight service. It is a step in the right direction. I look forward to returning to the matter in a few years' time to see that the rail freight system has been totally revitalised and that there are far fewer problematic heavy goods vehicles on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The Minister said there was no mention of French-style TGV or bullet trains in the report. Has the idea of night trains been explored? The last train leaving for Carlow and Waterford each evening departs from Dublin at 6.20 p.m. It is a pity and later trains should be scheduled. The train leaving Carlow at 6.30 a.m. is unheated and lacks catering facilities, which is horrendous in the middle of January when it is minus 10º outside and one is frozen and tired. While Iarnród Éireann has plans to upgrade the Carlow-Dublin line, Carlow should be considered in the context of the commuter belt given its proximity to Dublin. There is a huge population from Dublin living in Carlow now, among whom is the Minister's good daughter.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">The Iarnród Éireann mentality about the purchase of trains is of concern. I do not understand why the company cannot consider leasing rather than buying trains as this could save money in the long run. The Minister made reference to private sector participation in freight services. Will there be private sector participation in the general management of rail services? Perhaps the Minister will expand his comments on those issues at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I would welcome a return to this subject in the House in one year as part of an ongoing review of this report and our rail strategy. We should not leave the matter at today's debate. It would be useful to examine how we are advancing rail services.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">If one were a tourist from America looking at the initial map in the review, one would think no one lived in Donegal. One would think the county was a vastly depopulated area like the Sahara or the Kalahari desert.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_158">I am not using this as a political football and this is not a political bashing session. The Minister knows that 140,000 people live in Donegal and he knows its hinterland. He has three ministerial colleagues from there and he will have heard from them on the subject. I assume I am not telling him anything new.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">We have an opportunity in Donegal. Under the spatial strategy, the route between Derry and Letterkenny is highlighted as a linear pathway with gateway status and a symbolic cross-Border project such as a rail service there must be included in the strategic rail review. It is imperative to adhere to the spirit of the Good Friday agreement and to break down every political and administrative barrier between Letterkenny and Derry.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The Minister is open-minded enough to believe that consultants should not lead this country. As he said in his speech, this is about economic and social development. As my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, knows from living in Cavan, we have been suffering along the Border from economic, political and social partition. Talk about cross-Border and inter-regional co-operation is aspirational thus far. That would change with something as symbolic as a rail service between Letterkenny and Derry, which is not a new idea. That railway track existed in the past. On behalf of the people of Donegal and Derry and of the north-west region I plead with the Minister today to replace it.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">People in that part of the country feel isolated. The citizens of Donegal are asking why they are not worthy of the same train service as people in the south. It is a case which deserves consideration. The European White Paper on transportation policy refers to the reopening of existing tracks, which is being done throughout Europe. It has also emphasised that there must be cross-border regional railway projects. Therefore, I am being parochial in this regard, but not without justification because I speak on behalf of some 140,000 Donegal citizens who ask why the report does not recommend that their area be tied into the existing network.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Some four months ago, Donegal County Council unanimously passed a motion on reopening the existing track between Derry and Letterkenny. A project team has been set up under the guidance of Mr. John McLoughlin, director of roads in Donegal, and there is massive goodwill from county council engineers as well as Donegal people from as far away as Switzerland, England, Scotland and America who wish to be part of the project. May people contacted me when this motion appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I plead with the Minister to follow his heart. He has indicated that he is willing to listen. This is not a party political issue, because the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, and Deputy Cecilia Keaveney will all sing from the same hymn sheet. I am glad the Minister is leaving the door open and I will give him every credit in Donegal if he opens the door for this project.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_164">I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I welcome the report and congratulate the consultants, Booz-Allen Hamilton, for what is a comprehensive document. It sets out an excellent framework for the development of the railways. I do not agree with every element of it and, like my colleagues opposite, I will deal with some parochial issues later. However, it represents a good discussion document and I am heartened by what the Minister has said in relation to its not being the definitive Government policy, but rather that it provides the framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I join the Minister in complimenting the vision and foresight of the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, on seeking to redress the failure of successive Governments, represented by all parties, to invest in the railways. The decision of the then Minister has made it possible to move forward in the vein we have talked about.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The review is about the answering of four basic questions. What is the current state and status of the rail network and how might it respond to the developing needs and expectations? What role will rail play in the national strategic planning of the State over the next 20 years? The Minister has referred to this, as well as the innovations which are unfortunately not included in the report but which can be added at a later stage. We are looking towards 2020 and must ask where we can reasonably expect the railway sector to be as part of a modern European economy. The Minister has identified the projected increases in road traffic. Therefore, we need to strengthen the railways to ensure we do not have the continuous congestion we are only now seeking to grapple with. How will the railway network get to where we need it to be?</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The document sets out a vision for the railways to provide safe, reliable and consumer-focused transport services in support of the State's wider social, economic, environmental and land-use policies. Services will be integrated with other modes of transport and will support the economic development of the State as a whole. As the Minister has said, integration is vitally important. The review provides the framework within which the Government can implement an ambitious and realistic programme for the future development of the rail passenger and freight sectors. It lays a foundation upon which we can build to revitalise the railways and plan a modern and highly-efficient transport system for the benefit of this and future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The important thing about the review is that it takes the national spatial strategy into account and identifies the priorities which have been set as part of Government policy. As the Minister has said, it is vitally important that we do not develop a railway line in isolation. It must be done in conjunction with the development principles of local and regional authorities to ensure that whatever infrastructure is put in place, the relevant development plans are there to co-ordinate with it so that it does not become a white elephant.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Minister has identified some of the areas in the report which concern me. From a parochial point of view, I wish to refer to the Shannon rail link. While the document clearly sets out that it complies with the vision of the national spatial strategy, it questions the level of usage of the link. This is an excellent opportunity to identify a particular project that complies with the national spatial strategy and, at the same time, to lead by example. This is a chicken and egg scenario, as so many of these development are. However, when the service is put in place, the business will follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">It is recognised that any modern and successful airport needs to have a rail link. Shannon is particularly important because it is a gateway rather than a destination, taking in Limerick city and Ennis. Given the level of traffic that uses the area, it is critical that a spur be established there. Some of the costs are of concern but there are potentially ways around them. The scheme meets many of the criteria which the Minister has identified in terms of bringing local authorities on board. Clare County Council has come together with Limerick City and County Councils and they are enthusiastic supporters of the scheme, as are those who run the airport. They see the benefits associated with having such a rail link.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">A consortium owns Shannon town centre and is investing €135 million into the redevelopment of the area. The consortium has indicated that it is putting together another consortium of the local authorities, the airport authority and Shannon Development together with a construction company, Beaux Walk Properties. This group plans to put a case to the Minister in the coming weeks in support of what it believes to be a viable enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">There are some 300,000 weekly trips between the three centres of Shannon, Ennis and Limerick. Based on a projection of about 15% of that business transferring to the rail network, there is a belief that this is viable. The scheme refers only to the spur because the Ennis-Limerick line has been upgraded and considerable work is continuing on it, which has been helpful in assisting the commuter link between Limerick and Ennis.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">There is a belief that some of the costs outlined in this document may be exaggerated, based on the need for more detailed planning locally and this consortium is putting that together. It will need some assistance from the Government and I hope that, when we discuss the issue at a later stage, those handcuffs will have been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The Ballybrophy line, which takes in part of County Clare at Birdhill, is lightly used and, while it is not densely populated, the line picks up on a number of towns such as Nenagh, Roscrea and those in County Laois and onwards. Again there is a chicken and egg situation in that the report seems to indicate that there is not enough business there. My experience of using that rail link is that I am surprised there is any business on the line because of the lack quality of service, poor time-tabling, infrequency of services and the quality of the carriages. None of that encourages people to use the service. If there were some level of improvement in the infrastructure and service, it would attract more people since it targets the Limerick catchment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The Minister made specific reference to the western rail corridor, which is welcome. The Government is serious about its policies on balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy. As I said in relation to the spur to Shannon and the Limerick-Ballybrophy line, if the service is put in place, it will be used. The Minister's commitment to fund the consultants' study of the Cork-Sligo line is welcome. It is incumbent upon the regional authorities to become part of this. It is also incumbent on us, as politicians, to work together no matter what side of the House we are on. The level of interest from the Opposition today is welcome and the debate has been balanced and reasonable. If we can work towards these aims together with the regional authorities and local business interests which have something to gain, we will certainly see success. It is a matter of focusing investment in the west. If the infrastructure is put in place, with decentralisation policies that I know are under review in the Department of Finance, these services will be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The report is not negative. While I have identified some areas about which I am concerned, there is also much that is positive. The Minister talked about the hourly high speed services to Cork and Belfast, two hourly services on other inter-urban routes, more regular services and reliable timetables. These are hugely welcome because due to lack of investment during the years the level of participation in the service by the public was low. There was always a perception that the service was not good and that if one wanted reliability, one had to take the car. The measures outlined here and the investment identified will help to address this.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_182">It is clearly the Minister's intention to secure this amount. One must welcome his positive commitment to the development of rail services. It is important to clarify the amount of funding that will be available because the rail service, as we know, has suffered badly for many years from under-investment. In that context, the report is welcome. For the first time in a long time, it sets out the needs of the rail service as we move through the new century.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The context of rail has changed completely with the economic prosperity we have experienced over the last ten years or so but unfortunately this has not been matched in terms of investment. Now, not only is rail the poor relation having been starved of funds it is also simply not capable of meeting the demands of the economy. It is suffering from such serious fundamental problems that even if the investment took place, the infrastructure would not be able to cope. One of the useful elements of the report is that the issues – one of which is the manner in which Iarnród Éireann runs the network – are examined well and dealt with in a relatively positive fashion. This is essential because even if a lot of money is invested in coming years, unless we deal with the internal structure of Iarnród Éireann – how it is delivering the service – we will be wasting our time.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Recently I took the train from Thurles to Dublin. I do not, as a matter of course, carry a lot of cash around as I do not think it is a good idea. When I arrived at Thurles railway station, there was a queue at the ticket desk and by the time the train arrived I still had no ticket. I got on the train and when the ticket collector came around, I tried to buy a ticket with a card, only to be told that they did not take plastic – in 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">There is a need for the rail service to be upgraded and increased investment in rail to meet the economic needs of the country. Anybody who read the series run by <i>The Irish Times</i> recently on commuting, now a feature of many people's lives, will have noted the constant references to people's desire to use rail to get to work. Those who can do but a huge number cannot. Rail should be used much more in order to move our labour force around and ensure it is not spending 12 hours a day travelling, working and travelling home again. This has negative implications for their local areas, in which they are rarely present, and family life. I meet commuters all the time and they are under huge personal pressure. It is true that this has happened over a small number of years and it would have been difficult for any economy to have planned for it but rail can and should play a huge role in ensuring our workforce gets around in a more efficient fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Like other Senators, I will speak parochially on the issue of tourism. Senator Dooley referred to the proposed Shannon rail spur which is referred to in the report as a development which would not only link into the national spatial strategy but also play a huge role in terms of regional development and the tourism development of the area. This project would have to be linked, however, to the enhancement of the Limerick-Ballybrophy line. The Minister knows of my interest in this – I have attended meetings in his Department on the matter and he knows that we have established a local partnership to deal with it. In towns such as Nenagh and Roscrea we feel very strongly about the importance of upgrading this line. The report states clearly, more than once, that it is lightly served but as Senator Dooley pointed out and as we have indicated to the Minister many times, one of the reasons for this is that the trains are so infrequent and unsuitable that people find they cannot use the service even if they want to. I hope that despite the fact that the report has effectively consigned the line to the bottom of the heap in terms of investment, the Minister will consider the value of developing it, particularly in terms of commuting to Limerick. Dublin is not the only city suffering ongoing problems because of the number of commuters travelling in and out every day – Limerick is having exactly the same problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Linked to this, however, is the potential for tourism involved in developing a link from Shannon to Limerick and on to the towns of north Tipperary. Tourists getting off the aeroplane at Shannon Airport could simply hop on a train and have access to the whole region. This would significantly enhance the potential of the region, particularly in the light of the difficulties being faced by the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I point to environmental issues and concerns. Hardly a day passes in this House, particularly on the Order of Business, when the issues of traffic, freight transport, the number of heavy goods vehicles on the roads, the impact of traffic on people's quality of life, the danger posed by those now using the roads on a continuous basis or the environmental hazards traffic causes not only in terms of the level of emissions but also the difficulties being faced by those living in villages and small towns used as rat runs by heavy goods vehicles are not raised. Any of us could give a long list of the areas affected in the constituencies we represent. Rail has an important role to play in encouraging people to leave their cars at home, to travel by rail and reach their destinations faster.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The Minister referred – as is stated in the report – to the importance of having a policy on rail development in the context of an integrated ticketing or joined up policy. In that context, I point to the national spatial strategy, to which only some elements of the report are linked. If a hub was developed around Limerick, it would make a good deal of sense to develop a commuter line from Limerick to north Tipperary. Such a line would encourage development and greater investment, particularly foreign investment, in the area and take pressure off other areas such as the east coast and Dublin which are developing too fast.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I was disappointed that the western rail corridor did not receive a higher priority or was not singled out for investment. In the context of the national spatial strategy and regional development, the development of a western rail corridor would have great benefits not only for the region but also for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Like others, I generally welcome the report but have a concern about the Ballybrophy line. I welcome the fact that the Minster has stated at meetings and in this House that he will not oversee the closure of any line. The state of the Ballybrophy line is such that it is, effectively, going nowhere.</p>

        <heading>Strategic Rail Review Report: Statements (Resumed).</heading>
        <speech by="#TomMorrissey" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_199">I compliment the Minister on coming to the House so quickly after his visit here last week. I particularly compliment him on his speech, to some aspects of which I wish to refer. On the greater Dublin area, he said Iarnród Éireann should be aiming at a "turn up and go" attitude. I would be pleased to see that happen as that is what is needed. When one considers the awesome figures about to be spent on rail, according to the report, one will have to ensure that not only will we pour money into the system but also that it will be reformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Senator O'Meara gave anecdotal evidence of her experience of using Irish Rail. The practice which has developed on the Great Northern Line since 1962 whereby train drivers leave a train at Connolly Station and drive another back leaving another driver to take the train to Pearse Street Station or on to Arklow will have to stop. We have been fed a diet by Irish Rail for the past ten years that there is a capacity constraint at Connolly Station. This issue is not addressed fully but skirted around in the report. I want existing capacity utilised before we start pouring millions of euro – it is questionable whether we have the necessary resources – into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Platforms 5, 6, and 7 in Connolly Station are used as through platforms for trains travelling North to South and for the DART. A train from Drogheda arrives at the station at 4.45 p.m. and stops on a through platform for three quarters of an hour before another driver boards the train at 5.30 p.m. to take it on to Arklow. A train from Rosslare arrives at the station at 6 p.m. and stops at platform 5 until 6.30 p.m. Irish Rail has told us there is a capacity constraint in the station, yet 33% of its platforms are not being utilised. This can be compared to Dublin Bus parking a bus on O'Connell Street outside Clery's and saying there is a problem on O'Connell Street. It is an operational difficulty and I am delighted the Minister is present to here me say it. He has to examine the operational difficulties and management practices in place since 1962. I have spoken to Irish Rail on the subject. However, it does not consider it as an issue because this has been the custom and practice on the Great Northern Line since 1962.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I do not believe we will see the implementation of an integrated ticketing system based on my experience of booking a ticket by plastic card with Irish Rail. If we are to develop an integrated ticketing system as the Minister, other Members of the House and I would wish, the existing system will have to be addressed. If one wants to book a train ticket in advance by credit card, one telephones Heuston Station but the staff will not take the details over the telephone. One must fax them to Heuston Station where a staff member then faxes them to the offices in Abbey Street where the paperwork is done. They are then communicated to Heuston Station via telephone and a staff member in the station faxes the customer details of the reference number. One then collects one's ticket at the station. I had this experience, except that when my children went to collect their tickets they were not there. They were told to go to the back of the queue and buy more tickets. When I rang the station the following Monday morning, a staff member asked me what the trouble was given that my credit card had not even been debited and, therefore, what was I complaining about.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">In an era when Ryanair and Aer Lingus can sell air tickets to Europe and elsewhere on the Internet, why can Irish Rail not sell its customers a train ticket to go even as far as Naas or Newbridge? These are the difficulties we have to address if millions or billions of euro are to be spent on the rail system. I would like the Minister to examine this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The Minister referred to Dublin and the possibility of introducing new lines. To my knowledge, there has not been an increase in the population in the northern direction of the DART line since 1991. However, there has been a 40% increase in the population along the western line in the direction of Maynooth, Kilcock and Kildare since 1991. That is the direction in which resources must be spent. It is in Dublin that investment in housing and industrial development has been taking place for the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We must bring into the equation Irish Rail's under-utilised capacity. I refer, in particular, to the tunnel running under the Phoenix Park. We are aware of the cost of building tunnels. A joint committee discussed the possibility of building a metro in Dublin. We have a tunnel with signals that is not being utilised. If we were to build such a tunnel, having regard to acquisition and legal costs, public representation and oral hearings, it would not happen for five or ten years and then at great cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We also have an area known as the Liffey junction in Cabra, which could have five platforms at the one level and which is completely under-utilised. It is the area where the Phoenix Park tunnel emerges. We have lines going to the docks, including Spencer Dock, which have been under-utilised for the past ten to 20 years. Irish Rail must examine its existing capacity and apply its management expertise to utilising it.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">In the past five years we have spent more than €1 billion on public investment in our rail network under the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke. We have been told today in the strategic rail review that we will have to spend another €10 billion in that regard, which I am sure people will find staggering. We are aware that this type of money is not available. While such development is planned over a 20 year period, the country cannot wait such a period for a solution to the problem. We will have to decide our priorities. If we are to invest this type of money in our rail network and at the same time seek to invest in a metro for Dublin, we will have to examine how such a system can be supplied. We will have to seriously question the RPA figures and how it can come up with a figure of €5 billion for the line to Dublin Airport when a similar proposal in Madrid has been costed at a fraction of this figure. In Madrid more than 100 km of metro have been built in recent years. Using the Madrid model figures, we could have a Luas line all the way to Dingle. In this light, there is something wrong with the figures of the Rail Procurement Agency. We must examine the manner in which we carry out such projects and how Europeans carry them out.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">One cannot question the Madrid model. The project was completed in the past five to ten years, not decades ago. Given that Ireland and Spain are in the euro zone and work with the same currency, there must be some other reason for the costs given to the Minister. I am delighted those involved in Madrid are coming to Ireland to speak to the Minister and his Government colleagues because we will then be able to compare and contrast.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The RPA estimates that the metro for Dublin would cost €10 billion –€13 billion if the extension mentioned in the strategic report was included. We know this type of money is not available. We will have to decide where our priorities lie, which might mean examining the feasibility of those lines beside which large populations do not reside and investing resources in population growth areas instead. With this in mind, the Minister will have to examine how Dublin is growing. I was delighted to hear him say that county councils would have to examine land use, by which I presume he means rezoning, and that, if railways were to be built, they would have to serve proper populations.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">This has happened in Dublin 15, the Clonee area in west Dublin, out as far as Dunshaughlin and Kilcock. These are the areas for which I appeal to the Minister to bring forward proposals and for which the rail system has only been upgraded marginally in the past ten years by a twin track from Clonsilla to Maynooth. They need to be seriously examined with a view to removing traffic from roads. It is not sustainable for new communities to be established in west Dublin, on the fringes of the city where people have bought houses at exorbitant prices without a proper transport system being put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I believe in the rail network as the Minister does. I was delighted to hear his speech. I favour his proposals for the break-up of CIE. We will need to see a "turn up and go" attitude implemented in the organisation if the Minister is to give it the amount of money in question. Otherwise, we will be back in this House in five or ten years' time equating the Department of Transport to the Department of Health and Children in that we will have poured millions into it and received nothing in return. Value for money and reform must be the Minister's by-words. I wish him well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I welcome the review group's report. While I do not agree with all its contents, I certainly welcome it as a forum for discussion and debate on rail services.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I worked for a company in Waterford Port for more than 20 years. In that time we had a booming freight business. Two trains a night came from Dublin and one each from Cork, Limerick and Belfast. We also had links with Sligo and Ballina. Almost 30% of port traffic in Waterford was by rail. However, it became uncompetitive and almost all that traffic is now by road. This increases the volume of heavy goods vehicles on the road, which is not good for the environment or road safety. I would welcome greater investment in rail services, especially freight.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I welcome what the Minister said in respect of public private partnerships, that he would investigate the possibility of PPPs for freight, in particular. One of the major companies in Waterford is prepared to invest money in the rail network to improve services and links. That is the direction in which we should go. We should welcome private investment in the rail network.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Looking at the report in terms of the south-east, although it states the "do nothing" strategic option has been rejected, it is alarming that the Limerick-Limerick Junction-Waterford-Rosslare line is excluded from those lines recommended for investment. The only conclusion to be taken from this omission is that services along this line will cease over time which will ultimately result in it being closed. This is exactly what one would expect from a "do nothing" approach. Certainly the people in the south-east are alarmed and concerned about the report in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The Dublin to Rosslare line is also not included for investment purposes in the "going for growth" option in the review. This means the only investment proposed for the line is that which will maintain current services and networks, possibly with some improvements. With Rosslare being one of the major ports and key access points not only in the south-east but also the country, it is not encouraging to see this in the report. This part of the report should be re-examined because there is a need for investment in these lines and certainty that they will be kept open. It is fine for the Minister to say they will be kept open but we also want them operational and in good order.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">In general, I welcome the report because it is a good vehicle for debate and we have had a good exchange of views on it. The company which compiled it is to be commended. It is obviously an expert in the field internationally. I welcome the report in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Regarding inter-urban routes, the Waterford to Dublin line needs to be upgraded. It still takes about two and three quarter hours to travel from Waterford to Dublin, which is crazy. There is a need for a two hour express train in the mornings, especially for business purposes. It is something for which the South-East Regional Authority, the chambers of commerce and local authorities in the area have pressed for some time. It is not very encouraging that it is stated it will happen some time between 2010 and 2020. Many of us will not be around at that stage. This should be expedited, if possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_221">I thank the Minister for attending. I know Senator Browne will be delighted because this is the third time the Minister has come to the House within a week. I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and welcome back Senator Cummins. It is good to see him back and, importantly, in a mild mood.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I welcome the review and the proposed €10 billion investment over the next 20 years. Unfortunately, we cannot use the pun "looking down the tracks" in my region because we do not have any. They were taken up some time ago, unfortunately. That said, I wish to concentrate on my region.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Of the 27 possible links examined in the review, three are in the Cavan and Donegal areas. The first is a track from Donegal town to Cavan and on to Dublin; the second from Mullingar to Cavan, and the third is the direct link between Navan and Connolly Station at a projected cost of €408 million. Unfortunately a feasibility study on this proposed route was not carried out because the Department stated that it was waiting for the spatial strategy to be announced. As that strategy was not announced in time, the study was not included.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">In 2001, my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, Vincent Reynolds of the county enterprise board and Patrick Sexton, chairman of Cavan Urban Council as it then was, had a meeting with officials from the Department of Public Enterprise regarding a link from Cavan to Dublin. No funding was allocated at that time, the spatial strategy being given as the excuse. The spatial strategy has been published since this review and I am pleased that Cavan and Monaghan have been identified as hub towns in that strategy. It is worth noting that of the nine towns selected for hub status, Cavan and Monaghan are the only towns without a rail link. My colleague, Senator McHugh, referred to Letterkenny as the only gateway town that does not have a rail link. The citizens of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal feel very hard done by. They have no rail link and must endure horrific traffic congestion in order to get to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The BMW regional authority is very committed to the provision of a rail link between Sligo and Limerick via Galway and I support that proposal. In my county, there is an industrial rail line linking Kingscourt and Navan and I support the development of that line into a commuter line serving east Cavan and the huge population of the Carrickmacross area.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Senator Mansergh suggested that there should be support for a link between Navan and Drogheda in the first instance. I prefer to go with the Navan to Connolly station direct route if that is feasible in the short term rather than the long term. I welcome the review and I will insist on Cavan being serviced in some manner in the near future. I suggest that the Navan-Connolly station route is the most feasible and I urge the Minister to pursue that option.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_227">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House. I am pleased the House has the opportunity to discuss the strategic rail review. I compliment the Minister and the former Minister, Senator Mary O'Rourke, on their investment in the rail infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I am a member of the western inter-county railway committee which was formed some years ago. The honorary secretary is Father Micheál Mac Greil and it is chaired by a former Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas, Martin J. O'Toole. We have been campaigning for a long time to have the Sligo-Limerick line upgraded. We saw that as a Euro-route which could continue to Rosslare. We also campaigned for the inclusion of Donegal and the north-west. This report refers to the route as the Sligo-Cork line but whichever way one looks at it, it is a western corridor which must be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, seems to be more appreciative of the socio-economic value of the line than was the strategic rail review. The public reaction has been very favourable to the Minister's comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Perhaps the main achievement of our committee is that we prevented the lifting of the track which was contemplated during the time Deputy Brennan was Minister for Communications in a previous Government. That line is now a very valuable asset for the people and for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The national spatial strategy has identified the hub and gateway towns, a good number of which are along the western corridor. There are three new schemes which could fit in well with that report, the Cork suburban, Cork-Galway and the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis lines. However, the report only recommends the Cork suburban line and that does not bode too well for the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Galway city has a very central rail terminus but there is no proposal to spend money on that line. It could be used to take commuter traffic into Galway, particularly as the trains coming from Dublin do not arrive at a suitable time for people from Athlone or Ballinsloe to get to work in Galway.  I am very concerned about the Tuam line, where the famous film "The Quiet Man" was filmed. People from Claremorris and Tuam could use that line if it were included in the strategy and similarly from Ennis and Gort into Galway. The section of the line serving Galway city should be used for commuter traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I am pleased that freight traffic is again using the line and this is very important for the timber industry. Timber is being transported by rail from the west and north-west to Waterford. If Iarnród Éireann is not going to provide this service then it should be provided by some other body.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I welcome the provision for expenditure on Galway station. The report states that €3 million will be spent on the line from Galway to Athlone some time between 2009 and 2014; I do not think we can wait that long. There will be an expenditure of €3 million on a bay between Athlone and Portarlington and a further €3 million on another passing bay between Galway and Athlone in the period 2015 to 2022. This House should request the Government, the Minister and Iarnród Éireann to spend this money earlier because none of us will be able to wait that long for development of the railway.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_235">I welcome the report and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank the Minister, Deputy Brennan, for introducing this debate. The report provides food for thought and it has generated much debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">As other speakers have said, we cannot afford to wait ten, 15 or 20 years for some of those developments. The Minister said that it will cost €2 billion and that the Government does not have €2 billion at the moment. It would seem that they do not have €2 never mind €2 billion to spend on the rail services if we believe everything we read and see in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I welcome some parts of the report which refer to the improvement of journey times and the upgrading of rolling stock, station facilities and customer services. Several speakers have mentioned the lack of dining-car facilities on some routes. When there was no competition on air routes, Aer Lingus provided meals on their flights but the advent of Ryanair helped to reduce the cost of air transport and we owe that company a great debt of gratitude. The majority of rail routes do not require the provision of dining-cars but rather a fast, efficient service. Many routes are within one hour travelling time of Dublin. Athlone, Kildare, Tullamore, Drogheda and Dundalk, parts of Wicklow and Wexford are all within one hour of Dublin and dining-car facilities are not required.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">All the other routes, with the exception of the Cork route, take far too long. The route from Westport to Dublin still takes three and three quarter hours, even though we are grateful for the upgrading of the new welded line, which has been very satisfactory. Travel times must be decreased.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Senator Cummins said that the Waterford to Dublin journey takes two and three quarter hours. Surely if one can travel from Dublin to Cork in little more than two hours one should be able to travel from Waterford to Dublin in two hours or less. The Galway, Westport, Sligo and Limerick routes should all take two and a half hours. Some of the western trains to Dublin stop at every station. There should be no need for each train to stop at all stations. The last stop on the Westport line should be Athlone. The train should travel directly from Athlone to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I was very interested to hear Senator Morrissey say that the majority of platforms in Dublin are under-utilised. Trains are standing on platforms at peak times for up to three quarters of an hour. Surely this is wrong. I agree that many lines are under-utilised. Before spending the amount of money the Minister mentioned – approximately €2 billion over four or five years – we must consider the management system within Iarnród Eireann, how platforms are managed and how routes are being organised. The travel times from Westport, Galway, Sligo, Limerick or Waterford to Dublin should be reduced significantly, particularly given the new welded rail lines which have been put in place in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I am very disappointed in the report on the western rail corridor. The Minister goes to great pains to explain that there will be an onus on local authorities and planning authorities to zone lands in areas where the rail routes will be. If one takes the western corridor route from Sligo and Galway to Cork, one must travel via Sligo, Ballina, Westport, Castlebar, Athenry, Ennis, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. All these hubs or cities are included in the spatial strategy and rezoning has probably already taken place in these areas. If this is what is being put forward as a way of blocking the western rail corridor from getting the green light, it is a non-runner. I am very disappointed because all the stops along this line are either cities, hubs or major towns. I do not think it is a basis for delaying the project. As Senator Kitt said, in some of these cases, such as the Galway route, one could have Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry feeding into Galway city. This would take a significant amount of traffic off the Tuam-Galway road where up to quite recently there were a significant number of fatal crashes. There could be a passenger route from there into the city. Another Senator said that a Shannon, Ennis and Limerick route would work well.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">This report will be the death knell of the western rail corridor. It refers to local authorities playing a significant role in relation to zoning towns and cities but this is in place already. As someone who has been a member of a local authority for a number of years, I believe regional authorities have very little power, if any. The Minister attributed great significance to regional authorities who have primary interests in the western rail corridor. While this is the case in the broader context of expressing views, they do not have power. Regional authorities have no powers as planning authorities other than making recommendations. He said this will be provided in the context of the development by the regional authorities of the regional planning guidelines. I do not understand who puts in place regional planning guidelines. Each local authority has a county development plan, but I do not think there are any regional plans, unless something new is to be put in place. The regional authorities do not appear to have the power to put in place regional authority plans. Perhaps they will be given new powers that neither I nor other Members know anything about.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I am very disappointed regarding the western rail corridor. However, I welcome the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">The review sets out a solid and reliable framework for the development of the rail network over the next 20 years. There is no doubt it is a very comprehensive report. It is clearly the most significant review and rigorous analysis of the rail sector ever undertaken. It was the first major report in the history of the State to recommend the revitalisation and rebuilding of railways. For this reason, it has a valuable contribution to make to the debate on the future of the railway network.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The review provides the framework within which an ambitious programme for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector in Ireland can be developed and implemented. It lays the foundation on which we can improve the current railway system and from this plan a modern and highly efficient transport system for the benefit of this and future generations. The review will facilitate the introduction and development of more regular services, reliable timetables, improved and accurate information and a better level of comfort for customers. It envisages major increases in capacity and frequency of commuter services and promises to ensure savings of up to 40 minutes on journey times on the main inter-urban routes by 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Furthermore, the review outlines a clear investment plan which will involve upgrading the rolling stock and inter-city services, including additional rolling stock for commuter services. It will also ensure additional improvements in the reliability and safety of the rail network.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">On the rolling stock issue, I ask the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Brennan, that all the rolling stock purchased by Iarnród Eireann, consisting of approximately 60 carriages which I understand will be delivered in the near future, is bound for the Cork line. While I acknowledge it is a very busy line and worthy of the stock, the national spatial strategy must be taken into account in this regard. Other lines such as the Westport, Sligo and Galway lines must get their fair share of these carriages. I ask the Minister to take note of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I am pleased that the report opens up the possibility of involvement by the private sector. In light of Exchequer demands, it is necessary to consider different and challenging ways of funding such expansion, exploring options such as public private partnerships, development levies, leasing and revenues from property development. Other areas of the transport sector have already benefited from the injection of funds via the PPP mechanism. For example, I am aware of the signing of the National Roads Authority contract for the M4-M6 Kilcock-Kinnegad road project, which represents the first major inter-urban public private partnership scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The introduction of significant private sector funding has ensured earlier delivery of important national roads schemes which would not be possible through reliance on Exchequer funding alone. By increasing private investment in this sector, we will be able to further improve the rail system and, therefore, alleviate growing congestion, reverse growing car dependency, achieve balanced regional development and, above all, maintain our economic competitiveness. It will also help to roll out planned developments in the rail network earlier than might ordinarily be allowed if it was solely dependent on Exchequer funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The report provides for the expansion of the rail network. It also clearly supports the enhancement and maintenance of existing services. I would support a strategy that would put this element of the project first. Now is the time to ensure existing services are improved and enhanced. It is vital that none of the railways is closed. The Minister is committed to this and we have a responsibility to support him in this endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I have a major concern, however. Although I endorse the broad focus of the report's key findings and recommendations as a basis for future planning in the area of public transport, I am concerned about its vision in the context of the national spatial strategy. While the review is intended to follow on from and complement the strategy, it does not fully mirror its ambitions in terms of balanced regional development. I am anxious, for example, that it does not take full regard of the pressing needs of growth centres and hubs identified in the strategy, particularly along the western seaboard. We must now take the next step forward and ensure these hubs and gateways are equipped with the best possible infrastructure. If we are committed to establishing balanced regional development, we must ensure train services west of the Shannon are not the poor relation of the rail network. The infrastructure needs to be put in place without delay. Only then will business investment follow. There is no getting away from this reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I support the western rail corridor and the many commuter services mentioned by other Senators. In my constituency we would like to see a commuter route between Ballymoate and Sligo in the fullness of time. There are other links, for example, to Cavan and Donegal, which we would also like to see in due course. However, the priority at this time must be upgrading what we have. It is no good having infrastructure capable of taking the Ferrari of trains when we do not have anything like the mini of the 1950s available, certainly in the case of the Sligo-Dublin line where basics such as heating, seating and the possibility of refreshments are serious difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I congratulate the Minister and those involved with the report and its publication. It has provided a vision for the railways over the coming decades which could elevate Ireland's train service to a world class level. I am confident that this can be realised but any resources which are available must be put into bringing what we already have to a standard consistent with modern railways in other countries.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_255">The strategic rail review report is comprehensive and took a long time to produce. Over ten years ago I participated in a protest march from Sligo and the towns on the Sligo line such as Ballymoate, Collooney, Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford. If that protest had not taken place and if 500 people had not come to Leinster House, that line would now be closed. No funding was put into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I am glad there is now a new line and that new stations have been opened. Unfortunately, however, the rolling stock on the line is deterring people from using it. On previous occasions I have complained that the rolling stock is 1960s Craven carriages and since last December have had to complain on ten occasions that there was no heat on the train. In reply I was told that there would be new rolling stock but that it would not be introduced for another five years at least. One can discuss consultants and their reports but if the basics are not provided, one gets pessimistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">How many consultants has Iarnród Éireann used in the last three or four years? Did it employ consultants and when their findings were not what it wanted, did it get rid of them? I have a feeling these consultants were brought in to do a hatchet job on the western rail corridor. First, they got the mileage between Sligo and Cork wrong. Second, they produced exorbitant costs for trains. Six trains would have been sufficient for a commuter line between Galway and Sligo but the consultants say 15 trains and locomotives would be required. A job was done on the western rail corridor. People in the west believe they must have the same services as other areas and the same pressure will be applied in this regard as was applied to save the Sligo line.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">We talk about infrastructure for cities and major towns. It is a great concern that the freight carried by rail is now carried by road. We need a system like that in Switzerland, where finance is taken from the national roads to finance the rail network. We would support the line. I would love to travel by rail to Dublin for these sittings. There should be a service we could take from Boyle at 9 a.m. and arrive in Dublin at 11 a.m. We would love to have a service that is available on the hour, every hour. It could arrive at six minutes past 11 a.m., 12 p.m. or 1 p.m. Most of the Senators, Deputies and others travelling to Dublin, however, cannot avail of such a service. It does not exist. I look forward to a progressive strategy but the service must provide value for money, heating on trains and trains that travel on the hour, every hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I welcome the report but there are flaws in it. Much has been done in the last ten years and I wish progress was quicker but it is not. Western development depends to a great extent on the railway lines to Ballina, Westport and Sligo as well as on the western line. We will be vigilant in ensuring funding is provided for them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I welcome this study, to which I made a submission. In fact, I also made an input into Fr. McGréil's study on the western corridor 15 or 20 years ago, to which I am sympathetic also. I blame much of the under-investment in the railways on the attitudes of economists and economic institutes, especially those based in Dublin, who during the years were hostile and influenced Government and, to a degree, the European Union in a negative direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">In the past 15 years, however, there has been growing investment. It first came from the European Union for the Arrow investment and then for the Dublin-Belfast railway. I greatly favour increasing co-operation with the North. Obviously, the next item on the agenda is to strengthen the Dublin-Derry link and in the long term extend it to Letterkenny. The report acknowledges that the railways in Ireland have in recent years experienced a period of investment activity unlike almost any other period in their history. Great credit is due to the former Minister for Public Enterprise, now Leader of the House, the Minister for Transport and the Taoiseach, who is very supportive of the role the railways have to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Choice and alternatives are vital, particularly when we are faced with congestion on the current scale. It is not just a question of how long a journey takes, but how best to use one's time while making it. I am a frequent user of the railways and I find I can do a lot of work when travelling by train.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The tendency in recent years was to run freight services down and that was a mistake because we will need all available transport systems. Almost all European countries allow open access, with state run freight trains and private companies using railway lines. I cannot see why that should not be possible in Ireland, even from a trade union point of view, given that it happens in so many countries in Europe which have social partnership arrangements in place. There is a considerable demand for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">In areas where the business community and the community in general want a service, if financial input is possible, the Government should listen to their proposals. There are several examples of this throughout the State. The Limerick-Shannon-Ennis line has been mentioned and anyone who has experience of Limerick at rush hour will know that it is nearly as difficult to get through that city as it is to make one's way through Dublin. At the same time, trains are lying idle. Why can the Limerick-Ballybrophy line or the Westport-Ballina-Castlebar lines not be used instead of having trains lying idle until they are used for one or two services? There should be more intensive usage of trains and this should be done in consultation with local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Minister mentioned the importance of tying in rail transport with land use transportation. Cork is crying out for the Cork-Midleton line to be reopened because it is the linchpin for integration with land use transportation in the region. The requirements referred to by the Minister are already in place there.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I welcome the fact that the Minister will not close lines and I agree that there must be better marketing. Now that CIE realises that the lines will be kept open and not run down, it must make a better effort. I also agree with the point in the report about the DART and suburban services. There is no definite timetable in place and there is a worrying tendency, particularly since the Malahide and Greystones extensions, for trains to be cancelled without notice and this obliges people to wait for 20 or 30 minutes for a train. It is very unsatisfactory that this happens on such a service. The Department and the management of the company should pay more attention to the problems with reliability of service because they tend to discourage many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Some of the project engineering costs are astronomical and we should make better use of the current infrastructure. In many cases, a stretch that has already been upgraded, such as the one into Galway, should be used more intensively to provide a commuter service. I differ slightly from Senator Wilson in that I feel upgrading the Navan-Drogheda route could quickly provide a service to Navan, otherwise there would be a long wait for a new line to be put in place. The Senator also mentioned the connection to Kingscourt and, again, the line is there so why not use it? The Phoenix Park tunnel is crying out to be used. I do not understand why people want to build all sorts of other tunnels under Dublin when the existing tunnels are not used. People say that it is unacceptable that passengers would have to spend a quarter of an hour travelling to Heuston Station, via the Phoenix Park tunnel, to Connolly Station. Is that quarter of an hour worth billions of euro? We must make best use of what we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I agree with the Minister that the report pulls its punches in some respects. It is under-ambitious, but I am encouraged by the open and supportive attitude of the Government. Such an attitude should be maintained by all future Governments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranPhelan" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Mr. K. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_269">I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to the House and congratulate them and the Department of Transport on the tremendous work they have done in the past year. The need for a dedicated transport Department has been vindicated by the tremendous strides they have taken on transport policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I welcome the main thrust of the strategic rail review, particularly with regard to its overall emphasis. I concur with the Minister, however, that it is not ambitious enough and I hope he will take this into account when deciding on future policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Minister described the report as a road map and not a pair of handcuffs. I hope this is true because I am concerned about the call for the retention of rail links that are commercially viable to Iarnród Éireann. That standpoint casts serious questions about the future of the Ballybrophy-Limerick line. The report recommends against investment in that line, which could pave the way for its closure if such an approach is adopted by the Government. Such a decision would have a profound effect on the towns located along the line. As a representative from Laois, I am aware that any downgrading of this line will negatively affect the people of the county. We need to improve the level of infrastructure on the line because it will play a crucial role in rural development of this part of the country. How can we expect to implement the national spatial strategy if we are to remove one of the pivotal lines of infrastructure for such a large part of the country? We are not only talking about County Laois being affected; counties Offaly, Tipperary and Limerick will also suffer if this line does not receive the attention and funding it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The heart of the national spatial strategy is concerned with the development of gateways and hubs across the State that will help to arrest the growth of the greater Dublin area. With the rail network in the midlands in need of improvement, how will the strategy be affected by removing this key transport infrastructure? It will have a disastrous effect on it, as it will on the growth of County Laois.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">By 2020 the projected population of the county will be 100,000. That level of growth is being encouraged by Laois's location in the midlands and its relative proximity to a number of large urban centres. If, however, this line is allowed to fall by the wayside, growth could be seriously threatened. During the past year, a national retail outlet, Brand Central, set up in Rathdowney. This is a national development that attracted 650,000 visitors last year and its projected figures for this year are over 1 million. Key to the delivery of this number of customers to the outlet in question is the fact that Rathdowney is only a few miles from Ballybrophy and, therefore, rail passengers from all parts of the country have a simple method of transport to and from the store. If there is no investment in this line and it goes into decline, what future will there be for that development? How many potential visitors will no longer have ease of access to the store?</p>
          <p eId="para_274">What does the future hold for this part of the country? Laois, as a whole, is in need of increased investment, but this is particularly apparent in the south of the county. How can we expect large companies to come to this part of the county if we have not simple, efficient rail facilities? We cannot, so it is essential that this line is given the priority it deserves and that significant funding is found to make the best use of it. If it is not cost-competitive or commercially viable, or whatever phrase best suits the purposes of those who want this line closed, then we should do all we can to make it viable. We need to develop this line, not to turn away from it. How many times in the past have we seen rail lines shut down only for future Governments to lament such decisions? One does not have to look too far from Leinster House to note how the Harcourt Street line is now being used for Luas.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I have been greatly assured by the response by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to various aspects of this issue, in particular by his statement that no rail lines will be closed. I pay tribute to him too for recently meeting public representatives, myself included, as part of the delegation from Laois, Limerick, Offaly and North Tipperary. The Minister was aware of the issues and suggested we form a working committee, to include an official from his Department and officials from Iarnród Éireann, to examine the future of the Ballybrophy-Limerick line. The issues include frequency, quality and speeds of trains. On parts of the line in question, trains travel no faster than 25 m.p.h.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I look forward to the findings of that committee. I congratulate the Minister and his Minister of State on the work they have done so far and I trust this issue will be resolved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan2" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Mr. M. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_277">I too welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to this House. The review recommends the investment of approximately €8.5 million over the next 20 years. This will involve major capital funding in our railways system in a number of areas, from massive renewal through to the expansion of the network and increases in capacity and services. Such improvements are to be welcomed. However, capital investment alone will not deliver the vision of our rail system set out in this report. It is important that certain factors be taken into serious consideration. The national spatial strategy, national regional development guidelines and country development plans will have to be taken into account, as will our transport requirements over the next 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Contributions to the capital costs of our railways system should be broadened. New and existing commuter lines should be used as the infrastructure to service new and existing housing developments around our cities, and the suburban growth areas identified in various land usage studies carried out to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">In my own area, the Mid-West Regional Authority sees the rail system as part of the vital infrastructure for the area's future development. The Cork-Limerick-Galway-west line, the Limerick-Shannon Airport-Ennis link, and the Limerick-Ballybrophy line have potential catchment areas to meet the needs of an expanding population growth in certain areas. Balanced regional development would justify inclusion of the railways at this stage, and from reading the report it is obvious that the existing population requires the structured development set out in the national spatial strategy. I ask the Minister for Transport to look ahead to the operational requirements involved in implementing that strategy, so that the strategic functions can deliver full potential. Considering the developments in the Shannon area, it is essential that the railway link there be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I agree with Senator Cummins regarding the public-private partnership usage of the freight lines, especially those linking to ports. I urge the Minister to further that proposal. Foynes Harbour too is vital to the west and to Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Brave decisions will have to be taken at Government level, and I am sure the Minister will look further than the recommendations in this report alone, and to other positive measures that will encourage more brown-field and high-density developments close to our railways, to ensure that the capital investment in our railway system is sustainable. There are many people with a role to play in order that the best usage of our railways can be achieved as part of the transport infrastructure to ensure that the future needs of our economy are satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">At a time when our road infrastructure is reaching its limit in terms of the volume of traffic it carries, it is time to extend our vision to the railways. Train performance, service reliability, acceptance of the product available and the best use of our trains should all be provided at a competitive price for the consumer. The Government has a core role in ensuring that this happens. I wish the Minister for Transport well in his recommendations to Cabinet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_283">On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, I thank the Members of the Seanad for this opportunity to address the Chamber on the strategic rail review. The Minister will give careful consideration to the views of Members. I also thank the Senators for the very fine contributions they have made to today's debate. It is clear that the issue of rail transport is a very live one in all parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I will touch on certain comments made by Members. Senator Browne referred to the steering groups for the development of regional planning guidelines, and I want him to know that the Department of Transport is represented on the steering group. The possibility of rail-freight joint ventures will also be pursued, particularly by Irish Rail.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Senator McHugh referred to particular railway lines, some of which were considered in the course of the review. He also expressed views on business plans and appropriate land use and settlement strategies, views with which I know the Minister would concur. Senator Dooley mentioned the Shannon rail link, which will be considered by the Minister, along with the western rail corridor, a matter raised by a number of Senators. The Limerick-Ballybrophy line was also mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I concur with Senator O'Meara, and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, would agree that there has been under-investment in the railways in the past. The Minister is determined to make a positive stab at catching up with the investment needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In relation to the need for improved services in the greater Dublin area, a matter raised by Senator Morrissey, that issue is addressed in the review, and other issues he raised will also be addressed. The review calls for the maximising of the full capacity available to Irish Rail, and this will be followed up by the implementation group.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Senator Cummins mentioned rail freight, the Limerick-Rosslare line and the Dublin-Rosslare line. I reiterate the firm commitment given by the Minister in this House today, a commitment he has made on a number of occasions, namely that no railway line will be closed. Senator Cummins also mentioned the need for major improvements on the Dublin-Waterford line. These have been recommended, and it is hoped they will proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The rail proposals, particularly those relating to the Navan-Drogheda line and the Cavan line, which were mentioned by Senator Wilson, will be seriously considered. The western rail corridor was also mentioned by Senator Kitt, who quite rightly mentioned the regional authorities and the Western Development Commission. Senator Burke indicated the need to deliver quality services to Irish Rail customers, and I know that the Minister is keen to ensure this, as well as ensuring better time-tabling and shorter journey times by means of improved track signalling and rolling stock.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Senator MacSharry referred to the new carriages coming on stream. As I understand it, they are not all for the Cork line. As well as the 67 carriages already in place, 80 additional diesel cars will join the rolling stock this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I appreciate the points made by Senator MacSharry. However, with regard to the western rail corridor and putting an appropriate level of investment – approximately €500 million – in place, we will be obliged to look at settlement patterns, land use strategies and other such considerations. I welcome the Senator's acknowledgement of the Minister's intention to upgrade the existing network.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Senator Feighan complained about the fact that some old carriages are still in use. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, wants these to be phased out as soon as is practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I acknowledge Senator Mansergh's comments on the significant under-investment in the rail network in the past and the need for appropriate investment. In recent years, the level of investment has been on the increase. The Senator also referred to joint ventures with the private sector, a matter that is being explored. I welcome his positive contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I welcome Senator Kieran Phelan's comments on the need for investment on certain lines in the Laois catchment area. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, would be happy to consider some of the suggestions he made.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I welcome the positive contribution by Senator Michael Brennan. The particular line to which he referred, the Shannon rail link, will be considered in the context of the western rail corridor. A number of other Members also referred to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">I assure the House that the Minister for Transport has a visionary and progressive outlook on transport policy. He is committed to putting in place a comprehensive and excellent public transport network. The Minister stated that the strategic rail review provides the most significant and rigorous analysis of the rail sector ever undertaken in the State. The primary purpose of the review was to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of rail services in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">In the course of the review, the views of all interested parties were considered through an extensive public consultation process. Now that the Government has considered the report and noted its valuable contribution to the debate on the future of the rail network, a period of further revitalisation and expansion of the railways can now be considered. The review provides the framework within the realistic programme for the future of the railways can now be considered. The review provides the framework within which the Government can implement an ambitious and realistic programme for the future development of the passenger and freight rail sectors. With the implementation of this plan, the Government could deliver a modern and highly efficient transport system which would benefit everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The review will help the Government make the right decisions on investment. It is a sign of the Government's commitment to delivering an improved public transport system, that it has endorsed the Minister's view that elements of the review's investment strategy could be accelerated during the next ten years to meet the demands of our expanding economy and population.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">With the establishment of the implementation group, there will be rigorous monitoring of the investment programme and quarterly reports on the progress being made will be forwarded to the Minister, Deputy Brennan. This will assist in the efficient delivery of an improved public transport system.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The Minister recognises the current realities with regard to demands on the Exchequer and appreciates this may impact on the funding and timing of projects over the review's timeframe. Bearing this in mind, alternative funding mechanisms such as public privates partnerships development levies and revenues from property development will be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Previous Government decisions have resulted in considerable groundwork being made already on rail network development. To date, in excess of €1 billion has been spent on rail investment in recent years. The review provides a vision for the railway network which, in the coming decades, could elevate the train services and customer standards to world class levels. Among the benefits that will accrue from the implementation of the review are: hourly high-speed services to Cork and Belfast; two hourly services on other interurban routes; more reliable timetables; improved and accurate passenger information; higher levels of comfort for customers and major increases in capacity and frequency of commuter services in the greater Dublin area – a matter in which I have a particular interest –"turn up and go" peak period frequency on all four lines into Dublin city centre from Dundalk, Drogheda, Maynooth, Kildare and Arklow; the expansion of commuter services for Cork city; and major reform and restructuring of rail freight services.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Iarnród Éireann has been asked to bring forward a programme for the freight business based on the recommendations of the review. In addition, it will also present a prioritised investment programme for passenger services for the period up to 2008 based on the review's findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">On behalf of the Minister for Transport, I thank Members for the invitation to participate in this important debate and for their contributions and attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">Too much of our public administration is still concentrated in the capital. In Dublin, we have rapid population growth which is putting pressure on public services and threatening to damage the quality of life. In certain rural areas, the opposite is happening – population decline is putting pressure on the viability of public services and threatening to damage the quality of life. This is a pattern of development, which is neither economically efficient nor socially sustainable. One of the obvious solutions is to commence the decentralisation of civil and public service jobs from Dublin to other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Decentralisation has the potential to revitalise towns and villages. It will also have a major positive impact on the quality of life of thousands of families. As a Government, we can build crèches and implement flexible working hours for State workers, but we will never tackle the real stress of commuter workers until we relocate Departments and ensure that people do not have to get on the road at 6 a.m. to be at their desk for 9 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">As a result of the pressures on house prices in recent years, a three-hour daily commute from Kildare to Kildare Street now seems like a stroll in the park, particularly when one considers that many travel from as far away as Wexford, Thurles and Tullamore. These are young people – often young couples with children – who are undertaking extraordinary commuting journeys to achieve the aim of home ownership. Added to the length of their working day, many of these people are away from their homes for in excess of 12 hours a day. I do not think there is anybody who is not sympathetic to the plight of such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">For these families, there is a real quality of life deficit. Decentralisation has its part to play in making up some of this deficit. For that reason, if for no other, I would characterise decentralisation as a "quality of life" issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I am hopeful that decentralisation will have a much more significant impact than simply benefiting those who relocate and their families. I would like to see a profound change in this emphasis on east coast location. I am absolutely convinced that the Government can contribute its part to the east coast concentration through a comprehensive programme of decentralisation of Government Departments, offices and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Government has fully committed itself to such an initiative in An Agreed Programme for Government. I take this opportunity to assure the House that the Government is steadfast in its determination to give full effect to its commitment in this regard. Interestingly the contributions made in the Dáil last week and, I am sure, those which will be made here this afternoon, point up the difficulties which any Minister for Finance has in finalising proposals for presentation to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Many compelling cases have been made for inclusion in a new programme of decentralisation. The Department of Finance has been inundated by submissions and representations. The quality of many of them is extremely impressive with very persuasive cases being made for inclusion in the new programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I acknowledge the sense of anticipation in advance of a decision in relation to the new programme. Due to the large volume of quality submissions, I insert the caution that, when the decisions are taken in respect of relocation, there will be many more disappointed towns than happy ones. Every Member would accept the impossibility of accommodating anything other than a fraction of those seeking inclusion in the new programme. This message is not being imparted for any reason other than to bring some perspective to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Decentralisation should be used as an economic torch to shine light into areas that have not prospered in recent years. The programme should focus on towns that have not benefited significantly from the recent boom. Many of the towns included as gateways and hubs in the spatial strategy are already significantly developed and would not be economically transformed in the same way that smaller town would be by decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">No one can convince me that prosperous places such as Wexford, Kilkenny or Castlebar need another Government Department. However, I could highlight many places in the midlands that desperately a Government Department. Central to any decision about a new programme of decentralisation is the necessity to ensure the efficient delivery of public services is in no way compromised. It is worth noting that the new programme will be announced and implemented against the background of the new social partnership programme – Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I share the view that decentralisation can play its part in moving forward the modernisation agenda to achieve a public service which is: quality, performance and results driven; achieves value for money; is focused on the needs of its customers; is accountable; responds flexibly and rapidly to change; and promotes equal opportunities. Such a substantial programme cannot be delivered other than over a reasonable period. It is critical that the delivery of public services is not affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Sourcing the staff for particular Departments or offices relocating to particular locations means considerable transferring of staff between Departments. This can be extremely disruptive if not managed carefully and in a well-planned fashion. Minimising the consequent disruption necessarily means the implementation of a substantial programme of decentralisation should be rolled-out on a progressive and systematic basis over a reasonable period. Having sourced the staff, it will then be necessary to train them in their new responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">There is also the issue of identifying and acquiring suitable sites for the construction of suitable office accommodation. This is a very important aspect in the delivery of the new programme and one with which the Office of Public Works will be centrally involved. As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I will be closely involved in this process. The Office Of Public Works is the agency that will bring any future decentralisation plan to life. It will bring the decentralisation plan from the page to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Decentralisation should be located strategically within the chosen towns. Monolithic office blocks on the edge of small towns are not the way to proceed. We need to be imaginative and use decentralisation as an opportunity for urban regeneration and revitalisation. The State offices should be seen as flagship buildings that make a statement and are a source of pride to the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I reiterate the Government's absolute commitment to a new and substantial programme of decentralisation. I reassure all those organisations – be they local authorities, chambers of commerce or other community groups – which made submissions in respect of the new programme, that full account will be taken of their submissions as part of the decision-making process. The Government will deliver on its commitment to decentralisation. This programme of decentralisation is of considerable significance to the people who will be part of it and to the communities in which they will be relocating, as well as to the citizens of the State who are served by the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The Government is, quite rightly, taking due care in considering the wide range of issues that will impact on the final decision. We have had discussions and received reports about decentralisation. It is now time for action. The Government is committed to the concept of decentralisation. We are committed to moving major blocks of our public administration out of Dublin and into provincial towns. This is an essential part of regional development. I support the commitment made by the Tánaiste at the recent Progressive Democrats party conference on decentralisation to make a start this year, to make it happen and to get things moving. I look forward to the Government moving to progress this important issue as a concrete indication of a commitment to balanced regional development.</p>

        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_320">Three and half years ago the Minister for Finance outlined plans for the largest decentralisation programme in the history of the State. In December 1999, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that everything which could be decentralised would be decentralised. Some 10,000 Civil Service posts in Government Departments and non-commercial semi-State bodies would be identified and redistributed to provincial centres by mid-2001. Since then, nothing has happened. I accept that this is not quite the case. Three Government Ministers decided to do some political plundering – before an official blueprint was drawn up – and look after their own political neck of the woods.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, decided this was one political plum for which Deputy Healy-Rae would be unable to claim credit. Without prior consultation with the staff or trade unions, he announced that the Legal Aid Board was to be transferred to Caherciveen, County Kerry. The Minister for Defence decided to transfer the headquarters of the Civil Defence to his home base in Roscrea, County Tipperary while the former Minister with responsibility for the marine, Deputy Fahey, relocated the Marine Institute to his Galway West constituency. It is not necessary to inquire if these moves were coincidence or political expediency, nor into the motivating factor behind them.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Political expediency is the nub of the problem and the fundamental reason that three and a half years after the Minister for Finance announced his grandiose plans nothing has happened. Having listened to the Minister of State we are no wiser. Instead of the massive programme of decentralisation within a fixed time-scale, there is now a complete row-back. Instead of the explicit commitment to the decentralisation of 10,000 jobs, the more recent utterances leaked from the Government refer to up to 10,000 jobs. Instead of the unequivocal time-scale that the programme of decentralisation would be realised by the middle of 2001, we are now told that the plan will take up to ten years to complete. The row-back in implementation of the plan is singularly due to the fierce infighting that would inevitably ensue among Ministers, Ministers of State and backbenchers in trying to divide the spoils.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The Minister for Finance has not advertised for applications or submissions, yet as the Minister of State acknowledges, there is a huge volume of correspondence in the Department requesting decentralisation. Some 134 towns are vying to be included in the programme. Understandably, they all want a piece of the action, which spells trouble for the elected representatives of the Government parties. The Minister of State candidly acknowledges that there will inevitably be far more losers than winners. As a consequence, a much greater number of intensively lobbied Government Deputies and Senators will be unable to deliver to their political bases, with all the attendant consequences and political fall-out in electoral terms, with the local elections a mere 13 months away.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Probably at most 20 to 25 locations will eventually benefit, leaving as many as 114 applicant locations bitterly disappointed and apportioning blame for the failure to get a Government office at the feet of the local Fianna Fáil or Progressive Democrats representative. As a result, the political solution to a political problem is a phased-in decentralisation programme over a ten year period which the Government hopes will dilute local anger and lessen the negative electoral impact at next year's local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Other than this naked political consideration, there is no excuse for not proceeding with full-scale decentralisation now. Modern IT and communications advances make it possible to transact business and deliver services as effectively in any provincial centre as from the heart of the capital. Departments already decentralised have proven this to be the case. Figures published recently indicate that the programme of moving civil servants out of Dublin is already over-subscribed. More than 18,000 applications have already been received, with 7,832 from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, 4,326 from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and 4,187 from the Department of Agriculture and Food. Despite the huge interest by public servants to move to the country, the Government has decided to long-finger and prevaricate. This is based on the clear calculation that it will be able to announce the good news for certain towns without having to say in the short term which town or public servants will not be part of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The concept of decentralisation is good and, to the limited extent it has been tried, has worked well. It has at least partially assisted in decongesting parts of Dublin, freed office space in the capital and invigorated provincial towns by providing jobs with guaranteed salaries. The Minister of State has rightly said it has given parents and children a quality of life they could never enjoy in Dublin because of the terrible daily congestion in the city. At the same time it has delivered services as efficiently and effectively, if not more so because of easier accessibility than was possible under the centralised bureaucracy that has prevailed in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">It makes good social and economic sense to decentralise. The net gain in property terms – an aspect of the Minister of State's portfolio – of relocating offices in central Dublin to Ballinrobe, Ballyhaunis or Bally-anywhere would result in the saving of billions of euro. The Minister of State is already disposing of public property. Even greater gains would be made if hugely valuable assets in the heart of Dublin were to be sold and relocated in rural areas at a fraction of the cost. This aspect can be put into perspective by considering that the State pays €80 million alone for rented office accommodation for public services in this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">It also makes good environmental sense to decentralise. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by single car civil servant usage on a daily basis is a huge contributory factor to Ireland's failure to comply with the Kyoto guidelines. A penalty is threatened but huge sanctions will follow in the form of a possible fine of €200 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">What was a good concept has become a bungled mess. Some 14,000 civil servants are located outside Dublin and are working well, yet while 15,000 public servants work within one mile of this House, the Government has not advanced the decentralisation programme. No time-scale has been agreed. The Minister has said it must be reasonable. What is meant by this? Three and a half years ago an explicit promise was made that it would be delivered by the middle of 2001. What does the Minister of State mean when he says the Government will deliver?</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The Minister of State rightly said now is the time for action. We hoped he would make a clear, definitive statement, including details of the Departments and locations involved and a time-scale. We are seeking a reiteration of the clear pledge given in December 1999 and a statement of fact setting out how the programme is to be rolled out. Unfortunately, once again we and those locations seeking a Government office have been bitterly disappointed, as are the 18,000 civil servants who have over-subscribed to the scheme.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_331">I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on a constructive and forward looking approach to this issue, which has been the subject of much discussion over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I am surprised at the remarks made by Senator Higgins. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, scrapped a major programme of decentralisation that had been proposed by a previous Government. He put up for sale the sites that had been bought in rural areas, including a site in Ennis. After some representations and campaigning, the then Minister did not proceed with the sale of the site and Government offices were relocated to Ennis ten years later. In view of this, the Fine Gael Party can claim no credit on the issue because when in government, it put a stop to the first major scheme of decentralisation undertaken. While I am not sure if he was a Member of the Dáil at the time, Senator Higgins should know about what happened because his colleagues were in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Decentralisation has been discussed for many years and it has been an issue which has excited communities, local organisations, councils, politicians and developers. For many years, we have seen young people lining up to take the bus to Dublin on Sundays and returning to spend weekends at home with their families. It is far more realistic and suitable to relocate their offices from Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There was a campaign under way in Ennis for many years which eventually saw the location there, under a tripartite arrangement with Limerick and Nenagh, of an office of the Revenue Commissioners. In excess of 1,000 personnel were transferred to Ennis while the tripartite arrangement made it possible to relocate a substantial number of positions overall because doing so was important in terms of being able to offer promotion and advancement prospects within the service. No one would wish to see offices relocated if it was to be to the detriment of those employed in them. In this case, three towns combined to allow a major slice of a State organisation to decentralise and to facilitate their own development.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Promotional prospects are key to attracting people from the higher levels of the Civil Service to rural areas. The small office of 40 or 50 personnel mentioned in the case of Roscommon will not offer any great prospect of advancement for the people involved. I advocate that some of the smaller towns combine as we have done in Kilrush.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">When the Government made the announcement a few years ago of a major process of decentralisation of 10,000 to rural areas a campaign was organised in Kilrush by the town council, the chamber of commerce, the development association and the Shannon Free Area Development Company. It was obvious when the matter was examined in more detail that it would be desirable to link with other towns. As a result, Listowel, County Kerry, and Newcastle West, County Limerick, joined forces with Kilrush to put forward a tripartite proposal which was launched in Dublin by Professor Brendan Kenneally. The idea was put forward that a sizeable block of personnel could be relocated to the three towns. The advent of the Killimer ferry means Listowel, Kilrush and Newcastle West are now quite adjacent and there is a good prospect of developing a productive operation among the three towns as part of the overall scheme of things.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">I am sure the Minister is aware that the application on behalf of the towns is currently with the Department of Finance. Nothing further can be added to the case that has been made. Some of the other smaller towns should amalgamate because it is imperative to the overall development of the service that the long-term promotional prospects of personnel in a large Dublin office are not lost in the transfer of offices to small provincial towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Provincial towns offer advantages which one does not have in Dublin. There is no traffic congestion and there are few environmental problems in what are some of the most attractive towns in Ireland. Kilrush has fine educational institutions and transport infrastructure such as the ferry service. It is in one of the most scenic areas in the west and it offers fishing and a range of other leisure activities. For those who enjoy golf, a course designed by Greg Norman was recently developed at Doonbeg.</p>

          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_340">West Clare is mainly a football area. Nevertheless, there is a unique prospect for people to enjoy their leisure time in west Clare and I would strongly recommend that the person charged with making decisions in respect of decentralisation to take that into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I would like to see decentralisation advanced more speedily than it has been to date, although I do not particularly blame the Minister of State in that regard. Between ten and 15 years elapsed from the time of the first action to move Revenue Commissioners to Limerick, Ennis and Nenagh to the final phase of the process. I do not envisage that the latest process will take much longer and we would certainly like to see decisions made before the end of the summer. If decisions are not made, further elections will occur and this will lead to a risk of political accusations about favouring certain towns in order to gain seats for certain parties on local councils. The work has been done in the Departments and it is time the decisions were made. The cases have been made by the various communities, local organisation and councils involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">As the Minister of State is aware, there is an unanswerable case for this effort. Much has been said on the matter and more parliamentary questions have been tabled on the subject of decentralisation than on any other during the past five or six years. The time to make decisions has come, particularly in view of the fact that unless they are taken now, the prospect of achieving anything in the next few years is remote. It is imperative to acknowledge the work that has been done by local community organisations and, if necessary, to undertake some discussion with them before the final decisions are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">There is an unanswerable case for undertaking a programme of decentralisation and there is no reason it should not begin as quickly as possible. I encourage the Minister of State to forge ahead. In the long term, the public service will be improved by the opportunities provided to those employed by it to work and live in more attractive areas, especially those along the west coast.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_344">I welcome the Minister of State to discuss an issue of urgency for many areas which the Government, during the past four years of inaction, has failed to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Government plans for decentralisation were first introduced in the run up to the local elections in 1999 and since then there have been statements and a great deal of waffle on this issue. Following the Budget Statement in December 1998, in which the Minister for Finance announced that he would embark on a new and radical programme of decentralisation to transfer the maximum number of jobs to the regions, we heard promises on the issue in the run-up to local and European elections. The matter raised its head even in the presidential election.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">In the run-up to the last general election, a programme of decentralisation formed part of the agreed programme for Government and was to be delivered by the end of 2002. I understand from Senator Higgins that there were promises that the programme would even be delivered a year earlier in 2001. We are now informed that the Government is committed to introducing a new programme of decentralisation in the run-up to next year's local and European elections. Will the issue hold good to provide the basis of a promise in the run-up to the next general election? It seems the election will occur sooner than we imagined given the current differences between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Only ten months after the initial announcement of the programme for decentralisation in 1999, the Government came under fire for lack of progress on the matter. The Minister for Finance was forced to justify his position and stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Government is every bit as committed to the new programme as it was when I first announced it. Despite newspaper suggestions to the contrary, the Government has not abandoned the new programme of decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">More than three years later we remain at the drawing board stage. The Government is still protesting its commitment to a plan which it has failed to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">With over 18,000 applications for relocation, it is time the Government explained its strategy to decentralise Departments and replaced the fog surrounding its plans with concrete proposals. It is time the Government produced a blueprint for decentralisation in order that the public and, in particular, the applicants for relocation have a clear picture of the criteria on which decisions relating to decentralisation will be based. We want to know exactly what formula and criteria will be involved. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would explain them.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">A cohesive countrywide plan which would marry the national development plan, the national spatial strategy and sectoral plans such as the strategic rail review which was debated in the House this morning is the logical way forward. However, according to the Tánaiste, gateway or hub towns already nominated in the national spatial strategy will not get a decentralised office of a Department, which point the Minister of State emphasised.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">There has been a clear bias towards Dublin by the Government and its predecessor, with the lion's share of infrastructural investment in roads, railways and transport being ploughed into the capital. As Senator Higgins pointed out, over 134 submissions have been received from cities, towns and villages for departmental offices to be decentralised. Longford County Council made a submission to the Government on the suitability of Longford for decentralisation. We are disappointed that decentralisation has not happened, despite promises by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that it would by the end of 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">On his recent visit to County Longford the Minister of State inspected some of those sites and saw that they were suitable for agencies and offices of Departments. As Senators know, Longford is a central location and suitable for an office of a major Department. By far the single largest issue remains job creation, with the workforce increasing and high unemployment. The country exhibits clear signs of bleeding vital resources with high emigration in general and loss of graduates and, in particular, loss of service and capital and a communications system which pulls everything towards Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">A huge number of rural schools are at risk from population decline. One need only look at the recent census of population relating to County Longford, where the total population is falling with migration rates among the highest in the country. Declining populations are threatening our secondary schools, resulting in possible amalgamation in some towns. There is a disturbingly high level of long-term unemployment and the loss of graduates from the region as a result of the lack of job opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">It is a fact of life that initiatives and strategies come and go but the bottom line is that we are still in a situation where one part of the country is overcrowded and over-resourced, while the rest is under-populated and starved of essential infrastructure, development and services. I call on the Minister of State to end this uncertainty with regard to decentralisation and place before this House a coherent and workable blueprint for its implementation. I expected more from him. I expected action rather than more empty promises and would appreciate if he came clean and gave the people a clear indication of what he plans to do with decentralisation. It looks like this will be a long-paying record which will run until the next general election, which I presume will be held sooner than four years – perhaps even within 12 months – given how the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil are carrying on. We will have an opportunity to witness that this evening when the vote is called in the debate on third level fees.</p>

I caution Senators opposite that when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in government make a decision to do something, they do so in a careful and calculated manner for many obvious reasons, of which I am sure Senators are aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Caution is important at this stage. Senator Daly identified the difficulty associated with the process of decentralisation, particularly around election time, because we are open to criticism that we are favouring a particular constituency, whereas if we wait, Senator Bannon and others demand that we decentralise offices of Departments to every town, village and crossroads. However, with a capable Minister and Minister of State, I have no doubt that approach will not prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Decentralisation is critical to the main planks of Government policy, which recognise the need for balanced regional development with a national development plan – which we are midway through – and a national spatial strategy. If we are serious about these, it is incumbent upon us to ensure we have a proper process of decentralisation that will allow for those planks of Government policy to be implemented and the process set in train.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">We live on a small island and, unfortunately, the concentration of population is on the east coast and growing, as is clear from surveys of growth of population, business and industry. If we are to be consistent about Government policy, there is a necessity to change this. An island with fantastic resources such as we have provides communities beyond the east coast, particularly along the west coast, with the opportunity to assist in providing a home for Government agencies and Departments. It is necessary to assist those who wish to move out of the cities and large towns on the east coast and provide them with the facilities, security and job and career prospects in their native areas, particularly in rural areas. All of this will assist with the major planks of Government policy already referred to. There are benefits for all in this approach, particularly for those who have the opportunity to return to their native areas and provide the resources to develop their communities. This also has the spin-off effect of assisting the alleviation of congestion in our cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Earlier today we had a debate with the Minister for Transport about the work he has done and intends to do on foot of the strategic rail review. That document recognises that the increased use of cars on the east coast provides a major challenge to traffic managers trying to sort out congestion problems. Decentralisation goes some way towards this by moving people away from congested areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The Government is a blue chip employer in that there is none of the concerns associated with other industries such as whether they will last through times of international economic downturn. That fact will provide the catalyst for sustainable development, give life to many struggling towns and assist with their growth potential. However, it is important that we get the correct sized agency or departmental office for individual towns. Senator Daly has pointed out that some medium-sized towns can handle much greater numbers than many of us would suggest. For example, people argued that the construction of Moneypoint would put a major strain on the surrounding area. However, during construction there were some 2,000 workers and the town managed to cater for them excellently. There continues to be a large level of employment and the surrounding towns and villages have succeeded in growing and developing to meet their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The Minister will be aware of the project mentioned by Senator Daly involving Kilrush, Newcastle West and Listowel. I join in asking the Minister to give it serious consideration. There have been a number of proposals in this regard. The project is imaginative in the sense that there is a recognition that we need a large block of employment in that region and that none of the towns on their own would be capable of absorbing the large block.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">We have come together with Kilrush, Newcastle West and Listowel, using the existing infrastructure, particularly the ferry linking Listowel with County Clare. However, on the other side there is considerable infrastructure already in place, including Shannon Airport. There are towns such as Ennis and access to Galway, which is important from an educational point of view. It is an ideal combination.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The project is a good idea for two reasons. There is the capacity to have a large Department, which is important for the civil servants who are decentralised, because they need a proper career path. There is no point in putting a small agency of 20 people in Kilrush because there are no career prospects for the people working there and their growth within the Department or agency will be stunted. An entire Department or agency can allow for the career prospects of the people who transfer. Secondly, when these people are transferred, their quality of life will improve, as Senator Daly said. Educational needs are catered for with universities in Limerick and Galway and access is provided by Shannon Airport. The road infrastructure is good and Ennis and Shannon are recognised in the national spatial strategy as being of high quality. This provides as much as we can on the Clare side. I am sure the Minister recognises since our recent win that the sporting side of things is also exceptionally good.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Minister will be well aware of recent census indications of a major shift in population away from the west coast and it has been designated a CLÁR region. CLÁR on its own is not in a position to deliver much unless the responsible Department makes the decision to put in place a particular infrastructural development, a policy or an investment. The programme, through the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and his Department, will be in a position to add further investment to the area. On this basis, I ask the Minister to consider the proposal seriously. I join my colleagues in urging the Minister, at a time when there are fewer constraints, to move ahead with this project as quickly as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_376">I was elected to Roscommon County Council in 1999 from the town of Boyle. There are many towns like Boyle all around the country. It is not a county town or even a major town. However, it is a town with a proud past. It was a market town with many shops and businesses, some of which had been there for three generations. However, in the past 20 years a huge shift has taken place and the survival of towns such as Boyle has been challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Boyle was not large enough to attract major firms such as Dunnes, Penneys and Tesco. The retail business has moved to the major towns and unfortunately we cannot attract young business people to take over the older businesses. Like many other towns, it did not have a major hospital. It had no Government Department and no county council. Most county towns have an office of the county council providing at least 200 or 300 jobs. Eircom, or Telecom Éireann, as it was called, and the ESB were not represented, so there were no safe jobs. It had no Government decentralisation. Boyle and towns like it carried on primarily because of the people who lived in them and the businesses run by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced nearly four years ago that 10,000 jobs would be moved to areas which had not already benefited from decentralisation, I was very excited, as were most of the councillors in my county. We drew up a submission which showed that County Roscommon had a low crime rate, affordable housing and access from Boyle to Castlereagh to Ballaghaderreen to Roscommon town. If 200 jobs came to Roscommon town – if the Government took a visionary attitude and decided to relocate a full Department to a town such as this – there could be a cluster effect. Senator Daly agrees with me, because he came up with the same idea. For example, if the Department of Agriculture and Food could relocate, lock, stock and barrel, to an agricultural county such as Roscommon, 500 or 600 jobs would be created – perhaps 200 in Roscommon town, 100 in Castlereagh, 100 in Ballaghaderreen and 100 in Boyle. Staff could live wherever they wanted in the county and if they were promoted they would not have to move back to Dublin but could move within the county. That would be a major attraction for County Roscommon and many other counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">We have a very successful factory, and I have often congratulated Senator Leyden, who was instrumental over ten or 15 years in bringing that factory to Boyle. These things will not be forgotten. I have said this on the record of Roscommon County Council and I say it again in the House. Small industries mean much to the survival of towns such as Boyle. Like most towns, we have a new school, but unfortunately in these areas there is a cycle of emigration which continues throughout our lives. I draw to the Minister's attention what is happening. When people leave school at 18 they go away to college, to Dublin or the UK or the USA. When they have raised their families they relocate to towns like Boyle and we think it is great that they have come back. Unfortunately, however, the cycle has gone on since the 1960s and the children of that generation have grown up and are going away again. I have no doubt that in another 20 years they will come back to raise their children in Boyle, but we will have lost 20 of the most productive years of their lives. The cycle must be stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I was very disappointed to see that the 10,000 jobs announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, were being created little by little, in a drip effect. There was a haemorrhage of jobs to areas with Government Ministers. Jobs went to Deputy O'Donoghue's constituency in Kerry, Deputy McCreevy's constituency in Kildare, Deputy Fahey's constituency in Galway and Deputy Michael Smith's constituency in Tipperary. I am afraid this is a kind of slush fund that will be used for these areas, although the Minister may prove me wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Minister said that decentralisation should be used as an economic torch, shining light into areas that have not prospered in recent years – the programme should focus on towns that have not benefited significantly from the recent boom. I welcome that. Before the last election, the Taoiseach said that towns such as Boyle would not be forgotten. All we want is about 100 jobs to ensure the survival of Boyle. We have promised a free site in which to locate a decentralised Department or agency. I will thank the Government if it delivers on its promises for Boyle, but I will confront it if it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Rural Ireland faces many challenges. One decision that can be made to ensure the viability of rural towns is to decentralise these jobs now to areas that desperately need them.</p>

Given his knowledge of rural areas, no one is better equipped to be aware of what is happening in every part of the country. He knows exactly the requirements. It is ideal that he is in this Department at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I thank Senator Feighan for his kind words. His commitment to decentralisation is evident. I will not go into what happened in the past, but there has been a change of policy within Fine Gael. I am delighted about that.

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_386">I want to put this in context. It is important to set out the background to this matter, given that there are those who might criticise this Government over delays in honouring its commitment in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">A decision was made in 1992 to decentralise the General Register Office to Roscommon town, which it has taken ten years to achieve, that being one of the longest sagas in the history of decentralisation. That office has been decentralised for some time to Roscommon town and the staff are based in good quality temporary accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The new buildings to accommodate civil servants have been approved by An Bord Pleanála in the past two weeks. I appeal to the Minister of State to move forward the contract process to ensure the builders move on to the site. These buildings are to accommodate in one quality complex all the decentralised Government offices in Roscommon town. I refer to the agricultural office, the social welfare office, the General Register Office and the driving test centre under the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the temporary offices of which are in an appalling condition. This new complex will accommodate more than 200 civil servants and it will have crèche and other facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">When a decision was made by the Government in 1992 when I was a Deputy to decentralise the General Register Office to Roscommon town, Garret FitzGerald objected. He said that it was unsuitable to decentralise that office because his academic friends might have great difficulty finding the town of Roscommon, even though it is on a major rail link.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">He certainly did. He thought it was a retrograde step, but fortunately we now have computerisation, broadband access, e-mail and other forms of communication. The computerisation of some 70 million files in that office is proceeding very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We should be talking about decentralisation of the Dáil or the Seanad outside Dublin. It is time somebody grasped that nettle, particularly in a future all-Ireland context, whether such decentralisation would be to the Northern counties or a neutral location somewhere midway between the North and the South. This city would be enhanced if the 166 Deputies and 60 Senators were located outside it. It is time we took a stand in this House and said that should be the policy. It was considered in the past that the Oireachtas should be relocated outside the capital. Such decentralisation would show leadership to the people.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_394">Roscommon, being the heart of Ireland, would also be a possible location.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">From my research on this issue, I understand that 120 towns have applied for decentralised offices. There are some 13 or 14 large folders in the Department containing submissions from towns throughout the country, but nobody knows the number of civil servants who are seeking to transfer from Dublin. Some say that 18,000 civil servants have applied, but some have applied to several Departments. It is important for the Minister to establish the exact number of civil servants who have applied to transfer to offices in towns and counties such as Roscommon, Longford, Mayo and elsewhere. This information should be readily available within the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Like Senator Feighan, I would say that County Roscommon, through the county council, has made an excellent submission. Roscommon town is centrally located and has all the necessary facilities to attract major decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I must also make a pitch for the town of Boyle, which put forward an attractive draft brochure to the Minister and the Government. Boyle has offered three to five acres of land free of charge to the Government for decentralised offices. That is a wonderful offer by the Termon and Warren Land Trustees and the Boyle Chamber of Commerce. They are not only saying that they want and need something in Boyle but are putting their money where their mouth is and saying that they will make land available free of charge. The same would apply to towns like Roscommon which would seek to provide services.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Ballaghaderreen lost out on the decentralisation of the Office of Public Works, for which the Minister of State now has responsibility, in the period between two coalition Governments. I will not blame the person responsible for that. The offices were intended to be decentralised to Boyle but were transferred to Ballaghaderreen and they are now closed. I would like to see towns such as Ballaghaderreen, Elphin and Strokestown considered for decentralisation. The idea suggested by Senator Feighan is worthwhile from the point of view of the location of offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Decentralisation is an extremely important policy. I am convinced that the Government, with the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, will finalise this major decision in the not too distant future. This process will be carried out during the period of this Government. Nobody will accept that the 10,000 civil servants concerned will not be decentralised before the next general election in June 2007. That is the deadline. I refer to 10,000 jobs to be relocated throughout the length and breadth of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I am delighted the Minister of the State said that many of the towns included as gateways and hubs in the spatial strategy are already significantly developed and would not be economically transformed by decentralisation in the same way as smaller towns. No town in Roscommon is a hub or a gateway and therefore the county must benefit from decentralisation, according to the Minister of State's statement. When he went forward for the presidency of the IFA he was not let down in Roscommon, but that is neither here nor there. The Minister of State has a great record in County Roscommon and he has many friends there. I believe he will not be found wanting. He has a great knowledge of rural areas. Given what he said, Roscommon must be guaranteed jobs under this process, bearing in mind that it is one of the few counties that is not a hub.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I am delighted that we are not a hub or a gateway because under decentralisation we would benefit greatly. I am sure Senator Feighan would agree that the point to which I refer is one of the most significant in the Minister of State's speech. This is something I have been waiting to hear. When the spatial strategy was published I was concerned that the gateways and hubs would be the towns that would benefit from decentralisation, but it is stated in the Minister of State's speech as Government policy that the opposite is true. A county like Roscommon which was deprived under that strategy will now benefit from decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The Prison Service was decentralised to Castlereagh, a development for which the people there fought. When a former Fine Gael-Labour Government decided to scrap that project, a wall was built around the complex. Every time those parties were in Government, they removed something from Roscommon. I believe Nora Owen was the then Minister for Justice. People protested on the streets of Dublin in this regard. One American said, "My God, they want a prison. Down our way in Delaware we don't want a prison." People in Roscommon were so desperate that they fought for a prison and they got it, despite the actions of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government. Senator Feighan will have to fight very hard to make sure he secures decentralisation for County Roscommon if he wants to move from this House to the other House following the next general election.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_403">This is not a broadcast on behalf of Sligo for decentralisation, but I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. I join others in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The issue of the regional imbalance in Ireland is a major concern to each Member of this House. The current situation, where a major portion of the population lives and works in one city while at the same time there is increasing rural depopulation, is neither viable, practical nor sustainable. Due to the recent rapid pace of economic growth, bottlenecks and other signs of pressure on capacity are becoming evident in faster growing regions of the country while others are lagging behind in terms of growth performance. We are left with a situation where there are two sets of problems in urban and rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">All major cities, especially Dublin, have undergone rapid expansion in the past five years. All have seen explosive growth in population, employment and business investment, which has been broadly welcomed. However, at the same time, we must recognise that such explosive growth has been accompanied by a new set of difficulties, including excess demand for housing and public services with traffic congestion. This, in turn, has meant that people's quality of life has not improved at the same rate as their incomes and, in some instances, not at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The problem in rural areas is the opposite. It is not excess but insufficient demand. It is not just that they can accommodate more jobs and people – they desperately need them. They need an injection of vibrancy and energy if they are to achieve their full potential and maintain the culture, traditions and dynamism that have always defined rural and regional Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Although these represent different problems, one policy can significantly contribute to solving these difficulties. Decentralisation has a crucial role to play in tackling the problem of regional imbalance. In symbolic terms, the convening of full Cabinet meetings throughout the country, beginning with Ballaghaderreen in 2000, shows that we are prepared to bring Government outside the capital. However, symbolic gestures are no longer enough. Political commitment will only be taken seriously when accompanied by practical action.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">We cannot continue to urge companies, especially multinational corporations, to locate new and expanding businesses in regional locations unless we are equally prepared to consider such an option. Therefore, the time has come for a tangible and positive indication of how far the Government is prepared to carry this commitment to improve the regional spread of our economic well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">We have decentralised individual offices to areas outside Dublin. For example, Sligo hosts a section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and it is clear that the people working there have enjoyed a positive experience since relocating. Those who have moved out of Dublin to the regions have found that they live in areas with lower house prices and greater availability of housing, sufficient sports and recreational facilities for all, a cleaner environment – often blue flag beaches, mountains, lakes and rivers all within easy access of rural towns, as well as a wealth of historical, cultural and visual amenities.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Despite the process of moving smaller blocks of public administration to smaller towns, the bulk of government in the broadest sense continues to operate out of Dublin city centre. We must examine the acceleration of the process in order that in future we can think in terms of locating a number of different sectors of public administration in regional locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">There is no longer any reason the vast bulk of our administration system should be based in Dublin. This is especially true in the information age when data can be transferred at the click of a mouse not just from county to county or country to country but from continent to continent. We live in a world where location and distance are decreasing in importance. An American with a problem on his IBM computer rings a helpline. The call may be made in Boston and answered in Blanchardstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Given the introduction of the broadband system in many areas of the country, many towns offer modern high speed transmission systems to match the best available. There is now no reason a Government office cannot function as efficiently and effectively in Carrick-on-Shannon, Boyle, Roscommon town or Sligo town as it can in Dublin city centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Although I am glad to see that some offices are located outside Dublin, I firmly believe a piecemeal approach to decentralisation will not work. Moving small units will never make a real impact. We must be prepared to think big if we want to achieve real results and use decentralisation as a way of revitalising and rejuvenating whole towns and communities. It makes good human resource and economic sense to decentralise larger sections of Departments to towns and cities. For example, a section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is located in Sligo. It would be logical, therefore, to move further sections to the same area or nearby, which would give equitable opportunities for promotion and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Decentralisation is a win-win option. Dublin will stand to gain from any reduction in the huge demand and pressures which place such a strain on services in our capital city. At the same time, rural towns and communities stand to gain not only from an influx of people but also from the injection of energy, enthusiasm, not to mention cash, which the people concerned will bring with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Regional imbalance must be addressed if Ireland's growth potential is to be fully realised. The Government has firmly committed itself to tackling this problem. The regionalisation of the country into Objective One and Objective One in transition areas as well as the awarding of gateway and hub status show that we are prepared to target incentives at those areas where development is needed most. However, now is the time to follow these initiatives firmly with definite and genuine plans to establish government outside Dublin. Decentralisation is not an end in itself, rather the beginning, a method whereby we can begin to address some of the serious regional imbalances that have developed in recent years. For this reason, I call on the Government to implement a policy of decentralisation without delay.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_418">I am aware of that as it is located in my constituency. I know its location and a good number of those who work there are diligent on my behalf at election time. I know all about the CSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The movement out of Dublin of parts or the entirety of Government agencies is only one type of decentralisation. The country's greatest public administrative problem is that it is grossly over-centralised in terms of decision-making. An enormous amount of unnecessary work is referred to a central authority as if there was some expertise there superior to that available in a local authority. The famous "I am directed by the Minister" letter from a civil servant to a senior official in a local authority, when that civil servant is probably neither as qualified nor experienced and definitely not as knowledgeable as the official in the local authority, is a classic example of the pretence that centralisation is better. I wish to say before anyone who has done some reading on this contributes that those in the social democratic left throughout Europe were fantastic centralisers and it took them about 30 years to realise that it was not necessarily the best way to manage public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The fundamental problem is the lack of thinking about changing the distribution of decision-making, which is additional to moving part of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to Sligo, the Central Statistics Office to Cork, the Legal Aid Board to Caherciveen or whatever. These are arguably good, although I am not sure they serve the purpose in some cases. Real decentralisation will only come about when decision-making is moved out of Dublin to where it needs to take place. The trend in public administration, especially in the context of the proposed abolition of health boards, is to do the opposite. We could end up with the ridiculous scenario where health boards would be abolished, a central management unit established in Dublin to manage their work and a demand to have that unit decentralised to Athlone or somewhere to deal with the Government's plans for decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I will give an example, at the risk of annoying a colleague in my party. The location of the Environmental Protection Agency in a fairly small town in County Wexford, which is inaccessible by any serious method of public transport, is of no great service. There are some parts of the Minister's contribution that I did not like. However, I was taken by the part where he referred to the things that must be achieved. He spoke about creating a public service that will be quality, performance and results driven, that will achieve value for money, that will focus on the needs of its customers, that will be accountable, etc. How can the Environmental Protection Agency be focused on the needs of its customers when an environmental agency effectively requires that anybody who wants to do business with it must travel by car?</p>
          <p eId="para_422">If we are talking about decentralisation – regardless of whether it involves public bodies, public agencies or various powers – a network of infrastructure must be put in place which makes the areas where decentralised bodies are located accessible to everybody. The great temptation is always to locate things in Dublin because the radial nature of the roads and rail system makes it easy to get to Dublin. All sorts of agencies find it easier to hold meetings in Dublin because people from around the country can get to Dublin easily by train or by car. If we are talking seriously about decentralisation, it should be as easy to get to Galway from Cork by train as it is to get to Dublin. It should also be as easy to get to Sligo or a range of other towns as it is to get to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Decentralisation is not just about taking a group or a part of a public body, erecting a building – however aesthetically pleasing – in an appropriate town in a rural area and saying that this represents decentralisation. It is decentralisation of administration, but it is not decentralisation of the service and it is not going to meet the criterion of the Minister of State, which is to be focused on the needs of its customers – particularly if customers cannot gain access to it without staying overnight in the place in which it is located.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The Internet is a great liberating infrastructure which should make decentralisation easier. Of 30 countries, Ireland has the least developed broadband infrastructure. I am almost addicted to the Internet. The speed of downloading from the Internet is still abysmally low in Ireland. I would not wish it on a citizen to have to do any serious business with a Government body via the Internet until there is access to a proper, efficient, reliable, affordable broadband network. I know that 700,000 lines are being made available, but Intel has referred to the fact that Ireland is at the end of the queue internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We must move beyond administration into management and decision-making in the context of decentralisation and examine our road and rail infrastructure. We must build a road and rail infrastructure which is posited on the assumption of a transformation of public administration and public management. We must then look at the delivery of powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I am amazed at the things that still must be referred to central Government. I recall a discussion approximately two years ago about the safety aspects of the horse-drawn carriages on St. Stephen's Green. An official from Dublin City Council spoke on the radio about the issue. He was very well-informed and stated that draft regulations on insurance were being produced but they would have to then go to the Department for approval. What expertise rested in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to second-guess an official of Dublin City Council about the provision of horse-drawn carriages around St. Stephen's Green? The answer is none. We have a belief in hierarchy – it is probably derived from our experience of the church – that if a matter is passed up to a higher level, a better decision will be made. That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I have read a vast amount of correspondence between a third level institution, the identity of which Members can easily guess, and the building unit of the Department of Education and Science regarding a major building programme. I have no complaints about the quality of people in the Department of Education and Science, but – from reading the correspondence to which I refer, which encompasses a period of two to three years – it seems that its major contribution was to add 18% to the cost of the buildings. Whatever minuscule savings were made through the identification of little things with which it did not agree, the three-year delay meant that there was a price increase. What is the point in centralising authority to put together a mystique of expertise which is no greater than that of those who made the original decision? A huge amount of the excessive bureaucracy would be eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">If local authorities were responsible for most of the provision of funding for education and if they had responsibility for much of the policing function and a responsibility for a dozen different areas, then the administrative skills and capacities of the local authorities would need to be expanded. The same civil servants who are now based in Dublin could be invited to move and work with the local authorities which had been given expanded powers. That would have the same effect as the decentralisation of parts of Government Departments. It would mean that local authorities would then have real authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">We are being given a consultative forum which is supposed to cover the nakedness of county and city managers who make decisions by themselves, in most cases, and who increasingly do so in the future. That is what I do not understand. I fear that this will simply be the decentralisation of public administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I welcome the fact that the Minister of State referred to the need for State offices to be seen as flagship buildings which make a statement and which are a source of pride to local communities. The Minister of State's Department – this happened before his time so he had nothing to do with it – built Government offices on Sullivan's Quay in Cork. They certainly make a statement which is that we are utterly indifferent to whatever plans Cork City Council has for preserving streetscapes and street levels. It is the ugliest building erected in Cork in the past 30 years and the only statement it makes is that the Office of Public Works is entirely indifferent to the plans that the local authority might have for the area. That is not just my opinion because I have discussed the matter with senior officials of the city council. It was made clear to them at an early stage that what they thought should be done in the city was a matter of indifference to the then Office of Public Works. That was 20 years ago, so it does not much matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I am aware that the law has changed because of a High Court decision which was fought all the way to the Supreme Court by the Office of Public Works. The record is very patchy. Parts of the Office of Public Works construct wonderful buildings but, when it comes to building public offices, it seems that a Stalinist socialist realism takes over and big, ugly square blocks are landed wherever is most convenient for the Office of Public Works. If decentralisation of administration is to go ahead, the buildings should at least be worthy of and appropriate to the towns in which they are located.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_432">I agree with much that Senator Ryan said and, in particular, that there are two types of decentralisation, namely, decentralisation of the central office that simply operates from another part of the country and devolution of authority about matters such as housing or schools decisions up to a regional basis. I accept that, in respect of the second item, we are over-centralised.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Senator Ryan referred to Cork where he could have had the Environmental Protection Agency. It is my firm conviction that if An Foras Forbartha had not resisted in 1992, decentralisation to Cork would either still continue to this day or the EPA, as a successor body, would be located there. Perhaps I could send a message to any State agency which feels it is under threat that if it applies for decentralisation, it might well help secure its future.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I welcome this debate. The interest in and commitment to decentralisation on this side of the House are visible in the number of people there who have contributed and are sitting on the benches. I welcome the Minister of State's speech and the philosophy behind it, which is very positive. It is entirely in line with my thinking that decentralisation should be used as an economic torch to shine light into areas that have not prospered in recent years. The programme should focus on towns that have not benefited significantly from the recent boom and the fact that the gateways and hubs are not the primary areas for decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">We should remind ourselves of the history. One of the most successful pieces that no one thinks of as decentralisation is the Garda Training College, Templemore. It represents an outstandingly successful and major piece of decentralisation which is admired well beyond the country. There was a programme of decentralisation in 1981 which, following a series of Government changes, was cancelled by the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition. It was reinstated in 1982 and then cancelled again.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">People have had the mistaken notion that decentralisation costs money in net terms. Senator MacSharry's father, when Minister for Finance, introduced decentralisation in the late 1980s as a cost-cutting measure because rents and many other associated costs were lower in towns throughout the country than in central Dublin. There were two tranches of decentralisation in the late 1980s and early 1990s and, as far as I can judge, they were successful. There was decentralisation under the last Government viz the North-South Implementation Bodies, including the food safety office in Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I come from a town in Tipperary which is greatly looking forward to decentralisation from which it would benefit enormously. It fits the criteria set out by the Minister of State who also made a contribution on the matter on 15 April in reply to Senator Finucane in which he laid down other criteria when he referred to the success of the new programme and proximity to third level education facilities, on which Tipperary would certainly qualify being close to the University of Limerick, the location of the Tipperary Rural Development Institute, within commuting distance of Cork and having convenient access to Dublin. Limerick Junction, which caters for eight trains a day in each direction, is just two miles away. There is the availability of sites and offices and a quality of life in terms of every type of sports facility. There are also good schools available. It is located in a very attractive part of the country, underneath the Galtee Mountains. There are many places to visit as people discovered when I had a family wedding with guests from abroad. It is located at a crossroads between Limerick and Waterford on one axis and very close to the Dublin-Cork axis. From all points of view, it would benefit greatly from decentralisation. While it has good facilities, it needs more people to use and sustain them. Decentralisation would fulfil this need.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I also mention Carrick-on-Suir. In the list of towns for the RAPID programme Longford was at the top, Tipperary was second and Carrick-on-Suir, third. Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir are twins in many ways, whether in relation to urban renewal, the RAPID programme and so on. That may also be the case in relation to decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">In the short term there may appear to be more losers than winners in that it is hardly possible to announce at once 100 towns that will benefit from decentralisation. However, the Government must take its courage in its hands, with our support. It will probably have to do it on a phased basis because it is probably impossible to do it at once. It is important to negotiate with those involved, including the trade unions. There would not be much point announcing decentralisation to Malin Head if there was a full-scale revolt the following day.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I commend the Government for the work it has been doing. There has been much careful and systematic preparation and the people of Tipperary are looking forward to the announcement of the programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_441">I welcome the Minister of State. The fact that we are discussing this programme four and half years after the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced it is a ringing indictment of this and the previous Government. We should be reviewing how effectively decentralisation is working but instead we are still talking about it. People are sick to the teeth of hearing the word and want to see action. I am pleased that the Minister of State referred to the process beginning this year. However, I will believe it when I see it.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The Minister made an announcement on decentralisation four and a half years ago when he asked civil servants to indicate if they would be interested in moving. He received an overwhelming reply. Approximately 18,000 indicated that they would be willing to move. Therefore, there is no difficulty with them, it is a question of the Government getting its act together and the process under way. According to information received by Fine Gael, approximately 7,800 civil servants in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are willing to move, 4,300 in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, 4,100 in the Department of Agriculture and Food, 427 in the Department of Education and Science, 393 in the Department of Defence, 370 in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, 314 in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, 243 in the Department of Transport, 197 in the Department of Health and Children, 13 in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and two in the Department of Foreign Affairs, giving a total of 18,324. Almost twice as many civil servants are willing to move as are planned for. Therefore, no one can deny the urgency and need for decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I welcome the reference by the Minister of State to Carlow, in particular, as it was snubbed and ignored in the national spatial strategy. Even though my friends in Cavan were included at the last minute, we, in Carlow, were omitted. Perhaps it is a reflection on the good Senators in Cavan. Even though Carlow is the gateway to the south-east, it was not even given hub status, never mind gateway status. I welcome the Minister of State's comments that many of the towns included as gateways and hubs in the national spatial strategy are already significantly developed and would not be economically transformed by decentralisation in the same way as smaller towns. I assume he will look after towns like Carlow that were ignored in the national spatial strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Senator Mansergh mentioned suitable towns in County Tipperary. Nobody can deny that Carlow would be attractive, given that it has two third level institutions, a good supply of housing and good infrastructure. There are plans to put in place even better infrastructure in the near future. Apart from being the tidiest town in the country and winning litter free status, it has won many Leinster club finals and has a good sporting infrastructure. There are some fantastic golf courses, swimming pools and leisure centres. These add to the quality of life and we are here to improve people's quality of life. Life is not just about working all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I urge the Minister of State to consider Carlow and rectify the mistake of the Government in leaving it out of the national spatial strategy. If he can do that by decentralising a Government Department or part of one to Carlow, it would be most welcome. Population decline is affecting Carlow. Census figures show that the population in some parts of south Carlow is decreasing. These areas would benefit from decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The Government should get the process of decentralisation under way so that in a year we can return to debate this issue again. However, rather than discuss decentralisation, we can discuss its effectiveness, whether it is working and how it can work better.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Everything in Ireland has gone wrong in terms of planning. Everything is located in Dublin and that should not be the case. There is no need for it. Decentralisation has worked well in the past. Sections of the Department of Social and Family Affairs are based in Sligo, while the driving licences section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government is located in Ballina. When one drives through such towns during a Seanad election campaign, one can see the benefits of a Government Department being located there.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">There is a new industrial park on the outskirts of Carlow town awaiting investment. We would welcome a Government Department there. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that Carlow and the other towns that have been omitted, economically and socially, in the past are brought back into focus. Hopefully, this will not be a case of empty promises, as occurred before the general election.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">When Fianna Fáil returned to Government, it fulfilled its promise and brought 120 civil servants to Cavan. We make no apologies for that. I urge the Government to include Cavan among the centres to be selected for the forthcoming decentralisation programme. A number of factors underpin this request.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Cavan occupies a strategic position on the corridor linking Dublin to Enniskillen and Donegal. Centrally located in the north midlands, Cavan is a gateway to and from Northern Ireland and is also a pivotal point on the east-west route to be developed between Dundalk and Sligo. While the area is now identified as being within the greater Dublin commuter belt, it has kept its unspoilt and attractive environment relatively free from traffic congestion. It is conveniently located within easy access of regional and international routes and is only two hours away from three airports – Dublin, Belfast and Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The national development plan provides for a major upgrading of the N3 route, with a proposed dual carriageway from Kells to Dublin and high quality single carriageway from Kells to Cavan. While there is no rail service, which we discussed earlier, bus services have improved dramatically in recent years. Bus Éireann operates services to Dublin 19 times daily, to Enniskillen five times daily and to Dundalk, Galway and Belfast each day. Several private operators also provide access to Dublin. In a recent survey, it was discovered that 3,000 people commute each day to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Cavan town has sufficient land zoned and serviced to accommodate development which will cater immediately for an increase of 6,000 new residents. Rented accommodation is also readily available in the town and surrounding areas. There are numerous pre-school facilities in the county. There are six registered full day care providers and seven seasonal service providers within three to four miles of Cavan town centre. There are eight primary and four post-primary schools within a two mile radius. The quality of schools in the area is second to none.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">County Cavan Vocational Education Committee established the Cavan college of further studies in 1984. This provides a wide range of third level, certificate and diploma courses, including business studies, accounting technician, information technology, services in tourism, applied social studies, child care and international teleservices. The college is now recognised as one of the largest and most successful post-leaving certificate colleges outside Dublin and Cork. A new college on a green field site is at an advanced planning stage and will commence in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">A multiplicity of universities and other third level educational institutions are located one and a half hours from Cavan, for example, in Dublin, Dundalk, Belfast, Maynooth, Athlone, Sligo and Letterkenny. The County Cavan innovation and technology centre has recently been developed as part of a cross-Border programme to support local, regional and national agencies in stimulating an environment conducive to innovation, entrepreneurship and inward investment in the Cavan-Fermanagh region.</p>

          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_459">I thank Senator Wilson for sharing time.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Decentralisation is an important business. One might wonder why I call it a business when nobody else has mentioned the word. However, it is a business. It is an important business for several reasons, not least because it affects the lives, careers and futures of people and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Decentralisation is about balance and addressing regional imbalance and urban regeneration. It is about looking at east versus west and north versus south. I am glad that a Fianna Fáil-led Government has given a commitment to look at these areas. I remind Senator Browne that Fianna Fáil-led Governments have always accommodated decentralisation. His party never accommodated it in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">One cannot look at this from just a parochial point of view. If one's town is not chosen for decentralisation, one cannot get into a huff about it. I will congratulate the towns that benefit from decentralisation because the neighbouring towns will benefit from the spill-over. I can say this from experience. Although I am from Offaly, I live in Sligo and towns such as Ballymoate and Tubbercurry, to the south, Dromore West and Easkey, to the west, and Grange and Cliffoney, to the north, have benefited as a result of decentralisation to Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Senator Higgins talked about Ministers bringing things to their home town. Does it matter who brings them, provided they are brought? The Opposition is forever telling us that people have short memories, but I do not know how short memories come into it, if one has a problem with Ministers bringing things to their home town. My home town of Tullamore has done exceptionally well, but it has a vibrant, active and hard-working Minister. There is also a hard-working Minister of State in the south of the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I ask the Minister of State not to forget Birr. We are still waiting to see something nice brought to the town and I am sure the people living there will reward the Minister of State in whatever way they can – if there are a few votes going begging after the Minister for Foreign Affairs gets them, they will throw them his way.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_465">I welcome the debate because this is a crucial issue. I do not blame any Government but, in many ways, the west is almost a wasteland, it is dying on its feet. I made this point last week about a number of towns. Kilbeggan and Ballinrobe are both without a hotel, although they had one previously. I travel the country more than most Members and always look for the old, traditional local hotel when I drive through a town. Most of the time it is either closed or there are better facilities in a guesthouse. For infrastructural reasons, Governments of all hues gave tax breaks to build hotels and while those schemes were abused, there was a good reason behind them.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The Minister of State was given the wrong advice. He mentioned commercial viability but people said budget airlines would not be commercially viable. They said the man who had decided to build a €13 million hotel in Ballymore, County Cavan, was out of his mind and that he would lose every penny. I have seen these ideas time and again and the problem with the decision making process is that it is driven too much by current demand without taking potential demand into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">If the Minister of State, on his way home, takes the Summerhill road and the shortcut between Killucan and Milltownpass and crosses the canal, he will pass Killucan railway station. It is in the middle of nowhere within 40 minutes of Dublin and would be an ideal place for Westmeath County Council to develop and put in place infrastructure, giving something back to the village of Killucan which is fading away.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Towns should be encouraged to make a pitch for decentralisation. People used to build advance factories to attract businesses to their area. Towns should be asked to make similar pitches to show what they can offer to decentralised offices of Departments and should not get them just because they are located in a particular constituency. There are towns that already have the buildings and infrastructure in place, they simply need to be revitalised. Kilrush is an ideal example. I have no connection with the town whatsoever but it is a suitable candidate. There are wide streets, an old hotel that has closed down, like many in the area, and other large buildings where offices of Departments could be sited almost immediately. Kilrush, Newcastle West and Listowel have formed an axis to attract decentralisation and it makes sense. They are three very different towns that are culturally attractive, close to each other and to which development would give new drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I asked the chief executive officer of the largest and most successful IT company in Ireland what he looked for in a site. He told me that he preferred a greenfield site within an hour of an airport and which had connections to the rail system, broadband connection and housing, gyms and golf courses. He wanted space for his staff, he did not want to set up in a city. Such sites, with educational and social infrastructure, could be easily created.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The Minister of State should disregard much of the advice he gets that is based on current population, demand and possibilities. He should listen to the creative people who do one thing in the knowledge that the rest will follow. The hotel in Portumna was built from scratch and became successful while the hotel in Ballyconnell put infrastructure in place and was a major success. We should listen to the people concerned as we consider our options.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_471">I support the programme of decentralisation but I am worried by the Minister of State's speech. He takes a very different view of decentralisation from that laid out by the Tánaiste in replies to parliamentary questions and speeches. He has said many of the gateway and hub towns are already significantly developed and seems to be indicating that these should not be considered for decentralisation. In an ideal world it would be great if we could shine a light on towns that have not prospered in recent years but if the decentralisation programme is to work, we must decentralise to towns where housing stock and transport are available and the infrastructure is in place. It might be ideal to pick the 20 most disadvantaged towns and decentralise offices of Departments to them but we must decentralise to areas where people will want to live. It would be pointless to decentralise offices of Departments to a town if the people who are to move there cannot build or buy a house and would have to travel 50 or 60 miles to work every morning. That would be recentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I hope the Minister of State is not serious when he indicates that gateway and hub towns will not be included in the decentralisation programme. When the national spatial strategy was announced, every indication was given at the most senior level of Government that we would focus on the gateway and hub towns for decentralisation. We must be realistic and accept that there cannot be an office of a Department in every town and village and must look at the towns that have the services in place, with housing and education facilities readily available. The Minister of State should not make the mistake of selecting towns for reasons of geography if services are not available – that would be a disaster. There should be a focus on the gateways and hubs and everyone will be happy because there will be strong regional decentralisation.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_474">Like Senator Bradford, I find it hard to understand what the Minister of State said about the decentralisation programme in relation to hubs and gateways – that none of them will be considered. I am disappointed that he ruled out Wexford, Kilkenny and my town, Castlebar, for further decentralisation. That is a retrograde step because Castlebar is a hub town on the west coast and, if we are serious about decentralisation and bringing a proper balance to east-west population figures, cannot be ruled out. It has much going for it, including its tourism infrastructure and convenience for Westport.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The Minister of State said there should be efficient delivery of public services. When the decentralisation programme is put in place, it is hoped it will give quality performance. It should be results driven, achieve value for money and focus on the needs of its customers. It must be accountable, respond flexibly and rapidly to change and promote equal opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">We have seen the dispute outside the Department of Agriculture offices and in other areas around the country. These disputes are about promotion and equal opportunities, subjects mentioned in the Minister of State's speech. I do not understand why such disputes cannot be resolved. If promotion and equal opportunity are to be made part of the decentralisation programme, surely such opportunities should form part of the agreement under the social partnership programme.</p>

          <from>Mr. K. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_480">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for joining us to discuss this vital issue. Decentralisation has many advantages. By relocating various Government bodies and Departments away from Dublin we will be easing pressure on the capital and its infrastructure, as well as easing the pressure on the housing market in the city and reducing its traffic levels. With the vast majority of Dublin civil servants based in and around the city centre, such a relocation of staff would have a profound effect on the rush-hour traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">It is not just Dublin which will benefit from such measures. Decentralisation will have a significant effect on the towns and cities to which these Government bodies and Departments will move. Hundreds of thousands of people moving into towns throughout Ireland will have a significant effect on regional economies and a real effect on the ground. Local shops will experience a greater demand for their products and local service providers will have many more potential clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Such a boost to the local economy for any given area might also contribute to preventing further regional emigration. As the local economy improves, it will help to create more employment opportunities, will act as a spur for the development of better infrastructure, and provide an incentive for the building of more houses and other amenities. All these measures will help provide a better local government to help correct the impression held by many young people from outside Dublin, namely that if they wish to succeed, if they want opportunities, if they want to build a happy and healthy life with all the perks that modern Irish life provides, they must move to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The towns and cities selected as destinations under the decentralisation programme will not be the only areas to benefit. The surrounding areas will also reap the rewards of this programme. As these civil servants set up home in nearby towns and villages, we will see a knock-on effect that will benefit the country as a whole, right down to the smallest communities. The simple addition of an extra family to any rural community can have a significant effect on its future. When this programme of decentralisation is implemented, along with the national spatial strategy, it will help keep to a minimum the brain drain that has been eating away at rural Ireland for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">When all these factors are taken into account, it is clear just how significant the decentralisation programme is. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government, realise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">An area which can reap such benefits is County Laois. It is centrally located and has a relatively high quality of infrastructure. It has a young and energetic population and a capacity for growth and further development. All this marks Laois out as a prime candidate for decentralisation. When one also considers how Laois has been overlooked on previous occasions, the argument for choosing it is strengthened.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Of all the areas in Laois, the most deserving of the decentralisation benefits is the south of the county. If this area is to develop, to have any sustainable future, it must be considered as a location for substantial decentralisation. Knowing that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, spends much of his time in that area, I have no doubt that he will consider its case favourably.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I too welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and I welcome the decision and the commitment of the Government in going ahead with the decentralisation programme. I am sure that many fine applications have been received and assessed by the Department of Finance, and that the towns selected will play their roles in balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I support the application by Newcastle West, Listowel and Kilrush as an integrated application. The necessary infrastructure is in place in those locations. I agree with the Minister of State that State offices in the towns selected should be flagship buildings, and I have no doubt that with the involvement of the Office of Public Works, there will be flexibility in the design and location of those buildings in the towns, and that the quality of life of the 10,000 civil servants relocating will improve enormously.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">I thank the Senators who have made such a positive response. Senator Higgins spoke of the sheer coincidence of some of the more recently suggested locations for decentralisation. He mentioned Cahersiveen and Roscrea. I would remind Senator Higgins and other Fine Gael Senators that this is not a new phenomenon. In a previous Administration, both a Labour Minister referred to by Senator Brendan Ryan, and, I think, a former Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Yates, moved two Government Departments to County Wexford. It was just a sheer coincidence that both men came from there.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">It is probably a phenomenon that will last into the future, and there could be some coincidences with regard to the Government Departments being moved. It is no coincidence either that many Senators gave very positive and enthusiastic pitches for towns within their own constituencies – not that Senators have constituencies, but they might have in a future situation. I myself have been the subject of a number of pitches, and I feel that towns and communities which make very positive pitches are the ones that should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Much has been made of the numbers of civil servants anxious to move. There has been a major over-statement in this regard. A figure of 18,000 has been suggested and that is not realistic. Many of those civil servants would have made numerous applications, and there is a lot of re-recording there. Senator Browne suggested that the number of people in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who have sought a move exceeds the number of people actually working there.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_494">Perhaps. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, would no doubt be concerned about such a figure if that were the case, and I think it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Previously, there was a lot of difficulty moving people, and we know of some outrageous circumstances where people were moved to new premises only 100 metres away and sought compensation for such a move. It is generally accepted now that there is a very substantial number of civil servants based in Dublin who would wish to move to a decentralised location for all the reasons outlined in this House today in terms of quality of life. The arguments in favour of moving are very good.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Senators Brendan Ryan and Martin Mansergh referred to the criteria that might be laid down. I do not think there are any criteria, other than that everything should be taken into account. Templemore, a very successful location for training the Garda, was mentioned, and if someone were to draft criteria now, I doubt if Templemore would qualify. Portumna and Ballyconnell are two places where very successful hotels have been established by local entrepreneurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">In terms of making decisions about decentralisation, the Government will consider all aspects, and nowhere has yet been ruled in or out. Some people on the Opposition benches in this House—</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_498">Could the Minister of State say something about the hubs and gateways?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_159" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_499">I notice that people interpret speeches differently. I referred to many of the towns included as gateways and hubs, and I referred to three towns. The decision will not be made by me but by the Cabinet. There is a very strong Government commitment to decentralisation, and a similar commitment by Senators. It is a very sensible project for the Government. When the decision is made, the area will then be my responsibility in terms of when and to where the moves will be made. I will be responsible for providing the facilities, locations, buildings and sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Boyle has offered a site, and other towns already have suitable buildings. The Tánaiste recently visited Birr – it is mere coincidence that I happen to live beside Birr – to open a state-of-the-art technology centre there which is empty. The people of Birr made a strong plea to the Tánaiste to accept that the town would be an ideal location for a decentralisation move. There is much support for the move in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">While I cannot say when a decision on the decentralisation programme will be made, I understand it will be taken soon. Coming from a rural area, it is an issue to which I am committed. Decentralisation will give a boost to balanced regional development. While it will not be the answer to all the economic problems of rural areas, it will present an opportunity for the Government to put its money where its mouth is on the issue. We will be pushing the process along and I look forward to a decision being taken by the Cabinet soon and its speedy implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">It is important to point out to the House that decentralisation cannot happen overnight when one considers the need to acquire sites, etc. It will occur over a long period. One Member mentioned 25 towns as a more realistic figure, yet there are 110 hoping to have offices of Departments relocated. Some will be disappointed. A decentralised unit should have 200 individuals; anything less would be insufficient. The suggestion of "clustering" relocated departmental offices will be taken on board, as it has worked well.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">With regard to the attractiveness for civil servants, no civil servant will want to jeopardise his or her opportunities to move up the scale. If one has a cluster of 200 people and 600 in a ten to 15 mile radius, it will give an opportunity for the people concerned to move up the Civil Service scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I appreciate the contributions made by Senators and note a positive attitude to decentralisation. This will encourage the Cabinet to press ahead with the decision.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_525">I welcome the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, back to the House. There is some confusion about the procedure for this debate on rural development which commenced some time ago. There was a substantial number of speakers on the last occasion. Perhaps Members had looked for extra time and some did not get a chance to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">This is a good day to resume the debate as we have already debated the national spatial strategy, decentralisation and the strategic rail review. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has articulated some concerns in recent months with regard to planning and development in rural areas. Every Member of the Oireachtas, with other public representatives, has great difficulty with the heading rural development policy. What does "rural development" mean?</p>
          <p eId="para_527">In recent years there has been a rapid decline in many rural areas. While there is a great argument for the building of houses in such areas, they remain in decline. I shall provide an example. During the past five to six years, Mayo County Council received 16,500 planning applications and granted 15,000 planning permissions. That does not take into account those planning applications that have been withdrawn for one reason or another and those from people who received word in advance that they would be refused and withdrew their applications. Of the 15,000 successful applications, 10,000 new houses were built in rural areas of County Mayo. From the 1996 census of population to the 2001 census of population, the population declined by 2,500. This is a frightening statistic. The local authority granted 15,000 planning permissions, 10,000 new houses were built and yet the population declined by 2,500 over the five-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Nobody seems to know the reasons for this decline. One is that some of the houses to which I refer are holiday homes and are unoccupied for long periods. Other factors are that people are moving into towns and that younger people may have taken up summer jobs, etc., and may have been residing in the towns on the night the census took place. By any standard, it is a significant drop in population in a rural area – particularly when one considers that 10,000 houses were built. I do not know the answer in terms of reversing the decline in rural areas, but something needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Parlon, was here earlier for a debate on the decentralisation programme. I hope that programme and the strategic rail review, which we debated earlier, will reverse the decline in rural counties and achieve balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The Government will have to consider providing rail links along the west coast from Sligo to Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford. Other Members are seeking rail extensions to Shannon and Letterkenny. The services have got to be provided in order to attract people to those areas and thus maintain a balance on the east and west coasts.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">While we should consider the population decline in rural areas, Government policy favours more densely populated urban areas. That is also the policy at local authority level, where county and town development plans are put in place. Government policy is for higher population density. While this will work from the point of view of footpaths, public lighting, sewage facilities and so on, it may not be best at the end of the day. If there are to be greater urban populations there will be a decline in local post offices, shops and pubs in rural areas. The Government will have to put a policy in place to help fight the decline of small rural villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The GAA has done great work in the past in holding rural areas together. However, it is fighting an uphill battle in many areas because to run a rural GAA club – whether football or hurling or, indeed, both codes – costs between €50,000 and €60,000 annually. Given the declining population, there will be an even greater strain to raise resources to fund local clubs which are the life and soul of rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Government will have to take a lead in regard to the planning aspect. If we are to go down the road of no rural housing and where everything will be in towns and cities of higher population densities and higher growth areas, that will be to the detriment of rural communities. There will have to be a better balance as between the east and west coasts. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I thank the Leader and our spokesperson, Senator Ó Murchú, for making the necessary arrangements. I also thank the Minister for being present.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Government's commitment to rural areas is clear and is underscored by the creation of the Minister's Department last year. The CLÁR programme also emphasised our commitment to rural development. The issue of rural development is critical to our country. As the Minister said in February, working in the area of rural development can be frustrating, although the rewards can be incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The proportion of the population of areas outside the five main cities fell to approximately 40%, or 1.5 million people, in 2000. The population decline in rural areas is a massive challenge to all of us. Those of us who are members of local authorities have tried, through our county development plans, to address the concept of rural housing. In doing so, we have been conscious of the difficulty in terms of the decline in population as it affects the GAA teams. We have a situation where a number of clubs have to come together to form a team and where schools, post offices, churches and Garda barracks have closed. These are all signs of a declining rural population.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">In the case of the area I represent, north Westmeath, and, in particular, the Finnea area, the decline in recent years has been evident in the context of the numbers attending the school, the local GAA club and so on. The attitude of certain entities at national level <i>vis-à-vis</i> An Taisce and the difficulties that obtain in respect of the concept of rural housing has not counteracted rural decline, rather it has contributed to it in a major way. Those who know absolutely nothing about local democracy tell us what we should do in the context of rural development. Some proactive measures have been taken and we welcome them. One such measure is the national spatial strategy which will seek to revitalise and regenerate rural areas. It will also provide an impetus for new sustainable development and job prospects for those living there.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">When we think of rural areas, we think of agriculture and farming. I welcome the fact that the national spatial strategy acknowledges the importance of the agri-sector to the economy. This sector is obviously important in the context of agri-tourism. We acknowledge the input made by that sector and its the encouragement to people to visit rural areas and spend their holidays there. It is also realistic in its assessment that agriculture is changing and that new efforts are required to find alternative sources of employment in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">None of us can pretend that a small farm can support a family in the way it did in the past. The Minister is right to emphasise the need for diversification in rural areas. He is also correct to emphasise the liberating effects of technology and how we are bringing the world to people and how this is having a significant effect on population decline. It is encouraging that the Minister hopes to be proactive in encouraging rural development and the necessary infrastructure should be put in place to promote it.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">We pay tribute to the members of local authorities. They have organised water, sewerage and other schemes which complement the concept of rural regeneration.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">If we are to be effective in meeting the challenges posed by population decline we must realise that rural areas are not isolated and can only survive in partnership with urban areas. Rural and urban centres must complement each other and work in tandem. Rural areas need to utilise and develop economic resources while taking advantage of strong neighbouring urban centres. Small townland villages in rural areas have potential, which can be realised by ensuring good communications between town and country. We must ensure that rural areas have the ability to exercise their advantage in terms of lower costs and quality of life. Difficulties have arisen in this regard in terms of getting planning permission for developments, especially for isolated rural housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Gaeltacht areas are close to the Minister's heart. Senator Ó Murchú also has an abiding interest in them. The decline in the Gaeltacht areas, including the number of Irish speaking people, is a cause of concern. However, there are indications of a renaissance, athbheochan, in the number of people with an interest in speaking as Gaeilge. The Minister should continue to consider the concept of establishing new Gaeltacht areas which will allow for an established presence of those with an interest in carrying on their daily lives through the medium of Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Traditional rural-based jobs in agriculture, forestry and fishing will continue to have a strong role. There needs to be effective agriculture, marine and natural resources sectors, together with the contribution of significant developing sectors, such as a tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Women who choose to work at home form part of an under-utilised resource in my county, east Galway and other parts of the country. We are proud to have a facility at St. Thomas's Hall, Rathowen, County Westmeath, compliments of the local Church of Ireland community to whom we are thankful, which provides computer courses to women who work at home. There are many positive elements in rural areas on which we are not drawing in the way we should.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">An Post has attempted to replace the traditional postman with a bit of tin in the form of a square box which it calls postboxes. Other people call them by a different name, but the conventions of parliamentary language precludes me from using it. It has been established that the postman is the only human life that many old people in rural areas see from one day to the next. In that context, they provide a social service in addition to delivering post. Following the closure of many post offices, an analysis regrettably found that rather than use the facilities on offer, many people travelled to the local village or town to draw their pension to maintain confidentiality and anonymity. Despite this, a message should go out from this debate that where there is a regeneration of the population in these areas, An Post will not be found wanting in providing a post office facility to access postal orders, pensions, television licences, etc., but which would also act as a one stop shop for additional services and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Táim fíor bhuíoch don Aire agus don tSeanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú as ucht seans a thabhair dom an óráid seo a thabhairt ar rural development. I ask the Minister to consider providing whatever resources he considers necessary to help rural populations, an area in which he has an abiding interest and in which he has proven his worth. We also owe it to the language that the Minister should consider establishing new Gaeltacht areas where it is possible to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_547">Any opportunity for the House to discuss rural development or the lack of it is to be welcomed. It would be impossible to consider rural development without giving due regard to those who live and work in rural areas and ensuring that their interests and well-being are looked after. Given that every aspect of rural development is at the mercy of the Government, which offers incentives with the one hand but removes them with the other, what does the future hold?</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Senator Glynn outlined a large number of services that have been cut or dismantled in the midlands region, which is indicative of the Government's failure to address the problems of rural development. In my County Longford, ten group water schemes have been approved, some for the past three years, yet the Government has failed to provide funding to get them off the ground. Half a dozen applications for group sewerage schemes for smaller villages in the county have been with the Department of the Environment and Local Government for a number of years awaiting approval. The Government is failing to deal with this. There have also been cutbacks in the local improvement schemes, which are beneficial to rural areas, especially to those in the farming community or who are living at the end of laneways.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Tourism has a great potential to expand and develop in the midlands. There are many fine lakes on the River Shannon and there are other fine rivers in the region, yet there has been a failure to secure funding from any Department to improve access to these waterways. It is important to provide those funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Senator Glynn referred to the installation of rural post boxes. The regulator is to be complimented on the stance she took last week. It is a waste of money for An Post to proceed with its plans in this area. The maintenance of the current postal service is important to rural life. These and other developments, such as the closure of small Garda stations and small schools, which have occurred over the past 20 years are to the detriment of rural areas. The Minster should address this issue as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The Government has reneged on its commitments to rural Ireland. Essential budgets covering every aspect of community life and development have been slashed across the country. Rural affairs have been treated with appalling disregard, despite the promises made in relation to rural Ireland in the 2002 programme for Government. Did they end up on the cutting room floor as an example of the Government's duplicity?</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Budget 2003 saw far-reaching cutbacks in areas where the Government had pledged there would be none. These cutbacks strike at the heart of rural life, rural development and the people who live in rural areas. Not everyone felt the riches of the recent economic boom and the growth of the last ten years has led to some decidedly uneven development. Rich areas have grown richer while poorer ones remain stifled by lack of infrastructure, employment, educational resources, housing, medical facilities, etc. Inevitably, many rural areas have fallen behind. The western development fund has been slashed by 69% and the rural affairs budget has been cut by a staggering 26% from €52 million to €38.5 million. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, made a great public fuss of the presentation of his CLÁR programme, but he has slashed its budget by over 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The national spatial strategy initially appeared to offer a lifeline to rural development, but it is nothing more than a headline-grabbing exercise and another under-resourced white elephant. The midlands triangle of Mullingar, Athlone and Tullamore does not even have a decent road connecting the three towns and the National Roads Authority says no funds are available to develop secondary routes. New motorways to serve some of the strategy's hubs have been shelved by the Minister for Transport for a further three years. The Government is attempting to buy time, but what time is available to rural communities?</p>
          <p eId="para_554">In the 2002 programme for Government, a number of promises were made to rural Ireland, but they have not been acted on. The Government promised to improve significantly transport services in the regions, stating that it would ensure that every county had a comprehensive rural transport initiative in place. It also promised to embark on a new initiative to further develop localised bus services in rural areas. On foot of these promises, the rural affairs budget has been cut by 26% from €52 million to €38.5 million. With the exception of the Ennis information town project, of which nothing is heard now, there is a massive digital divide between urban and rural areas. While Dublin is racing ahead in respect of high technology, the rest of the country is limping along behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The heart of rural Ireland – its farming heritage – is threatened by a climate of uncertainty and mistrust. We witnessed the farmers' protest immediately after Christmas. Farmers are being driven off the land as farming incomes fall and the expected support from the Government fails to materialise. The costs of production have risen, irrespective of enterprise, and young people are adopting a negative attitude to careers in farming. Irish farming faces further uncertainty under the Fischler proposals. Will we stand back and allow our rural farming communities to be destroyed? Will anyone be left to produce Irish food within ten years? These are serious questions and they must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">Does the Government care that the essential lifeline to rural Ireland which An Post's home delivery service represents is under threat? What is it doing to protect the infirm and elderly in remote areas who will be most affected by the proposal to end door-to-door deliveries? This action will have far-reaching effects that will not be felt in urban areas. As the haemorrhage from farming continues, life for those who are left becomes more isolated than ever. Does the proposed development of necessity mean taking a number of retrograde steps, while making what may be unsustainable plans for advancement? Does the Government care about the future of the Irish language, something which is supposedly a core value of Fianna Fáil? It must not, given that the Gaeltacht budget has been slashed by 22% while that of Údarás na Gaeltachta has been reduced by 22%.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The population of rural Ireland is in decline and some areas have seen a fall-off of 50% over the past 75 years. The vicious circle created by the withdrawal of services as population declines pushes more and more people to look for a better life elsewhere. A large number of schools are at risk from population decline in rural areas. One need only look at the recent census of population in County Longford, where the population is falling and migration rates are the third highest in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Population decline threatens our secondary schools and results in amalgamation in many towns. There is a disturbing level of long-term unemployment and graduates are lost to the region due to the lack of job opportunities. It is essential that we improve rural infrastructure in order to offer an attractive, viable alternative to urban dwelling, rather than drive people off the land, out of rural communities and away from what they often see as a sinking ship. To achieve population increases, we must develop and diversify the rural economy and provide appropriate services and infrastructure. We must work to halt and reverse the trend of decline in the rural population.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In practice, rural development policies are implemented at national and regional levels. It is imperative that policy-makers are aware at all times of the likely impact of all policy proposals to improve the economic, social, cultural and environmental well-being of rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I hope the Minister takes note of the contributions made by Senators. It is important to develop infrastructure in rural areas. Hopefully, the Minister for Finance will provide adequate funding to the Minister to allow him to provide his Department with the resources it needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancisOBrien" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Mr. O'Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_561">It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to discuss the important issue of rural development. It is encouraging to see that rural development initiatives still feature prominently in the policies being implemented by the Government. Senator Bannon is wrong to say that it has been forgotten. I assure the Senator that rural development will not be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I come from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, where rural development measures are extremely important to counterbalance the disadvantages of being close to the Border. The latter has created difficult economic conditions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancisOBrien" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Mr. O'Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_564">My own area of Latton in mid-Monaghan and the neighbouring areas of Carrickatee and Tullycorbet have derived considerable advantages from the CLÁR programme of support measures introduced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A great part of the rural localities of counties Monaghan and Cavan could be put forward as a template of the type of area the CLÁR programme was designed to benefit. The trend of depopulation has caused the rural landscape of the constituency to undergo an inevitable and sad decline. When the numbers living in an area are reduced, it is not long before its economic health begins to suffer and the provision of transport infrastructure and other services to such an area becomes difficult to sustain.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">CLÁR has focused on many ills created by rural depopulation and has, to a large extent, been successful in putting forward remedies. County Monaghan recently received substantial funding for its non-national roads through CLÁR resources and funding of this level is extremely welcome. Monaghan County Council has long argued the case that the extremely high level of road mileage that comes within its ambit of responsibility has never been adequately recognised by those who operate the purse strings of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Any additional funding such as that which has been forthcoming from CLÁR is, therefore, appreciated and is always put to productive use.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I encourage the Minister to continue with the CLÁR programme and to be attentive to the representations made to him by public representatives from counties which it covers. Such a programme should keep its methods of application as flexible as possible. I hope the Minister will continue to be receptive to suggestions from politicians and community interest groups in the counties concerned. The decline of their traditional areas of agriculture, upon which Ireland has depended for so long, also brings the issue of rural development into sharp focus. Involvement in agriculture calls for a change of approach and emphasis. The young Irish farmers of the 21st century will have to display the ability to adopt the imagination to steer their activities into a new and ground-breaking areas. It is on behalf of those young farmers and the farm families that I appeal to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">There are severe restrictions in operation in County Monaghan with regard to the development of houses in rural areas and I am sure other rural locations experience the same problem. There are important environmental principles to be borne in mind when planning applications of this sort come under consideration. However, those principles should not be set at such a level of importance that they prevent the development of housing in rural areas. Many farmers want to see their sons and daughters live on or close to their holding. This type of development is vital if the family farm unit is to continue to be viable and if our rural communities – which are already suffering from depopulation – are to remain able to sustain themselves. No one is arguing for large-scale housing development to be allowed to overrun the countryside, but surely there is scope for sufficient flexibility in the application of planning legislation to allow for some degree of sensible rural housing development that contributes to carrying on family farms and lends vibrancy to our smaller centres of population.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I thank the Minister for coming before the House to take this debate, because the day we forget about rural areas will be a sad one for this country.</p>

It is such an important issue that the debate could have recommenced under a different heading. Planning and rural development are not static. Rather, they have changed to a large degree since February and our contributions and input are vital.

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_573">When I went to look at my own notes on this issue, I realised how long it had been since we began this debate, which is a pity. Perhaps if we engage in this exercise again, it would be much better if we could run it over a short period. It is much easier to address the issues raised today, but other issues were raised on the previous occasion some months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">One of the first issues raised was the multiplicity of agencies and, as someone who worked on the ground, I concur with anyone who is confused about where one goes to seek assistance. One of the reasons my Department was set up was to try to deal with this issue and I am taking steps to try and bring coherence and simplicity in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">With regard to wider issues beyond post-offices, one must ask whether we are going to spend our lives protecting that which will inevitably change or develop rural Ireland in a new way. The post office network is important, but change must take place. There will be fewer post offices because a large number of them are turning over less that €4,000 or €5,000<i>per annum</i> and could not be made viable under current circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">When this issue first arose, I was one of the first to put my head above the parapet. At the time, I said that I accepted change but not decline. I accepted that there might be fewer post offices, but I want those that remain to have a huge number of extra services so that they will become modern focal centres for the community. In that connection, I welcome the arrangement that has been made with a certain bank in respect of banking services now being available in post offices. I only regret that this was not done ten or 15 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">We must always look at young people. During a debate on post offices, an argument was made that young people do not want post offices, rather they want ATMs. We must recognise that 70% of young people go to third level institutions and all of them acquire, almost on the first day of college, a card which they use to withdraw cash. I welcome the creativity of solving the problem, about which I had meetings with the bank federation just two years ago, of providing in-store ATMs in rural areas. There were good reasons the problem was solved in this creative way, rather than installing ATMs in walls. The cost of running and filling an ATM was the dilemma, but this has been dealt with because it is the sharp shop operator who will be responsible for filling the ATM. People will withdraw money and, if he is lucky, they will put some of it back into his till and he will then put it back into the machine. Therefore, the big cost associated with a conventional ATM will be tackled. Our focus should, in the first instance, be on development and, in the second, on dealing with problems in new and modern ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">A large number of issues were raised in respect of infrastructure, which is the fundamental key to the future. I welcome, for example, the provision of welded rail, more or less universally, on mainline tracks. I have discussed with the chief executive of the Western Development Commission the possibility of having a co-ordinated approach to realising our dreams of opening up the western rail corridor – to which I am very committed and have been for a long time – decentralisation and spatial planning in the west. The west and rural areas in general are entitled to proper road and air services, gas supplies and so on. I will be making an announcement soon about rural broadband in connection with the CLÁR programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Rural health was mentioned. One of the major factors for mothers in the decision about where to set up home is the availability of health facilities. We are looking at innovative systems in this regard. For example, in recent years a facility was opened in Clifden where one can go in, have an X-ray, have it read by the doctor in Galway and receive the result over the telephone. A similar facility, funded through CLÁR, is planned for Belmullet and this will enable the people of that town to avoid having to go to Galway or Castlebar for their X-rays. With the co-operation of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and the local health board, we have managed to arrange to have a doctor located on Inis Oirr, which was until now the most populous island without a resident doctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">There has been much discussion about SACs, NHAs, planning and spatial strategy. I will spell out the truth once again. Despite popular theory, during my time in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands – in fact, during the lifetime of the previous Government – no house for a rural family was refused solely on SAC grounds. Looking at a map of the SAC areas, it is easy to understand that. People complain that 60% of Connemara is designated SAC, but most of that is blanket bog and the tops of mountains, where people do not build anyway. The policy of the Department was always to facilitate family houses from an SAC point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">An interesting point was made today. How is it that we can grant 10,000 planning applications in Mayo and then find that the rural population has declined? A small amount of this is accounted for by holiday homes – other counties such as Galway have set their faces against granting permission for holiday homes – but the same thing is happening in the cities. How can we explain the fact that something like 53,000 houses were built in the State last year, while on the neighbouring island, with a population of 60 million – 15 times larger than population here – only approximately 120,000 houses were built during the same period? The reason was identified by a County Mayo man, Professor Seamus Caulfield, in a paper he wrote.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">We have a huge bulge of population at the family-forming age. We are now moving rapidly from having an average of five people per dwelling to the European norm of approximately three. The reality is that if we do not build many more houses in rural areas, we will inevitably have a decline in population. To freeze the number of houses in rural areas, as desired by some organisations, would inevitably mean a rapid decline in population, just as to hold static the number of houses in Dublin would result in a decline in its population. We can see at present that the population in the city area is declining – even though we are building quite a number of houses – because the number of people living in each house has declined. Years ago, parents lived in one house with six or seven children. Nowadays, people might have only two children or none at all. Students away at college might be occupying one house during the week and another at the weekend. If we do not build rural houses we will kill rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The issue of decentralisation was raised and I understand the Senators have been discussing this today. We are committed to it; it has to happen, in the interests of rural Ireland. Senator White mentioned that I said that somebody who comes from the city and settles in the rural community is more important than the multinational 40 or 50 miles away from that community. On the face of it, this seems an extraordinary statement. It was one I made consciously but carefully. All of the maps, spatial strategies and studies show that commuting distance extends to between 25 and 30 miles and beyond that the population does not benefit from industry. We only have to look at places such as Belmullet in County Mayo and Oughterard in Connemara, which are declining rapidly, to see this. People will not commute more than 25 to 30 miles, even when road conditions are good.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Senator Ulick Burke, referred to CLÁR and stated that I had made good use of it in my constituency. He has previously accused me of having a slush fund. Under CLÁR, everything is done by programme – in fact, the selection of projects tends to be done by county councils in the case of roads, Leader companies in the case of village renewal and so on – and not by me. All I do is to make sure that they adhere to the very strict criteria laid down and that it is all done impersonally. The Senator is absolutely correct: of course it is benefiting my own constituency. A CLÁR area benefits any constituency, because that is what CLÁR is designed to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">There are areas in my constituency that are in decline – why should they not benefit from the CLÁR programme? Of course they benefit. I can also say, however, that Senator Burke's constituency benefits. East Galway has large areas in the CLÁR programme. I thought he would have the good grace to acknowledge that when I reviewed the CLÁR areas, not one townland or DED was added in Connemara, while, in most other areas, including east Galway, extra DEDs were added because the figures justified it.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Senator Bannon mentioned problems with group water schemes. Under the CLÁR scheme, we are carrying out top-ups to group water schemes and it is interesting to see which counties always seem to have the money to avail of these schemes. It is also interesting to see which counties never seem to be able to come up with their share of the money, no matter what we do or how much money we put on the table. My understanding of the operation of the group water schemes is that each county is given an allocation and that it is up to the local authorities, in conjunction with the local monitoring committees, to decide which schemes get preference in any one year. I suggest that the Senator return to his local authority and discuss what is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">My understanding is that, in general, counties are given a group water allocation and it is the county, not the Department of the Environment and Local Government, that decides which schemes are given approval. The Senator should return to his local authority and ask what allocation it received this year and which schemes it, not the Department, will approve under that scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Senator also mentioned cutbacks in the western development fund. I wish to again clarify a basic fact. The fund was cut because last year the Western Development Commission failed to spend the money that had been allocated to it in the Estimates. It was allocated almost €6 million, but spent only €1 million and we allocated it some €2 million. I have had continuous discussions with the Western Development Commission. It now seems likely that it will exceed the expenditure of €2 million provided in the Estimates. I have made arrangements to give extra money to fund the extra projects that are likely to be drawn down this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">The Western Development Commission has been asked to focus expenditure on areas of decline. I have told its representatives that I do not consider that the western development fund was set up to fund projects in Galway city, Castlebar, Ennis or Shannon because they are already growing. The purpose of the fund is to target areas of decline.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Senator Bannon mentioned a cut in the CLÁR programme. He also mentioned cutbacks in LIS. I understand, although I stand to be corrected on this, that the LIS budget is more or less static and that there has been a major increase in its budget compared to that which was available when we came into office in 1997. I further point out that the greatest problem in respect of LIS roads arises in the more depopulated parts of the country which are also, by definition, CLÁR areas. I have made arrangements, for the second year in a row, that for every €2 spent by the local authorities out of their LIS allocations in a CLÁR area, I will provide another €1 for additional road works. This should rapidly decease the LIS waiting list.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">The Senator has done his homework. He will have noted from the Estimates – a matter which disappoints me – that the CLÁR allocation for this year was reduced from somewhere in the region of €12.9 million – which probably translates to approximately £10 million – to approximately €9 million this year. That is a disappointment. However, the good news is that by handling the funding in a clever manner, I will be able to do as much with it this year as I was able to do with the considerably larger sum last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The reason for this is easy to explain. At the end of the year, approximately €7 million was spent without matching funding, which is normally required under CLÁR on class three roads. However, all of the funding we spent this year was invested in matching schemes. With the nine, rather than seven, matching funding schemes this year, I am confident that Members will see as much work done this year as was done last year under the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">The position is similar in the case of Údarás na Gaeltachta. This is the challenge for me as a Minister. The economy is not expanding. Perhaps we became careless when money was plentiful and did not watch how it was spent. I have long been of the opinion – nothing will convince me otherwise – that the methodology employed by Údarás na Gaeltachta in respect of its buildings programme was incredibly expensive. It is sitting on approximately €150 million worth of property. I said to its officials that, in more constrained times, perhaps we could examine ways of having as much property available for industry in the Gaeltacht as we had before and add to it. However, we should not have to pay out the large sums of money we paid out in the past. In fairness, they sat down and worked this out with me. We will be able to have as good a year this year in Údarás na Gaeltachta, as we had last year, by way of innovative and creative ways of spending money on a smaller budget. This is what life is all about – getting better value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">An amazing feature of Government is that we have preached day and night about getting better value for money, but when a Minister does that, all people can talk about is the total spend; they do not consider the value delivered on the ground.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">I thank all the Senators who contributed. There are major challenges to be faced in rural areas. There are some issues over which we have no control. For example, we have no control over world agricultural policy. We have an input into but no direct control over the European agricultural policy. It increasingly takes more land for farmers to earn an average industrial wage. The challenge, therefore, is that we want to maintain as many people in full-time and part-time agriculture as we can. That will mean considering new systems of agriculture and new products. However, that alone will not be enough to sustain rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The major challenge is to diversify the rural economy so that part-time farming is a real option in terms of the way forward for some. Large, non-farming communities in rural areas make a contribution to rural society. I live in the heart of rural Ireland and if I was to exclude the non-farmers in the area, there would not be much left in the way of social life in terms of local football teams, schools, etc. All I can hope is that we all meet this challenge. As Minister with responsibility for rural development, I will try to be as inventive as possible in tackling the major challenges that all western societies face. On a global scale, we could say that every society has for a long time been trying to meet the challenge of increasing numbers of people moving from rural living to urban living. I hope we become the country that eventually stabilises the rural population and, if we do, we will certainly be the first.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_616">I wish to comment on the Government amendment, which fails to recognise the motion. The controversy that has arisen is of the making of the Minister for Education and Science. When he gave an interview to <i>The Irish Times</i> last September in which he floated kites as to his intentions, people in the media and education thought they were witnessing a visionary Minister for Education and Science. His idea for raising a new source of revenue within education by reintroducing third level fees was tempered by the suggestion that this would be used to increase the finances and resources available to the disadvantaged to access third level. We now know that has failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">One of the Minister's first efforts in education was to increase substantially the college registration fee, which became a burden on the very group he was supposed to encourage and whose problems he was purporting to alleviate. That fee was increased by 69% because the Minister could not introduce fees elsewhere. It was a huge imposition on many families and was followed by an insensitive reduction of €36 million in the Estimates for support mechanisms to allow the disadvantaged access third level, such as the retention of school initiatives, building improvements, information technology research and development and teacher recruitment. Some €5 million was taken from programmes aimed at attracting school leavers from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds into third level and €6 million from planned initiatives to reduce the schools drop-out rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The Minister is well aware that, last year, 1,000 primary school students failed to transfer to second level and 13,000 failed to transfer from second to third level. Many of these failures were within the categories to which he referred and are mentioned in the amendment. I do not know why they have been referred to because they only serve to highlight the abject failure of the Minister in improving access at any level for the disadvantaged. If they cannot transfer from primary to second level or from second to third level, why does he make an issue of ringfencing finance for third level?</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The confusion in the Minister's vision for education is also manifest in the uncertainty of the Taoiseach, who has clearly distanced himself from the Minister's stance on this issue. Within Government, the Tánaiste and the Progressive Democrats have also distanced themselves and said that under no circumstances can fees be reintroduced. This has caused uncertainty and confusion for many students and parents, and it is especially insensitive at a time when students are just about to sit their examinations. Their confusion is marked and is paralleled by the confusion within Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The Minister does not know for what level or ceiling of earnings he will reintroduce fees. He is on record as saying he will do so for the three holiday per annum family. They are the target of his new revenue raising tax. Perhaps it is aimed at what the Taoiseach described as the super rich, those who earn from €100,000 to €200,000 per annum. Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show that the number of people in this category is small – 53,000 last year. There is no indication how many of these are parents who might have sons or daughters likely to attend third level and be subject to fees in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">If we knew that fees were to be reintroduced, the level at which they would apply and who would be the target, there would be something to be said for them, but confusion continues to reign. I hope the Minister for Defence gives a clear indication in this regard during the debate. The Minister for Education and Science cannot dodge these matters by saying he is waiting for a review. Mr. McDonagh from the Department has undertaken huge work which seems to have been completed since last Easter but because of the sensitivity of the subject and the fallout that has occurred, the Minister has failed to indicate his intentions.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The onus is on the Minister to come to this House tonight and say that he will not reintroduce third level fees. Nothing short of that will be of any consequence to the many people who are literally under stress. I question the Minister's sincerity and I hope he clarifies the matter at a later stage this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The Minister has talked about a loan scheme. The acid test of the ineffectiveness of a loan scheme is to be seen in Britain. Students who had accrued substantial debts were forced to declare themselves bankrupt in order to avoid repaying loans for up to ten years. That is a huge debt to carry when starting out on a first job and dealing with all their other commitments. A test case last week found that the British Ministry of Education could not pursue them for the money. I hope the Minister will not tinker with the idea of loans, whether based on the Australian or the British model. The Department of Education and Science cannot seem to see that the policy has failed in Britain. If this system is adopted we will find to our cost that it will be a failure here as well. I ask the Minister not to entertain that idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Minister failed on a mission similar to this – the dual mandate – when he was Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the former Government. If we withdraw the incentives for young people to go on to third level education we will switch off the engine that has driven the economy in the past ten years. I challenge Members on the other side to declare truthfully that they do not agree with the reintroduction of fees and go through the lobbies in the right direction tonight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_625">I second the motion in the name of my colleagues. I welcome the Minister for Defence and his officials to the House but I ask where is the Minister for Education and Science. This is a very important debate and many colleagues on all sides have important contributions to make. I ask that the Minister should show up at some point during the debate to make his contribution and also to hear the sincerely held views of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The reason we have elections is to enable people to determine, based on programmes, policies and manifestos, the kind of Government they want for the following four or five years. The reintroduction of third level fees is an idea that came after the election from the Minister for Education and Science. If the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats wanted this proposal, why did the debate not take place during the last election? That is what elections are about and they determine where people stand on issues such as this. I accept that it is a legitimate subject for debate and that differing stances can be taken on the issue. Trying to do this in the first year of office of a Government is a crude attempt to take money from people which will go into a big black hole. This is another stealth tax and it will be clearly shown as such during this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">I come from a constituency where there are many pockets of deprivation, where the level of participation in third level education is very low. I do not believe that the key issue in getting children from those communities into college is fees. There are many reasons why children from those communities do not go to college – peer group pressure, parental expectations, the level of support available at home for study, the lack of chance and the lack of expectation.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I know of a case in my constituency where a young person had to leave college because of the hassle he was getting from other young people in his community. The notion that simply reintroducing fees will bring about some element of equality into the education system is daft. If the Government is genuine on this issue – let us accept that it is – why does it not tell us its programme for dealing with educational disadvantage? Why does it not mainstream the Breaking the Cycle programme which is still a pilot scheme? Why does it not fund proper access programmes for young people from those communities to give them support? I believe the Minister would have a good deal more credibility on the issue if he outlined what exactly he wants to do, summed up the amount of money it would cost and then engaged in a genuine debate. There is nothing in this proposal but spite, to use the words of his Fianna Fáil colleagues when they called him the Minister for Spite last year. This is a spiteful proposal because it will do nothing for educational disadvantage. It will be money lost in a colossal black hole and it will not go to the communities most in need.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">If there is consistency in the Government's argument, why are we not talking about the abolition of the free medical cards-GP scheme for persons over 70? Why is it the case that Mr. O'Reilly and other well-known millionaires should be given medical cards? There is no consistency in the Government's argument in respect of this matter. If we were genuinely serious about doing something for educational disadvantage we would be talking about tackling a whole range of discrepancies that exist across a variety of Departments. There is no commitment to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">This policy has no political support in this House and clearly not among the Progressive Democrats, the Leader of the House and many of her colleagues. The Minister should do the honourable thing and should consider his position, given the difficulty he has created for the Government on this issue. This proposal will not fly and it comes at a time when students and parents are trying to prepare for examinations. He is playing games with children's futures and he should be ashamed of himself, as should any member of the Government grouping who votes for the amendment tonight.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_631">I join in supporting my two colleagues on this motion. It is important to put this issue into perspective. In 1996, when Niamh Bhreathnach abolished third level fees, neither Fianna Fáil nor the Progressive Democrats nor any party opposed her decision. They recognised the validity of her action. It is fair to acknowledge that over the years many parents have been extremely thankful for the abolition of college fees. Many of us in this House and our sons and daughters have benefited from this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The two parties on the other side of the House were in power from June 1997 until last year, a period of five years. It was the time of the Celtic tiger when money was coming out of our ears, a time when the present Minister for Finance said that we should drink champagne and celebrate. Why was it not attempted in the five years when the funding was available? They did not do so because it would not help their political chances and there would be a political backlash. If they were so committed, why did they not include it in their manifesto?</p>
          <p eId="para_633">This has nothing to do with disadvantage. It is like a mantra used by the Minister for Education and Science. The Taoiseach even uses it. He made a statement during the Nice referendum campaign that he was in favour of the introduction of fees. If I know the Taoiseach, he will not be long distancing himself from the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">If I were the Minister for Education and Science I would be disappointed at the level of Cabinet collegiality. He has been hung out to dry on the issue. Perhaps he wants to be the latter day Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the disadvantaged in the form of better education. I would remind him of the social inclusion policy on housing – we know what happened to that 20% provision. It was recently overturned by the Minister, Deputy Cullen. The Minister will probably be remembered for the introduction of the plastic bag levy, which is probably a good venture.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">This issue has nothing to do with disadvantage. It has to do with a Government in straitened economic circumstances deciding it wants to raise more revenue from within the education system. If it had to do with disadvantage, why did the Minister not consult his colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, on the back-to-education allowance which was recently debated in this House? This money was whipped away with the stroke of a pen to save €4.5 million for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, the Minister withdrew the proposal when she recognised the level of hostility among those who had availed of the back-to-education allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Let us not continue with this nonsense. The Minister probably wanted to go down in history as having achieved one laudable objective but he has been hung out to dry. The Progressive Democrats have distanced themselves completely from the proposal. He must have been sick watching "Questions and Answers" on Monday night and listening to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, from the comfort of the United States of America, distanced herself from the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">If the Members opposite are honest they will back this simple one line sentence in the motion and forget about the long waffle in the amendment. They should back the motion because it is what they are saying outside on the plinth. However, Fianna Fáil members play the "good cop, bad cop" role on every issue. They should at least have the gumption tonight to support the motion, which is consistent with what they are saying outside.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">We have different points of view, not just across the parties in Government but within parties, for which I make no apologies to anyone. This is a fundamental debate not just about the future of education, including third level education, but about the future for our country, based on surveys carried out on future skills needs over the next ten to 15 years, surveys carried out by eminent educationalists and sociologists on the socio-economic profile of the participation rates at third level and the clearly stated sentiments expressed by eminent experts in the area of third level education on the abominably negative effect of the free fees initiative. Perhaps I will deal with that matter before I deal with the glaring inconsistencies in the performance of the main Opposition parties over the last few years in relation to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The free fees initiative has contributed absolutely nothing to promoting equality of access to third level education. It has favoured the higher income groups, a fact to which educational experts almost unanimously attest. It has facilitated those with the most resources to buy their way into further educational advantage. Professor Malcolm Skilbeck, a leading expert in educational policy, said the abolition of fees gave a fantastic subsidy to the middle and upper classes. He said it helped to underpin the elitist nature of third level education in the Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">It is strange to note the failure of the Labour Party to address the creeping elitism in education and its seeming abandonment of the needs and concerns of the lower income groups, the poor and the disadvantaged.</p>

In an article written in 2001, the Fine Gael Party complained that despite free fees, one in ten students declined their CAO offer because their parents could not afford to send them to college. I have not yet spoken about the many initiatives the Government has taken since 1997 to promote better access to third level education for the disadvantaged. My colleagues will deal with that.</p>

I know one man who took a career break from his job. He had three children at college and could not afford to pay for them, despite having made provision. By taking a three year career break he lost his salary so he could qualify for grant aid during that period. Two of those children are now senior members of the diplomatic corps. They would never have got there without that type of scrimping and scraping. People went without. It is unfair to say that those people should be put back into that situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">I know the Senator did not say it. However, it would be wrong to put them back into that situation. We should leave the middle classes out of it. The reason I am worried is that the people who had made provision for their children before the free fees were introduced liquidated that provision and used the money for other things. Those people are scared by the current prospects.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I opposed the proposal to introduce free fees in 1996, for the same reason that I now oppose the reintroduction of fees. People are not able to plan. The people who will be hit are the parents who are caring, concerned and who have consistently been responsible in their approach. This issue is not driven by equity. This will make people suicidal.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">There are other ways to look at this. Senator Fitzgerald's points about whether the initiative brought more people into college are correct. I do not believe it did. I do not accept the argument that the reason the initiative should not be reversed is that it brought a huge number of extra people into third level. It did not. There are still huge problems with maintenance and that is what should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The downward egalitarianism that is proposed, which is to take from people who have a little to give to people who do not have anything, is not the way to approach this issue. That is my honest response. There are other ways. I said in the health debate last week that we cannot have Swedish systems of health care with Texas levels of taxes. The same applies to education. We should approach disadvantage in a comprehensive manner with a proper plan that begins at pre-primary and goes through primary and post-primary by supporting people throughout. We should make provision for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">This is not the way to do it. It is unfair, threatening and has no element of equity. The Government can do other things. I pleaded with the Minister for Finance before the last budget not to reduce corporation tax to 12% and to defer the reduction for a couple of years. Other things can be done to address this issue. Fees are the wrong way to do it and I speak as a Member who did not support the free fees initiative. I have a bag full of hate mail from people, mainly those who were paying my salary, asking me to shut up but I stuck with that position. I am not taking a populist line now, I just believe it is the wrong decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">This will not bring greater equity. We should examine maintenance grants as a means of dealing with equity in a more consistent fashion. This proposal is unfair to a group of people on whom we depend for the future of this country. It is wrong. We should see education as an investment and we should be supportive.</p>

          <p eId="para_688">I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time. We are speaking in a vacuum because we do not know what the Government's proposals are at this stage. However, we know it proposes to reverse the decision which was taken some time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Like Senator O'Toole I opposed the introduction of free third level fees. That has been a sometimes difficult and sometimes easy road to travel. To suggest now, however, that the policy be reversed is impractical and a nonsense. The proposals we have seen and heard are only in the flotation stage but they are a tax on the middle classes. The money they have earned and put aside for a certain purpose will be taken away.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">There is a great danger in means testing. There seems to be a difference between the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and Science and other sources in the Government, who are giving all sorts of figures, about who would pay these fees. Would it be people on incomes of €100,000, €150,000 or €200,000? It does not matter because, in effect, one is saying that those who earn more pay more, which is the same principle as an income tax, and those who have saved more pay more in the case of assets and savings. That is not a healthy principle on which to run education.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">This is about ideology. I believe there are two important areas of public spending above all else. The first is health. We cannot compromise the principle that everybody has a right to their health and the right to have the State look after it as far as possible. The second area is education. When one talks about these two rights, one cannot put a commercial value on them and say one person must pay while another does not and one has a right to them and another does not. It is discriminating in a commercial way in education and putting a tax on people because they have done well, earned money and saved it. It will deter some of those who have earned and saved money from putting their children through third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">If the House believes that people have this right or should be offered this access, the Government should look at the idea of offering loans. It is a controversial idea but one this House should consider – that everyone should be entitled to a guaranteed Government loan. It would certainly solve the problem of access. They should also be entitled to a Government loan for maintenance, which Senator O'Toole rightly identified as one of the most important and tricky areas. When the Minister brings his proposals to Cabinet, he should do something of a shimmy, and he will have to do quite a shimmy to get them past Senator Dardis's party, and ask about loans. It would solve the problem of access, help the Government with funding and place a value on education for those who benefit from it while not crucifying the parents.</p>

          <p eId="para_694">Coalition Government has been the norm in Ireland for two decades now. Over the past 22 years, single party Governments have been in power for only 36 months in total. If there was one clear message from the last general election, it was that voters wanted to see a continuation of coalition, a continuation of the partnership approach to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The record of coalition over those 22 years has been varied. Some Administrations were very cohesive and quite successful in implementing their political objectives. Others were not so cohesive and they foundered relatively quickly, leaving little by way of political legacy behind them. The successful coalitions were characterised by mutual trust and confidence and the unsuccessful coalitions by mutual distrust and suspicion. We in the Progressive Democrats have experience of both kinds of coalition.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The Administration which held office between 1989 and 1992 was very difficult from the Progressive Democrats' point of view. It collapsed prematurely amid recriminations and hostility between the coalition partners. The Administration which succeeded it, of which we were not part, collapsed in a similar way just 24 months later.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Since then the country and the political system have matured. Our experience of coalition since 1997 has been wholly positive. We in the Progressive Democrats have negotiated with Fianna Fáil two programmes for Government. We have had a positive and constructive role in two successive Administrations. We remain true to our principles while engaging in reasonable compromise for the common good. Mutual trust and mutual respect have been the glue that have kept the two Government parties together over the last six years. Two different parties with different policies and perspectives have worked together in a spirit of co-operation and consultation to form a successful Administration based on genuine partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the two parties have worked together for the good of the country. Structures were put in place to address issues, to resolve differences and to solve problems. Those structures have worked exceptionally well up until now.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">I can assure Senator O'Toole that I can stick my chest out with the best of them. There is a major decision to be made here about an important issue of public policy. That decision should be made after a full process of analysis and discussion, but that process should not be confined to one Department nor should it be confined to one party. Using our coalition processes, the Government has developed over the last six years education policies that have led to more investment at all levels, more teachers and more access programmes. In coalition Government, we have implemented new steps to help people from disadvantaged backgrounds use the open access to third level education that free fees provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Since 1997, spending has increased from €500,000 to €26 million on measures to open up third level education to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We have worked with the Higher Education Authority, the universities and the institutes of technology and we have funded initiatives for third level opportunity in Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Limerick and Wexford. We have introduced special rates of maintenance grants, the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage and the student assistant fund. Together with the free fees initiative, these programmes are working to help increase access to third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The parties in Government share the objective of making greater progress on education at all levels. That is why the Progressive Democrats have supported on every occasion the work of the Minister for Education and Science in initiating a review of student support measures to ensure they are effective in achieving greater access. We await the outcome of this review. The Progressive Democrats in Government will give detailed consideration to the Minister's proposals based on the review when they are brought forward and that is why we support the amendment to the motion tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">This coalition Government has implemented for six years the policy of free fees for third level education. Third level education is now as important for our country's development as second level was in the 1960s.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">—because he has said many things I would agree with.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Tomorrow, the Labour Party is holding a wreath-laying ceremony in Arbour Hill Cemetery to honour the memory of James Connolly. In 1896, James Connolly, the founder of the oldest political party in the State, the Labour Party, called for free education up to the highest university grades. It is good to know that, of all parties, the Progressive Democrats concur with that basic socialist principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The principle James Connolly espoused of education at all levels as a basic and universal right and a thing of value to the individual and society is a fundamental socialist and social democratic principle. It is this principle that underpinned the Labour Party's decision that the former Minister for Education, Niamh Breathnach, should abolish third level fees in 1996 and that the State should fund third level as it funds primary and second level education out of general taxation. As Senator Dardis has reminded us, a similarly imaginative and foresighted move was made in relation to second level education by Donogh O'Malley, a Fianna Fáil Minister in the 1960s. That move saw levels of participation in second level education increase dramatically over a 20-year period, to today's level of more than 80%.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">It is only seven years since third level fees were abolished, and it is too soon to assess fully the impact of this abolition on levels of participation at third level by the various socio-economic groups. The figures available in the Clancy report of the Higher Education Authority relate only up to 1998, but the signs that access to third level education is widening are promising.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In the Dáil this morning, the Taoiseach trumpeted the increased numbers attending third level courses compared to figures in the past. Contrary to what the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and Science and Senator Fitzgerald seem to believe – that the abolition of fees has not improved access to third level education by the lower socio-economic groups – the evidence available suggests that the abolition improved access to third level education by all socio-economic groups. In the latest year for which figures are available, 1998, two years after the abolition of third level fees, the participation rates of the children of the lowest socio-economic group, the unskilled manual workers, had almost doubled, from 12% in 1992 to 22% in 1998. The Clancy report shows that from 1980 to 1992, before third level tuition fees were abolished, eight out of 11 socio-economic groups increased their participation rate in third level education, and overall participation rates increased, but the rates of three low to middle PAYE-paying income groups either worsened or increased negligibly. Between 1986 and 1992, the participation rates of those three groups actually dropped.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">If third level fees are reintroduced, those three lower-income groups who fared badly in terms of those participation rates prior to the abolition of fees will suffer again. The types of people involved include, for example, the children of teachers, nurses and shop-workers, hardworking people who scrimp and save – the kind of people Senator O'Toole referred to. These are the middle classes, basically the low to middle income PAYE groups that Fianna Fáil seems to have decided to abandon, while at the same time providing tax breaks for millionaires.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I read an article before Christmas in <i>The Irish Times</i> which claimed it was as if the middle classes had become the surrogate for the truly rich in society, the tax dodgers, the millionaires with illicit offshore accounts. Those people will probably not end up paying fees, but the PAYE people will be sitting ducks if this Government reintroduces third level fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The conclusion that may be drawn from the Clancy figures is that the abolition of fees removed both a psychological and a financial deterrent to PAYE families participating in third level education. Reintroducing fees will replace the same psychological and financial barriers in front of hardworking families.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">A loan system would be an even greater barrier and deterrent. Today I read a report by the Joseph Rowntree Trust on socio-economic disadvantage and experience in higher education. This report found that a fear of debt was a huge deterrent in terms of disadvantaged students' continued participation in third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The statistical evidence suggests strongly that participation in third level education of all groups, including the disadvantaged, has improved as a result of the abolition of fees. As a local public representative, that is my experience on the ground. For example, Neilstown's Collinstown Park school, in my constituency, this year sent its first student ever to study medicine, in Trinity College. The school sent several students to third level colleges. When I was attending my own local school in Lucan, very few students went on to third level education, whereas now the vast majority do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Fees will definitely be a deterrent. When people of my generation, who did not have in their families the tradition of going to third level colleges, were faced with the choice of a job or the financial burden that going to college entailed, they chose the job. Their long-term economic and career prospects were thus reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">There is no evidence that the abolition of fees has failed. All the evidence suggests it has been a success. If fees are reintroduced, whatever the threshold or the system, it will be the thin end of the wedge. We know it is a revenue-raising measure, and that is how the increase in college registration fees was treated. The money raised went back into the general coffers and did nothing to improve access to or funding of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">It should be noted that Australia and the UK are now looking at the prospect of third level top-up fees. That will probably be the next proposal if fees are reintroduced here. I suggest to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, and to the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, that instead of setting up one person against another in third level education, and one class of society against another, the Minister should be fighting at the Cabinet table for proper funding for all levels of education, and for investment to be funded out of a fair taxation system.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. I have so far listened to a very lively debate, which I had expected. I do not want to talk about the narrow issue of third level fees. I want the debate to be broader than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">When I began to think about the issue, I realised it was all about the funding of education. I asked myself whether or not we are getting value for money. There is a colossal amount of money going into education and, as I see it, we are not getting value for money. Something is going wrong somewhere. I ask why we should not have this review. It is important, and we need a brainstorming exercise in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Many people I spoke to, including Fine Gael supporters outside this House, have agreed that the issue is worth debating, that we need to ask where we are going with regard to education, in terms of creating an inclusive society. That is what I want to debate, not the narrow issue of third level fees on its own. That is not sound conceptual thinking in terms of how our education system should be developed. We should be talking about resources to target those who should have access to education but who are not getting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I want to look at our second level education system and consider how best we can target the disadvantaged. Have we put the resources into this area, in terms of remedial teachers, home school links, early start programmes, career guidance counselling, and into the best way of targeting and directing people from second level education into third level?</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Not everyone is suited to third level education. Not everyone should go into it. Not everyone has an academic brain. There are different types of intelligence. There is skilled intelligence. There is also emotional intelligence. We could do with more of that in the House this evening. There is political intelligence, of which we are getting too much in this debate.</p>

The Government's record of lies and half truths has been shown up and the people will give their verdict at the next local and European elections, if there is not a general election before then. I ask the Minister to take note of what the general public is telling the Government in the opinion polls, that it has got it wrong, that it was lied to in regard to the cutbacks prior to the general election. It is a very bad message.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey. I do not mean to say with any vestige of pretension that I was Minister for Education for almost five years and a teacher. The Minister was also a teacher, as was the spirited Senator Ormonde. I speak from that perspective and should have an input into a debate such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">It is very alarming that we are not debating a proposal. We are debating a matter about which we know nothing. In regard to the amendment, I cannot understand how one can cast aspersions on building an inclusive society. Of all parties, the Labour Party should enjoy this. In regard to improving the level and quality of participation and achievement at every level of education; ensuring the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds in third level education expands significantly; and building a greater culture of review of public spending, I cannot see how anybody could have a quarrel with the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I regret very much that we are not debating a proposal. I wish we had before the House a fully fleshed out review which had been presented to the Cabinet and was up for public debate. That is the point at which we should be. In September 2002 this issue was first strongly floated. It has been defended on several occasions in this House. The Minister and his Government colleagues are entitled to review any part of public policy. It would be a sad, dispirited and undetermined Government if it was unable to do so. We are approaching the end of May and a time when it will be necessary for young people and their parents, who make provision for them, to have the full facts in order that they can make subsequent decisions. Eight months on it is still unfocused. It has no texture and is not debatable because we do not know the facts. I regret this very much because that is not the way matters should proceed in any Department.</p>

That is the reason those who sneer at our amendment are incorrect. The Minister has yet to go to Cabinet with his proposal which, we are assured, he will be doing. The politics of envy are not the right way to go about promulgating public policy.

          <p eId="para_815">—one is satisfied with oneself and one's inner self. Stirring up atavistic tendencies is wrong. This has come about because people do not know what the proposal is.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Lest anybody think I am afraid to face up to the issue, in 1987-88 when things were very difficult and I was Minister for Education, I had to face up to 1,000 teachers at my front door and every clinic I attended for six weeks. I certainly did face them because I had to do so. Policies were brought forward from the Department of Finance – it was proposed that there should be a charge for post-intermediate certificate secondary education. That was the policy given to us but we rejected it because the Cabinet stated it would not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">While the Department of Finance has a job to do – I am not criticising it – which is to conserve the public purse, at which it is very good, this is the thin end of the wedge. If this proposal is introduced at whatever level – if the level is huge, we might all have to look again at it – it will not do and will come down the following year and will come down again the year after. That is the way the Department of Finance operates because it needs money. I am not speaking about the Minister for Finance but about the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I certainly agree with Senator Ormonde. The Minister's review will cover a broad area. He referred to differentiation of disciplines, an interesting concept that should be considered. He also referred to various other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">This is a complex issue. We are concerned with those at primary, late primary and second level becoming infused with the idea that they can attend college and are as good as the children already attending. We also face a period when colleges will be denuded of students and the points race will lose its acute role in deciding futures.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">I do not like the macho way in which this debate has developed, with argument centred on the poor versus the rich. It amounts to a Robin Hood style of politics which is inappropriate and improper in the context of a debate on education.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">While we will support our amendment to the motion, all parties should be united on the need to bring education in its fullest sense to everybody. It does not end when students leave college. We should bring this debate to a speedy conclusion and proceed with the review which may cover a large number of issues on which we would have common purpose. If so, it will have been a good review and I wish the Minister luck in progressing it. If I appear to have been outspoken, it is because I spent five years in the Department over which the Minister presides, which entitles me to have an opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I am afraid I will disappoint my good friend, Senator O'Rourke, because I will take a different approach to this debate. I commend the Minister. He is somebody of courage and integrity and the kind of person we need as Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">We hear much from members of the public about scandals and their desire for integrity, decency and ideas, yet when they get it, they pee all over it, if the House will excuse the unparliamentary expression. They do not seem to want to know when they are asked to pay for it, when something is taken out of their well filled pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">My esteemed colleague, Senator O'Toole, told a tragic tale of somebody who had to take a career break in order that his income would drop to a level where he would be entitled to avail of free education. My heart was broken that the poor man should have to go through the frightful trauma of getting paid for doing nothing for three years in order that his children could be educated at the expense of the taxpayer. What a tragic story but it did not change my mind. It is the kind of luxury and self-indulgence that has got the country into its present condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I got no free education. I was unable to take up the scholarship to which I was entitled because it was not tenable at Trinity College. While I do not begrudge people these things, it is outrageous that the taxes of old age pensioners should be used to provide free education for those earning €250,000 and more every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">In what are we interested? Are we interested in equality? Is there a genuine interest in the right of access to education? Free education is a lot of blather. It is like saying everybody can have tea at the Ritz. Of course, they can, provided they have the money and the social <i>cache</i> to get into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The figures are clear. Alleged free education has virtually no impact on disadvantaged areas. If people are interested in equality and committed to the ideals of the 1916 rebellion, revolution, or whatever it may prefer to be called, about cherishing the children of the nation equally, scarce resources must be reallocated. It must be made clear that they will be channelled to those areas which people cannot access, even with free education because of the cost of such factors as transport, accommodation and books. Even with programmes such as the Trinity College access scheme, the number from deprived areas of this city and the rest of the country attending third level is pathetic. If we want to do something about this, we must at least inquire, which is what the Minister is proposing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Yesterday, I told the Minister about my recent experience when I visited two marvellous institutions in my part of the city. I attended a debate at Larkin College, Champions Avenue, an area blighted by drugs while the previous day I read stories to six, seven and eight year old children in the Central School, Marlborough Street. They are participants in the Breaking the Cycle programme. It should be called the break your hearts programme because, in an area of absolute deprivation, it only takes children up to the second year of primary school. These wonderful children, beautifully dressed, immaculate, polite, intelligent and curious will, within a period of approximately 18 months, be dumped on the pavements of a very harsh city, where their role models will be the crack and heroin dealers in the big cars and motorcycles. If they were given a different role model, it would have a huge impact on the part of the city in which I live and on many similar areas around the country. Most have unemployed or absent fathers, or single parents. The couple of decent community gardaí who put their effort into the area provide them with a kind of male role model.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">If the Breaking the Cycle programme were to be continued, beyond the pathetic two years of primary level to which it is currently applied, through primary, secondary and third level education, the first couple of doctors, lawyers, engineers and vets who come from the areas around me would provide a new role model. The money to provide for this could be raised by charging those who can well afford it to pay for their education. A condition of this charge would be that it did not go back to the general Exchequer but was targeted and focused on these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Minister has a real commitment to the ideal of giving everybody an equal chance and equal access and opportunity, not the slogan of free education. All the surveys show that people would benefit from this approach. In England, men with a three year university degree get a quantifiable benefit of a 17% increase in their earnings while women get a 37% increase. That is what they get for the rest of their lives. Why should the State not get some of this money back to redirect it? This is not covetousness nor envy. I say to those who are well off, why not share a little with those who are not so advantaged? Why not set up a system where, for example, tax clawbacks would be available? This means that parents would not have to take their free holiday at the expense of the company in the form of a career break of whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">There needs to be a sophisticated form of means testing. For example, if three or four children are clustered around the same age, they must be looked after because even a wealthy family would find it difficult to support them. The Government would also have to guarantee funding to the universities.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I commend the Minister and urge him to continue with his inquiry, even if it leads to the reintroduction of fees. I represent a constituency that would be affected by that approach but do not care because I believe the one way in which we will get decent values in this country is by spreading the right of access to people throughout. If that is the way the Minister proceeds, he will have my strong support.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">If those who are members of the Conference of Heads of Irish universities were present, they would support the reintroduction of fees. They found that, unfortunately, the parents of Irish students were a far more reliable source of income than the Department of Education and Science. While there has been an increase in the amount of money given to universities, there has also been Government agreement of major increases in salaries. No matter how well deserved these are, it means there is very little left over for services. We have increasing numbers in lecture theatres and tutorials while staff on contracts are not being re-employed. Courses such as the clinical psychology course which is so badly needed have been cancelled, though in that case the Minister reinstated it.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">There has been talk of getting money from graduates once they leave college but there is no need for anyone to worry as we are getting that money already. We could not manage without it. I am chairperson of the Trinity Association and Trust and we appeal to our graduates all the time. Most of the Trinity College access programme is funded by graduates and the same amount goes into the general fund. I take Senator Norris's point. We certainly appear to be very well off but it was only when our three children who had been at university at the same time graduated and were able to support their mother in her old age that I realised how hard it had been.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">As a proud member of the Progressive Democrats, I hope I do not disappoint my friend, Senator Bannon, on the Opposition benches. Education is the key to our future opportunities as a society and as individuals. For this reason, the Progressive Democrats support free primary, secondary and third level education and seek to ensure each is well funded, effective and open to all. To achieve these objectives we need policies which are well thought out and a broad resource base to fund them. Targeted initiatives are required to improve each level of education. In no area should we attempt to achieve these objectives by tinkering with thresholds for taxes, fees and charges for smaller groups. Any change in free secondary education since the 1960s would have been a backward step and any change in third level fees now would be the same.</p>

          <from>Ms K. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_841">To bring back fees would be unfair and disruptive to thousands of students and families. People have made plans many years in advance on the basis of free education and it will not only be students who hope to attend third level this year who would suffer. Students already there as well as those in secondary education would also pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">There has been much talk about thresholds for payments but everyone knows that thresholds, once introduced, are likely to come down. In these tougher economic times people want as many reassurances as they can get but ideas about thresholds have already had the opposite effect. People will be anxious, not reassured by the idea of thresholds for fees. We expended much effort to create a clean and understandable tax and benefits system in which people were not trapped by thresholds. Anyone whose household income is near a fees threshold would face an enormous increase in expenses in their earnings which in one year might tip them slightly over the benchmark. There would be a perverse initiative to avoid pay increases, overtime work, bonuses and opportunities for promotion. With a few students in a family the effect of fees would be devastating to the family finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">This is much more fundamental than thresholds and questions of who is and is not wealthy. At issue are our approach to education at all levels as a public service, our approach to the funding of public services and our work to ensure full access to education. Charging fees at third level to some would not achieve greater access to education for others. Policies and programmes to help people take advantage of third level education need to be effective and funded. Should wealthier persons who have dependants attending third level education make a greater contribution to funding access for all? They already do. Should wealthier persons who do not have dependants at third level make a significant financial contribution to tackling disadvantage? They already do. Should third level graduates who get good jobs and earn higher salaries fund social programmes to help others to get the same opportunities they had? They already do through the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">We believe the only fair way to fund social programmes is through the general tax system. The coalition Government has formulated a tax system and made it much fairer over the last six years. It is clear, fair and effective. Wealthier individuals pay more tax, as they should, while 50% of all income tax is contributed by 8% of income taxpayers. The general tax system is the vehicle for ensuring social priorities are decided by Government as a whole. There are significant demands on resources from health, social welfare and education which must be considered as a whole, as should the level of tax fees and charges in our society. This is the only fair way to achieve a balance between tax and spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The Progressive Democrats are committed to making coalition Government work as well as to social justice, fairness and education access. We hope this issue can and will be resolved in the tried and trusted way we have always managed coalition with our partners in government.</p>

If they wish to pay for education, let them attend private schools and if the Minister is so concerned about social justice, he should stop paying the salaries of teachers in elitist fee-paying secondary schools. Will he respond to this as my radical friend who is concerned about social justice? Why should we pay the salaries of teachers in Belvedere, Clongowes, CBC Cork and Presentation College, Cork other than to support privilege and elitist education?

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_956">As has been stated, there was no talk about the reintroduction of these fees in the programme for Government, but now it is being discussed all the time. The Government has, effectively, already ended free third level education with the massive increase – 69% – in college registration fees last autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">We have heard about the Government's commitment – or attempt at commitment – to fighting disadvantage. What did the Minister do? One of his first actions was to cut €6 million from initiatives designed to reduce the school dropout rate and €5 million from programmes that help disadvantaged school leavers make it to third level. An Agreed Programme for Government states, "We will ensure that the number of mature students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds in third-level expands significantly." What happened? The back to education allowance was cut by 25%. We have heard nothing but lies, lies and more lies from the Government in respect of third level education or, indeed, any type of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">I do not believe that the Minister has any conception of the challenges facing students and the workload they face at second level in order to gain places in third level institutions. Does he not realise that in addition to the stress they are under, they must cope with the cost of expensive accommodation, subsistence and books? People have paid dearly for re-electing the Government, with its empty promises, last year. No one believes that the introduction of fees for the wealthy will be the end of the matter. The income threshold will decrease until everybody is caught in the trap and the situation is as it was prior to the Fine Gael-Labour Government which got rid of these fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">We could have a new Government as a result of all this. There are plenty of Independents waiting in the wings already. The Progressive Democrats may have to drop out – that is a decision for the party itself to make. A decision will have to be made, however, sooner rather than later, for the sake of the students.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">This day last year I finished my last exam in Waterford Institute of Technology after spending four years there with free fees. My sister is currently attending the same college. Previous speakers have stated that many families have several children attending third level institutions at any time. It is a great burden to all families to have more than one member attending college. The possible reintroduction of third level fees is now hanging over these families.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Under the current Government we saw a 69% increase in college registration fees at the start of last year. We are now facing the start of the leaving certificate exams. It is a time of great apprehension and anxiety for the students who are facing those exams. As the Leader of the House correctly pointed out, we are no clearer about the Government's proposals on the reintroduction of third level fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">A suggested solution to this problem is some sort of loan system. This is something to which I am absolutely opposed. Senator Kate Walsh was right when she said that people who qualify from colleges pay for their education through the taxation system. That is the way it should be done. When people leave college they face starting families and buying houses. This is the nature of their age group. They have huge expenses they have never had before. Now the Government is suggesting, or so we are led to believe, that they will have to repay a loan for their college tuition.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">If the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Senators had any backbone, they would have no problem supporting this simple, one line Fine Gael motion, "That Seanad Éireann is opposed to the reintroduction of third level tuition fees." It is a simple, basic motion. We have heard Fianna Fáil Senators say they are opposed to the reintroduction of fees. If they are, let them put their vote where their mouth is.</p>

          <p eId="para_1006">The two main Opposition parties have said very clearly that they are not willing to make any changes to current policies – as far as they are concerned, the core funding structures are fine as they are. The House should be aware that this marks a major change in position for many Opposition Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">We should look back at the ramshackle way in which the decisions which created the current system were made. In 1995 a major review group reported on third level student support and presented its report to the then Minister for Education. It considered the full range of issues and was particularly concerned to improve access. It very explicitly recommended against the introduction of free fees for those who did not qualify through a means testing arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">In spite of this, the Labour Party decided it wanted to push ahead with exactly this policy, particularly because it hoped that it would help it to retain the various seats it had won in the professional class areas in 1992. The decision of the Labour-Fine Gael-Democratic Left Government to go ahead with that policy was far from unanimous. John Walshe has reported on this in great detail and it forms a significant part of his book on education policy in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The most striking aspect is that Democratic Left – remember it – directly opposed the abolition of fees. The then party leader and Minister, Proinsias De Rossa, is recorded as having argued at Cabinet that it would be a regressive decision which would do nothing to help disadvantaged groups. I do not often agree with Proinsias De Ross, MEP, but he was right about that. Fine Gael was also lukewarm but accepted the policy as the price of keeping Labour happy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1069">An Agreed Programme for Government also contains a commitment to build a culture of review of public spending by publishing regular evaluations of key spending programmes. It is perfectly logical to assess a student support programme that cost €380 million last year, of which some €240 million was spent on so-called free fees. The aim of the review of student support provisions is to ensure that the benefits of the substantial investment being made are maximised with a view to achieving the objectives we set out in the programme for Government. The review has almost been completed and, when available, will be brought by me to the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">It would be relatively easy to proceed on the basis that everything is fine and no change should even be considered. That means we, as a society, are prepared to acquiesce in a system where one's address and socio-economic background are more important criteria for entry to third level education than academic ability. No political party or civilised society should countenance that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">We were told in 1995 that tuition fees were being abolished to improve access to third level education for students from so-called disadvantaged backgrounds. If this was the reason and accepting is as such, it failed miserably because the proportion of people from these backgrounds attending third level education has not increased since the cost of tuition fees was transferred to the taxpayer directly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1075">I accept that it initially assisted those middle income groups who were finding it difficult to support second and subsequent children in the third level system. I mentioned earlier the top-up grants system, of which 3,500 people availed last year and 7,000 will avail this year. Such a targeted initiative is a much better way of encouraging people from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">There is consistent evidence that third level education represents a significant benefit to the individual and that educational attainment is closely correlated with success in the labour market. The study, Education at a Glance, shows that the career earnings potential of graduates is significantly enhanced, with a tertiary education delivering a weekly earnings premium of up to 57% in Ireland. The premium is even more striking when hourly earnings comparisons are made. The 1997 Living in Ireland survey conducted by the ESRI indicated that individuals with a degree or above receive an earnings premium of up to 83% more on average than individuals with a leaving certificate. Surely they should make a greater contribution to that education. This represents a significant private return for the public investment made in higher education and brings sharply into focus the issues surrounding the principle of individual contributions.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_1085">I will be brief so that Senator Mansergh can reply. I want to hear his views. I have a policy of not supporting any motion from this side of the House unless it explains how we are to pay for it. On this occasion I have no problem whatsoever. Back in 1995 to 1997 when this was being talked about I was not in favour of the move to abolish third level fees. There was no suggestion in An Agreed Programme for Government there was to be a reintroduction of third level fees, so I have no problem in supporting the motion from this side of the House because it is a reversal of policy on the part of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">My second point is that it does not make good economic sense as far as I can see. There is a 20% tax rebate for parents who are paying the fees. Whatever money the Government is planning to take, I hope it has taken into account that it will not be quite as much as it thought, even if it includes those earning €100,000 and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">My third point is about equity. In many cases the students rather than their parents will be paying the fees and they will use a loan from the bank to do so. It will have nothing to do with the parents' income. Some students will be required to repay a loan because their parents had money but others will not have to repay anything because their parents did not have money. I do not believe that is equitable or fair and it challenges the parents rather than the students themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">There seems to be a view in the last week which suggests that there are differing levels of respect for university courses. With all due respect to Senator Henry, if one is studying to be a doctor, that will cost €8,000 but if you are only going to become a commerce graduate like me, that is only worth €4,000. Those who are studying science and technology and technical skills are the people we want to encourage, but they are regarded as very junior and not nearly as important. We have spent years trying to realise that there is a huge value in those with technical skills as against those with academic qualifications. We should not place monetary values on courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">I encourage the Minister to re-think his proposal. He spoke about a U-turn, a reversal of policy on the part of the Labour Party, which it may well be. I believe the Minister should now make that U-turn and change his mind and say that it was an error of judgment and that he will return to the situation as it was according to An Agreed Programme for Government last year. The reintroduction of fees faced by parents of students is a wrong idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">I thank Senator Quinn for giving me some speaking time. I welcome this debate which is about a very important strategic decision for the generations of students of today and tomorrow, for parents, for the character of universities and third level colleges and for the economy and society. I applaud the Minister for his courage and integrity which have been evident for a long time. He has a palpable commitment to the disadvantaged which one must respect and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">Much of the debate both in this House and everywhere else has been highly emotive and over-simplified. I fully accept that the decision of Niamh Breathnach did seem quite attractive and it was not as costly then to have free third level education on the same principle as free second level education, but it has not worked in terms of equality for the disadvantaged. Fianna Fáil argued trenchantly at the time that the priority was raising maintenance grants over free fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_1093">Of course "free fees" is a manner of speaking; we do not have free fees at the moment. We have a €670 per year registration charge and I have not heard anyone argue on the basis of universalist principles that it should now be got rid of, except possibly the USI. The issue is whether fees in some way commensurate with the cost of the course, and indeed the benefits from it, could or should be charged to those well able to afford it. I accept that large numbers of parents paid fees with difficulty prior to 1996 and there have been a lot of tax cuts and pay increases since then. Nonetheless, there is a fairly general consensus that if fees are to be introduced they should be at a much higher threshold. The difficulty is that if that threshold is set too high the administrative costs wipe out the benefits and there is a repetition of the property tax syndrome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">Tuition fees only account for part of the cost of maintaining a child at college. There are clothes, books and travel costs and accommodation costs if they live away from home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">Whatever else the Minister can be accused of, it is not being right wing. I heard him being accused all evening of egalitarianism, of being Robin Hood and so on.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matter. - Neurosurgical Services.</heading>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_587">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_1142">I wish to refer to an usual situation. A former professor of medicine in New York University has offered a very generous grant of $4 million for the provision of a neurosurgical facility at University College Hospital, Galway. The staff at the hospital, however, are growing frustrated that the Minister for Health and Children has not accepted this generous grant to provide the service because there is a review of the neurosurgical needs of the whole State. The Western Health Board, of which I am a member, has requested on numerous occasions that staff and accommodation be provided for the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">Everybody will appreciate that there are many people who live on the western seaboard for whom this facility will arrive too late. A very active western support group has constantly lobbied for the provision of this service but to no avail. When best practice is mentioned with regard to the provision of health services, it can be clearly seen that any place within the Western Health Board area is two hours from Galway. That is not to mention the distance between many remote locations in this area and Dublin or Cork, where the service in question is currently provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">The Minister will agree that this is a further indication that the disadvantages endured by the west are being perpetuated by decisions, such as that to which I refer, which will deny this particular service to the many parents in the west who are campaigning for its provision. These people have seen their loved ones, family or children, suffer severely and endure terrible handicaps as a result of very simple falls or accidents. Worse still, they may have witnessed the deaths of people who could not be moved from the western area to Dublin or Cork following serious brain haemorrhages or similar difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">My plea is that the Minister should expedite the review, if that is necessary, or else indicate provisional acceptance to the provider of the offered facility. We take grants similar to this for research and development in education. When people's lives are at stake, I cannot understand why the Minister cannot embrace this generous gift with open arms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">People are putting about a rumour that there must be strings attached. All the necessary assurances that there are no such strings attached to this generous offer have been provided. I beg the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to intercede with his senior colleague to ensure that approval is sanctioned – as soon as possible and even on a temporary basis – so that this offer can be consolidated for the west, particularly if the funding for the provisional services, space and staff cannot be provided by the Government at present.</p>

Neurosurgery is currently provided at the national centre in Beaumont Hospital and in Cork University Hospital. Comhairle na nOspidéal is a statutory body set up under the Health Act 1970. One of its functions is to advise the Minister for Health and Children on matters relating to the organisation of hospital services and to publish reports relating to such services. Some years ago, Comhairle na nOspidéal examined the organisation of neurosurgical services in Ireland and recommended that these should be concentrated at Beaumont and Cork University Hospital. It also concluded that a unit at Galway was not a viable option at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The western neurosurgery campaign has submitted a proposal for a neurosurgical unit at University College Hospital Galway. The proposal includes a commitment, to which the Senator referred, from the Irish-American friends for the west of Ireland neurosurgery campaign to provide a once-off financial contribution of $1 million and a gamma laser knife machine valued at $3 million. The Minister and officials from the Department of Health and Children have met representatives from the campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">It is now over ten years since Comhairle na nOspidéal last undertook a review of neurosurgical services. Given the passage of time, and in light of the commitment in the health strategy quality and fairness review to increase acute hospital capacity, the Minister considered that an up-to-date review of neurosurgical services should be undertaken, focusing, in particular, on issues of capacity and geographic configuration. Comhairle na nOspidéal was asked to carry out such a review and prepare a report for consideration by the Minister. It has also been asked to focus, in particular, on the provision of adequate capacity and consideration of equity of access to neurosurgical services, having regard to best practice in the provision of quality health care Comhairle na nOspidéal established a committee to conduct this review and its work is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">A preliminary estimate of the projected completion cost of the proposed project, including construction, fees, equipping and other costs, is around €20 million in capital terms. The initial estimate of the running costs of such a unit is around €5 million to €6 million in additional funding per annum. Decisions regarding the further organisation of neurosurgical services will be informed by the Comhairle report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">I understand that representatives of the western neurosurgery campaign met the Comhairle committee to put its case for neurosurgical services to be located in the west. The Minister for Health and Children and I acknowledge the very generous offer from the Irish-American friends of the western neurosurgery campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">The Senator will be aware that a major development is underway at University College Hospital Galway, at an estimated cost of some €100 million. It is by some distance the largest ever health care project to be undertaken in the west. This development is due for completion in September and includes an intensive care unit – including cardiac intensive care – a high dependency unit, a burns unit, a coronary care unit, operating theatres – including two cardiac theatres and two orthopaedic theatres – trauma orthopaedic beds, a cardiac surgery ward, an MRI unit, the up-grading of wards on floors two and three of the hospital, a radiotherapy department, an administration and concourse section, medical records, an admissions unit, a medical social work unit and a unit for BreastCheck.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The provision of cardiac surgery, radiotherapy and MRI services will establish University College Hospital Galway as a major centre of excellence in the provision of acute hospital care. A static BreastCheck facility will also be situated at the hospital. Moreover, it will mean that services that have been traditionally concentrated in Dublin will now be available in the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">The Seanad adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 May 2003.</p>
