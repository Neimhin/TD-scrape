            <p eId="para_1">1. <b>Deputy Timmy Dooley</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment</b> his plans to engage with Eir on its proposals for rural broadband; the information provided to date on the proposals of Eir; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [28665/19]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_1">

            <p eId="para_2">In light of the recent intervention by Eir in the debate on broadband and, in particular, the comments by the Department to the effect that the company's proposals cannot be taken into consideration because the procurement process is already under way - it has been in train for some time - will the Minister accept that said process is no longer fit for purpose? Will he accept that the process has not been fit for purpose since SIRO and Eir withdrew from and outlined their concerns about it? Will he further accept that the final nail in the coffin of the broadband plan has taken shape in the form of the requirement for the State to pay €2 billion to protect a €1 billion investment?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">The national broadband plan is the Government's commitment to design, build and operate a network which will make high-speed broadband available to every rural home within seven years and to continue to operate the service under the terms of the plan contract for up to 35 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> Eir has made no formal proposal to the Government to replace or supersede the national broadband plan. When she appeared before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment last week, Eir's chief executive officer, CEO, outlined the company's view on whether the plan offers value for money. She also made certain observations regarding Eir's proposed model for the delivery of rural broadband, which could only be delivered outside of the current procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> My Department requested a detailed outline from Eir setting out the assumptions made and the financial model underpinning those assumptions. Eir provided further information to my Department by letter at close of business on Friday, 28 June. I understand that Eir shared this letter with the joint committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> The letter suggests that Eir could deliver broadband in the national broadband plan intervention area for a lower cost than envisaged under the plan contract if it was to do so outside what it referred to as the "constraints" of the procurement process. It envisages that these savings could accrue through the use of a model that applies in the Eir 300,000 area.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> It must be pointed out, however, that the broad terms of the competition to deliver the national broadband plan were set in 2015 after a consultative process. They were designed to meet the requirements of state aid, the requirements to protect the State’s investment and the requirement to deliver future-proofed, high-speed broadband to every home and premises in the intervention area at a comparable price to those outside. These terms were clear from the outset and were accepted by all those who took part in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> Under these terms, Eir made a bid of €2.7 billion. Three alternative costings have now been suggested by Eir on the basis of changing many features of its original bid and altering the terms of the bidding process. My Department and its national broadband plan advisers are analysing the information provided.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">Will the Minister accept that the State has already engaged with Eir regarding the commercial roll-out of high-speed broadband to 300,000 homes, businesses and farms dotted across semi-urban and rural areas? Will he accept that this was a success? Will he also accept that Eir is essentially stating that it is prepared to provide exactly the same service, as well as the same terms and conditions and the same quality of service, to the 542,000 homes, farms and businesses targeted under the broadband plan? Eir claims that it can deliver this for €1 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> We have had detailed engagement with the Department. It now seems that the necessary levels of scrutiny, oversight and controls require the taxpayer to spend another €2 billion to protect the €1 billion it will cost to roll out the service. On behalf of the taxpayer, it would be wrong of me not to question and interrogate that further.</p>
            <p eId="para_11"> Will the Minister give consideration to the notion that the issuance of a universal service obligation is, in essence, the best way to achieve value for money for the taxpayer, recognising the significant assets which exist in the State by at least two major players in infrastructure, namely, the ESB and Eir?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Climate_Action_and_Environment">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">Eir has suggested that it could do this project for less by abandoning some of the essential conditions that were imposed at the very start of the process. Those essential conditions involved showing that it had the cash and financial commitments to deliver the project. They involved showing that there would be governance of the state aid in order to ensure that we could see that any money provided to the company was used exactly for the purposes for which it was intended. These conditions also involved penalties and performance clawbacks in the event that the company did not deliver and that every home would have 100% delivery of high-speed, future-proofed broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> The Deputy must indicate which of those requirements set out in the original national broadband plan he wants to jettison. When those requirements designed to protect the State were put there, Eir was in the process. It made a bid of €2.7 billion. It made no alternative offer because it withdrew from the process. There was engagement with the process but Eir made its decision not to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">Now, very late in the day, Eir is offering three alternative prices at which it suggests it could do the project but, in all of those cases, it is proposing to jettison the essential conditions of the contract that are there to protect the State and the rural user and to comply with state aid rules. That is the difficulty with the proposal being put forward.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_15">It is not for me to answer for Eir but it is my job to hold the Minister and his Department to account. It is time he and his Department engaged with Eir in a wholesome and proactive way to figure out what Eir is prepared to jettison and what he and his Department are prepared to accept is unnecessary when the potential savings to the State and taxpayer are considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> It is also probably now a requirement that the Minister brings in external, independent advisers. It is unfair to ask Department officials and Government advisers to go back and effectively recheck their own work. If we are to be assured of protecting the taxpayer and the people who are waiting for broadband, it is now time to do what this House passed a motion to do 18 months ago when Eir withdrew following SIRO's withdrawal from the process. At that time, Fianna Fáil, with the affirmation of the House, asked the Government to bring in independent, external advisers for a short piece of work and the response of the Government and the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, was that it would delay the process. They wanted to keep going because that was what everybody said. We are now in a much worse position and there is a potential saving of €2 billion to the State. I accept that those lines may degrade but it is now a requirement for the Department and Minister's team to get to the bottom of that and do so in a proactive way. I have no doubt that is his intention, or I hope so.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">The national broadband process is clear. The only way in which one could consider any offer from Eir would be by abandoning this process and starting all over again. That is absolutely clear and Eir acknowledged that because it has not made an offer, under any of these various financial scenarios, in which it says it could do it for €500 million, €1 billion, or €1.55 billion. Eir's offer within the process was €2.7 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> There has been ample engagement with Eir around its concerns. There were 200 hours, across 65 meetings, during which officials engaged with Eir about its concerns. Progress was made on many of those concerns but Eir decided unilaterally to pull out of the process. That was Eir's decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> The level of scrutiny and independent advice has been absolutely clear and there have been independent elements throughout the process. It complied with state aid, so the European Commission was involved to see that the process was compliant on that front. There were independent committees with external representation and State expertise brought to bear at every stage. They were reviewed by an oversight committee that was also independent. There was an independent assessor who oversaw the process to ensure it was fair throughout. Eir has had ample opportunity to make its proposal within the terms that were designed to protect the State and its investment and to deliver the service to proper performance standards and to comply with state aid rules. Eir failed to do that and pulled out of the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">This question is about the national broadband scheme. Will the Minister re-engage with Eir and the ESB regarding this plan? I am asking him to look again at the current process which, by any measure, is banjaxed. We are looking at a cost differential of €2 billion. Over the past couple of years, an overall cost of €800 million has become €3 billion. Worse still, members of the public who are awaiting broadband and have been promised it for a decade are no further on. The only broadband being provided is being provided by private operators regardless of the Department's plan. The current process is not fit for purpose.</p>

            <p eId="para_22">The procurement process in the national broadband plan is not yet concluded. Both Eir and the ESB, as partners, were bidders for the national broadband contract but withdrew their bids. At the time of their withdrawal, the Eir bid was comparable to that of the remaining bidder in the amount of €2.7 billion. Very detailed negotiations and due diligence were conducted and the Government agreed, on my recommendation, to the appointment of a preferred bidder. The award of preferred bidder is now subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The possibility of allocating the national broadband State intervention to the ESB was considered as part of the published alternative options analysis conducted by my Department. The Attorney General advised that there would be significant legal risks in respect of both procurement and state aid law, were the State to mandate and fund directly, outside a procurement process, any economic undertaking. This would include a commercial entity like Eir or a commercial semi-State entity such as the ESB carrying out the national broadband plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Furthermore, engagement between officials of my Department and DG Competition, which is the Directorate General of the European Commission with responsibility for state aid matters, has clearly established that it is the view of DG Competition that it would not be possible to provide a State subsidy to an economic undertaking, such as the ESB or Eir, to roll out the national broadband plan without undertaking a new public procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> However, the existing infrastructure owned by Eir and the ESB network will be used by National Broadband Ireland where this represents the most effective use of existing infrastructure at a local deployment level. I understand from their recent appearances at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment that both entities will support this.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">I thank the Minister for his reply. The reality is there are two main reasons for the escalation of costs. One is that Eir was allowed to cherry-pick in 2017 and that banjaxed the process and made it more expensive to service the remaining 500,000 premises. The second reason is that the Government is going with a bidder that has no infrastructure and does not own poles or a yard of ducting in the State. There are two providers that do. I do not hold any candle for either provider and would prefer for the ESB to have the contract from an ideological and practical point of view because that way we would have some democratic control. We are going with a provider without any infrastructure and it is questionable if it has the money. We are told there are letters of comfort from other investors saying that they can come up with the cash but this is a highly risky process.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> I take on board the fact that Eir originally bid a much higher price but it is now saying that this can be done for a subsidy of €1 billion. At the very least, that needs to be probed further by Government and there should be engagement between Eir and Department officials. I ask the Minister to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> On the issue of state aid, the former Minister told me that the Government had to allow Eir to roll out broadband to those 240,000 premises, which then became 300,000. At the committee meeting last night, I asked the Minister's senior officials for a copy of the case that was put to the European Commission to explain to the Commission that Eir was being allowed to doughnut every circle of houses, village or cluster of houses and, in the process, completely derail the rest of the project. I also requested a copy of the instructions received back and the order from the European Commission saying Eir could not go ahead. I would like to see those.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">Any state aid process must be done where the commercial sector cannot deliver it. If the commercial sector states it can deliver part of that, under a state aid process, one must allow access to that part and state aid can only be provided in the area which is not commercial.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> National Broadband Ireland will be guaranteed access to infrastructure and the price at which they get that access will be regulated by ComReg. It is for ComReg to determine the price at which that is made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> No contract would be signed if there was any question on this bidder's ability to fulfil the financial commitments of this process. It is absolutely a requirement to fulfil that commitment. As the Deputy knows, one feature of Eir's suggested alternative model is that there would be no such obligation on Eir to demonstrate financial commitment. The way that Eir proposed to do it more cheaply than its €2.7 billion offer was by abandoning all of the protections that were included, namely, the clawbacks, penalty clauses, performance requirements, distinct governance and upfront capital. The Deputy would be saying to me that all of those things were essential to show the State was protected and Eir is seeking to abandon them.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">There were 200 hours of discussions with Eir regarding such protections and the State explained why those provisions were there. Eir decided then that if it was to fulfil those requirements it would be bidding €2.7 billion. It then withdrew. The company had ample opportunity to offer alternatives within the process but it withdrew from that process. Eir cannot now re-enter the process at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">The Minister is correct that Eir cannot re-enter the current procurement process. The problem is that the current procurement process has run into the sand by any objective measure. The Minister is now entering into a cul-de-sac. He is going to end up in the situation depicted in the diagram of the governance structure prepared by his departmental officials. That is not going to work. It can be seen that sharks are lined up to take a bite. It will also be the case that National Broadband Ireland, NBI, will finish up with a board of nine people. This House, and ultimately the taxpayers, will be responsible for lobbing in almost €3 billion in cash. The people putting in €200 million will occupy eight positions on the NBI board. People who have sat on committees, never mind the board of a company, will know that they are completely outmanoeuvred at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> The Minister referred to checks, controls and balances and protecting the taxpayer. There is little or no protection in the structure into which the Minister is entering. I state that sincerely. I do not mean that to be in any way derogatory. That is a definite cul-de-sac that the State and the taxpayer will be getting involved in, however. Officials from the Department, as well as successive Ministers, have told me that we had to allow Eir to cherry-pick these 340,000 and then 300,000 premises. The first time I saw that map I realised, as would anyone with a bit of common sense, that Eir was doughnutting the clusters and the villages. That is what it has done. Was it put to the European Commission that this action was going to banjax the process?</p>

            <p eId="para_45">The ban on smoky coal, as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to other major cities. Following a public consultation process, it was further extended in 2012, and now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide. The ban has proved effective and research indicates, for example, that the ban has resulted in more than 350 fewer annual deaths in Dublin alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Estimates of the total numbers of deaths attributable to air pollution in Ireland and 40 other European countries are released by the European Environment Agency. This assessment requires information on air pollution, demographic data, and the relationship between exposure to ambient pollutant concentrations and a health outcome. The latest report, published in 2018, gives data for 2015. It shows that although Ireland has one of the lowest levels of air pollution in Europe there were still an estimated 1,150 premature deaths in Ireland attributable to air pollution in 2015. That was out of an estimated 483,400 premature deaths across the EU as a whole. Figures for 2019 are not yet available, and would not in any event give the level of detail the Deputy seeks as they are based on pollution loads from all sources rather than just emissions from residential solid fuel burning.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> Regarding the proposed national extension of the smoky coal ban, I am disappointed that a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide and also challenge the existing ban on the basis that the State should also have to ban the burning of other fossil fuels, including wood and peat products. Banning the use of smoky coal would have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas. Since I announced that I would not be extending the ban nationwide in time for the 2019-2020 heating season, I have been contacted by a number of manufacturers of low-smoke fuel who have expressed a wish to see the national extension of the ban implemented. I am working with the Attorney General to finalise a legally robust plan, which will improve air quality by reducing particulate matter in the air. </p>

            <p eId="para_48">I am concerned at the sudden raising of this issue of a smoky coal ban not being possible due to the threat of legal challenge from businesses because other fossil fuels such as peat and wood would be excluded. Surely the Government faces the threat of legal action whenever it makes a change to regulations affecting businesses. The Government must have known for years that initial action on the worst smoky coal was necessary. The situation is farcical. No further information has been provided by the Government on these supposed challenges, when or how they will be overcome or how long it intends to consult with the Attorney General. It appears that the Minister has knowingly made a misguided political decision and these companies are benefitting to a great degree from that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> In 2013, the then Minister and former Deputy, Mr. Phil Hogan, confirmed that the current smoky coal ban would be extended. That was confirmed again by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, in 2015 as well as by the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, in 2018. Companies should have been well aware that this was under way. Why has the situation suddenly arisen today that we are accepting these legal challenges? Why are we not recognising the position that the State has taken for some time now?</p>

            <p eId="para_50">The challenge has arisen around this question of the equivalence regarding particulate matter derived from burning smoky coal or wood and peat products. That is the core issue. The nationwide extension of a ban on smoky coal, which I know was made in good faith by the former Ministers, envisaged that it would not apply to peat or wood products. This issue has to be examined carefully and that is why I am consulting with the Attorney General. I want to take action to deal with cases where there are risks to health. In taking such action, however, I have to ensure that I do not jeopardise existing measures which have shown themselves to be particularly effective in avoiding premature deaths. It is a question, therefore, of having to take the due and proper care to ensure that the action that I take is something that will be robust and will not jeopardise protections already in place.</p>

The Minister might also clarify if the Department is now rejecting those Commission recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_52">The Department is not rejecting anything. It recognises the merit of extending a ban on smoky coal. The issue that has been challenged is whether it is legally robust to have such protections in respect of one fuel product at a time when other fuel products that have a similar profile regarding polluting effects are excluded. That is the issue. We need to ensure that in taking action to protect health we do not inadvertently jeopardise protections already in place. I want to make sure we are on solid ground with any action I take. That is why it will take some time to find a resolution to this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_55">The basis on which measures were selected in the climate action plan was to identify those which created least burden and most opportunity. It has also sought to ensure that all sections of our society would contribute and that those most exposed or least equipped to make changes will be supported. Just transition is thus at the heart of the plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> Certain activities will be particularly exposed, such as the phase-out of coal and peat from power generation. These transitions will be carefully planned and monitored to ensure that those individuals and regions affected will be supported through many policy streams identified in the plan. </p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The plan also identifies the significant economic opportunities that will open up as a result of the plan's decarbonisation ambitions, including in areas such as: renewables, including offshore technologies, as the installed renewable power capacity goes from 3.5 GW to 17.5 GW; the building retrofit sector, where the 25,000 homes currently participating in energy retrofits represent an estimated €150 million contribution to the economy and where we intend to scale our ambition to achieve 500,000 retrofits by 2030; and new technologies, such as microgeneration, anaerobic digestion, biomass, heat recovery, carbon capture and biomethane, which will come to maturity bringing new business opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> It is encouraging to see how Bord na Móna has been identifying opportunities in the midlands. In addition the recently launched midlands regional enterprise strategy has made opportunities in the decarbonisation economy a key pillar of its plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Just transition will also arise in the context of carbon pricing and retrofitting homes. The design of these programs will explicitly take into account the need to address fuel poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> To ensure that the theme of just transition is sustained on a consistent basis across the plan a just transition review group will be established within the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, as part of its working group structures. Through this group, NESC will review the ongoing transition and identify specific transition needs among cohorts of workers, enterprises, communities and specific groups of people. It will collaborate and engage with a wide range of stakeholders and will interact closely with my Department’s national dialogue on climate action and sustainable development goals stakeholder forum. </p>

The first periodic review and strategic advice will be published by the end of 2020, and is intended to be a key input to the formulation and adaptation of a five-year just transition strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I thank the Minister of State for that reply. He outlined the challenges and it will undoubtedly be challenging. My party and I understand that and we want to take up those challenges. However, there are opportunities. We do not want the transition to create a bigger dependency, particularly for the midlands. We want to see the opportunities grasped quickly. We want to be ambitious and have a framework for just transition that creates jobs to ensure that workers and communities are not left behind in that transition to a green economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The Minister of State gave the example of Bord na Móna. However, since January, 200 workers have left Bord na Móna and a further 240 will go in the remainder of this year. That is 440 workers gone in one year, mainly in Offaly. It is important that we try to move on this. Bord na Móna needs to be involved in biofuel, wind and solar energy generation, and biogas. It needs €50 million for the transition. When will the just transition review group be established?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I am acutely aware of the situation with Bord na Móna as is the Minister, Deputy Bruton. As I explained earlier, work is ongoing to ensure it has a just transition. I will speak more about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> The climate action plan foresees that the NESC will publish a periodic review and strategic advice on the just transition. This will include an examination of the range of national and international funding opportunities, and how these could be used to underpin the work of this group and the priorities identified. The first periodic review and strategic advice will be published by the end of 2020, and is intended to be a key input to the formulation and adaptation of a five-year just transition strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The Deputy spoke about the implications for Bord na Móna. It will be a significant milestone for the region that by 2028 Bord na Móna will end the harvesting of peat for power generation. The Government is committed to supporting the company in its transition to the development of new businesses in herbs, aquaculture, resource recovery and renewable energy. Existing initiatives and structures in this regard include: the regional enterprise plans to 2020; the regional steering committees which oversee these plans as live agendas; the current regional mandates of the enterprise agencies and regional assemblies; and the regional spatial and economic strategies. These initiatives will be mobilised to maximise enterprise opportunities to deal with the challenge faced by Bord na Móna.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">I asked the Minister of State when the review group will be set up. He might give me an answer to that question.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> Bord na Móna is the most acutely affected, but motor mechanics will also be affected. We also have the situation with Moneypoint. A number of workers will be displaced and will need to retrain. The scale of what needs to be done is enormous. Bord na Móna was a significant employer. It is possible to have that kind of scale again in terms of a green economy. It has potential to be involved and it is making moves in that direction. It needs to be encouraged to move into biomass, biogas and solar energy generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> We need a national agency to train people for retrofitting because we do not have the construction workers to do it at the moment. We would prefer to have some sort of commission for a just transition; we do not have that. At least the Minister of State needs to tell us when the review group will be established. We need biomass supply chains. Bringing this stuff halfway across the world defeats the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We need to be growing biomass in Edenderry and throughout west Offaly to supply these plants.</p>

It wants to remain as part of the communities in the midlands. It is committed to doing that and with support from the Government and the regional agencies, I have no doubt we will see Bord na Móna become the model for transitioning in a just way from a brown company to a green company.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every home, school and business in Ireland has access to high-speed broadband. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment across the country and a State intervention in those areas where commercial operators acting alone are unlikely to invest. The national broadband plan has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector. In 2012, fewer than 700,000, or 30% of Irish premises had access to high-speed broadband. Today, 74% of the 2.4 million premises in Ireland can access high-speed broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I recently brought a recommendation to the Government to confer preferred bidder status on Granahan McCourt, the remaining bidder in the national broadband plan procurement process, and the Government agreed to this at its meeting on 7 May. </p>
            <p eId="para_78"> The Government decision means that it is intended to award the State intervention contract to National Broadband Ireland, subject to contract close, including the finalisation of financial and legal documents. A period of final due diligence on all elements of the contract is part of the normal conclusion of a procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> National Broadband Ireland will be supported by a number of experienced subcontractors and is currently tasked with finalising negotiations on contracts with subcontractors to assist in the delivery of the national broadband plan. It is anticipated that a subset of these subcontracts will be required prior to contract close to support deployment. The state aid notification relating to the national broadband plan will also be submitted to the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">It is anticipated that these elements will require a number of months, with contract close expected later this year and deployment commencing shortly after that. That was an update on the status of the plan, which was what was sought in the original question.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">I will not give a view attributing motivations or otherwise of anyone involved in this project. The position is that Eir was involved in this process and it found fault with a number of elements which the State regarded as key to the protection of the State's investment, compliance with state aid rules and protection of those for whom this service was being designed. In other words, the conditions were for 100% future-proofed, high-speed broadband for every home and premises in the country. Eir participated in the process for a long time. It accepted those conditions in the initial period and made a bid of €2.7 billion but then withdrew from the process. It is now suggesting, as it did at the time to be fair, that if all of these protections were abandoned, it could do it cheaper. The State's view then and now was that those requirements are essential to comply with state aid rules and protect the State and those we are seeking to serve. Equally, I recognise and welcome that Eir continues to be committed to supporting the roll-out of the national broadband plan. It has always been envisaged that the most cost-effective way of delivering this is to use the infrastructure of either the ESB or Eir and the company in question would be rewarded with a regulated price for the service it provides.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">The climate action plan launched last month sets out Ireland's 2030 ambitions and puts the State on the right trajectory to meet net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan provides that a support payment for excess electricity generated on site and exported to the grid will be available to all microgenerators by 2021 at the latest. ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities will assess potential implications for the distribution network of higher penetration of microgeneration by the end of 2019. Furthermore, my Department will establish a working group to set policy objectives which, in turn, will lead to the detailed design of the support scheme. The annexe to the climate action plan contains the detailed actions, timelines and associated responsibility to ensure delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> To ensure fairness to microgenerators and energy consumers, there are a number of issues that need to be considered and addressed in developing a scheme for microgeneration. These include a reform of the network charges, an assessment of the distributional impact of such a policy decision on the public service obligation levy, PSO, and the development of a fair tariff for exported electricity taking into account the benefits of self-consumption. This approach is in line with the experience of other EU member states which have attempted to introduce supports for microgeneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_87"> The microgeneration pilot scheme, launched last year and administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is being reviewed and the costs of installation are being assessed. The data gathered during this pilot scheme will inform potential future phases of support for microgeneration that may be appropriate, as we align with the ambition of the recast renewable energy directive, which recognises the rights, entitlements and obligations of renewable self-consumers. The Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 was not opposed by the Government. The Select Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment has held a number of hearings into this issue in recent months.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">I hope the Bill is not opposed by Government. I first introduced it in 2017 but it has been moving at a snail's pace. I am glad that Committee Stage is under way, as the Minister of State noted. We are awaiting the clerk's report on that and I hope we will be able to see quicker progress at that point. Will the Government block the Bill? Should we expect it to use the money message facility at the last minute? I hope that will not be the case. The Minister of State should flag now if that is the Government's intention. We are open to amendments to the Bill from the Government and other parties, as I have said throughout the process. Sinn Féin's intention in the Bill is to plan ahead and allow families, schools, farmers, small businesses, local clubs and GAA clubs to produce power for self-consumption and export to the grid. It is an example of joined-up thinking. Will the Minister of State indicate when we can expect to see a microgeneration support scheme in place?</p>

            <p eId="para_89">The pilot scheme that has been carried out will inform the potential future phases of support for microgeneration. That is important. We will take on board the good work the Deputy has been doing on microgeneration, including in his Bill. It is important that we fully assess how we will implement a microgeneration scheme, including tariffs and related issues. The ambition of Government is that the scheme will be in place by 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">It is good to hear a scheme will be in place by 2020. There are good examples of microgeneration schemes in other countries. I know the Department will be ultra-cautious on these issues but there are good examples of schemes that are already operating. I ask that lessons be learned from those examples. The average person wants to know when he or she will be able to self-generate and export excess energy to the grid. My Bill has been on the books for two years but I hope we are now making progress with it. The Minister of State has not answered my question as to whether the Government will block it using the money message device. I hope it will not do so. The Bill has broad support in the House so I ask that it would not be delayed.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> We need to move this discussion on. It was difficult to get a discussion going on these types of issues in the thirty-first Dáil but the discussion on energy and climate action has intensified in recent years, particularly in the past six months. Will we have big thinking from Government on this area? The Minister of State indicated a microgeneration scheme will be introduced in 2020. Can we expect large-scale microgeneration to commence in 2020? Big thinking is needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">The all-of-Government climate action plan is an example of big thinking but it is also practical. It includes key dates, timelines and details on how targets will be delivered. On international best practice, some countries have taken successful approaches to microgeneration, while the approaches of others have been a failure. The clever approach is to look and learn from the successes and failures in other countries to avoid repeating the mistakes made elsewhere. We need to put a scheme in place that is effective and fair and ensures that all those who take part in it are treated properly.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">Carbon-proofing will have a key role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy and has been recognised by the Climate Change Advisory Council as an important tool for Ireland to achieve its long-term decarbonisation objectives in a cost-effective manner by 2050. As part of project appraisal for all public capital investments, it is essential to avoid expenditure that locks in long-term fossil fuel consumption. To that end, the climate action plan commits to reviewing the Government's public spending code in 2019. This guidance currently includes values for monetising the greenhouse gas emissions associated with Government investment and the plan proposes to significantly strengthen the calculation of a shadow price of carbon, such that proposed Government investments will need to value carbon at a level which will see the shadow price increase to €32 per tonne by 2020, €100 per tonne by 2030 and €265 per tonne by 2050.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">The reform of the public spending code will also see a new stage introduced into the project life cycle. The project identification stage will become the first stage of the life cycle with the purpose of ensuring early consideration of approaches to deal with a policy issue ahead of selecting the preferred option and proceeding to the appraisal stage. Climate considerations will be incorporated in this new life cycle stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> Consistent application of these rules will allow decision-makers to better understand and appreciate the climate consequences of their investment options. Separately, the climate action plan commits the Government to ensuring that all Government memoranda and major investment decisions are subject to a carbon impact and mitigation evaluation, for which a template will be developed. This will be incorporated in Cabinet procedures, in regulatory impact assessments and in project evaluation processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">There are two dimensions to the answer to that question. In terms of staying on track, we are setting up an implementation committee within the Department of the Taoiseach which will be co-chaired by the Secretaries General of that Department and of my Department. That will oversee the roll-out and implementation of the action plan. In addition, there will be carbon proofing within the Government process so that each memorandum that comes to Government that would have a carbon impact would be assessed as part of the Government decision on it.

Those views are shared in the affected areas north of the Border too. EirGrid has not listened to the views of those communities and neither has the Department, nor the Minister's predecessors. A clear message from the communities North and South is that if this project is to proceed it needs to have buy-in from communities and local landowners. If the project is to go ahead those transmission cables need to be put underground as happens with other major projects throughout Europe. The Minister is aware that some overground transmission cables in other parts of Europe are being put underground.</p>

            <p eId="para_105">The North-South interconnector is critical to improving the efficient operation of the single electricity market and increasing security of electricity supply across the island of Ireland. A resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure is vital for Ireland's economic well-being and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers. In December 2016 An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission for the project in Ireland, while in January 2018 full planning permission was granted for the section of the line that lies in Northern Ireland. Both of the planning decisions have been subject to legal proceedings in each jurisdiction. In Ireland a Supreme Court appeal of the planning permission was dismissed on 19 February 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> In Northern Ireland, on 8 February 2019, the Department for Infrastructure asked the High Court to quash the planning permission given so the planning application can be re-determined under new legislation introduced by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in November 2018. The planning process in Northern Ireland is a matter for the authorities there.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> There are currently a number of ongoing procurements in relation to the project being undertaken and managed by ESB Networks. In June 2019 ESB Networks awarded a framework contract for the design, test and supply of steelwork for the project. However, under this framework there will be no supply of materials until the planning process in Northern Ireland is complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> The earliest possible date for construction to commence is early 2020.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">Does the Minister of State have any idea when a determination will be finalised in respect of the planning project in Northern Ireland? How can a procurement process proceed even in its initial stages if there is not planning permission?</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> I recently mentioned to the Minister of State's colleague that we were told some years ago that the lights would go out in Northern Ireland if the North-South interconnector did not proceed within a very short timeframe. The most recent electricity generation reports published by EirGrid and the System Operator for Northern Ireland, SONI, indicate clearly that there is a surplus of energy supply in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_111"> None of us is against the all-Ireland electricity market. We favour all-Ireland economic development. The Minister of State, however, should have been made aware by departmental officials and EirGrid, if it is reporting correctly to the Department, that communities in Meath, Monaghan, Cavan, Armagh and Tyrone are vehemently opposed to the project as proposed. Communities deserve to be listened to. Most public representatives in Meath, Monaghan and Cavan have attended numerous public meetings where hundreds of people turned up to outline their concerns and their total opposition to the EirGrid proposals as constituted. </p>

            <p eId="para_112">There is a very definite need for this North-South interconnector. It is critical to ensuring that we have a safe, secure supply of electricity throughout the island of Ireland. It also supports the core objectives of European and national energy policy: sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. The benefits associated with the project will include an increase in competitiveness by reducing costs for energy consumers through more efficient operation of the electricity system on the island of Ireland. A key barrier to the efficient operation of the single electricity market since 2007 has been the limited interconnection between the electricity systems in Ireland and Northern Ireland with only one high-capacity interconnector between the two electricity systems. They cannot operate as a single system. This limits the benefits that can be derived from the single electricity market. This project will ensure that the efficiencies in the single electricity market are fully realised to the benefit of the energy consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> Security of supply will be increased. The planning process has been dealt with. It has gone for judicial review and that is the process by which these projects are brought forward. </p>

            <p eId="para_114">That planning permission was granted by a public servant in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, there is no political system in place there due to the intransigence of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and Sinn Féin.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> This is not a matter of opposition to the development of the all-Ireland electricity market, far from it. The landowners and people living in those communities, who are very concerned about the proposal, are not opposed to the development of the North-South interconnector. They want it developed, if it is necessary, on the basis that the transmission cables will be put underground and not overground where they will be a blight on the countryside and hinder development in the years to come for those communities, in a large part of the country, North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> EirGrid has continued to refuse to listen to the concerns of public representatives in those counties and to communities. People are not opposed to a North-South interconnector, provided those transmission cables are put underground, as is happening in major projects in many other countries in Europe. It is disingenuous for any Minister or any statutory agency to try to suggest that people opposed to the North-South interconnector proposal are opposed to the North-South electricity market. We welcome all-Ireland economic developments. </p>

            <p eId="para_129">I thank the Deputy for this important and timely question. The National Cyber Security Centre was established under my Department following a Government decision in 2011 and has a remit across the digital and cybersecurity of Government ICT and critical national infrastructure under the network and information security directive. The centre is focused on developing capacity to protect Government information and communications networks and on engaging with stakeholders on sharing information, securing systems and responding to incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_130"> The National Cyber Security Centre has three central roles: to manage and share information relating to threats to network and information security; to manage and collate incident reports and threat-intelligence data; and to issue advisories to constituents and-or the public, including during ongoing incidents. The centre also provides early warnings and alerts, and disseminates information about dynamic risk, incident analysis and situational awareness. </p>
            <p eId="para_131"> The centre is home to the national computer security incident response team, which acts as a conduit for information to constituents, including operators of critical national infrastructure and Departments and agencies, and is responsible for the provision of expert advice and analysis on cybersecurity issues and for co-ordinating the response to significant incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> The resources for the group have been considerably expanded in recent years as it takes on new responsibilities under EU directives.

            <p eId="para_138">In the climate action plan I have set a target of 70% for renewable electricity by 2030 to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change. This will build on the progress made in the past ten years, in which the renewable energy sector has undergone a considerable transformation, with the share of renewable electricity generation more than doubling to 30% in 2017. However, we must step up the scale of our plans even further in order to meet our climate ambitions. Analysis and modelling to underpin the plan assessed a range of options to ensure that Ireland meets its 2030 climate and energy ambitions. The plan identifies a range of technical, regulatory, legislative and economic factors that arise. The impact on the cost of electricity, affordability for consumers and business competitiveness of setting higher renewable electricity targets must also be considered. To meet the 70% target, major capital investment will be needed in new generation capacity, system service infrastructure, and electricity transmission and distribution networks. A review of the policy and regulatory framework will be necessary to incentivise electricity storage infrastructure, which will be critical to absorbing higher levels of renewable generation on to the system. Progressing EirGrid's programme, Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System, known as DS3, and the efficient procurement of low-carbon generation through the single-market capacity auctions, will be critical to delivering the system changes required to meet our 70% target.</p>
            <p eId="para_139"> In addition, increased interconnection, including to France and further interconnection to the UK, will be required to facilitate the large upscaling in onshore and offshore wind so that we can balance the grid and ensure security of supply. In parallel, delivering an early and complete phase-out of coal- and peat-fired electricity generation will create space for the entry of new renewable energy assets into the market. </p>
            <p eId="para_140"> The new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, is critical to meeting Ireland's contribution to the target and is being designed to achieve that in a cost-competitive way. Private sector funding through corporate contracting will be essential for meeting higher levels of ambition to increase renewable energy supply and deliver on long-term decarbonisation. The RESS will be characterised by a series of renewable electricity auctions, aligned with the ambition set out in the climate action plan and the final national energy and climate plan, NECP, which is due to be submitted to the European Commission by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">I thank the Minister for that reply. He mentioned the Celtic interconnector, which is a very important and welcome development for this country. It is hoped that when we develop renewable sources, electricity will be exported by the interconnector and it will help guarantee our supply. Last week, I received a reply from the Minister's Department to a parliamentary question, which said that as part of the climate action plan the State intends that a total of €13.7 billion will be put into energy investment by 2027. That is good but that is all the information the Department gave me. How much of that investment is expected to come from the State? Will there be matching funding from the private sector? Will it be through PPPs? It will not, I hope, be done through a gap-funded model similar to the broadband plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> The big question is this. We know that the private sector will not do this on its own and that we have very successful semi-State companies, such as the ESB, Bord na Móna and Coillte. Will those companies be big players in this?</p>

            <p eId="para_143">The detail of the €13.7 billion investment has to be worked out, but it will be in the areas I mentioned, namely, the system service infrastructure, the transmission and distribution networks, the interconnectors and storage infrastructure. Those are predominantly State infrastructures to facilitate the system's capacity for more renewables.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The private sector contribution will predominantly involve companies bidding at auctions and State bidders will not be favoured over private bidders. The auctions will have to be run in such a fashion that all bidders are treated equally. However, there will be separate pots, as one might call them. For example, we envisage a community pot the bidders for which could not be large private sector players. It will be a confined pot. Similarly, there may in time be a confined pot for offshore wind. As the Deputy will appreciate, that is at an earlier stage and will need to be given an opportunity to gain a foothold over time. In summary, the participation of the private sector will take place predominantly within the auction system.</p>

            <p eId="para_145">I accept that there will have to be a rules-based auction system. My question is whether, as the shareholder and representative of the public in the ESB, Bord na Móna and Coillte, the Minister sees those companies becoming major players here. A lot of that is a matter for the policy direction of Government notwithstanding that the boards of those companies will make their own decisions. In the case of Bord na Móna, it is very welcome that it is going ahead with plans for renewable energy. As the key player in the setting of the policy direction, does the Government envisage these three companies having the major role?</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> I refer to biogas. France has 1,000 biogas plants producing clean biogas energy while Germany has 6,000. England has 600 and we have one. We are playing catch-up there. I put the point to the Minister also that we need to start developing biomass supply chains again. I will keep pushing this with the Minister. We do not have those chains here and we must start to develop them. What plans does the Government have to do so?</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I agree absolutely with the Deputy. We intend that the ESB, Coillte and Bord na Móna will be major players. Those companies have set out significant ambitions and put plans in train and will play a strategic role in the move to a decarbonised economy. We announced recently the renewable heat support scheme, which will allow biomass provision to replace existing heat systems. A generous support scheme has been published and is envisaged to remove 10 million tonnes of carbon equivalent over the period 2021 to 2030, which is a significant initiative. There was biogas participation in the climate action fund. A successful biogas project under the fund will be a very useful test base to determine its potential role, which I do not doubt will be very significant.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">The recently published climate action plan sets an ambitious target of 500,000 energy efficiency retrofits by 2030. Achievement of this target will be supported by a Project Ireland 2040 allocation of €3 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the plan. One such measure is the development of a new retrofitting delivery model which will group retrofitting projects together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance and ensure easy pay-back methods. Savings on electricity bills from using less energy will help to fund repayments while homes will be warmer and produce lower levels of emissions. Other relevant initiatives identified in the plan include: the introduction of improvements to the BER certificate to provide more guidance to homeowners; the development of interactive tools and reports for homeowners to identify the impact of energy efficiency upgrades; an expansion of the pilot salary incentive scheme for energy efficiency upgrades; the identification of options for the financing of energy upgrades such as green mortgages; an assessment of the potential for energy suppliers to pilot a pay-as-you-save mechanism and on-bill finance; and enhanced delivery models and supports for households with lower incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_152"> The primary current support for retrofitting is the programme of grant schemes funded by my Department and operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. Since 2000, more than 400,000 homes have received direct support under these schemes to improve their energy efficiency. This year, I have allocated €85 million to the schemes. The climate action plan commits to reviewing and redesigning these grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government objectives and value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_153">The reply refers to the retrofitting of 500,000 homes by 2030, which is a significant and welcome target. The problem, however, is that I received a previous reply from the Department which stated that over a three-year period, 305 homes benefitted from deep retrofitting grants provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which is a minuscule number in the context of what we are trying to do. I flag that to the Minister. It is a fantasy to say we will retrofit 500,000 homes if we are only doing 100 homes a year now. Even if we were to retrofit 10,000 homes a year, it would take until 2069 to get to 500,000. That is the scale of the challenge we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_154"> Support schemes are one thing, but I highlight to the Minister also the issue of apprenticeships and training. In his current role and in his former role as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton has told me the private sector was not taking up apprenticeship and training schemes. We accept that. The question is what we do about it as a State. We must intervene to get the skills in place. They are not there in the building industry at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">I acknowledge the Deputy's support for the action plan. It is a significant target at 50,000 per year whereas the current rate is 34,000 per year, approximately. As the Deputy says, rightly, retrofitting takes place currently at a lower level. These are shallower retrofittings. To be fair, the deep retrofitting scheme was a pilot and was never intended to constitute the final approach. As I indicated in my reply, we will have to design a different model to hit the proposed targets. The current model envisages people coming forward on an individual or small-group basis to commit to an investment of €30,000 in return for a 50% grant. We must look at bundling larger areas, better contracts, better tendering for blocks of work and more effective delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> I agree with the Deputy that the action plan represents a major opportunity to develop new skills and a new sector. I envisage that the retrofitting sector will be worth at least a €1 billion to €1.5 billion. While that is approximately 5% of the construction sector overall, it will nonetheless be important and we will have to develop new apprenticeships and skills within it. Part of the development of the new delivery model will be about ensuring the supply chain is capable of achieving the targets. As the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said, we will be looking to the education and training boards to support the delivery of that supply chain with new traineeships and apprenticeships. We will also see new companies getting involved in this to support the supply chain.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">On skills, I highlight to the Minister the Mount Lucas training centre run by the Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board. The potential exists to expand that centre, which is geographically located in the middle of the country. I asked questions about the centre seven years ago, at which stage fewer than 20 people went through it in one year. According to a reply to a parliamentary question I submitted recently, the numbers have now increased with 120 people undertaking training in specialist building skills at the centre last year. Enrolment must be accelerated and the potential exists to develop that. I flag that to the Minister to be helpful. I would like to see that development take place given that the centre is in the midlands in the Laois-Offaly area where jobs are needed. The centre is located near Edenderry and Daingean and the site of the old briquette factory and, as such, it fits in with the just transition we have been talking about.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> We need to continue with shallow retrofitting also. Many houses in the State are still single-glazed and have pre-2006 attic insulation. There are even some houses with no insulation. That low-hanging fruit needs to be picked. Some such households are in the lowest income bracket and are experiencing fuel poverty. I ask that they receive attention.</p>

            <p eId="para_159">I agree with the Deputy. Group and area-based schemes will allow us to carry out those shallow retrofits as they will offer people an easy, turnkey process by which to do so. I assure the Deputy that not only did I visit Mount Lucas as Minister for Education and Skills, but I have also visited in my new role. I fully acknowledge its potential. It is a fantastic centre. Great things are happening there not only in the area of training, but also in the area of piloting new sustainable options for Bord na Móna. I see it becoming a very significant player in the development of a supply chain. It is good to see that the midlands regional enterprise strategy has made developing opportunities in the decarbonised economy a key priority for the development of the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_165">The climate action plan sets a target of 936,000 EVs by 2030. That would represent approximately one third of all purchases in the period between now and then. To support the achievement of this target, the plan sets out a range of actions which include introducing a legislative ban on the sale of new fossil fuel cars from 2030; developing the charging network to stay sufficiently ahead of demand - as the Deputy knows, we are currently rolling out 724 new or upgraded charging points; ensuring our regulatory regime for buildings requires the installation of EV charging infrastructure; consideration of a car scrappage scheme to promote the purchase of EVs; consideration of the recalibration of vehicle tax regimes to support uptake; and developing a roadmap for the optimum mix of regulatory, taxation and subsidy policies to drive the ramp-up in EV usage.</p>
            <p eId="para_166"> I also note the existing incentives, which include a grant of up to €5,000; vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief of up to €5,000; benefit-in-kind tax relief; a grant of up to €7,000 for EVs in the taxi sector; a grant of up to €600 for the installation of a home charger; accelerated capital allowances; a lower rate of motor tax; and tolling reductions of up to 50%.</p>
            <p eId="para_167"> These incentives have helped support strong growth in the uptake of EVs. In the first five months of 2019, more than 2,600 new EVs were licensed. This is almost three times the number licensed in the same period last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_168">While the situation regarding EVs has improved this year, they are still a lot more expensive than ordinary petrol or diesel vehicles and are beyond the reach of many households. There are also concerns about range anxiety, which is a major issue. In that context, how many charging points are there in the State? What scale of increase in the number of such points is planned for the coming years? Who will own the charging points? The question of whether the ESB will retain ownership of its charging points has been batted back and forth for two years. How many charging points do we have? What are the Minister's plans to increase that number? Who will provide the charging points?</p>

            <p eId="para_169">The Deputy is correct. The price of EVs is higher than that of conventional cars, but the running costs of EVs are approximately one eighth of those of conventional cars. It is a case of swings and roundabouts. It is worth pointing out that the price of batteries is decreasing rapidly and that their durability is improving. The expert opinion we have received is that, even if there were no tax incentives, the cost of EVs by 2023 or 2024 will result in them dominating the market. We have provided substantial grants and taxes on fossil fuels to add to the incentive.</p>
            <p eId="para_170"> The existing network comprises approximately 600 chargers. Some 724 new or upgraded charging points are to be rolled out. Of these, 500 will be higher-grade chargers to replace existing chargers. Most will be new, high-capacity chargers in strategic locations. They will be under the ESB. We are also looking at other providers such as local authorities. From 2025, anyone who has more than 20 parking spaces will be obliged to have a charging network. The network will not be solely State-supported. New obligations will be imposed on others.</p>

Will the local Topaz garage have charging points? Are there any plans for such a scheme to be rolled out? Will there be a charge to use such points? How will it be regulated?</p>
            <p eId="para_174"> There is also in issue in respect of grid capacity. The revenue from petrol and diesel brings in a lot of money for the State. When we move to EVs, that source of funding will be cut off. On the other hand, the electricity grid will have to be upgraded. We know this from speaking with EirGrid and the ESB. It will require substantial investment. How will that mismatch between revenue and investment be bridged? What assessment of the grid's capacity to cater for new EVs and associated infrastructure has been carried out?</p>

            <p eId="para_175">The ambitions of the electricity network are based on very substantial growth in overall demand for power. From memory, a 50% growth in power demand arising from a variety of sectors, including new EVs, is anticipated. The Deputy is correct. We should be looking to car manufacturers and service stations to make investment in this area. Thus far it has had to be leveraged by a State company with State support. As it develops, we expect to see the private sector coming forward to support the roll-out of the infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_176"> In the context of the impact on traditional revenue sources such as diesel tax, VRT and so on, the Deputy is also correct. Over the next 20 to 30 years, there will be a rapid change as we move away from depending of fossil fuels for 85% of our energy needs and head towards 0%. This will require different sources of revenue to be found. That will have to be handled on a year-to-year basis by the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">I am very conscious of this issue. Deputy Browne's colleague, Deputy Dooley, raised it earlier and I went through it at that time. The Deputy probably appreciates that, while my predecessors announced that it was their intention to introduce a nationwide ban, this was challenged on the grounds that it would not be fair to treat the burning of smoky coal differently from the burning of peat and wood as their environmental impact is similar. There have been threats not only to challenge the extension of the ban but to challenge the existing bans applying in considerable portions of the country, which have been very successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">I have had to seek legal advice on how we would robustly design the roll-out of the protections the Deputy rightly signalled are a priority for Enniscorthy and other towns. I am working with the Attorney General to develop a robust way of doing that.</p>

            <p eId="para_187">The distinction between coal as against wood and turf is that there is a viable alternative to coal, namely, smokeless coal, while there is not such an alternative for wood and turf. That distinguishes it in that respect. Having talked to people involved in this area, I am aware that high-tech monitoring has been put in place in Enniscorthy town but it is not in place in many other towns. I suspect many other towns that are not covered by the smoky coal ban are in as bad or close to as bad a situation as Enniscorthy. Enniscorthy has been highlighted because modern, sensitive, high-tech equipment has been put in place. We need to know what the air quality is in the town but I suspect it is not the only town in this situation. The smoky coal ban covers approximately 80% of the population. The people who were threatening legal action have had 30 years to take such legal action with respect to the rest of the country but they have not done that. We know the dangers associated with burning smoky coal and much of that coal is being illegally imported from the North. Action needs to be taken on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">I agree with the Deputy but one has to be careful not to jeopardise successful schemes that are managing air quality at a time when we seek to extend those. With the law of unintended consequences, we could undermine what is successful. I agree with the Deputy that we need to find a way to address this with respect to a number of towns which the Deputy rightly said does not only include Enniscorthy where there is a particular problem. All I can say to him is that we are working hard to find a solution to this problem that would be legally robust.</p>

          <p eId="para_194"> The primary purpose of the Bill, as published, is to provide for the setting up of a judicial council. Such councils are generally seen as having an important role to play in safeguarding the independence of the Judiciary. They also provide a vehicle for addressing matters such as further education and training as well as matters pertaining to discipline. In keeping with this approach, the Bill affirms the independence of the proposed judicial council and provides that one of its key functions will be to promote and maintain excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions. Furthermore, the Bill will establish a complaints regime, which will address instances of misconduct by judges, which do not warrant the invocation of Article 35.4.1 of the Constitution. As Members will know, that article relates to the removal of a judge from office for stated misbehaviour or incapacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Before dealing with the content of the Bill, I would like to comment on some amendments, which were made to it during its progress through Seanad Éireann, the first of which concerns personal injuries guidelines. Originally, it was not envisaged that the judicial council would have a role in setting personal injury guidelines. However, when the second and final report of the Personal Injuries Commission was published in July last year, it recommended that the judicial council should have a role in compiling guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. The Government recognised the clear opportunity presented by their recommendation to give the council a key role in this important task. Accordingly, the Government has proposed a package of amendments to the Bill to provide for the setting up of a personal injuries guidelines committee within the framework of the judicial council. One function of this committee will be to develop personal injuries guidelines for adoption by the judicial council. Another function involves the review of adopted guidelines at least once every three years and, if necessary, the preparation of amendments to the guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> In drawing up the guidelines, the committee will be empowered to consult widely with external stakeholders, including the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and to obtain information about court decisions in this jurisdiction and in other comparable jurisdictions. A number of factors will be taken into account in drawing up the guidelines, including the level of damages awarded in personal injuries actions by the courts in this State and by courts in other jurisdictions. Guiding principles drawn from those set down in recent Court of Appeal decisions, which affirm that modest injuries should attract moderate damages, will also be relevant, as will the need to promote consistency in the level of personal injuries damages awarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> In carrying out its task, the personal injuries guidelines committee will have access to relevant domestic and international expertise. To complete the circle, so to speak, provision is also made for the courts to have regard to any guidelines, which might be in being when a personal injuries action comes before them. Where a court departs from those guidelines, the reasons for that departure must be stated in the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The membership of the committee consists solely of seven judges. This membership configuration is both for reasons of efficiency and to avoid any impression that the committee is being captured by vested interests. The membership arrangement respects the independence of the Judiciary and facilitates the undertaking of the work of the committee in a dispassionate and objective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Provision has also been made for the training function of the judicial studies committee to include a specific reference to training in assessing damages in personal injuries cases. I will return to the issue of training more generally in a few moments, but for now I would like to move to another core area of this Bill, that of sentencing guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Deputies will recall that there had been a strong public desire that there should be genuine and demonstrable consistency in regard to the imposition of sentences in criminal cases. While it has to be acknowledged that guidelines developed by the Judiciary are increasingly being used as a technique for structuring sentencing discretion, it was felt that confidence in the criminal justice system would be enhanced by the production of formal guidelines. In that context, amendments were proposed, which provide for the establishment of a sentencing guidelines and information committee rather than the sentencing information committee originally proposed in the Bill. I acknowledge the role of Deputies in this respect, particularly Deputy Ó Laoghaire. </p>
          <p eId="para_201"> The sentencing guidelines and information committee will consist of eight judges and five lay members. The Government following a recommendation from the Public Appointments Service on foot of a selection process will appoint the latter. The committee will draft sentencing guidelines and submit those guidelines for review by the board of the judicial council, prior to their adoption by the council itself. The sentencing committee may, for the purpose of performing its functions, have access to court documents relating to criminal proceedings. The committee may also draw upon external expertise in preparing draft sentencing guidelines. The most critical element of this sentencing package specifies that a court shall, in imposing a sentence, have regard to sentencing guidelines relevant to the proceedings before it, unless the court is satisfied that to do so would be contrary to the interests of justice. As is the case with the personal injuries guidelines, the reasons for departing from the sentencing guidelines are to be stated by a court in its decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I want to touch briefly on one other area, which concerns the hearing of a complaint in public. The Bill, as published, provided that a hearing of a complaint before a panel of inquiry should be conducted otherwise than in public unless the judicial conduct committee directed that, in order to safeguard the administration of justice, it should be conducted in public. A similar arrangement applied in respect of a hearing conducted by the judicial conduct committee in regard to a complaint that had been the subject of an investigation by a panel of inquiry and in respect of which a report had been submitted to the judicial conduct committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Such arrangements did not sit well with contemporary understandings of accountability and transparency. The Bill now specifies that the default arrangement is that a hearing will be held in public, unless the judicial conduct committee directs that, in order to safeguard the administration of justice, such a hearing should be conducted in private.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Part 1 deals with matters of a general nature such as definitions and repeals. A significant definition is that of judicial misconduct. In broad terms, this means conduct which constitutes a departure from acknowledged standards of judicial conduct and which brings the administration of justice into disrepute. Standards, in this context, should have regard to certain principles which are essentially those commonly referred to as the Bangalore principles of judicial conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Part 2 concerns the judicial council itself and provides for its establishment. In addition to the function of promoting and maintaining excellence in the exercise by judges of their judicial functions, the council will also be tasked with promoting and maintaining high standards of conduct among judges, the efficient and effective use of judicial resources, continuing education of judges, respect for the independence of the Judiciary, as well as public confidence in the Judiciary and the administration of justice. The council also has functions relating to sentencing guidelines and personal injuries guidelines which I have already discussed in some detail. The council will consist of all members of the Judiciary. It is anticipated it will generally meet on an annual basis with the Chief Justice acting as its chairperson.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Part 3 deals with the board of the council and its committees. However, it does not deal with the judicial conduct committee covered by Part 5. The board will be responsible for the performance of the council’s functions on a day-to-day basis. It will be chaired by the Chief Justice. It will include among its members the presidents of each of the courts, five judges elected from each of the courts and one judge who will be co-opted from each of the courts on a rota basis. The board will hold a minimum of four meetings per year and may also establish committees to assist it in its work from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The judicial studies committee will have a role in facilitating the continuing education and training of judges, which will be broader than the role currently undertaken by the current committee of the same name on these matters. The existing committee does not, of course, have a statutory basis. It will be possible for the council to appoint persons who are not judges to be members of the judicial studies committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Judicial support committees will be available to each of the courts to advise and assist the council in the performance of its functions, insofar as matters relevant to the court to which the committee relates are concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Part 4 deals with staffing and funding issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Part 5 is a core element, creating the formal structures which will provide an open and coherent mechanism to allow for the investigation of complaints of judicial misconduct which falls outside the framework of Article 35 of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> At the heart of Part 5 is the provision relating to the establishment of the judicial conduct committee, the function of which is to promote and maintain high standards of conduct. The Chief Justice will chair the committee. In addition to the presidents of all of the courts, there will also be three elected judges on the committee, along with five lay members who will be appointed by the Government after an appropriate Public Appointments Service selection process has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> In keeping with the need for transparency in the investigation of complaints, the committee is required to publish the procedures, which are to be followed in the making, the investigation and the determination of a complaint. The committee may refer complaints for resolution by informal means or for investigation by a panel of inquiry. Where a panel of inquiry finds that an allegation in a complaint has been proved, the recommendations for the reprimand of the judge concerned may include the issuing of advice, a recommendation as to the pursuit of a specified course of action such as attendance at a training course and the issuing of an admonishment. The judicial conduct committee may accept, with or without modification, a recommendation made by a panel of inquiry. It may also reject such a recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> A final provision relates to the annual report of the judicial conduct committee. The Bill sets out an extensive range of statistical data which must be included in that report. This will provide a useful perspective on the committee's work and will also provide a means of evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed complaints regime. In keeping with the transparency provisions to which I referred earlier, the annual report will contain the name of any judge who fails or refuses to co-operate with a panel of inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I thank Members for their attention and I look forward to hearing their observations on this Bill. I am grateful to Opposition spokespersons and the Business Committee for facilitating the taking of this Bill this morning.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_215">The Judicial Council Bill has been about 20 years coming. The origins of this Bill can be traced back to a report prepared by a working group on a courts commission established in 1999. It was asked to report to the then Chief Justice, Liam Hamilton, on the question of judicial conduct and ethics. One of its recommendations was the establishment of a judicial council to promote efficiency and excellence in the Judiciary, as well as dealing with judicial misconduct and how complaints could be made and dealt with against members of the Judiciary. Subsequently, the Chief Justice established a committee which led to a report prepared by the next Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Ronan Keane. His committee produced a report, known as the Keane report, which concluded that the existing structures for dealing with concerns as to judicial misconduct were inadequate. It set forward reasonable details of proposals for legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> In 2001, the then Government brought forward a proposal which also sought to amend the Constitution to deal with the issue. That did not get support in the Dáil. As a result, the proposal was dropped. Subsequently, draft legislation was prepared and a scheme of a Bill was published to give effect to the 2000 report by the then Fianna Fáil Government in August 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> There has been considerable delay in respect of getting this legislation into the Houses of the Oireachtas and debated here. Not all of the blame rests on the political system. The Judiciary was slow in responding to it as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> While I welcome the fact we are now debating the Judicial Council Bill, it is unfortunate all Stages will be dealt with in one Dáil sitting. I will not object to it as there is an urgency to get this done and, in general, I am happy with the proposals contained in the legislation. However, the Dáil should have been given more time to deal with this Bill, considering it has been 20 years in the making, yet Members who make the law of the country only get one day to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> As the Minister said, it is extensive legislation which sets out the establishment of a judicial council, as well as establishing several committees to deal with important aspects of judicial behaviour and performance of judicial functions. Its origins are in respect of assessing how we deal with judicial misconduct. The only provision available to the State to deal with judicial misconduct is contained in the Constitution which allows for the Oireachtas to impeach a judge for a stated misbehaviour. Fortunately, that has never been done. However, it is clearly the case that there are occasions when judges engage in misconduct. Currently, the only possible remedy to deal with that, which is not set out on any statutory basis, is that a complaint can be made informally to the president of the court who then is without any power or real jurisdiction over the member of the Judiciary and cannot impose a sanction upon that judge for judicial misconduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> We have been lucky with the judges we have had. There are few examples of judicial misconduct. All judges abide by the oath they take in advance of taking up office. Nonetheless, that does not mean that we should not have a procedure in place and there have been examples of judicial misconduct in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The procedures set down in the legislation are beneficial in how we deal with judicial misconduct. I had the opportunity and benefit of meeting advisers from the Minister's office in respect of these proposals. It is a complicated mechanism which involves complaints being made, panels of inquiry being established and determinations being made by the judicial conduct committee. The ultimate sanction which can be imposed under this legislation is that the Minister can be required to bring a motion before the Dáil seeking the impeachment of a judge. The legislation in respect of judicial conduct is well set out and coherent.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> There is also the section which deals with judicial studies and supports. We have three arms of government, the Judiciary, the Executive and the Legislature. There is no doubt that the Cinderella sister is the Judiciary. The resources devoted to it are considerably less than those devoted to the Executive and the Legislature.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It is an extremely important arm of our Government and deserves to have more resources invested in it. Judges must produce very detailed written judgments. We operate in a common law system and our law develops, to a large extent, through written judicial decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I welcome that the legislation establishes a judicial studies committee. We also need a judicial support committee, as indicated, and we must recognise that greater resources must be provided to support judges. Elected Deputies can hire two people to support them. I do not know how many people Ministers get but they have a whole Department behind them. Judges are lucky if they get one person to support them and they have little support when it comes to drafting judgments, which takes a considerable amount of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Being realistic and straight, the reason we are rushing this legislation through is that it includes guidelines for awards in personal injury cases. This recommendation was made by Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns when he chaired the Personal Injuries Commission, the first recommendation of which was that a Judicial Council should be established to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury. That is set out in the legislation and we will come to deal with it on Committee Stage because I have tabled a number of amendments on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> The objective and hope is that when we get this judicial guideline committee and guidelines from the judges, the effect will be to lower awards in certain types of personal injuries actions. We need to recognise, however, that there is a difference between what the Houses of the Oireachtas do and what the courts do. The Houses, by definition, deal with issues generally so we are correct in trying to deal with the general issue of personal injuries awards for low level injuries. We have tried to deal with that through a raft of legislation. We deal with it in the generality and do not take into account the specifics of each individual's injury. On the other hand, when a court is dealing with an issue, it cannot deal in generalities but must deal with the specifics of an individual's injury. We must be aware that injuries which people sustain can be specific to them. I agree that the awards handed out by Irish courts for low level injuries such as whiplash are too high and need to be reduced. One never hears, however, that awards for serious injuries, for example, paraplegia, are lower in Ireland than the awards in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> I hope this process will be effective in setting out guidelines for personal injuries awards and, if it comes in and is effective, I hope we, in this House, will see the objective behind all of this, namely, a reduction in premiums from insurance companies, realised. It is also important to note that awards are being reduced at present by the Court of Appeal. I expect that when the personal injuries guidelines are established, they will, to a large extent, reflect the reductions that have been happening as a result of the decisions of the Court of Appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> There is, finally, the issue of sentencing guidelines which was pushed by Deputy Ó Laoghaire and Sinn Féin. We must be careful with sentencing guidelines. We try to be general with sentencing when drafting laws. We must recognise that a judge imposing sentence must consider that every criminal operates differently and every crime is separate. A judge, in imposing a sentence, must take a variety of factors into account such as whether the offender was a repeat offender, the impact on the victim and any mitigating factors, for example, whether it is a first offence. This is not a simple issue where we can simply say that a person convicted of a particular crime gets five years while someone convicted of another crime gets two years. Those are my preliminary points.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">This is significant, landmark legislation for a number of reasons. One of my main priorities in this area has been the introduction, for the first time, of a legislative basis for sentencing guidelines. I will return to that but this is a significant moment for sentencing policy. It is also significant in respect of its provisions dealing with the awarding of general damages in personal injury cases. I concur with many of the reflections of Deputy O'Callaghan. The Bill does not deal with the whole picture, or anything like it, but I hope it will have a real impact. The legislation is of value and Sinn Féin will support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> As Deputy O'Callaghan and the Minister have reflected, this Bill has been long anticipated, not only by Members of the House but also by many judges of various courts who have outlined, at various stages, the need for legislation in this area. There was a lack of accountability, support, assistance and structures to ensure quality educational and training support as well as disciplinary procedures. Those were very clearly lacking and identified as a significant absence by international bodies. We are finally, 20 years after it was first anticipated, moving towards a judicial council model. That is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_231"> It is important that the judicial council will have real structures of accountability, creating the potential for findings of misconduct to be made against judges and providing consequences therefor, up to, in the most serious instances, the Minister bringing a motion to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the removal of a judge. The vast majority of judges are of the very highest quality and one hopes that such circumstances will never arise. That said, it is important that this procedure is available to the judicial council because that power exists in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> The Bill includes provides for training and education for members of the Judiciary. This is an issue because certain judges have shown a lack of understanding or poor understanding of particular areas or displayed attitudes that have dated poorly. It is right and proper that provision is made for education and training as a form of reprimand as well, right up to the most serious consequence I just outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Deputy O'Callaghan noted that Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns recommended the establishment of a judicial council to deal with personal injury awards. A number of issues arise in that regard. The establishment of the council is welcome as awards for damages are clearly too high in some cases. The intervention of the European competition authorities underlined the fact that while premiums are high, the profits of insurance companies are also high.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">Expensive premiums cannot all be attributed to what is happening in the District or Circuit Courts. The insurance firms' profits topped €227 million last year. Industry profits have surged by 1,300% with 17 general insurance providers making combined operating profits of €227 million. Profits have jumped from €16 million in 2016 with cover for drivers proving particularly profitable. The 17 firms in question mopped up €125 million from private and commercial motorists as premiums jumped by 70% in the four years to 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> While this legislation is a part of the solution, we need to go further. Some of the measures needed are probably beyond the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality, although some of them fall within its remit. In many respects, insurance companies have been operating in a manner that is akin to a cartel and those anti-competitive practices need to be tackled. People must be forced to account for the reasons that premiums have increased. A great deal more reform is needed in that area but this legislation is of value nonetheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The area of sentencing guidelines has been a significant priority for Sinn Féin for a number of reasons. I accept the points Deputy O'Callaghan made and I do not disagree with him. I hope, when he examines the amendments, that he will accept that they strike a careful balance. Nobody would envy the Judiciary the job of devising sentences because that process requires much consideration. That applies both to minor and serious crimes. It is important, however, that there is high public confidence in and understanding of the approach taken to sentencing. We have often seen inconsistent, inappropriate and, in some cases, inadequate sentences. That undermines public confidence in sentencing overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> The sentencing guidelines and information committee will have to undertake research because research in this area has been inadequate. Existing research shows that there are significant inconsistencies. RTÉ's "Prime Time Investigates" programme did its own research but other academic research has shown that sentence lengths range from between 14 days and five months in assault cases, from between 30 days and nine months for cases of theft, and from between two and 12 months for road traffic and burglary cases. The application of the Road Traffic Act has been frequently shown as demonstrating wild variations from District Court to District Court as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Serious concern has been expressed at the sentences handed down in the District Courts for crimes involving rape and sexual offences. That indicates a failure to understand the gravity of the violence against the victim. This issue has been identified by judges themselves. Ms Justice Úna Ní Raifeartaigh, a judge of the High Court, stated that the lack of sentencing guidelines in rape cases was "somewhat bizarre". She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_240">One judge’s substantial could be four years and another’s could be 14 years. It is somewhat bizarre that an area that is so sensitive has so little in the way of guidance for a trial judge. </p>
          <p eId="para_241">This is in the interests of ensuring members of the public and victims of crime have confidence in sentencing. It is also in the interests of lawyers and judges. I believe this will be a very successful regime. In the context of the model in Britain, guidelines have been drawn up for about 250 individual categories of offences. These have ensured a high degree of consistency and compliance. To give an example, in cases of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, 96% of sentences fell within the range. Cases involving grievous bodily harm saw 92% of sentences fall within the range while it was 99% in cases of common assault.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> The legislation in Britain makes provision for judges to depart from the guidelines, as does this legislation. That is right and proper. In addition, the sentencing guidelines will be drafted by judges in co-operation with expert non-judicial persons. I believe the guidelines will be of a high quality but it impossible to account for every set of circumstances. No set of guidelines can do that. It is right and proper, therefore, that the judge should be in position to depart from those guidelines. It is also right and proper, however, that judges should state reasons when they depart from the guidelines. </p>
          <p eId="para_243"> This is a significant change, which will certainly enhance public confidence in the judicial system and sentencing policy of this jurisdiction. I thank the Minster for engaging with this issue. I also thank his officials, including Regina Terry and others, who have engaged very constructively. The amendments made to the Bill closely reflect what we had sought. This is an important Bill, which contains three or four crucial elements and we will support it. I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that taking all Stages at once is not the ideal way of passing legislation. I will not object, however, because this is important legislation. I could say the same of legislation coming before the House next week. I appreciate that we are approaching the recess but it is not ideal. This is, nevertheless, important legislation in respect of insurance and providing for proper monitoring, accountability and support of the Judiciary. It is crucially important in respect of having sentencing guidelines that will ensure members of the public and victims of crime have confidence in our sentencing policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">The Labour Party supports the Bill on which my colleague, Senator Bacik, has already spoken. I see no reason to rehearse her comments in welcoming the Bill. In the interests of brevity and to ensure we can pass the Bill in the short time available to us, I merely wish to seek further clarity on section 18(7)(b) which states that the personal injuries guidelines committee may "consult with such persons as the Committee considers appropriate, including the Personal Injuries Assessment Board". Is there scope to consult as wide a range of stakeholders as possible, including those advocating for insurance reform?</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> In a similar vein to Deputy Ó Laoghaire, I seek to interrogate further the relationship that exists between the insurance company and the person purchasing a product, such as car or house insurance. A thorough solution has not been provided regarding the increase in premiums. We have not had complete transparency on the profits derived by insurance companies on this island. Those companies justify increases in premiums by stating that there has been an increase in claims and the settlement of claims. That needs to be further interrogated as well because it has a knock-on effect on the damages awarded. I would be grateful if the Minister responded to that in broad terms. My party welcomes the Bill. </p>

          <p eId="para_246">I also welcome this Bill, which has been an astonishingly long time in gestation. We could go back to the report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics which advised in December 2000 that a judicial council be established. We are going back two decades now. A problem with judges and the Courts Service is that movement is at a glacial pace. It is striking that the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Clarke, has asked for more resources at all levels of the Courts Service, including support for training judges. I have asked many questions over the years on road safety, specifically the lack of efficiency in producing records needed by An Garda Síochána and the Road Safety Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> It is amazing that this legislation has taken so long. The former Deputy and Minister, Mr. Dermot Ahern, published the first heads of a Bill in 2010, a decade ago and an interim Judicial Council has been in place since 2012. The aims set out by the judges were excellence in exercising judicial functions, the efficient use of resources and continuing education. That is an important point because it is astonishing that it took us until today to establish a system of lifelong education for judges. We could argue that Deputies and Ministers need the same type of continuous in-service training but it is especially important for judges as society changes. The draft Bill of 2010 included the first provisions on conduct and ethics.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> There has been no avenue of complaint for members of the public who might have been upset at lenient sentences or the general conduct of a few judges. Having said that, having a strong, independent and well-resourced Judiciary is a hallmark of democracy. I note that the measuring tape, as it were, for the judicial systems of all countries is the Bangalore principles of judicial conduct, which I have referred to previously. These were endorsed by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in 2003. The six core values that we expect in our Judiciary are independence, integrity, propriety, equality, competence and diligence and impartiality. These are the values that we need to see throughout the judicial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> As always our excellent Library and Research Service presented us with a very good background paper. I know the Bill has been amended since then. However, it is interesting to look at the Judges' Council of England and Wales. The 39-member Canadian council oversees about 1,100 judges and not all the members are judges, as proposed in the Bill before us. There is a council in New South Wales. Of course in the United States judges are elected. Some people might say that for us to become a true democracy we should have the election of some judges, which is characteristic of parts of the American system. The United States has had the judicial ethics model since 1924. Many would believe all the people should have a decision on such a senior role in the State. I have often felt the same about the Governor of the Central Bank, for example. In the past few days, four of the highest positions in the European Union were decided by backroom deals, as Matt Carthy, MEP, said yesterday. Perhaps there is scope for a more democratic system.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> The Bill proposes to repeal sections 10(4) and 36(2) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, which allowed the Chief Justice to investigate the administration of justice at the District Court level. The Court and Court Officers Act provides for funds for training of judges but did not lay out any fundamental improvements in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> We need the improvements proposed for council itself to address the complaints procedure, which takes up the bulk of the Bill, as well as the committees on conduct, training and so on. They are all very valuable and important improvements. Many people feel we need more fundamental reform. For example, why should professional guilds like Law Society of Ireland and the Honourable Society of King's Inns have a fundamental role in and control over education and apprenticeship into the legal system? As with most professions, why are the university law departments not at the centre of the training of not just lawyers generally, but also of judges? Why has that not been considered?</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> Judges need to representative of society. There tends to be a self-perpetuating legal elite. It can be seen with some families down through the decades. We need a broader base. I welcome that in recent years at long last gender balance has been achieved in the solicitors' profession. I would prefer a single profession of lawyer. Reform of the archaic English system of barristers and solicitors should be on the agenda of a future government.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> I have experience of being in court helping to support people with local issues. I have been very impressed with the judges in the Flood-Mahon and Moriarty tribunals, and the Priory Hall case. The judges' performance has been courageous and exemplary. It is often a pleasure to read the reports published by members of the Judiciary, such as the reports of the Morris and Charleton tribunals. Those reports, which were fluent and to the point, were very important for this House. We have gratitude for our Judiciary in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> I believe I already spoke to the Minister about correspondence I had with the Chief Justice regarding legislation. At one seminar the Chief Justice said we should try to avoid introducing legislation that will be litigious and to have a litigation stress test for all legislation. The Chief Justice, Mr. Frank Clarke, has proposed more regional development in the lower courts to allow specialisation by judges in addition to judicial training about the book of quantum, insurance costs and so on. The Chief Justice made an interesting point about records of evidence and the records of courts. He said that except in indictable cases, the records are generally not there. We also need to look at that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> I have one negative comment. I understand that the Minister, Deputy Ross, asked at a recent Cabinet meeting that judges should provide declarations of interest. In respect of Members of this House everybody knows what our business interests are, who are directors, landlords, farmers, teachers, etc. The Minister, Deputy Ross, made a reasonable proposal and it needs to be considered. We should know the interests of people carrying out such a fundamental role.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The filibuster being carried out in the other House on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is very disappointing. That reflects all the worst elements of an elite legal class determined to prevent encroachment on its sacred turf.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> People often talk about courts' sitting times and the length of the working day. Next week people will talk about Members of this House being off on our holidays. Of course, we will be going off to intense constituency work. Mr. Ahern used to engage in a two-month-long door-to-door campaign in Dublin Central. We will all be out and about because we know a general election is not too far away. We always would be anyway because it gives us a chance to do what we regard as real representative work outside the Chamber. The Chief Justice has commented on the supports judges have. Additional resources are important. The closure of the courts system in August and September is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> With those caveats, I welcome the Bill and I commend the work the Minister and his colleagues have done in finally bringing the Bill before the House. It represents a good step forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">Tús maith, leath na hoibre. I am not withdrawing anything. If the Minister wants to play it that way, I can play it to. It would suit the Minister better to give us some sense of security in Tipperary and not to have people sleepless in their homes and afraid of their lives. They cannot go to bed and have to lock the doors with gangsters marauding around with free rein. We do not have gardaí or anybody else to support us. I can drop my script if the Minister likes. When they come before the courts they get free legal aid - 100 times some of them - and no sentences. It is a laughing stock. Anyone going into courts in Tipperary or anywhere else any day of the week will see the carry-on. They can be seen scoffing and laughing at the gardaí. It is easy for the Minister to be laughing and commenting about me when I say a word. It is a jungle out there. There is a free rein in the jungle for the marauding gangsters and vagabonds who want to terrorise our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Here we are 20 years later trying to change legislation and, as Deputy O'Callaghan, said we only have an hour or two in the final days before the summer recess. It is rushed and not properly debated. Rushed legislation is bad legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The Minister must give protection to the people of Tipperary that Deputy Cahill, I and others represent. They are frightened out of their wits. They have met the Minister and his predecessors, begging to be respected. They are entitled to live with some modicum of dignity, peace and happiness in their own homes. They are paying their taxes and working hard from dawn to dusk, whether they be farmers, local authority workers, doctors, solicitors, nurses or anything else. They are living in fear that their houses will be broken into at 3 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I support the Garda, I am attending a care in the community function tonight and I salute the Garda. I salute the gardaí in Cahir and Cork who recovered a horse in Cork yesterday that was stolen from Cahir at the weekend. That horse was used by a family for therapeutic measures and it was stolen but thanks be to God the Garda did great work on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> If only the Garda had enough members and if there were enough gardaí in Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir we would not have the epidemic that is happening there. We will be like Drogheda and Longford. The Minister rubs his hand in glee as if he did not know there were not a shortage of gardaí. There is not a garda in those places. They have three, four or five gardaí on a unit in Clonmel. It is the biggest inland town in the country and those Garda units have to cover the town of Carrick-on-Suir and all the villages in the area as well. It is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> I wish them well in Kilkenny and the chief superintendent down there is a good Tipperary man, Dominic Hayes, and they have 12 on every unit. Why are we discriminated against in Tipperary? We fought for Irish freedom. The first shots in the War of Independence were fired in Tipperary and here we are back to being treated like this. We have to mind ourselves. Will we have to arm ourselves and defend ourselves? That is what it is coming to under the Minister's watch and under the watch of previous Ministers for Justice and Equality. I do not have any animosity against the Minister but the people deserve respect and when vagabonds are brought to court it is a jungle because they make a joke of it, they are sneering at the judges and they are given free legal aid willy-nilly. They can get free legal aid 100 times over and the people who are being robbed and attacked pay for that with their taxes. Then they go into the luxury of jails that are like hotels to learn more about crime before they come out again. They are starting as young as eight and ten years old now in the drug cartel in Clonmel delivering the drugs and they have immunity because they are children. It is shocking. The Government knows who is doing it and the Garda knows who is doing it. Lives are being lost to suicide and everything else but the Government does not care. Members of the Government laugh at me instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The Bill seeks to establish a judicial council, which will be independent in the performance of its functions and will promote and maintain excellence and high standards of conduct for judges. That is badly wanted. Like Deputy O'Callaghan and others, I compliment the vast majority of judges who do an excellent job but they need upskilling and reskilling. The Bill will also provide means of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct and in this context a judicial conduct committee, which at long last will have lay representation, will be established. Furthermore, it will facilitate the ongoing support and education of judges through a judicial studies committee and through the establishment of judicial support committees. That is badly needed, as other Members have alluded to, because we cannot just appoint them as judges and then leave them off to paddle their own canoes. They need upskilling, reskilling and continuous education and Deputy O'Dea and others have been calling for that for years. The criminals have all the education and all the tools of the trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> An important point is that we know that the Council of Europe's anti-corruption monitoring body, group of states against corruption, GRECO, published a compliance report on Ireland in these matters in 2017. It concerns Ireland's compliance with a 2014 evaluation report on corruption prevention in respect of Members of the Parliament, judges and prosecutors. The original evaluation report contained 11 recommendations, not 100. If we were carrying out the evaluation we would have 100 recommendations and we would not implement any of them but this came from Europe. The 2017 compliance report found that Ireland had fully implemented only three of the recommendations and had only partly implemented a further three recommendations. The Government only went half way with the 11 recommendations, which is shameful. GRECO concluded that Ireland's low level of compliance with the recommendations was "globally unsatisfactory." Those are not my words, they are the words of GRECO.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> That being said, GRECO also noted with some concern the suggested lay majority of an appointments commission for the Judiciary included in the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017. While it accepted that the Bill is subject to much debate, it questioned whether it is in line with European standards aimed at securing judicial independence in respect of the appointment and promotion of judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Further concerns were also noted at the time by the Minister on the original form of the Bill. The Minister noted two matters in particular, namely the need for the so called secrecy provision in the Bill to be removed and the need to establish a public register of financial interests for members of the Judiciary. Why can we not have that? We must have that because I have seen cases and I have been in the Four Courts when people have made allegations against judges for their involvement with banks and they are hearing cases those banks are involved in. It should not be happening. There should be no ifs, buts or ands. We should know if an eminent justice has investments in a financial institution and he or she would then have to recuse him or herself from hearing the case. It leads to rumours and potentially to falsehoods being perpetrated if we do not know, so there should be a clear register so that we know what is what and who is who. As I said, the Minister noted two matters in particular, namely the need for the so-called secrecy provision in the Bill to be removed and the need to establish a public register of financial interests for members of the Judiciary. At the time, the Minister said on the secrecy provisions that: "It is fair to say that some of the provisions intended to protect the confidentiality of the complaints process do not sit well with current understandings of accountability or transparency." He also said that he was considering amendments which might be made to these provisions. Perhaps the Minister can provide an update on these matters for those of us who did not have the pleasure he had in sitting through the endless hours of Seanad debate on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> On a separate matter, when the Minister of State at the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy D'Arcy appeared before the Seanad at the end of June, he highlighted a key amendment, namely amendment No. 21. As I understand it, following the model related to both the sentencing information and guidelines committee and the judicial conduct committee, provision is also being made for the committee to prepare draft personal injuries guidelines and submit them for review by the board of the judicial council. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, said the amendment specifies that the first draft of the guidelines must be submitted to the board no later than 12 months after the establishment of the committee. To assist it in carrying out its functions, the committee will have broad powers to obtain any information it might need. This is very much to be welcomed. It may also consult appropriate persons and bodies, including the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and conduct research into the level of damages awarded by the courts in the State and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> I do not want to delay the Bill unduly but it is bananas out there and other Deputies have alluded to this. We see the profits the insurance companies are making. They tell us the claims are driving up premiums but we see the huge percentage profits they have made in recent years. It is time we grasped the nettle and it is time we took a leaf out of the book of our old colonial power across the pond. We can see that they have fixed penalties and fixed awards for certain matters. What is going on here is nonsense. It is the same with free legal aid. We should have a system where it is two strikes or three strikes and a person is out. We see criminals with previous convictions who have served prison sentences for the most heinous of crimes getting free legal aid 68, 90 or 103 times. It is farcical. It would not happen in the real jungle so we have to deal with that and protect our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Under the amendment, the judicial conduct committee is also mandated to prepare material for inclusion in the annual report of the judicial council on its activities. These amendments were very welcome. Indeed any measure that strengthens the capacity of the Judiciary to deal more effectively with scurrilous or unfounded personal injuries claims is to be welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">We will have an opportunity later in the afternoon to revert to some of the important points that have been raised by Members but in the meantime I merely wish to acknowledge the contribution of Deputies to this debate on Second Stage so far. The extent of participation and the diverse views offered demonstrate to me the importance of the issue and underline the concerns Members have on a range of issues pertaining to the Judiciary, to the Bill and to the need for a Judiciary which at all times adheres to the highest standards of probity and which at all times retains the trust and confidence of the public at large, which is served by judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Judges have a vital role to play in our society and when our citizens come before the courts they have a legitimate right to expect that the highest standards of integrity, independence and impartiality will at all times prevail. The relationship we have with our judges as a society is complex, as it is an institution that derives strength from the confidence we repose in it to act at all times without fear or favour. In turn, we feel secure in the knowledge that we can trust judges to adhere to the highest possible standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> A number of points were raised in the course of the debate. We all acknowledge that judicial independence is recognised as being a core value within our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">This Bill will foster that culture of independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> A number of Deputies referred to resources. I agree with Deputies Broughan and O'Callaghan that this is an issue that requires a greater level of consideration than perhaps has been given to date. I also agree with them regarding the need for a complaints regime of the kind provided for under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Deputy Sherlock referred to section 18 and the need for consultation. This is an issue to which we will revert on Committee and Remaining Stages this afternoon. I very much agree with the Deputy's comments. The wording of the section should meet his concerns. I very much welcome the remarks of Deputy Ó Laoghaire on sentencing.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">The Minister will agree that there could not be a worse time to conclude the Mercosur deal than today. There could not be a worse time from the point of view of our climate. The Oireachtas has declared a climate emergency - a declaration that is being repeated all over the world - and there is an awareness now of how finite our time on this planet is. The conclusion of this deal could not come at a worse time for the beef or poultry sectors. The latter have suffered significant price reductions and difficulties with factories. The Government is putting its head in the sand while these sectors are being decimated and hoping it will all go away. Despite this, the EU Commission has decided to conclude a deal. The deal in question has been has been 20 years in the making, it goes against all of the principles, beliefs and declarations relating to climate change, it will sound the death knell for Irish beef and severely damage the Irish poultry sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Then there is the background of a hard Brexit. We have discussed the ins and outs of the very particular impact the latter will have on this island. What is agreed is that no matter what happens with Brexit, it will bad for our economy and, in particular, our beef producers. Mercosur, Brexit and the climate emergency are leading to a disaster that is being underpinned by the agreement to which I refer, to which the European Commission has signed up and in respect of which there have, depending on the day of the week or the hour of the day, been incredibly mixed signals coming from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> This agreement was signed up to without any environmental analysis. In an article in today's edition of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, Commissioner Hogan indicates that every country should carry out its own environmental analysis. What land is he living in? He is certainly not showing any awareness of where this planet is at if that is his attitude. When replying to questions on the matter from Deputy Micheál Martin on Tuesday last, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton stated, "This trade deal has compliance with the Paris Agreement at its heart. If there is not compliance with the Paris Agreement, there is no deal." I can tell the Minister opposite, Deputy Regina Doherty, that there is not compliance with the Paris Agreement because the EU is planning to reward governments, including that in Brazil, which is clearing rainforests at a rate of knots in order to make room for cattle which will be sold as part of this deal. Every 15 seconds, an area of rain forest the size of a football pitch is cleared. Since President Bolsonaro took office, the level of deforestation has accelerated. The EU Commission is saying, "Go ahead," and giving him a clap on the back. Where is the Paris Agreement in that context? Instead, what we got all week were different messages. It seems that the Government is engaging in media management in order to try to manage its own backbenchers who have suddenly woken up to the implications of this deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> As both a Minister and a representative for Meath, Deputy Regina Doherty should be aware of the challenge facing our beef and poultry sectors. As a young Minister, she should be aware of where we stand in the context of the climate emergency. In order to get some idea as to where matters stand, from a Government perspective, can she outline her view on the agreement? Should the Mercosur agreement be passed and should the Government endorse it? Is the Minister on team Creed, the leader of which is going to take the agreement apart? Is she a member of team Humphreys, the leader of which thinks the agreement is good and that it will present many opportunities? Is she standing with the beef and poultry farmers? Is she standing with the climate against the might of South American climate deniers? Will the Government ratify or reject the Mercosur deal?</p>

          <p eId="para_288">As a young Minister, I am on team Ireland, as are the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton. I expect all Members of this House and of the Seanad are also on that team.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> It is fully acknowledged that having a balanced international trade deal is important for our economy, including our agriculture sector. There is no point in having a benefit for one part of the economy and not having an equal benefit for another. That is why the agreement, which includes a significant tariff rate quota that will allow beef imports from Mercosur countries, is a disappointment to every one of us. That is why we have been working for the past number of years to bring it from where it was to where it is now. As the Deputy will agree, however, there is still a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> We worked hard with our colleagues in Europe to ensure that we will try to mitigate the impacts of what is on the table today. The agreement does not only have negative connotations for Ireland and Ireland's beef sector, it has those for other EU countries and some others who have aligned with the EU. While it is disappointing, the amount of time that it has taken for us to get where we are shows, in part, our efforts to try to mitigate what was originally a 300,000 tonne quota. That quota has now been significantly reduced. The Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Creed, Commissioner Hogan and others who have expressed their views, including the Deputy - I genuinely believe we are all on team Ireland here and on the same side - need to work together. My party and the Deputy's party need to use their connections in Europe to ensure that we get both a better result and better a transposition of what is a headline agreement into the legal text. That includes carbon-proofing the production methods used by all of those who are operating on a level playing field. It also includes taking cognisance of the governance in our beef and poultry sectors which is second to none. It further includes the quality and the delivery of the standards with which we have become synonymous internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> What is agreed today is not satisfactory from our perspective. Equally, it is not satisfactory from the perspective of others across Europe. The Taoiseach was fairly clear yesterday and the day before when he stated that we will work over the next couple of years with the influence that we have collegially with other countries and also with our Commissioner - he has done a tremendous amount of work to reduce the impact in recent years but the job is not done yet - to ensure that we continue to reduce the impact on our beef and poultry sectors. The agreement is currently a headline document and it will take at least two years - if the 20 years it has taken to get to where we are today are anything to go by, it could effectively take longer - for us to agree and align with those who are in similar positions to ourselves in order to ensure that we get a level playing field in respect of governance, carbon production and quality with regard to the sectors concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> There is no disjointedness and there is no spin. I genuinely believe that all politicians in this House should be on team Ireland and that we all should be working for the best outcome for our beef sector, but also for all of the other sectors that will benefit from the positive parts of Mercosur.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">Everybody is on team Ireland. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is on team Ireland but he fell asleep when he was on the pitch. Is Commissioner Hogan on team Ireland? The Commissioner is the cheerleader for this deal but I have noticed that there are more Fine Gael tanks being placed on his lawn than we will see in Washington later today. Commissioner Hogan is going to become the Government's scapegoat for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Our beef farmers, poultry farmers and pig farmers are on team Ireland but they are not feeling the team spirit at this stage because they have been thrown to the wolves. So many people are on team Ireland in terms of climate but they see the Government acquiescing to a deal that rewards climate change deniers, those who destroy rainforests and people who adhere to low standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> I agree that team Ireland has the highest possible standards. Our beef, our poultry and our pigmeat are world class because of those standards, which cost money and make our products slightly more expensive compared with those of countries that do not have standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">By acquiescing to this deal, we are rewarding the absence of standards. We are rewarding climate change deniers and abandoning our core agricultural industry. Farmers are not really feeling part of the team at the moment. Team Ireland is a lovely concept but those left on the substitutes' bench or indeed outside the stadium are not part of the team.

The transposing of this headline agreement into a legal text will take place over the next number of years. It will be absolutely crucial that we represent the best interests of the beef industry in this country, as this Government and the ones that went before it have always done. That is why we should be on team Ireland. This is not about Fianna Fáil against Fine Gael against Sinn Féin. We all should want the best outcomes for all of the industries we represent. Beef is an incredibly important industry here but there are also beneficiaries of this deal. We need to reduce the difficulties and negatives in the deal for our beef and poultry industries while maintaining all of the positives for our drinks, chemicals and pharmaceutical industries. There is a fine balance to be played over the next few years by us and our skilled negotiating team in Europe, which includes Commissioner Hogan, to ensure that the final legal agreement hits the mark and provides positives for every industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_302">Speaking on "Morning Ireland" this morning, the former head of the Army Ranger Wing, Commandant Cathal Berry, said that the purported pay package for members of the Defence Forces to be announced today amounts to "too little, too late". It is hard to disagree. The Minister talked about team Ireland. These are people who put their lives on the line for team Ireland. He said that what is on offer will work out at just €1 a day before tax for many soldiers and that "this is the kind of money you would give a child to get sweets and that is what the Government thinks of the Defence Forces." Again, it is hard to disagree. There is a serious recruitment and retention crisis in the Defence Forces, as there is in some areas in our public services on the front line. Some 3,700 personnel left the Defence Forces over the last number of years. The average turnover is currently 9%. In the Naval Service it is 14%. These people are voting with their feet. They do so because of the very low levels of pay that they receive. They pay mortgages and rent. Like everybody else, they are caught with the high cost of living, childcare, sending children back to school and all of the costs that families have to bear. They do so on very low and unsustainable levels of pay. Many soldiers see a long-term career in the Defence Forces as unsustainable and unviable. Those are the words they use. That is why for the sake of their families they are unfortunately leaving in their droves. Defence Forces personnel are among the worst paid workers in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> This is relevant to the Minister's portfolio. There are Defence Forces families that are reliant on the working family payment. The fact that many families cannot make ends meet means they are dependent on welfare transfers simply to get by. Imagine people who work in the public service not being paid a living wage. Imagine people who put their lives on the line and who are the front line for this State getting welfare transfers because the State will not pay them what they are due. They legitimately ask for a pay increase to compensate, in the first instance, what was taken from them when FEMPI cuts were imposed on them by others in this House. Pay was unilaterally taken from them by previous Governments and all they are looking for is justice and fair work. They are also looking to be represented by a trade union or representative body. We hear from the Cabinet meeting that there will be some movement in the area of pay and allowances which, as the Defence Forces themselves are saying, it is too little, too late. Some form of yellow-pack collective bargaining and trade union membership has also been proposed. Does the Minister accept the words of Commandant Berry when he says this is too little, too late? Does she accept that an awful lot more needs to be done to ensure that these workers are paid a fair wage? Does she accept that it is unacceptable that welfare transfers are being paid to these workers? Will she commit to full collective bargaining rights for all members of our Defence Forces?</p>

          <p eId="para_304">I thank the Deputy for his question, which is very topical as the Cabinet is currently meeting to address this issue. The report that was prepared by the independent Public Service Pay Commission is either being discussed or has been approved by Cabinet at this stage and will be published later by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The report of the independent commission is the outcome of the Government's recognition of the challenges surrounding recruitment and pay issues in the Defence Forces. It is not an abstract thing. It was prioritised over other groups in the Public Sector Pay Commission in the first instance because of how seriously the Government takes its commitment to the people who serve us on a daily basis. The recommendations will be published later on. I hope they will go a long way to addressing some of the concerns the Deputy has raised, those raised by Mr. Berry this morning and other representations that have been made. Families have come to each of us in recent months expressing their concerns and difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">The problem is that we have already seen this. It has been leaked. We are reading it in the papers. We have a fair sense of what is being proposed and discussed at Cabinet. We have very senior current and former members of the Defence Forces saying it is not enough. These are really genuine concerns that members of the Defence Forces have. It is soul-destroying for someone doing a job as important as being in the Naval Service or the Army or any of the Defence Forces not to be able to pay the bills and not to have even a living wage. Yesterday, the technical group that calculates the living wage produced an increased figure. Again yesterday in this House, the Taoiseach turned his face against introducing a living wage, even in the public sector. He is still saying to these workers that he is not prepared to pay them what is necessary to put food on the table, pay their rent or mortgage, pay for their children going to school or meet the cost of living. It is very clear that because of this, members of the Defence Forces are leaving in their droves. That is the message the Government is giving them. It is too little, too late and an awful lot more needs to be done. I am asking the Minister again if she will commit to ensuring that members of the Defence Forces get the just pay increases they need, full restoration of all cuts that were taken and sustainable wages. The Minister did not answer the question in respect of full collective bargaining rights. They have the same right as anybody else to be represented in terms of their working conditions.</p>

All I can say is that I have the authority to represent a Government that has a commitment to our Defence Forces and that is why the Public Service Pay Commission sought to address this issue as a priority. That is why the range of allowances, including the military service allowance, security day allowance, patrol duty allowance, Army Ranger Wing allowance and bomb disposal team allowance, as well as the return of premium rates for the weekends, have all been under consideration by the commission and will be presented in a document this afternoon for our Defence Forces to appraise and decide whether they will accept it.

          <p eId="para_317">I wish to return to the widely leaked announcement, confirmed by the Minister, that the Government is to sign off on €10 million of extra allowances for the Defence Forces today, or so we are led to believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">This follows on from a report by the Public Service Pay Commission into the recruitment and retention crisis that we all acknowledge exists in our Defence Forces. There was, however, a clear flaw in the remit given to the Public Service Pay Commission for the work it was set in this regard. The commission was not permitted to examine the issue of core pay. A pay commission was prohibited from examining core pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Ireland is now in a situation where the economy has recovered, the cost of living is going up and there is a widespread view across the House - as the Minister has acknowledged - and across the country, that the Defence Forces have been left behind and need a particular focus and an upgrade in pay and conditions. In these exceptional circumstances why did the Government not include in the terms of reference of the Public Service Pay Commission the ability to look at the core pay of the Defence Forces? Every national pay agreement - two of which I was involved in - is held together with any number of sub-agreements and special arrangements. Given the scale of the crisis in the Defence Forces there is no reason this could not have been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> It is reported there would be a 10% increase in the military services allowances but what does this mean in real terms? It means an extra payment resulting in an increase of between €4.20 and €12.30 per week. I do not believe the Government seriously thinks this would make an impact on the requirements for our Defence Forces' men and women. Having road tested the response in the media for the last week, and finding it to be seriously inadequate, apparently the Government has made one last minute adjustment by proposing another review to be announced this afternoon. This time it is for the 2,500 members of the Defence Forces who are specialists. This is simply a case of the issue that needs to be addressed being pushed down the road. I imagine the intention is to probably kick it beyond the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> What does the Minister have to say to the thousands of men and women in our Defence Forces who need their pay increased today? Why did the Government not include an examination of core pay - which is the nub of the issue - in the review's terms of reference, a review the Government has vaunted every time the matter was raised in this House in the last months?</p>

          <p eId="para_329">The Public Service Pay Commission was challenged with addressing the issues we have around recruitment and retention. This is the report its has come up with today that was charged with looking specifically at the issues we have, which are well documented, around the Permanent Defence Force and the Naval Service recruitment and retention issues. The report, which will be issued this afternoon, is the commission's suggestions for addressing that. The Deputy can reject them if he wants to but I believe it is more important that our Permanent Defence Force and Naval Service will consider there are items in the report that are enough satisfy them at this stage, while we then move on to the next section of the public service pay agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">The truth of the matter is that the issue of core pay was excluded from the review and it is not the independent review of the commission. The Public Service Pay Commission has said that its hands were tied behind its back because the terms of reference precluded it from looking at the issue of core pay. The Minister is aware that there is any amount of wriggle room available in these agreements. The Government found it for the nurses - rightly so - and found it for the Garda when it was put under pressure. Because the Government knows the Defence Forces cannot strike, its members are to be treated differently and they are not to have the increase in their actual pay to which everyone in this House and everybody in the trade union movement would agree they are entitled. I ask the Minister to not hide behind the review of the pay commission when it was the Government that preset the terms and the outcome by not allowing the commission to look at the issue of core pay. Will the Government now acknowledge that what it is offering will not be adequate to meet the legitimate demands of our Defence Forces' men and women? Will it agree to have a speedy review of core pay now and not just for a subset of the Army, who are the 2,500 specialists, but for all 8,500 men and women who serve our nation with such distinction?</p>

          <p eId="para_339">I would like to raise the issue of online safety for children in Ireland. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will be aware that cyberbullying and access to graphic adult material online such as pornography and violence is increasing in Ireland at an alarming rate. I refer to the availability of negative and exploitative online material to children from the youngest age through all the devices that are available such as mobile phones, tablets and gaming apps The emotional and mental anxiety experienced by children and young adults is at epidemic proportions with increased levels of self-harming among teenagers as a result of online peer pressure. On occasion this tragically results in victims taking their own lives. We are failing our young people by not taking the practical steps in implementing a system which educates Irish children in positive online behaviour. According to a recent OECD report Irish 15 year olds report incidents of cyberbullying at comparatively high rates and are more likely to use the Internet for extreme use by accessing harmful and damaging material.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Children need a basic building block, a skill set that will serve them in good stead for lifelong engagement with the Internet that will ensure that they can cope on the occasions when the cyber wolf comes to the door. The skill set needs to include discernment; critical thinking; empathy; and the ability to cope when presented with uncomfortable behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> Technology is required that develops these relevant and age appropriate attitudes and strategies in a supervised, safe and controlled cyber environment. Technology is the pen and paper of our time and it is the means by which our children and young adults communicate today. The problem with the Internet and social networks is that we have never been taught how to use it. The Internet and social networks developed organically on a global scale without any conditions, rules or boundaries as to what is permissible behaviour. It was left up to humankind to police ourselves and as a result bad behaviour was given as equal an opportunity to flourish as good behaviour. As there are no rules and no repercussions, and because an individual is anonymous behind a computer screen he or she can inflict a lot of damage. This has to stop and it begins with practical education from the earliest age.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"><i>CyberSmarties.com</i>, an international award-winning company based in Limerick, has had detailed discussions with officials from the Department of Education and Skills, the Garda authorities and Opposition Deputies. CyberSmarties is a safe social network for children aged seven to 12 years old and has been operating since 2015. More than 80,000 primary school children use the application and it operates in and out of school. It is a fully monitored, locked down social network for children, where no adults have access to the website. It is the first social network to authenticate a child as a real child through their schools. CyberSmarties' research has been used internationally and is recognised as the leading expert in child-safe social networks. CyberSmarties has worked closely with the national protection services within An Garda Síochána and is recognised by them. I ask the Minister to ensure that the CyberSmarties system is rolled out to our primary schools under the auspices of the Department of Education and Skills. </p>

          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_343">It is a topical issue and I thank the Deputy for raising it. I am the mother of four teenagers who have grown up knowing nothing else except technology in their hands. I am also the proud parent of two children who have used technology as part of their educational offering from our local school. They have been very successful and have had a good experience with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> The Deputy is correct. There is not a mam or dad, or probably any adult, who is not concerned about the amount of time our children spend online but, more important, about the material they can potentially access, or the people who have access to our vulnerable children. Not only do we need to take it very seriously as parents - it is challenging and difficult, and I am not saying it is an easy thing to do - but the Government also has to take the health and safety of all of our children extremely seriously, and that is particularly true in the online environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, will bring forward the online safety Bill in the autumn. We propose that, hopefully, this will happen with everybody's input, because it will have to go to pre-legislative scrutiny following the public consultation that has taken place over the past couple of months. We are going to ask all web providers to operate under a new safety code. There will be a clear expectation that they have to take responsibility and measured steps to ensure that children and young, vulnerable adults are safe online. We have to absolutely ban and outlaw cyberbullying material that is designed - it is totally mad to think about this - to encourage children to try to be bulimic or try to be anorexic, or to teach them how to self-harm and how to do damage to themselves. I do not understand a person who would create content like that but our children are getting access to that kind of content just by being available to YouTube, Google and all of the other apps that they enjoy using socially with their friends. The laws of the land have to ensure that not only are there rules, but that they are enforced. The new online safety Bill and a new online safety commissioner will play a pivotal role and we, as a House, should make sure we get that legislation drafted and passed as soon as we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> Parents have a huge responsibility at home but schools and teachers also have a huge responsibility, not only to make sure there is a digital strategy and a safety strategy in every school, but also to ensure that we teach our kids, in this new environment, to recognise what is good or to recognise somebody who is out to do them harm, because most of our children are young and naive, and they believe what they are told and never assume it is a bad thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I have no knowledge of the company, CyberSmarties, to which the Deputy referred. I checked in the Department and I know it has a hugely valuable reputation. It has had enormous interaction and I suggest that it needs to have more. If it is doing work with An Garda Síochána, there is nothing that we cannot learn in regard to best practice from an international perspective. We all want the same thing, which is for our children to enjoy the new world of technology but to get the best out of it, and for us to protect them as a State, as parents and as school educators from the worst aspects of this. </p>

          <p eId="para_348">Everybody recognises the dangers and the problems but we need to do something about it. This company, which is recognised internationally, has been working with the Department of Education and Skills. Many of us did not grow up in the digital age. I believe practical Internet education is the very same as driving lessons for a young person who is going to drive a car or stabilisers for a bicycle, and is essential to protect children online. The CyberSmarties technology is a practical educational platform, which has a forward-thinking approach to online safety. It has been introduced to the Department, and the Garda authorities are on board. I ask the Minister to encourage her Government colleagues to implement this technology in all of our primary schools as a matter of priority. I hope this could become the subject of discussions on the forthcoming budget between the Departments of Education and Skills and Finance to make sure this technology, which has been proven to work, can be available to our young people. The parents of 80,000 children are paying for this online. They find it helpful and useful and it gives them peace of mind. Parents are living a nightmare due to worry about what their children are accessing online. We need to assist them and support them, and we can do it through our primary schools.</p>

          <p eId="para_349">I hear the Deputy loud and clear. If there is any agency or organisation that has developed technology that will assist us in the Webwise programme that is delivered to all schools, then, obviously, we have to listen to it. Perhaps this should not be exclusive and I do not want to give the Deputy the impression that there are not other people available. If this company is successful and established, and is doing exactly what parents and educators want, which is to ensure we guard our children, we certainly have to learn with it and co-operate with it. I can certainly re-engage and talk to my colleagues, and that is no problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> We need to learn from the technology that is available from multiple platforms. The Webwise programme within our schools needs not only to be advanced at the speed the technology is improving and increasing, but it has to be consistent in every school in every county. Each of our schools is run by a board of management and those boards of management are responsible for devising policies, including digital strategies, bullying strategies and self-care strategies. There has to be consistency on this. We need to ensure that what happens in Donegal happens in Dublin and Dunboyne as well. On that basis, when we establish the online safety rules and their governance and enforcement in the legislation this year, it has to feed into a digital strategy in all of our primary and secondary schools. </p>

          <p eId="para_355">One issue the Government is not on the same page on is the Mercosur trade deal. We have had different Ministers say different things over the past number of days. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and others have, quite rightly, outlined how devastating this will be for the beef sector, and other Ministers have talked up the deal. Commissioner Hogan told us we need to look at this in the round and look at this on balance. The reality is this is a bad deal for Ireland. What Ireland needs is a clear unified line from the Government, wearing the green jersey, making sure that Irish interests are protected and making sure there is a clear, unambiguous, consistent, unified position coming from the Government and, indeed, from across this House, that this deal is not in our interests. That very sharp message has to go back to the European Commission because this is devastating for beef farmers and many other farmers right across the State, including in my own region in the south east, where we have a strong agrifood sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">One would be at risk of thinking that this was a trade deal just about beef. The Deputy can suggest there are inconsistencies, with some people saying there are good parts of the deal for Ireland, specifically for the drinks, chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, and others saying there are less good parts, particularly for the beef and poultry industries. That is not inconsistency; that is stating the obvious. This is an enormous trade deal that has major positives for Ireland but also has a very obvious downside for us. The consistent message from Government - from all of us, regardless of when anyone speaks to us or what we say - is that we welcome the good bits and the positives, and we are going to make sure that we negate the bad bits over the next couple of years, while we take the headline agreement and turn it into a legal agreement. We are going to do that in a number of ways and, in particular, to continue doing what we have done with Commissioner Hogan over the past number of years, which is to try to mitigate against the value of the tonnage that is included in the deal, but also to forge alliances with like-minded member states that equally have suffered a negative impact, particularly in the beef and poultry sectors, to ensure our voices are heard and that we mitigate the bad parts of this deal.</p>

The difficulty is that the HSE refuses to recognise that union. To be fair to the Minister, he asked his officials to engage with HSE management to explore how this issue can be resolved before we get to the strikes on 19 and 20 July. Those discussions have taken place. Obviously, a resolution has not been found because it if had we would not be having this conversation.

          <p eId="para_384">I want to ask the Minister, Deputy Doherty, whether or not she and other members of the Government approve of a new co-living space in the Dún Laoghaire area which is advertised at €1,200 to €1,500 per month and is called The Orphanage. The marketing blurb calls on people to make it their "adopted home". This Government is presiding over 3,750 children in homelessness. They have no home to go to, whether in an orphanage or anywhere else. Will the Government, which has encouraged the idea of co-living - the monstrous idea of up to 42 adults sharing a kitchen space though not in this luxury development - ask the developers to change the name of the development in Dún Laoghaire, which is a disgrace in light of the tens of thousand of people in Ireland who were in institutions?</p>

It states the Government will "develop a new Integrated Framework for Social Inclusion [outlining] measures to help eliminate any persisting discrimination on grounds of gender, age... race [or] religion." Unfortunately, no such tolerance or respect was shown for the Catholic religion in the Dáil yesterday when the Taoiseach likened the leader of Fianna Fáil to a parish priest telling us from the altar how to avoid sin while secretly going behind the altar and engaging in any amount of sin himself. What a complete disrespect for one religion. Why should my religion be treated like this in the national Parliament? It is simply unacceptable to me. He denigrates the entire Catholic religion. I think today of Fr. Peter McVerry and Brother Kevin of the Capuchins, who are feeding and housing the poor and homeless people of Ireland, a job the Government should be doing.

This 29 year old man has been suffering serious health issues since 2015. He lost his sight in 2016 and then suffered from a tumour in August of last year. He has been in University Hospital Cork permanently since December. Some 14 weeks ago, he was told that he was fit for discharge to move to the next stage of his recovery in residential rehabilitation services. Unfortunately, no place has been found for him in the intervening period. We are told that the budget is in place from the HSE to do it. The 12-month cost of his package is €153,000.

Specific areas such as Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle and Tralee have significant tourism pressures and these rents are spiralling out of control. Young local couples find it almost impossible to get any level of rent certainty.

The local authority would certainly be involved in kicking off that process in any specific town or village. I will certainly bring it to the attention of our officials and the Residential Tenancies Board but the decision-making is for the Residential Tenancies Board in conjunction with local authorities. It is based on various rent increases over the past year. I will ask for it to be looked at but the process does not involve ministerial intervention.</p>

As part of that, there was supposed to be an annual support waiver of €75 for people who have lifetime or medical incontinence. That was due to be rolled out by late 2017. I do not think it went far enough. It should have been expanded to people in receipt of the working family payment, the one-parent family payment, etc. I raised the issue with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, last December. He stated that there have been problems rolling that out and that he was in discussions with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Here we are two years later and this has still not been introduced. Some of the most needy people in the State are being penalised with this charge. The waiver has not been introduced.

A scheme does not exist today that exactly mirrors the people who need to receive this money. I cannot share data with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. It cannot establish who the people are. We are trying our level best to make sure that the money gets to the people who need it but it is not as easy as identifying what scheme those people exist on because they exist across multiple schemes. We will keep going until we find a means and it will be backdated, so the money is not going anywhere.</p>

The first was to press the pause button on the downgrading of the emergency department at the hospital and the other was to immediately put in place a consultation process. The Dáil will rise next week but 20 months later the facilitator has not been appointed. Difficulties arise at the hospital because of the uncertainty, one of which is recruitment and retention of staff. There is an over-reliance on agency staff.</p>

Does the Minister agree that citizens are becoming more assertive about their rights and entitlements, no more so than in respect of education? Parents are now raising concerns regarding school governance, grievance procedures and voluntary financial contributions, among others. They expect openness, transparency and accountability in respect of all aspects of the day-to-day functioning of schools. The Minister for Education and Skills has stated that schools must be accountable to parents and that we need a greater level of communication, engagement and transparency in how schools serve their communities. When can we expect the publication of the education (parent and student charter) Bill 2019?</p>

I wish to raise the issue of a 50-year old man with muscular dystrophy who was admitted to hospital on 3 March last as he was seriously ill. He suffered a stroke on 9 March while in hospital and after staying in the acute stroke unit in Louth County Hospital for some time, his HSE social worker informed him that a home care package was being arranged to enable him to go home and that it would take just a couple of weeks. He was then sent to a step-down facility in the Louth County Hospital and he is still there almost seven weeks later. This 50-year old man is in a totally unsuitable environment for his needs. He has picked up several hospital infections, not to mention his fragile state of mind as he is so long in that environment. His family has repeatedly asked when they can take their son home, to be told they cannot.</p>

This week's Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, data prove that the rent pressure zones, RPZs, are not working. We now have nine quarters of data that show that the 4% cap in Dublin has not tempered rents in any way whatsoever. We had a 7.7% increase this quarter. In quarter 1 of 2018 it was 8.7% and in the previous year it was 8.5%. Average rents in Dublin are €1,600 a month. It is now €3,000 more a year for the average renter in Dublin than it was when the rent pressure zones were introduced. Given the abject failure of the RPZs, will the Minister commit to using the forthcoming housing and residential tenancies Bill to give renters some real relief, both for those struggling with high rents and those locked out of the private rental sector?</p>

We have had many problems with JobPath, which I will not get into as I wish to raise a specific issue relating to JobPath. A man in my constituency works for a company that put its workers on a three-day week when the hard times came. It did not sack them but tried to work with them. He is continually being sent to JobPath because he is only working three days a week. The rules say that one must work for more than 30 hours a week to avoid that. Some leniency must be allowed in such a situation. This man has worked for the company for 28 years. If he got a job somewhere else he would lose a redundancy package to which he would be entitled in the not-too-distant future. It does not make sense for him to look for a job somewhere else, yet he is continually called back to JobPath. Could the Minister consider introducing some flexibility and reduce the timeframe from 30 hours a week, possibly down to 25 hours a week as it would suit many people?</p>

When he went to JobPath he was told to go to the social welfare office but when he went to the social welfare office he was told he must go to JobPath. As a result, he has lost three of four jobs in recent weeks. Who is responsible for getting a safe pass certificate? Does JobPath pay for it or does the social welfare office pay for it?</p>

Part of our activation is to use training to put people through whatever measures will help them to get them closer to the marketplace. Again, if the gentleman or lady in question wants to do a safe pass course then we should be able to arrange it. If Deputy Fitzpatrick wants to come to me personally and give me the person's name I will help with that. It is not a problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">Then I should also deal with section 17, in respect of which I have a similar amendment. It is to change the period of six months to three months. Section 17 deals specifically with the judicial studies committee. My third amendment relates to section 18, which points to the reason for my tabling these amendments. The amendment to section 18 is to deal with the personal injuries guidelines committee. At present, the council, under subsection (1), is required to specify the date upon which that committee shall stand established, which shall be a date not later than six months following the first meeting. We need to speed this process up and make the period three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> My second amendment to section 18, my last, is to subsection (4). The legislation states the personal injuries guidelines committee shall submit the first draft of the personal injuries guidelines to the board not later than 12 months after the date upon which the committee stands established but I believe we need to reduce the period to six months. Let us get the process moving more quickly. There is much desire in the House to have the personal injuries guidelines implemented as soon as possible. My concern is that considering how the Bill is currently drafted, we will be looking at a period of three years. Therefore, we need to reduce it. The amendments I have tabled will reduce the period significantly. We need to be conscious of what the guidelines will be. I do not believe we should expect a 200-page document. There will be general guidelines. They are to give assistance to judges but they will not have to be stuck to rigidly. We need to have them produced as promptly as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_498">My comments are also on section 18. I thank the Minister and his officials for prioritising the Bill and facilitating the speedy development of the personal injuries guidelines and committee amendments. As everyone knows, there is considerable frustration over the lack of availability and the cost of business insurance. It is a difficult issue for us to address because of constitutional and legal reasons. The Government cannot intervene directly in regard to award levels and the pricing of insurance. This has led to considerable frustration.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> The Personal Injuries Commission, chaired by the former president of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, highlighted the significant differential between award levels in this country and England and Wales, in particular. The level here is 4.4 times higher for soft-tissue injuries. The commission made a number of recommendations, including the establishment of the judicial council, to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages. We all feel the award gap needs to be closed significantly. It is hoped that the enactment of this Bill, with the establishment of the personal injuries guidelines committee, will enable awards for various types of personal injuries to be recalibrated. The extent of recalibration is a matter for the Judiciary to determine but I hope it will take into account the Personal Injuries Commission benchmarking exercise in its consideration. Assuming the Judiciary responds in a constructive fashion, particularly in regard to award levels for soft-tissue injuries, the reduced award levels and the greater consistency in their application should have a positive impact on both the cost and availability of insurance. There is no excuse for this not happen. As the House will recall, Mr. Justice Kearns, the chairman of the Personal Injuries Commission, noted in the foreword of its second report that insurance industry representatives on the commission repeatedly stated that, as award levels and associated costs account for the bulk of the cost of insurance, if claims costs come down and are maintained at a consistent and predictable level, then premiums should and will also reduce accordingly. On that basis, I will be keeping a close eye on this as a Member of this House and as chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party. I passionately believe that what I seek needs to happen. We do not want to go down the referendum route. We hope the Judiciary will respond accordingly.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">I acknowledge the amendments. Reference was made to the importance of this Bill and its urgency. As I said at the outset, it is a comprehensive Bill dealing with the reform of law that has remained unreformed since the foundation of the State but, during the course of debate on the Bill, it was decided that the issue of personal injuries might be addressed. I very much appreciate the purpose of amendments Nos. 1 to 4, which is to ensure that some of the matters contained in the Bill can be addressed more expeditiously following the setting up of the council. The amendments introduced by the Government in the Seanad were intended to alleviate some of the pressures that might arise if all the committees under the new regime were required to be set up within the same short timeframe. I recognise that, in the case of committees where lay membership is an issue, there was the need to ensure there would be sufficient time to allow for the putting in place of the appropriate individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Amendments Nos. 2 and 3, in the name of Deputy O’Callaghan, would mean both the studies committee and personal injuries guidelines committee would be required to meet not later than three months after the first meeting of the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The provision in the Bill is for the committee to meet not later than six months after the first meeting of the council. Having listened to Deputy O'Callaghan and given the matter some consideration, I accept that there is merit in what is proposed. Accordingly, I am in a position to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3. However, I want to acknowledge some difficulties regarding amendments Nos. 1 and 4. I ask Deputy O'Callaghan not to press these amendments or divide the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Amendment No. 1 may give rise to practical difficulties depending on the timing of submission of the guidelines concerning additional conduct and ethics. This is because the adoption of the guidelines is a reserved function of the council and cannot be delegated to the board. The current provision gives some flexibility as to the timing of the council's meetings, which, having regard to the fact that involve all members of the Judiciary, will take place on a once-a-year basis only. The period of 12 months from the submission of the guidelines is the outermost time limit for adoption. There is nothing which precludes earlier adoption, if that is feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Amendment No. 4 would impose a significant burden on the guidelines committee, which would have just six months within which to conclude its work. The matters to be taken into account by the committee are broader, in terms of criteria, than those which currently inform the book of quantum and they will require some research. It is important to take the opportunity to establish guidelines that are fit for purpose and that will inform the level of damages awarded by the courts into the future. I acknowledge what Deputy Heydon stated in respect of the importance of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> I am prepared to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 3. There are some issues regarding amendments Nos. 1 and 4. However, the clear message from the debate is such that all those involved need to act with some haste.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">I move amendment No. 5:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_640">In page 24, line 29, after “Council” to insert “and this may include public consultation processes”.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The amendment relates to the provision that the sentencing guidelines and information committee may consult such persons as it considers appropriate for the purpose of drawing up guidelines. I am proposing that this be made explicitly clear. I ask the Minister to clarify that such consultation may include public consultation such that if the committee or, formally speaking, the council is, for example, drawing up a set of guidelines relating to environmental offences, it may hold an information day, seek submissions from interested parties and so on in regard to the drawing up of the guidelines. It would be appropriate for it to have that power. It may already be provided for in the sense that the Bill states that the committee may consult such persons as it considers appropriate in this regard and if that is the case, I will withdraw the amendment. I am seeking certainty that such processes are provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> Amendment No. 6 is contingent on amendment No. 7, which seeks to amend section 25 of the Bill. Section 25(3) provides: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_643">For the purposes of making a recommendation under this section, the Public Appointments Service shall have regard to the desirability that the lay members of the Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee will, among them, possess knowledge of, and experience in, as many as possible of the following matters: (a) the prosecution of criminal proceedings; (b) the defence of criminal proceedings; (c) policing; (d) the administration of justice; (e) sentencing policy; (f) the promotion of the welfare of the victims of crime; (g) academic study or research relating to criminal law or criminology; (h) the use of statistics; (i) the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">In the context of the importance of the victims of crime and their families having confidence in the judicial and sentencing process, amendment No. 7 proposes the insertion of a new subsection (4) to provide: "The Public Appointments Service shall have regard to the objective that the Sentencing Guidelines and Information Committee will at all times have knowledge of, and experience in, the promotion of the welfare of the victims of crime." The amendment would give additional weight to the consideration of the welfare victims of crime. It adds an emphasis to the importance of that matter by ensuring that people with experience and knowledge of the welfare of the victims of crime and who have been involved in the representation of such victims will be represented on the committee.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_645">I have no principled objection to the idea that the committee would have the power to conduct public consultations on the guidelines. I addressed this matter in reply to Deputy Sherlock in particular on section 18 and that reply holds in respect of amendment No. 5. What is proposed in the amendment is already contemplated in section 18. The provision which the Deputy seeks to amend clearly states that the committee is empowered to consult such persons as it considers appropriate. This would allow for a targeted consultation and a public consultation which is more general in nature. In addition, the committee may organise conferences, seminars and meetings relevant to its functions. There is no disagreement on the thrust of the amendment, but it is not necessary for its objective to be attained. I heard what the Deputy had to say. The amendment would not add significantly to the Bill. I assure the Deputy that section 18 will apply and will meet the objective behind the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> On amendments Nos. 6 and 7, as the text currently stands, the promotion of the welfare of the victims of crime is one of the desired criteria to which the Public Appointments Service must have regard in making a recommendation as to lay membership. This provision mirrors identical provisions in the Sentencing Council Bill 2017 and the Judicial Sentencing Commission Bill 2013 brought forward by Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil, respectively. The Public Appointments Service is not responsible for the appointment of lay members to the committee. Rather, it is only responsible for making recommendations to the Government, which will have ultimate responsibility for such appointments. I assure the Deputy that the Government will have regard to the need to ensure that the promotion of the welfare of the victims of crime is a key element in the selection of lay members to sit on the committee. I am not inclined to agree with the amendment, but I acknowledge the points raised and contend that these issues are adequately catered for elsewhere in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">This amendment does not in any way impact upon the substance of the provision now contained in section 29. The Minister for Justice and Equality of the day will still be required to undertake a review of legislative provisions that impose minimum sentences, whether those sentences be presumptive or mandatory. The Minister will also still be required, within 12 months of the commencement of that review, to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas.

          <p eId="para_664">The amendment derives from an amendment proposed by Senator Lynn Ruane and others in the Seanad. It deals with a review of current statutory mandatory, minimum and presumptive sentencing provisions. There is no difficulty with that. This amendment is simply a redrafting, as I understand it, and those in Senator Ruane's office are happy enough with it. I will support it as I think it is right and appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> Since we are dealing with the area of sentencing, I will take the opportunity to seek clarification from the Minister on one point. We spoke previously about sentencing guidelines and whether circumstances in which a judge persistently departed from the guidelines might constitute misconduct within the meaning of this legislation. Will the Minister clarify the position in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_667"> There is potential for an investigation under section 59, which deals with the matter of investigations of judicial misconduct in the absence, or after the withdrawal, of a complaint and there is a role for the conduct committee in such circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_674">I wish to clarify this point. My understanding of section 87(7) is that it provides that the name of the judge concerned and the reprimand would be included in a report under the section unless the committee "considers that in order to safeguard the administration of justice that information should not be included in the report". We are removing that provision. Will the Minister clarify this point? If a judge is reprimanded, where will the detail of the reprimand and his or her identify be disclosed, if not in the annual report?</p>

          <p eId="para_675">That is a concern of mine as well. My concern relates to amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 13. The three sections that are proposed to be deleted will result in the removal of the provision for naming a judge against whom an allegation or complaint has been substantiated. I do not believe that is right. The matter was discussed in the Seanad and the majority of Senators voted in favour of the publication of the name in such cases. That is right and fair. It is salient information for the public and legal teams. It is an appropriate discouragement to judges in the context of a form of misconduct. The Minister may be able to clarify the matter but, as matters stand, I will be voting against amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 13. Amendments Nos. 11 and 12, which appear to be technical, are fine. In addition, I am still waiting on clarification from the Minister on the point I raised earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">What we are doing is flipping the position regarding publication to some degree. I refer the Deputies to section 87(6), wherein specific information is referenced as to what shall be included in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">That will include the fact that a reprimand was issued, and the name of the judge to whom the reprimand applies. That will be included in the conduct committee report unless there is good reason for it not to be included in the report. </p>

          <p eId="para_681"> Having regard to the definition we have agreed as to what constitutes judicial misconduct, if there is a departure from acknowledged standards of conduct, or if the administration of justice is brought into disrepute, it would be possible for the conduct committee to initiate an investigation of that matter under this Bill. The important thing about this amendment is that publication of a name and the existence of a reprimand will be included in the annual report unless good reason is established for non-publication.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_58">— the comprehensive nature of the reports and their contribution to building a culture of transparency in mental health services; and</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_64">— a serious concern with hygiene and maintenance in a significant number of approved centres;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">— mental health services where the degree of dirtiness and shabbiness is unacceptable and shows disrespect for patients’ dignity;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">— that 70 per cent of approved centres (in-patient mental health services registered by the Mental Health Commission) remained dirty, malodorous and poorly maintained;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">— that a number of centres remained unsuitable and not fit for purpose;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">— that a significant number of approved centres have, on a consistent and sustained basis, failed to provide the most basic and fundamental aspects of a service;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">— that more than 40 per cent of approved centres were non-compliant on the need for individual care plans; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">— that residents in long-term care are not being adequately monitored for serious physical illness and there was widespread lack of access to essential healthcare such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, dietetics and seating assessments;</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_81">— there are significant governance and management deficits within our mental health services;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">— it is difficult to see how some of the lowest compliant centres could be registered in the future without significant improvement;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">— hope and dignity are key elements of any mental health service and that not all approved centres are providing that, either through the service itself, or the physical buildings in which they operate;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">— it is necessary to respect the wishes of service users and their families/carers in facilities such as the Rosalie community psychiatric unit in Castlerea, Co. Roscommon;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">— a planned, costed and funded capital investment programme is required to bring a significant number of Health Service Executive (HSE) buildings up to date, make them fit for purpose and ensure that they are registrable;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">— the placement of any child in any adult unit indicates a gap in service provision; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">— a child or adolescent’s first introduction to mental health care should not be through a service or building which is not specifically equipped to deal with their needs; and</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_93">— adult safeguarding regulation to be put on a primary legislative basis;</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_95">— an urgent implementation strategy to ensure that the CAMHS services provided match what is recommended under <i>A Vision for Change</i>;</summary>

            <p eId="para_1452">I want to discuss the issue of the Kanturk link road. This project has received planning permission and is shovel-ready. Significant progress has been made by the local authority with the purchase of the land and the design process. The lands required having been already fenced off by Cork County Council. Councillor Bernard Moynihan has put a great deal of work into this project at council level. It is a priority project. Kanturk has the unique distinction of being the largest town in the largest barony in the largest county of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">It is a focal point for Duhallow. It has significant potential. We have secured funding for a number of significant projects, which are moving on. I am talking about the link road and the relief which it will give to the town centre at points during rush hour, for example, when the town is choked and congested with traffic. This link road has been discussed at local authority and other levels over the last 25 years. This project is almost ready. It was submitted under the rural regeneration programme when it was last open at the end of last year. I am extremely disappointed that funding did not come through on that occasion. It is a shovel-ready project. Substantial emphasis has been put on developing the town. Why it did not get funding at that stage is beyond me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454"> The Department of Rural and Community Development has to accept that this is a worthwhile project. It has been prioritised by Cork County Council. The local authority has done substantial work to advance this and other projects going through the planning and design process which are awaiting funding, such as the school. Planning permission has been secured. The county council has purchased the required lands. It is a shovel-ready project. The Minister might allude in his response to why the funding was not forthcoming to the last round in November. There was another round in February or March. The link road in Kanturk is a project which would contribute to economic development in the region. It is vitally important to ensure that Kanturk town can grow and develop and that we have a centre for the greater Duhallow region, a market town similar to many other towns. I need not advise the Minister of State about the number of shops closed in many of these towns and the decay in these communities, including Kanturk. Will the Minister of State explain why it has not been funded to date? What funding can the Minister of State offer for the link road in Kanturk, County Cork?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development (Deputy Seán Canney)<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1455">I understand that the Deputy’s question refers to an application for funding from Cork County Council to the rural regeneration and development fund which is administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The rural regeneration and development fund seeks to support ambitious and strategic projects which have the potential to transform rural economies and communities. It is one of the four funds established under Project Ireland 2040. The Government has committed €1 billion over ten years to the fund and €315 million has been allocated for the period 2019 to 2022. The first call for applications closed in September 2018. There was a large response to the call with 280 applications received. On foot of the first call, 38 successful category 1 projects and 46 category 2 projects were announced with funding of €86 million provided from the fund to support projects worth €117 million throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456"> Successful proposals for the fund are determined on a competitive basis and not all projects which meet the requirements may be funded. The Department received a category 1 application from Cork County Council for the Kanturk link road for funding of €747,000. The proposal underwent an assessment by the Department and was considered by the independent project advisory board. However, it was not recommended for funding to the Minister at the time. As it is a competitive process, not all projects that apply to each call can be funded. The assessment process for applications made under the first call comprised different stages of evaluation. The initial assessment was undertaken by the Department of Rural and Community Development, which involved proposed projects being marked against the criteria set out in the information booklet for the first call. The next stage in the process was consideration by the project advisory board, which was established to provide high-level guidance on the suitability of proposals for funding and assisting in making recommendations to the Minister. The project advisory board considered the projects under these criteria: the marks applied in the internal evaluation process; categorisation of the applications by the Department; the observations and advice of the members of the board; and the need to deliver balanced regional development in accordance with the aims of the national planning framework and the objectives of the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457"> Final decisions on the funding of projects were made by the Minister, Deputy Ring, following consideration of the recommendations to him. Under the first call, the Minister, Deputy Ring, announced funding of €4.4 million for eight projects in County Cork. Among these projects was the development of a multi-purpose, floodlit, all-weather facility in the village of Banteer. This facility will be available for use by the community throughout the year. The second project was the relocation, restoration and fit-out of a heritage building in Kinsale town centre as the new library for the town. The third was an international standard mountain bike trail in the Ballyhoura region. The new trail will provide recreational, health and tourism benefits. Another project was the development of regeneration strategies for the towns of Rathcormac and Ballydesmond. Applicants who have been unsuccessful in the first call may reapply for the second call.</p>

            <p eId="para_1458">Applicants who were unsuccessful in the first call may reapply for the second call. When will the second call be? How much money is in the second call? The Minister of State said that when the advisory board evaluated the project, it did not meet the criteria. Has there been an engagement process between the local authority and the Department about this funding of €747,000? It underwent an assessment by the Department. Could we have the independent project advisory board recommendations? Why was it not funded under that? How much money is available under the next project? Will the Minister commit that the vital link road in Kanturk will be considered under that? I cannot overstate the importance of this to the town of Kanturk and to the region. It is important to allow it to grow and prosper. The Minister of State said that there will be a new call which can be applied to. When is the second call happening? When will decisions be made on the second call? Is there any possibility that funding applications that are already in place could be looked at in light of further moneys that may be made available? While it was not successful with previous calls, will the Minister of State commit or is there any possibility that moneys that are still in the Department under that rural regeneration fund could be given to Kanturk as a matter of urgency rather than going through the second phase of this? I think Cork County Council made an exceptional application. The reasons were outlined very clearly. Is there any possibility that any funding coming down the tracks could be provided rather than going through a second call? The Minister of State might outline the process for the second call if that is how it has to proceed.</p>
          </speech>

            <p eId="para_1459">The second call for applications to the rural regeneration and development fund is now open and the closing date for that is 6 August. The overarching priority for the second call for proposals will be to support projects which exhibit the greatest potential for the achievement of stated national, regional and local strategic development and planning objectives, and the delivery of significant and sustainable regeneration in rural towns and villages and the surrounding areas. The types of project that will be supported under this call include infrastructure that enables improved accessibility with and to towns and villages, especially to support sustainable modes such as walking, cycling and public transport links.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460"> The Deputy asked if this application can be considered now rather than waiting for the next application process. The application process is open so the council should apply now under this application. With regard to feedback about the first application, the Department has given feedback to the local authorities on projects if they were not successful and has set out the areas in which they were weakest, and there is a dialogue. This call is only for category 1 projects. The money committed in the last call is committed so there is no more money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">The first €86 million will be spent from now on. A total of €315 million will be spent over the four years. I expect a similar amount of money will be available for the next funding year. An application must be made by the local authority. Applicants must take cognisance of the fact that the application process might be slightly different due to the nuances that might have been introduced since the previous year. It is not exactly the same. Issues arise due to Brexit and how the project will impact positively in a Brexit situation. It is important that the local authority would examine the application process and the questions and not just think it is the same as the previous application process. If assistance is required, the Department will provide it at any stage. The project described by Deputy Michael Moynihan is the type of one I would consider suitable for a rural regeneration project. It is important that the application is sent in as the closing date is 6 August 2019. Applications are open to projects that have planning permission and where everything is in place so that they are ready to go to the next stage, which is full design and construction.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">This is the fifth or sixth time I have raised this issue regarding people with type 1 diabetes in the north west. Some 31 patients would benefit from having an automatic insulin pump fitted. The problem is that they cannot get the pumps fitted although they are on the shelf waiting for them because a diabetic nurse or specialist nursing staff are unavailable to train them in how to use them. The situation has been going on for six months. I have raised the issue on numerous occasions. I have spoken to the manager of the hospital and I have written to the hospital. I have written to the CEO of the hospital group. I raised the matter three times with the senior Minister, Deputy Harris. In fairness to him, he has always been very accommodating and he has told me that he would get back to me. I raised the matter with him again no later than last Tuesday week. I met him afterwards and he said he would get back to me before the end of the day. I know he is depending on people in the HSE to get back to him with answers, but nobody seems to have the answers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463"> In addition, Suzanne Donnelly, chairperson of the Sligo branch of Diabetes Ireland, wrote to the Minister's private secretary a few weeks ago about the 31 patients in the north west. The reply she received was outrageous. It said that under the 2004 HSE Act the Minister could not intervene on behalf of an individual patient. Her letter was not about an individual patient; her letter was about a service which was denied to people in the north west, and it is being continually denied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464"> I do not know who in the HSE is so incompetent or what idiot is not doing his or her job, but the only time the Minister, the Department and the HSE will gain any credibility with the public is when such people are sacked and lose their job and they will have to go to the Labour Court to explain why they are so god damn incompetent that they think that their job is to block people from getting a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465"> I rarely get angry but it makes me very angry when the genuine people who have come to me, who need to get the service and are waiting for it, are being fobbed off and told the hospital has applied to get a nurse to provide the service. The nurse who was providing the service in the hospital in Sligo was seconded to another part of the hospital. She was not sacked and she did not go on maternity leave. Now the hospital says it has to apply to the HSE to get someone to replace her. The hospital says it is waiting for approval for the post. The post exists and those people are waiting. It is shameful that the situation has continued for so long. I do not blame the Minister directly but I do blame him for not dealing with it. Some individual somewhere is failing the people with type 1 diabetes in the north west who need an insulin pump. He or she will not take responsibility and hides behind bits of paper saying do not write to me about it again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466"> The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is here to respond. She has been given a response to read. To be honest, I do not expect it to be much better than the one Suzanne Donnelly got. It would be great if it is, but we are in trouble until we get to grips with the people in the HSE who think their job is to block progress and prevent people from getting their entitlements. The only way we will deal with them is to kick them out, give them their P45 and let them take a case to the Labour Court or wherever they want, but that is the only way the Minister can be seen to stand up for the patients who need somebody to stand up for them. I know the Minister, Deputy Harris, is genuine about this but along with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and others who are also genuine, they need to stand up to the people who are blocking others in society who deserve to get a service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1468"> Just like the rest of the world, Ireland is experiencing sustained increases in the number of people with diabetes. Currently, there are more than 200,000 people with diabetes in Ireland. People with type 1 diabetes make up 10% of all people with diabetes. Appropriate and timely management of diabetes can reduce the risk of deterioration in health and well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469"> The adult diabetes service in Sligo University Hospital is currently led by a consultant endocrinologist-general physician with her team, including one locum consultant. This service covers a catchment area including Sligo and Leitrim, south Donegal, north Roscommon and west Cavan. The adult diabetes service also includes an insulin pump service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470"> In addition, there is a pregnancy diabetes service, an inpatient ward-based consultation service, as well as an inpatient and outpatient podiatry service. There is a well-established, integrated multidisciplinary team approach between both the hospital and the community. On a hospital basis, the service is supported by specialist diabetic nurses in the hospital, specialist diabetic nurses in the community, an advanced nurse practitioner working between the hospital and the community and a full range of support staff, both across the acute and community services. There is a well-established shared care approach between the acute and community services including the specialist diabetic nurses and GP practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471"> The adult service is complemented by a paediatric diabetes specialist service, which provides a regional insulin pump service for children across the north-west region. Both the adult and paediatric pump service have experienced considerable growth in referrals both from new patients commencing treatment as well as the relocation of patients from national centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472"> A general paediatric consultant post was advertised in recent months which will provide for oversight of the insulin pump service in the north west. Interviews are due to be held in early July, following the completion of a shortlisting process in May 2019. That will ensure all new paediatric patients will commence their pump therapy at Sligo University Hospital for patients from Sligo and Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473"> The development of the diabetes day unit at Sligo University Hospital is proceeding to stage 3 with the tender process now under way following the receipt of a letter of approval in April 2019. It is expected that building works will commence in quarter 3 of 2019, subject to funding approval for construction. The funding of all projects is subject to the availability of capital funding and the progress of other priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474"> The Government is committed to the further development of services for people with diabetes and other chronic conditions. Earlier this year, the Sláintecare Action Plan 2019 was published, which will be a fundamental enabler in the delivery of the Sláintecare vision. Under Sláintecare, integrated care programmes for people living with chronic conditions will also be implemented, as well as plans to expand capacity in GP and community nursing to manage chronic disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475"> As part of the action plan, a total of four workshops were held, including one on diabetes. The workshops were attended by a mix of clinical and management stakeholders from the HSE and the Department and will inform future decision-making and service planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476"> The Minister, Deputy Harris, is keen to continue to work with Deputy Martin Kenny and he has written to him today. I do not know whether the Deputy has received the letter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1479">I thank the Minister of State. Much as I expected, the statement does not go to the heart of it because it refers to an advertisement for a general paediatric consultant's post. I refer to a service for adults, not children. Some 31 adults are waiting to be provided with the service. The paediatric service is available for children who require an insulin pump and they are getting it. The problem arises when they reach 18 years. One such patient is a young woman from south Leitrim who is going to college in Galway. She needs to get an insulin pump and she has been waiting four or five months for it. She cannot get it because there is no one to train her on how to use it. That is unacceptable in this day and age. It is the same for many others. A total of 31 patients in the north west are affected by the delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480"> The statement also referred to the new diabetes care unit in Sligo University Hospital, which is proceeding to stage 3 of the tender process, but that is dependent on funding and we still do not have clarity on funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">It would be useful to know that the funding is to become available. I do not want to stop focusing on the issue I am raising, however. The specific issue I am raising concerns 31 adults who need to get the insulin pump. It has been purchased for them and it is sitting on the shelf to be given to them but they cannot use it because there is no diabetes support and no specialist nurse to train them in its use. These are generally intelligent people who, with a small amount of training and assistance, would be able to make a great leap forward in the treatment of their type 1 diabetes if they could get the pump fitted. It has been denied to them in their area although it is available in other parts of the country. Therefore, the Minister of State can understand the people's frustration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482"> If the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, has written to me today, I have not seen the letter yet. I will read it with interest. Let me return to the central point, which is that somebody somewhere is not doing his or her job. That person needs to be held to account. If the Minister will not do so, then we have to hold the Minister to account and say he is not doing his job. Somewhere along the line, the buck stops. The Minister must be prepared to find the individual, sort him or her out and determine what the hell he or she believes his or her job is. The individual is so incompetent that he or she can think that 31 people, for the sake of a little training, can be left to the wind and that letters can be written saying correspondence should be sent to the complaints department. That is what the HSE told the association in Sligo. It is absolutely ridiculous. It is time somebody's head rolled somewhere in the HSE for this kind of incompetence.</p>

            <p eId="para_1483">I note the Deputy's frustration and concern. I believe I have dealt with this Topical Issue matter twice before. I do not know what is in the letter sent to the Deputy by the Minister today. I do not know whether he will be pleased with it when it reaches his desk. It is a matter he will have to pursue with the Minister. I understand, although not from the reply I read, that there are 31 adults waiting for the pump to be given to them. I will pass this on to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484"> Regarding the frustration and concern of the Deputy and his remarks on HSE staff, I do not have any briefing but I will certainly pass on his remarks to the Minister. I believe I have covered most of the points the Deputy made. I will make sure, when I go back to my office, to inform the Minister about the Deputy's frustration and concerns, as I have done before. I hope that when the Deputy reads the letter today, there will be some good news in it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1485">I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, but I am deeply disappointed that the senior Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, is not present to deal with this debate. That is in no way undermining the capacity of the Minister of State to deal with the issue. If there were a photo opportunity that would encourage the Minister to look better or add to his public profile, he would certainly find time to participate. Notwithstanding that, I must put to the House that Shannon Airport is a vital piece of the infrastructural jigsaw that drives the mid-western regional economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486"> The entire country is facing an enormous challenge owing to Brexit, as the Minister of State will be well aware. Whether there is a hard or soft Brexit, this country is facing very difficult circumstances that will challenge economic growth and the capacity to retain jobs and attract tourists. It beggars belief that the State has not found it possible to support Shannon Development in its current activity. The airport is currently investing €20 million in safety and security measures. This should have been funded by the central Exchequer as part of a programme of support for regional development, particularly when we are facing a very strong headwind, which will undoubtedly come whether there is a hard or soft Brexit. Shannon Airport has had to take the €20 million from its own resources, resources that would be better deployed supporting the continued development of the airport, continued route development and an increase in traffic. Unfortunately, the money has to be poured into the base infrastructure, leaving no capacity to use the funds to increase capacity at the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487"> In 2019, passenger numbers are already disappointing and are predicted to get worse. The continued grounding of the Norwegian Boeing 737 Max fleet has added further to a poor set of circumstances. Since its disconnection from Dublin Airport, given its independence, Shannon Airport has failed to meet expected growth targets. According to the predictions made in 2012, passenger numbers were expected to be approximately 2.5 million but the airport has scarcely 1.8 million passengers now. This is a long way short of what would be considered to be acceptable and necessary to retain a viable airport. We have seen passenger numbers fall this year by somewhere close to 5%, or maybe higher when extrapolated over the rest of the year. Passenger numbers in Dublin Airport are up by approximately 8.4% and the numbers in Cork, Donegal, Kerry and Knock airports are up 11%, 7%, 5% and 9%, respectively. In the period in question, Shannon Airport has been losing passengers. It needs Government support. It is not just about supporting the airport but also about supporting the principle of balanced regional development, foreign investment and the capacity of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to develop new opportunities to protect employment in the region in this very challenging environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488"> I appeal to the Minister of State to relay my remarks to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the hope that he will heed the views of this House, get his act together and support a vital piece of infrastructure for the mid-west, which is the engine that benefits not only the mid-west but also the entire west.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1489">On behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, I thank Deputy Dooley for raising this matter today. I pass on the Minister's apologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490"> Shannon Airport, established by statute in September 2014, is a strategic business within Shannon Group. It is a commercial state company whose purpose is to promote and facilitate air transport and aviation services in and around Shannon Airport and to optimise the return on its land and property and on its shareholdings in subsidiary companies. Therefore, as a State-owned enterprise with a fully commercial mandate, operational issues in regard to Shannon Airport, in the first instance, are matters for the airport. All of us here today can agree that the statutory role carried out by Shannon Airport is extremely important. This is acknowledged in the national aviation policy which recognises the strategic importance of Shannon Airport for connectivity for the mid-west region and as a gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491"> Since Shannon Airport's separation from the DAA in 2012, it has seen passenger numbers increase by 34%. That is a significant increase in seven years. As recently reported in the group's annual report for 2018, the airport has been the fastest growing outside Dublin, and it enjoyed its sixth consecutive year of growth. Indeed, 2018 saw an increase of 6.5%, or 113,000 passengers, over 2017, growth attributable to, for example, new services to Barcelona, Bristol and Liverpool, through Ryanair, and growth in transatlantic traffic, which increased by 7% to 427,000 passengers, with Shannon Airport operating its highest number of transatlantic routes in nine years during 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492"> The Deputy is correct in pointing out that the company had been forecasting growth of about 5% in passenger numbers for 2019. That has not transpired. So far, we have seen a loss but there are a number of factors. The volatility of the global aviation market has been felt this year by airports around the world, including Shannon Airport, due a combination of issues, including an increase in geopolitical risks and unstable oil prices, as well as the ongoing grounding of the Boeing 737 Max. This has affected greatly a number of services that were operating or due to resume or commence operations from Shannon Airport in 2019. This has impacted passenger numbers at the airport. While these matters are totally outside the control of the company, I am aware that it is working hard to deal with the fallout and put in place alternative services at the earliest opportunity. The Minister's Department is working with the airport to explore what marketing supports might be available to assist this work. </p>
            <p eId="para_1493"> It is important, however, to point out that decisions by airlines on the routes and services they provide are commercial matters in which the Minister has no function. Under Project 2040, Shannon Group, through its subsidiaries, which include Shannon Airport, has plans to invest in excess of €150 million in its capital programme over the period to 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">This includes a significant investment in the construction of a wide-body aeroplane hangar. This will be the first such hangar constructed at an Irish airport in over 20 years and represents the kind of expansion that was envisaged in order to grow a globally recognised and internationally competitive aviation industry cluster in and around the airport campus. The reputation of the International Aviation Services Centre was boosted in 2018 when it was appointed as the first Irish member of the European Aerospace Cluster Partnership, an EU-funded association that brings together the principal aerospace industry clusters in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495"> Shannon Airport provides essential strategic transport infrastructure, as has been pointed out, and services to airport users and the wider community in and around Shannon and to many of those who are transiting through. In a small country such as ours, it is important, if not vital, that Shannon Airport continues to exploit opportunities that benefit all citizens which support both the local economy and that of the State. It is also vital that the stakeholders in the region support the airport in order to optimise opportunities for growing services and to ensure their viability by using them. The Minister supports all endeavours of the group to ensure the prosperity of Shannon Airport is in line with Government policy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_358">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1496">An effort has been made by the Government to suggest that the airport has done really well in the past couple of years. This has been done by means of a comparison involving the use of passenger numbers from 2012, when the economic crisis was at its height and when passenger numbers were down at all airports. Every other airport in the State has experienced a considerably higher level of growth in passenger numbers than Shannon Airport. There has been major growth in the economy and in passenger and tourism numbers in the interim period but, regardless of which metric one uses to measure these things, it is obvious that Shannon Airport has fallen significantly behind. It is time for the Minister and his Department to look at the regime in Shannon Airport. Two chief executives have come and gone during the period to which I refer. There is a need for a significant change in leadership and that is something the Minister and his Department need to address. It is not good enough to just suggest that the airport has been given its independence and is now on its own.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497"> I questioned the capacity of an independent entity to survive against the threat of competition from Dublin Airport when all of this was first proposed. I do not want this to be a case of me saying "I told you so". What I predicted at the time has now come to pass. We cannot give up on Shannon Airport. It is not good enough for any of us to state that I predicted this; it is about what we can do now in the situation we find ourselves. There is a need for significant intervention on the part of the State. If the Minister and the Department are prepared to look at route support, marketing funds or whatever assistance is available, then let us see that. Unfortunately, the €20 million from the airport's resources that has to be invested in safety measures could have been much better used in supporting its continued growth at, hopefully, a better level and to get it to the point of viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498"> The Taoiseach is on record as stating that a facility like Shannon Airport would only be viable if throughput there reached 3 million passengers. The target for this year was 2.5 million but we will scarcely reach 1.6 million or 1.7 million. We need the support of the Minister, the Department and the Government. There is a willing and capable workforce at the airport, the members of which are prepared to do whatever is necessary to make it viable, but the support of Government is required. I ask the Minister of State to channel my concerns back to the Minister at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1499">I do not doubt that there are committed staff at the airport who are working hard and who, like the Government, want to ensure its viability. As the Deputy indicated, the separation from the DAA in 2012 was not forced but it has brought about significant challenges and, in particular, competition, not just with Dublin Airport but also with the smaller regional airports. Given its size, Shannon Airport does not receive the same funding as the smaller airports but it does receive support and funding in other ways. Tourism Ireland strongly promotes Shannon Airport as an access point, particularly to the Wild Atlantic Way, but for other locations as well. A large amount of funding has been given to Tourism Ireland to ensure that it is part of that overall strategic plan and agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500"> There are challenges with Brexit, as the Deputy rightly outlined. The Department and the Government are acutely aware of these challenges, including those relating to a no-deal Brexit. Shannon Airport provides a European hub connectivity. Much of this is via London and Heathrow and there would be implications for it in a no-deal scenario. We are working with the European Commission on this. Contingency plans for a no-deal scenario in order to ensure that traffic through the various hubs in the UK will not be brought to a complete standstill. Obviously, this will underpin activities at Shannon Airport as well. As I have outlined, there had been an anticipation that passenger numbers would increase this year. This has not happened for a number of reasons. If one looks at the figures up to this year, however, there has been significant growth, not just in passenger numbers but also in the number of flights. This is not a matter in respect of which the Minister can intervene by increasing the number of flights but his team and his Department officials can work with Shannon Airport to ensure that the airport can avail of whatever opportunities exist and that Tourism Ireland and other national bodies are supporting it and making sure that the airport is part of their overall plan to promote Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501"> I will see to it that the Minister is made aware of the Deputy's specific concerns.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1502">I thank the Minister of State for attending. For a number of years now there has been talk of providing a permanent base for the Coast Guard contingent based in west Connemara. As the Minister of State is probably aware, the Coast Guard operates with local crews that operate on a totally voluntary basis and with the helicopter service, which is on contract. The Coast Guard crew in west Connemara has no permanent base whatsoever. The coastline there is very long and indented and the Coast Guard receives frequent call-outs. The reality is that when it is mobilising and after it mobilises and returns from a mission, the crew has nowhere to meet to debrief, there are no toilets available to them, and nowhere to change their clothes or take a shower. They literally have nowhere to go. This is totally unsatisfactory.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503"> There has been talk for the past number of years - I have correspondence dating back to 2017 and earlier - stating that the Coast Guard would be provided with a permanent location. The most obvious place in west Connemara is at the airstrip which was built at Cluain Leacht an Abba, just outside Cleggan in County Galway. It is so suitable because it is very accessible by road to all of the coastline from Killary all of the way down beyond Clifden and into Ballyconneely. The reality is that having the boat at that location is perfectly satisfactory because it is towed behind a trailer and can be launched wherever it is needed. It is not kept it at one pier and launched from there. The boat can be launched from any slip, once one can get it to the relevant location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504"> The location of a base was agreed. The Coast Guard wrote to what was then the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht a number of years ago and there was vague reference to building a permanent base for the local crew at that location. The other huge advantage is that every time the Coast Guard helicopter comes to Connemara, for training purposes of whatever, and needs to land, this is always and obviously done at the airstrip. It is safe and the Coast Guard crews know its location. It is what it says on the tin: an airstrip, and is very suitable for the Coast Guard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505"> When will the Minister show concern for these volunteers who give up time and effort to engage in sophisticated training? Following the accident that occurred in County Clare, such training is becoming even more rigorous, as is the training for helicopter crews. The crews do this training together. When will they receive access to the basic human facilities? It is not much to ask that such facilities be provided to people who give so much on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506"> What I hope to hear is that the Minister is now moving forward with this project, which would be very low-cost in nature. The site and everything is there, it is just a question of erecting the buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">I hope that the reason the Minister could not be here is that he has good news for me and is going to announce that I need not have tabled this issue for debate because the Department is going to do the decent thing and provide this long-promised base.</p>

            <p eId="para_1509">I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter and for his interest in it. The Minister cannot be present - the Deputy can take that as he will - but I will be as helpful as I can in my response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510"> I acknowledge the work of the Coast Guard and its teams. The job they do is often difficult and challenging. I appreciate the need for a new permanent Coast Guard base at Cleggan. As the Deputy mentioned, the Coast Guard unit based there is designated as a shoreline search unit and operates out of an historic rocket house with inadequate facilities. All volunteer Coast Guard units are categorised as shoreline search units and other units are assigned additional functions. For example, Westport is designated as a search and boat unit and Doolin is designated as a search, cliff and boat unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511"> The Coast Guard is endeavouring to secure a suitable base for the Cleggan unit. Unfortunately, few local opportunities have emerged. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport registered an interest with the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as far back as 2015 in acquiring a site at the local airstrip in Cleggan. There have been ongoing communications since then between the Departments of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512"> I will outline some of that engagement. In 2015, the latter Department requested that the Office of Public Works, OPW, conduct a feasibility study of the potential use of space on the airstrip for a Coast Guard facility. That study, with an appropriate assessment screening, was completed in March 2016 and submitted by the OPW to the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for consideration and, if appropriate, the approval of that Department. Subject to that approval, the OPW proposed to submit a planning application for provision of a Coast Guard station on part of the airstrip on the basis of the feasibility study. A written consent of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, as the site owner, is required to accompany any such planning application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513"> It was initially proposed to accommodate the Coast Guard from an earlier date by way of a temporary structure arrangement, to be followed by an application for a permanent new building within the lifetime of the temporary permission for the temporary structure, which would have been two to five years if granted. The then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht gave its consent to such a planning application in April 2016. However, I understand that the OPW is yet to pursue the drafting of the application, as the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has stated that the method by which the formal transfer of the relevant portion of the site will be achieved has not yet been finalised by that Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514"> It has been brought to my attention that this matter has been raised with the Department a number of times, including as recently as this May. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will await a response from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The process is moving, however, and there has been considerable engagement back and forth, but it appears that the latter Department needs to sign off on certain matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1515">I am sure the Minister of State shares my concern and frustration when Departments start pushing paper around from one to the other as if they are not all part of the same public service or the functioning of the Government, which is a collective of 15 people who are meant to ensure that all Departments work in tandem rather than against one another as rival companies. At what stage does the Government interfere and tell Departments that an answer is needed? Of course, there is always one quick way of getting an answer from a Department that is swinging the lead, so I do not accept the excuses from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. If it was not getting an answer from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in its various manifestations - it is now the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht - all it had to do was bring an <i>aide-mémoire</i> to the Cabinet. I assure the Minister of State that there would have been an answer from that Department and its Minister before the <i>aide-mémoire</i> ever got onto the Cabinet agenda. The Ministers all sit around the table together. It is their job collectively to run the country. I find this extraordinary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516"> I have with me a letter from 2017. It is part of the tennis match, where the ball is played into the other court, returns, gets played back again and so on without anything happening. This is a very simple issue. A lease or some other arrangement must be reached to permit the Coast Guard to erect its temporary and permanent structures. Actually, we can forget about the temporary structure at this stage and just go for the permanent one. Planning permission has to be acquired, but it has never been sought, and the structure must be built.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517"> Would it be possible for the Minister of State to revert to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on foot of my raising this issue and ask for a timeline for the project and a list of the steps that need to be taken to bring it to a conclusion? It is time that the people of Connemara who are involved in the Coast Guard have set out for them the steps to be taken, the bodies responsible and the timeline to be adhered to. Obfuscating and moving the issue from one body to another is not acceptable, as the collective Government should ensure that bodies answer one another.</p>

            <p eId="para_1518">Not knowing enough about this specific case, I can appreciate from the Deputy's response that it has been ongoing for some time. Clearly, there is a need for a structure, which the Government acknowledges. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as part of the Coast Guard's multi-annual building programme, which is funded through that Department, has included a provision for a permanent Coast Guard base at Cleggan. It remains a priority for the Department. Obviously, there has been some toing and froing between the two Departments. I am informed that the OPW and the Department requested updates numerous times on the transfer of lands from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, most recently in May. They are awaiting a response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519"> I will relay the Deputy's frustration around the fact that this process is taking so long, but there have been further developments. The Cleggan unit has been prioritised by the Coast Guard for the new unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV, drones function and training. It is one of three units prioritised for this function and has undertaken training on the airstrip site. However, the burning issue is the need to have a permanent structure in place so that the Coast Guard and its crews have the facilities required to perform all of the functions that the Deputy has outlined they cannot currently perform at Cleggan. It is a priority and has been included in the multi-annual building programme. I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy with some form of a timeline. I will also raise the matter with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1520">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1521">That Dáil Éireann shall take note of the Report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality entitled ‘Report on the Wards of Court’, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 22nd February, 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522">I would like at the outset to thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and other colleagues who have made the effort to attend here this afternoon to discuss the committee's report on the wards of court, which our committee published last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523"> As I stated in my preface to the report, the wards of court system has played a vitally important role in allowing the courts to make decisions regarding the protection of persons and their property when they are unable to look after their own affairs. As of 2015, there were in the region of 2,700 wards of court, with funds valued at over €1 billion. Wards and their families rely heavily on the wards of court system and the expertise within the Courts Service to invest these funds wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524"> During the financial crisis, decisions taken by Courts Service managers led to a significant downturn in the value of the funds of a not insignificant number of wards of court. We were advised that some lost their entire funds and were left to depend on social welfare payments. In examining this issue, the Committee on Justice and Equality set out to understand how the loss of funds had transpired - funds that are vital to maintain the accommodation, care and quality of life needs of some of the most vulnerable people in our society - and to make recommendations as to how, insofar as possible, the situation might be remedied.</p>
          <p eId="para_1525">In October 2017, the committee engaged with the Justice for Wards group, representatives of the Courts Service and officials from the Department of Justice and Equality. The hearing gave rise to highly conflicting evidence regarding the effective management of the funds of wards of court. Having considered the evidence presented, the committee was and remains strongly of the view that the cases identified by the Justice for Wards group where funds have been significantly depleted should be subject to a comprehensive independent audit that would engage with the representative family members of those affected. Equally, a more involved relationship between parents and guardians and the Courts Service is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526"> The committee is of the view that an independent review of the Courts Service's disposition towards and engagement with parents and guardians of wards should be undertaken. Representatives of wards of court recounted their experiences, speaking of an invisible but real wall around the Courts Service and the Office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court. Their experience was that there was no accountability or transparency and that they were most often met by silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527"> There is nothing in the mission and functions of the Courts Service to suggest this entity is geared towards managing, let alone responsibly managing, an investment portfolio valued at more than €1 billion. In the experience of the aggrieved families, it has never demonstrated empathy towards their and their loved ones' situation. Its functions are to manage the courts, to provide support services for judges, to provide information on the courts system to the public, to provide, manage and maintain court buildings and to provide facilities for users of the courts. There is nothing there to give comfort to or assuage the fears of those who have been grievously ill-served by the wardship system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528"> The withholding of information, including account details, has rightly vexed these families. The committee recommends that in cases where the funds for a ward of court are depleted, the remaining portion of the funds should be disregarded for assessment of medical card entitlement and other State benefits. Contingency plans for essential needs such as healthcare and accommodation should be set in train for individuals who are identified as being particularly at risk. Although the committee commends the extensive work undertaken in 2018 to advance the implementation of a decision support service, as introduced by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, we continue to urge the Government to provide the resources necessary to ensure the decision support service is fully operational as soon as possible. That translates into now, next week or next month but very definitely not next year or by the end of 2020. In light of the projected further three years to having existing wards transferred to the new decision support service and the abolition of the wards of court system, such a timeframe would be wholly unacceptable to the cohort of largely aged and ageing family members who very understandably are anxious over the certainty of their loved ones' care and future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529"> Finally, the committee, subject to the view of the Attorney General that it is legally and constitutionally permissible, recommends that the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 be amended in order that the investment funds for wards of court can be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530"> In conclusion, I wish to express my sincere gratitude to those who contributed to the preparation of this report: the witnesses who attended our public hearings, particularly the representatives of Justice for Wards, ably led by Mary Farrell who, along with others, is in the Visitors Gallery; the members of the joint committee who worked with me on the hearings, discussion on the report and the adoption of the recommendations; and the staff of the committee secretariat and the Oireachtas Library and Research Service. I urge the Minister for Justice and Equality and his Government colleagues to give the report their detailed consideration and to provide with due haste a timeframe for the implementation of the recommendations therein.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1531">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I note the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, Deputy Ó Caoláin, acknowledged my presence for this debate. I assure him and other Members that I regard it as my duty to attend in person for this important debate on an important report. I am pleased to have the opportunity to be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532"> As Deputies will be aware, the management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998, and the High Court has jurisdiction in wards of court matters. Having regard to the important issues raised and the work undertaken by the committee, I am pleased to be joined by Ms Joyce Duffy, a senior official in my Department, Mr. Sean Quigley, head of human resources at and accountant for the Courts Service, and Ms Alice White of the Courts Service. Important issues have been raised and it is important that they be addressed. In this regard, I wish to confirm that my Department and the Courts Service have received and reviewed the report on the wards of court published in February 2018 by the justice committee. I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin and the members of his committee for their interest in the matter. I note that six recommendations relating to wards of court matters were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533"> I assure Deputies that the Government is fully committed to the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties and I welcome the upcoming changes in the wards of court system. The aforementioned Act is significant reforming human rights legislation framed to meet Ireland’s obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which provides a comprehensive and robust framework for the realisation of the rights of people with disabilities. The Act will also abolish the current wards of court system by repealing the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">The current wards of court system for adults will be phased out over a period of three years from the commencement of Part 6 of the Act. The Act offers a continuum of options to support people in maximising their decision-making capability. New administrative processes and support measures must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. These measures include the setting up of the decision support service within the Mental Health Commission, a body under the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535"> I am pleased that the Revised Estimates for 2019 provided an additional €3.5 million for the establishment of the decision support service. My Department will continue to work closely with the Mental Health Commission and the director of the decision support service to deliver the full implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536"> The Deputies will be aware that it is a matter for the presiding judge, who is independent in the exercise of judicial functions under the Constitution, to determine the level of funding awarded in individual cases. I understand that in some cases, those awards may not be sufficient to provide the care and assistance that the person needs or requires. Therefore, I have signed the commencement order bringing Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 into operation with effect from 1 October last year. The Act, which allows courts the power to award periodic payments rather than a lump sum payment in cases of catastrophic injury, will provide much-needed financial security to persons requiring lifelong care and assistance following a catastrophic injury. I believe the availability of a periodic payment to those who have suffered catastrophic injuries will ensure they will receive the care and assistance they require for the rest of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537"> I wish to turn to the specific recommendations as presented by the committee in its report and as highlighted this afternoon by the committee Chairman, Deputy Ó Caoláin. I will begin with the first recommendation. The Courts Service has advised me that in December 2017, Mazars, a leading international audit firm, was appointed to conduct the audit of 63 ward-of-court cases. The review showed that there were no significant losses incurred by these cases during the financial crisis and that virtually all of these cases had net realised gains when the units were sold. The significant investment returns from investment performance extended the available funds to meet ongoing care and maintenance in respect of these cases by a considerably longer period than would have been the case if the cases had not been invested in growth funds. In effect, the reduction in the available funds in certain cases to the point where they are likely to run out is not attributable to poor investment performance. Rather, it is due to a combination of other factors, including the level of expenditure incurred to care for the ward of court, the value of the compensation awarded by the court and the life expectancy of the ward. Therefore, the availability of a periodic payment to catastrophically injured persons is important in ensuring that the ward will have sufficient resources and will receive the appropriate level of care and assistance that will be required for the rest of his or her life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538"> With regard to the second recommendation, the Courts Service has informed me that the wards of court office commenced providing statements automatically to the committees of wards of court during the third quarter of 2017. These statements are high-level reports on the funds in court and the performance of the funds and, if more detailed reports are required at a later stage, they can be made available on request. I understand that many committees of wards of court have received two statements at this stage. The Courts Service will continue to send out statements to committees of wards of court on an annual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539"> The third recommendation relates to a number of Departments and is under consideration by my Department. My Department officials are engaging with the relevant Departments to discuss and establish any action possible on foot of this recommendation. I understand that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, through its own resources and its funding of the Citizens Information Board, provides timely, accurate and accessible information on its supports through a variety of methods and these are available to the committees of wards of court. I believe that since annual statements are being issued to the committees on a regular basis, the eligibility of the ward for income supports from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection should be noted prior to the depletion of the ward's funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540"> The fourth recommendation concerns the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the upcoming changes to the wards of court system. It is anticipated that commencement of most of the provisions of this Act will take place during 2020. Each adult ward will be reviewed in accordance with the new system. A ward who is found to have capacity will be discharged from wardship. A ward who continues to have capacity needs will be discharged from wardship and offered the support option most appropriate to his or her needs. In this regard, the Government is making the necessary financial resources available for the setting up of the decision support service through an allocation of a sum of €3.5 million in this year's Department of Justice and Equality Vote. I wish to confirm that the commencement of most of the provisions of the Act will take place next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541"> With regard to the fifth recommendation, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposals on the audit of wards of court funds by the Comptroller and Auditor General is incompatible with the Constitution's architecture and is not consistent with Article 33.1. The advice of the Attorney General is that wardship funds are not public funds but are subject to the control and supervision of the High Court. These are essential obstacles to enabling the Comptroller and Auditor General to take on responsibility for auditing such funds. The advice of the Attorney General is also that legislating for Comptroller and Auditor General oversight of these funds could undermine the independence of the Judiciary and the administration of justice under Articles 34.1 and 35.2 of the Constitution. The Courts Service has advised that there is already independent oversight of the wards of court funds. The funds are independently audited by external auditors in compliance with the generally accepted auditing standards and the audited statements are published.</p>
          <p eId="para_1542"> Under the sixth recommendation, the committee called upon the Government to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities without further delay. I am pleased to note that Ireland has now ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the convention came into force for Ireland on 19 April 2018. The optional protocol will be ratified following the completion of the first reporting cycle under the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1543"> I am pleased to have had the opportunity of being here. I hope that I have addressed many of the issues raised in the report. I am happy to listen to any further observations or submissions that members of the committee or more generally Members of the House have to make in the course of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1547">I have listened carefully to what the Minister has had to say. I am sure the same contribution to a debate like this could have been given in previous years. Nothing has changed. The fact of the matter is that wards of court and those who campaign for transparency in the system have been at this for years, dating back to before 2002. Certainly, the matter was raised in 2002 at the Committee of Public Accounts. Right now, people can read on the website some tales from individual families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548"> The parents of one family are 73 and 74 years of age. They are now caring for their son, who has €25,000, though he was granted €516,000 in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549"> The lack of information being given out to families is a disgrace and needs to be addressed. The Minister's suggestions about the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 do not address the efficiency of the wards of court, or the accountability and transparency that is required, in any significant way. The Minister, in his speech, erected roadblocks at every turn for families who want basic rights applied both to the fund and to the administration of their cases. Those rights include a right to information, a right not to be obstructed in the courts by the General Solicitor, a right to understand how the money is invested, a right to the statements and a right for family members to participate with the fund and the individual concerned in a meaningful and constructive way. They have a right to basic information without having to pay for it, fight for it, or go to court for it. One family member of a ward of court had to pay €30,000 to go through the courts to get some input into the care of their loved one. If the Minister thinks that is fair in this day and age, then we are seriously out of kilter with the demands of the families concerned, the wishes of the Committee of Public Accounts of years ago and the wishes of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality now. I commend the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for the work it has undertaken and the report it has provided to this House. However, there seems to be an unwillingness to address the central issues, namely, accountability for the funds, the involvement of families and the fact that the HSE in particular continues to involve people in this system. It is not working and does not work for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550"> Wards of court are now trying to exist on disability allowance, despite the fact that they were given awards in court on the basis that they were needed for their future care. Those funds were poorly invested and managed by the State and there is little explanation of the fees and charges involved. The people who are suffering are the very ones who should not suffer, because they were given these awards by courts in the past. It has nothing to do with the judges or what they awarded, but has to do with the management and transparency of the fund. It is rather ironic that the Minister says the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot audit these funds for legal reasons, as they are not public funds, because when I introduced the Court Funds Administration Bill in May 2017, the Minister supported it. It is currently on Second Stage in this House. If the Minister really wanted to do something about it, he could take that Bill and the commitment he gave by allowing its passage to Second Stage and pass it. He may amend it as he wishes, if that makes it work better. He could also bring forward legislation to allow the independent office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit these accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551"> There are two strands to this debate. One is the right of individuals to information so they and their families know where the money is invested and what the charges and fees are about. There should also be constructive engagement with the General Solicitor and the system itself to ensure families are put at ease and are comforted that the best is being done. They also need an explanation of how these funds were managed and why they are now reduced to a level where they cannot pay for the care supports needed by the individuals concerned. If the State were to deem it necessary to address those funds because of the funds' bad management, then it should also be prepared to offer top-up funding in some of those cases. The Minister has said that Mazar's audited approximately 60 of these funds, but anyone in the Public Gallery today will tell the Minister a different story. He should ask them how they are treated regarding being given basic information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552"> It is surely a reflection on this House that we are still looking at an Act from the 1800s which uses language such as "lunatic" and so on. In a modern democracy, and for the sake of society and the weakest people in it, we should at least be giving them their proper titles. We should have proper structures for families to engage with. Three to four years is too long to wait for the implementation of the 2015 Act. Parents are now moving on in years and the logistics of transferring funds and doing whatever is necessary according to that Act adds to those years. All they want is for the Minister to strip away the bureaucracy and the commentary of how it cannot be done and to look at the basic courtesy families require. The Minister needs to address the basic information they need and deliver it to them in a sensible, constructive way. They should have input into the management of the care of the individuals concerned and should be given information so as to understand the extent of the funds left and how they are going to be managed. It is far too adversarial a system for families who are trying to engage constructively. That could be taken out of the system with a little common sense and we could begin a process of treating people fairly and delivering what everyone in every sector of society demands - information, transparency and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553"> If we are acting as a Parliament on behalf of the people of this country, I appeal to the Minister to meet those who have been campaigning for this change for a number of years before he leaves this Chamber today. He needs to listen to the other side of the story, rather than relying on the official side that is delivered to him. He should understand their concerns and their desire to help and assist loved ones who cannot help themselves. We owe it to them. Both the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts of yesteryear have highlighted this. Everyone is appealing to the Minister to cut the nonsense, apply common sense and deliver the basic requirements campaigners are asking for. Nothing else will do and anything else is just fobbing them off and sending the fool further.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1554">Many people contact the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality asking the committee to conduct investigations into legitimate grievances they have, either as individuals or as organisations. Unfortunately, the committee does not have the capacity to conduct investigations into everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555">By necessity, we must be selective about the issues in respect of which we decide to have public hearings and produce reports. I am very pleased that one of the areas the committee decided to inquire into and report on involved the issues raised regarding wards of court. We know from Deputy McGuinness that there have been previous inquiries by committees of this House into issues associated with wards of court. The Committee of Public Accounts conducted a number of inquiries in respect of it. We know that after our own inquiry, the National Safeguarding Committee produced a report on the wards of court system. I think everyone in this House agrees with its findings, namely, that the system is a 19th century system that is archaic and unsuitable for the 21st century. I commend the people who urged and requested the committee to conduct public hearings into this matter and I thank all of the individuals who came before the committee during our public hearings. What stands out most in my memory from those hearings were the families of the wards of court who came before us and told very gripping stories about how they found themselves in extremely difficult circumstances because of the great trauma they suffered and expressed their belief that the wards of court system did not serve them or their loved ones well. </p>
          <p eId="para_1556"> We spend many hours in this House talking about personal injuries actions and how we need to reduce awards in such actions. Earlier today, we passed the Judicial Council Bill 2017 to establish personal injuries guidelines. In recent years, the assumption has taken hold that anyone taking a case in respect of a personal injuries claim has a questionable motive. If we want a more legitimate and balanced assessment of the issue of personal injuries claims, we need look no further than the people who unfortunately find themselves wards of court. The wards of court system operates to protect those who are unquestionably the most vulnerable in society. In many instances, they are young people who sustained catastrophic injuries at birth and need support and financial damages to ensure that they can maintain themselves throughout their lives. They are made wards of court and get a settlement of money as a result of negligence, admitted or otherwise, paid by another side. The reason they are made wards of court is their mental infirmity - the fact that they cannot manage their own affairs. The purpose of the wards of court system is to ensure that there is an independent, court based process whereby the affairs of these people can be independently managed. </p>
          <p eId="para_1557"> Where conflict arises is in respect of the family members who sometimes feel they have been excluded from the wards of court process. Many of the issues that have arisen in respect of these cases can be traced to other issues aside from issues of concern in the Office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court. One of the problems is that if people are given an award of damages at a very young age for injuries sustained at a very young age, it can be extremely difficult for a court to calculate the level of damages that are required to sustain these people throughout their lives when it is not known at the time of the award how long their lives will be, the nature of the demands they face and the cost of inflation in years to come. Fortunately, in recent years, we have introduced legislation that will give effect to periodic payments. In many instances, a person who has been injured, goes to court and is awarded a sum of money by way of damages by that court can now receive periodic payments. The court will have a more accurate assessment of how much money is required for that person throughout his or her life so that he or she does not find himself or herself in a situation many people who came before us have found themselves. Let us talk about that situation. It can involve persons who were awarded a sum of money to ensure that they could be cared for throughout their lives finding themselves at a point in their lives where that money has simply been dissipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558"> The committee heard much evidence about what happened to the money. There is no doubt that we received conflicting and diverging evidence as to whether the funds were managed prudently or effectively. The Minister spoke about the Mazars report. We heard from the families who have a different point of view on the competence of the management of the money. It was for that reason that we mentioned in our recommendations having heard conflicting and diverging evidence as to how prudently and effectively funds for wards of court have been managed. As a result, we made a recommendation that there should be a comprehensive audit of cases identified by the Justice for Wards group of funds where funds had been significantly depleted during the years of the financial crisis. In fact, we specified those years as the two years between 2007 and 2009. I do not know whether there was any financial mismanagement. The Mazars report seems to suggest that there was no mismanagement but credible evidence was put forward by the persons who appeared before the committee and it was on that basis that we made our recommendation. We also recommended that financial statements be provided to the wards on an annual basis or even more frequently. The Minister has indicated that this is now being done but we need to ensure it is done regularly and consistently. </p>
          <p eId="para_1559"> We also called upon the various State agencies to work together to identify the individuals at risk and draw up contingency plans to provide for their essential needs, including healthcare and accommodation. This is something for which we have a real responsibility. If it is the case that wards of court find that their funds have dried up, the State has a responsibility to them and we need to ensure that they are protected throughout the remaining years of their lives. I note that we have spoken about the legislation that will establish the new design support service. It is imperative that this service is made effective and is properly funded and resourced so it can carry out the important functions required of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560"> One of our recommendations was that the Attorney General be asked to consider whether the Comptroller and Auditor General could audit the funds in the Office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court. I note the Minister's comments and the advice of the Attorney General. I do not believe our recommendation could have gone any further than that. We said it was subject to the view of the Attorney General and it appears to be the case that these funds will not be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This means, however, that we need some system in which the families have confidence to audit those funds on a frequent basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561"> I note that we have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but our recommendation on this matter emphasises that there are very many archaic aspects to the legislation on the Statute Book that still refer in archaic language to people suffering from lunacy. We must ensure this language is changed for good and does not come back. </p>
          <p eId="para_1562"> I commend the families of the wards of court who appeared before the committee and I thank the committee for the work it did. We have limited powers as a committee. All we can do is have hearings and produce a report. We are not in control of the executive arm of Government. All we can do is make recommendations in respect of the matter. Some of the recommendations are being implemented and I urge the Minister to ensure that all of them are implemented as quickly as possible in order that we can provide some level of comfort to the people who find themselves in this very difficult position. We will never be able to provide them with the full level of comfort they want but we have a responsibility to try to provide as much comfort as we can.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1563">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin, the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Justice and Equality, and all the members of the committee who produced this fine report some time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564">Above all, I thank the members of the families of wards of court, many of whom are with us today and have been in regular contact with us as Members of the Oireachtas in relation to their ongoing difficulties in the funding of necessary services to provide for their family members who are wards of court. Certainly, there have been major difficulties in relation to the funding, despite awards being made by the courts some time ago and being managed by the Courts Service. That is one of the principal reasons we are here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565"> I acknowledge also the work of Inclusion Ireland, which has been in contact with us and which has asked for a fully independent review of the management of the Courts Service wards of court funds. It also is seeking an independent review of the manner in which the Courts Service interacts with the wards of court and their families. It includes many concerns the families have. This is important because everybody feels they are shut out, excluded and not consulted. They are told they have no real business here and that the service is responsible for the wards of court. We have seen it in several cases. We all know individual cases where this is so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566"> Above all, we need adequate funding in the Estimates to allow the full commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. I am told it will cost €9 million to get it fully up and running. I acknowledge the Minister stated here today there is an allocation of €3.5 million. It is a start but it will not allow the service get up to the capacity we require as urgently as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567"> While I am not a medical practitioner and I am merely going on the experience of those I have met, persons can become wards of court because of capacity issues, as a result of accidents or in many cases due to catastrophic injuries suffered at birth. People have told me that they went to court, the award was made and at the last minute before leaving the court they were told the court was making a member of their family a ward of court. All solicitors know that this is the situation because the person, clearly, if he or she is getting such an award for a catastrophic injury, has not capacity. By definition, the courts know that they must deal with that issue. However, the family members tend not to have been informed. Many of them get a shock and do not really understand what this is about. It gets dropped on them at the last minute. There is no debating it in the courts. The facility is part of the courts system. One of the reasons we are here is the separation of powers between the courts and the rest of public life, including the democratically elected national Parliament. The matter has to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568"> There have been some cases recently and I have been dealing with a couple of cases. The Minister provided the information for persons who want to get out of being wards of court. There were seven requests last year and seven the previous year, all of which have been granted. That is where the persons go for medical tests and it is deemed that they have capacity. It means, in some cases, not specifically the cases that the families brought to our attention, that the HSE has been too quick off the mark in the situation where it sees an old person in a nursing home or a person who needs to be brought into a nursing home and it is not satisfied that person will be looked after by next of kin, and it moves quickly. There is a closed shop once one gets into the court dealing with these issues. The HSE gets somebody made a ward of court and sometimes the family, extended family or the neighbours who have been looking after the person might not be aware of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569"> I take slight issue with what the Minister for Justice and Equality stated about the independence of the courts, these not being public funds and the Comptroller and Auditor General not being allowed audit them. Wearing my hat as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I come at this from a different angle. This information might be a surprise because the committee to which I refer discussed this as recently as today with the State Claims Agency. That agency pays out €350 million per annum on the various compensation claims, most of which are due to medical negligence. I refer to the type of cases where catastrophic injuries happened at birth. A high proportion of the money the State Claims Agency pays out, which is taxpayers' money, is paid directly to the Courts Service in respect of wards of court. The Minister might not be aware that the majority of the funds going into the wards of court fund come straight from the taxpayer through the State Claims Agency. Most cases, including the case we heard about yesterday, involve public funds going into the wards of court fund. I accept that when there is a car accident, a private insurance company is involved and in such a situation it is not public funds. We must approach it differently. I take the view that if somebody does not have capacity - this should be dealt with under the new legislation, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 - the funding should not be put into the Courts Service system at all and should be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, which is the agency that manages and invests everything on behalf of the State. The State Claims Agency, which is the agency which negotiates the settlements in court cases, is the best placed organisation to manage this. I accept the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot go in and audit anything in the Courts Service because there is a separation of power between the Courts Service and the Oireachtas. That is fine. The answer is we should not have the funds under the Courts Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570"> When one thinks about it, who are the judges or the Courts Service to know anything about managing investments? I accept they hire expertise. However, it is still not their brief. Judges are legal practitioners making different categories of decisions every day of the week and they are not geared to manage public funds. We must take those funds out of the Courts Service. It is a burden on the Courts Service. It should not be dealing with these issues. Let those who manage funds manage funds and let the Courts Service and the courts do their job. When the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 fully gets up and running, we should move to the funds going to and being managed by the State where there is accountability and transparency. That could be done fairly promptly. It would probably be a more direct way of dealing with some of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1571"> I would also be concerned if the Courts Service has any role at all in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. I do not know whether the Act comes under the Department of Justice and Equality. I thought, because it refers to mental health, it should be under the Department of Health. When one thinks about it, most of those concerned are made wards of court on medical grounds. This should be done in the medical sphere and the funds should be managed by a State body, the job of which is to look after public funds. It is not the way people have been taking this debate but I ask that the matter be reconsidered in that light. The Minister correctly states in relation to the wards of court that it is matter for the deciding judge who exercises his judicial functions and one cannot cut across that when he or she sets an award in court. I accept the judge should make his or her decision and set the award, but he or she should be off the pitch thereafter and the management of those funds should not be under the stewardship of the judges. The judges have been involved in adjudicating and ruling on the level of the awards and they should have no further role in it. That is another way of going about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572"> The periodic awards is a good idea. The State Claims Agency told us at the Committee of Public Accounts two hours ago that it has made three to date. I hope that is a start. I understand from what its representatives stated that there is provision for periodic awards but it is always up to the injured party to decide whether he or she wants to accept it or not. It is not compulsory. People have an option when it comes to that as well. The lump-sum issue can be dealt with based on the periodic awards, if people want to go that route.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573"> The question is who manages these funds and who provides for these services. There has to be further engagement with the HSE because many of the major difficult cases are as a result of medical negligence. The HSE should have an ongoing commitment to the injured person for life if the injury is the result of medical negligence by an employee or group of employees who are involved in the delivery and where there was negligence. The HSE should always have a monitoring role in the provision of services into the future. We are all aware of cases where there was no medical negligence, people got serious injuries or some other illness and required 24-7 nursing care, and the HSE provides that in a small number of cases. It is very expensive but the HSE has a role in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574"> I want to speak up generally on behalf of the wards of court and their families. Even though the families are not involved in theory, they are wholly involved in it every day. They need to be supported because they have been on a long campaign for a number of years and they want to see action on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575"> I accept the Minister's legislation is significant but some further changes need to be made to resolve this situation once and for all and take this issue out of the Courts Service for the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1576">I support the report of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in respect of wards of court. I congratulate the members and the Chairman, Deputy Ó Caoláin, on the job of work they have done in respect of the recommendations they have made. I listened very closely to the Minister's speech. If I was listening to this debate as a relative of a ward of court, I would ask myself if I had heard anything to give me some semblance of hope for the future in terms of the issues and recommendations that have been aired. The answer to that question is that the jury is still very much out in terms of seeking closure to many of the issues raised in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1577"> The Minister contends, in respect of the advice of the Attorney General, that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1578"> [T]he Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposals on the audit of wards of court funds by the Comptroller and Auditor General is incompatible with the Constitution's architecture and is not consistent with Article 33.1. The advice is that wardship funds are not public funds [that is the key line in that sentence] but are subject to the control and supervision of the High Court. These are essential obstacles to enabling the Comptroller and Auditor General to take on responsibility for auditing such funds. The advice ... is also that legislating for Comptroller and Auditor General oversight of these funds could undermine the independence of the Judiciary and the administration of justice under Articles 34.1 and 35.2 of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1579">In the absence of an alternative to that recommendation, I ask that the Government come forward with a set of proposals to ensure that this particular recommendation is addressed. If we take the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General at face value, given that the Committee of Public Accounts has endorsed the position of Inclusion Ireland in respect of that recommendation, some sort of architecture, to use the Minister's word, should be put in place to ensure that the recommendation in respect of auditing is dealt with. This is germane to the issue at hand. There is a responsibility on the Government of the day to deal with this very point. The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has made a set of recommendations, which are followed by a particular recommendation by the Committee of Public Accounts. If the advice of the Attorney General is contrary to those recommendations, something has to be put in place to meet the needs of the people who want to see transparency in respect of the auditing process. If people perceive that there is something wrong with the process, that is enough. The perception must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1580"> A key point is made by Inclusion Ireland. I acknowledge the work it and Justice for Wards have done on this. In an email I received today, Inclusion Ireland states that, with regard to the funds that are lost, the Committee on Justice and Equality asked for an independent review to take place, including those funds identified by Justice for Wards. The email further states that the review that took place by Mazars almost immediately after the report was published looked at 63 cases, but it is unclear whose cases were looked at and whether those cases were representative. That is why Inclusion Ireland is calling for a fully independent review. This is vital. It is a reasonable request and should be acceded to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581"> The qualitative relationship and the culture that exists around the relationship between relations, loved ones and the Courts Service is something that needs to be addressed. In the minds of loved ones and relatives, there is a serious lack of empathy and sympathy. That is how they perceive it and it has been the experience of some of the people who have interacted with the Courts Service. This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Inclusion Ireland speaks to this very issue. The report of the justice committee called for a review of the Courts Service's disposition towards and interaction with wards and their families. Inclusion Ireland has experience of engaging with the Office of the Wards of Court and supporting other people who have also been in contact. Communication is difficult with the office, according to Inclusion Ireland, which states that it has been aware of families who have had communication cut off completely when they queried matters, families who received no advance warning that their fund was about to run out, and a refusal to share documents, even with the person. Data protection is used as a block. On one occasion, Inclusion Ireland was supporting a woman who was a ward of court and the office refused to provide her with information about the court orders on the basis that she would not understand it. I do not question the<i>
						</i>bona fides of Inclusion Ireland as an advocacy organisation. I am taking at face value and accepting what it has stated to me in this email. Inclusion Ireland states that this is contrary to natural justice and a breach of public duty. Therefore, the second issue I want to see addressed is the nature of the relationship and the culture that exists. It is clear that there needs to be a paradigm shift in ensuring that people are treated with respect and that their dignity is recognised. It does not take funds or moneys to do that. All it takes is a change in behaviour and I do not think it is an unreasonable request.</p>
          <p eId="para_1582"> I agree with the points made by other speakers. I have been involved in this for a reasonably short time and am not a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. However, I feel there is more work to be done. I have listened carefully to my colleagues on all sides of the House where they seek the repeal of the Lunacy Act 1871 as soon as possible and a review of all wards within three years. The Minister has gone some way on that, in fairness to him, but it needs to be expedited. The full commencement is also sought of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, with a commitment of €9 million in the budget process. Again, from a financial point of view, the Minister has gone some way to making funds available for that. This is a non-partisan issue which could conceivably affect any of us at any time in our lives. It is important that we as an Oireachtas do everything we can to ensure that these issues are addressed. I daresay that there is more work to be done in respect of this issue. I commend the work of the committee. Work needs to be done on the guidelines requiring a consistent standard of assessment for wardship. There are issues in respect of the right to independent non-legal advocacy. People need advocates. There is the issue of the inaccessibility of court documents and the issue of the review of wards. One point that has also been made to me is that once a person is made a ward, there is no recognition that a ward may have capacity to make particular decisions himself or herself. The Minister also speaks to that point but we need to do more work on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583"> The Labour Party is fully supportive of the recommendations of the report. We need to parse further the words of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584">We need to have a further deliberation within the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality or in the House in respect of some of the legal issues that are outstanding. This has been a very useful opportunity to air these issues. I acknowledge the work done by the families, by the advocacy organisations and by the members of the justice committee, without whom we would not have this debate today. A good job of work has been done in raising the consciousness of the issue among the wider membership of the Dáil.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1585">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. One has to look at this matter in the context of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland has ratified. When discussing the ratification of that convention, many Members made the point that it would be inconsistent for Ireland to ratify it without actually putting in place the nuts and bolts that actually make a difference and that this would have to be done in a timely way. There were concerns at the time in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586"> While it is welcome that the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 provides commitments on a number of key objectives, there are areas it does not address comprehensively or where matters remain outstanding. I understand there will be a mid-term review of the national disability inclusion strategy by the end of this year, which will consider ways that it may need to be revised to ensure, as far as possible within that timeframe, a full implementation of the UN convention. That would seem to be an opportunity to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1587"> One such area must be the operation of the wards of court system. The Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality have spent a significant amount of time on this issue. It has been frustrating because the area is one step removed. This is the very point being made, for example with regard to auditing by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Committee of Public Accounts found it is not under its remit, the Comptroller and Auditor General does not report to the committee on the wards of court system, and therefore its members do not have the information to interrogate it. A system of interrogation needs to happen where one can be absolutely sure that it is not just a dry report and one can tease things out. This is why the demand was made for that kind of oversight. It was very welcome that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality took ownership of preparing this report and it was quite proper that the Committee of Public Accounts did not duplicate that work. Today is the opportunity for us to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588"> The establishment of the decision support service is critically important. The Minister has said this would be established and work on it is intended to commence in 2020. This will be provided over a three-year period, with a handover to the decision support service for the existing wards of court system. Will the Minister indicate if this handover is intended to be gradual? Money is going into the system, which is budgeted for, and more money has been promised and then it would be concluded. How is that intended to happen in reality? Must the service be completely up and running or will taking on responsibility be achieved through a gradual rolling out or moving across from the current system? Perhaps the Minister will address this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589"> While the new decision support system is in line with the UN convention and therefore is very welcome, in reality a four-year timeline for the changeover will seem like a lifetime for people who are in need of a decision sooner. It creates significant difficulties, especially for people who are older and looking after a family member, who usually is a younger person, and providing care. These are not disinterested parties. Is it possible for this changeover to happen quicker? I believe it must be done quicker. What are the nuts and bolts of this process that would mean it could take that length of time?</p>
          <p eId="para_1590"> The Minister will be aware there are legitimate reasons for many people not wishing to enter the wards of court system. Some of these reasons include a feeling of loss of control, areas of secrecy and the exclusion of the person's family members on whom he or she relies to be his or her support. They are key people who make decisions on their behalf and who they trust. As has been referenced here on several occasions, there is also the fact that we use language such as Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591"> Other concerns may not be as emotive but are certainly important. The Committee of Public Accounts has written reports on such issues, namely, the financial arrangement and management of people's funds. I agree with Deputy Fleming with regard to the people who have specialist expertise in this area. There are large question marks in this regard and people want to be satisfied about how money has been used, how it has been invested and if it has worked to the benefit of the person who is the ward of court. If there is a doubt on that, which there is, I believe it is legitimate that such doubts need to be fully vindicated. There is no external complaints system for the oversight of the wards of court at present and it is very hard to see how one can guarantee accountability in circumstances where people cannot have sight of how the system is working. The courts can be a very cold place and by their very nature are rules based. We need to see the person at the centre of all of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592"> As the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has examined in detail the issues and has given solid recommendations, the changeover from the wards of court system to the new decision support system, as recommended under the UN convention, must be completed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593"> The courts take quite a paternalistic "we know best" approach when a person is trying to plan the care of a loved one. That person does not quite know what there is to work with and, for example, does not know what supports will be available from the State. It creates a degree of stress that could be dealt with by additional information and an assurance that there is proper management and proper investment for funds that are available. Even having the knowledge of what is available will be important for such persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594"> Significantly, the report charts an approach but there is a difference between influence and power. We are acutely aware of that on this side of the House. The power to do things lies on the Minister's side of the House. If one thing was to come from today's debate, it should be a commitment by the Minister to an earlier delivery of the changeover to the new system, which is nestled in the UN convention. It is critical that this be accelerated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1595">I thank the members of the Committee on Justice and Equality for all their work, in particular the chairperson. I also welcome the visitors to the Visitors Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596"> I want to put this in perspective. When we are talking about money invested by the Courts Service, I note its annual report for 2018 referred to almost €2 billion, or €1.929 billion to be precise, and I am sure it has gone up since then. That is not all for wards of court and it includes a number of different categories, including residential redress board cases, minors, the compensation fund and so on. Under that fund, there are 2,864 wards of court and the value of that is €1.38 billion, which is not insubstantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597"> If we are talking about that type of money, then we have to talk about accountability and supervision. I am acutely aware, given my own background, of the separation of powers and the role of the courts and I want absolutely no interference with them. That said, we are talking about accountability. The Minister said the accounts are audited and that that is oversight. If that was the case, there would be no need for the Committee of Public Accounts to sit every Thursday because all of the accounts are audited. However, we still have oversight through the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am not sure why the advice of the Attorney General took nearly 20 years, given that, going back to 2000-02, it was mooted that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have jurisdiction over these accounts. Repeatedly, different reports said that should happen but it has taken this long to get the legal advice. The Minister might clarify precisely when the legal advice was asked for and given.</p>
          <p eId="para_1598"> In regard to public moneys, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has made the point that it is public money. Some of it is certainly public money but some of it is not. Some of it belongs to people who, for one reason or another, had to be made wards of court and their estate and their money was minded by the courts. However, much of the other money is public money that is awarded. I ask the Minister to clarify when he got the advice, when he asked for it and, moreover, what changes there may be to that advice in the context of the 2015 Act, when it is fully implemented, given we will no longer have wards of court. As I understand it, every single ward of court will be discharged, albeit with different levels of assistance. What are the consequences and implications of that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1599"> This report of February 2018, which has already been gone into in detail by Deputy Ó Caoláin, contains six recommendations. That report came on top of a report by the National Safeguarding Committee which is dated December 2017, although I do not know when it was published because there is often a difference between the date on the report and the date of publication, as we know from the Health Service Executive and Tusla, in that one does not bear a resemblance to the other. In any event, that detailed report, "Review of current practice in the use of wardship for adults in Ireland", had 18 findings and 38 recommendations, to which I will return. The report from the Committee of Public Accounts in July 2015 had six recommendations and the report which is under discussion today has six more recommendations and, of course, all of the recommendations overlap. There are also recommendations from Inclusion Ireland, which I also thank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600"> I have put this in perspective in regard to the numbers and the money. Let me put it in perspective in regard to the Council of Europe which way back in 1999 set out:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1601">The fundamental principle underlying all the other principles, is respect for the dignity of each person as a human being. The laws, procedures and practices relating to the protection of incapable adults [I have a difficulty with that wording] shall be based on respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1602">A recent judgment from England, which has gone further than us in its protection of people with disabilities in this particular area, means they come under the UK Comptroller and Auditor General, although I realise there is a different system under a written constitution. In 2015, Judge Peter Jackson stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1603">As the Act and the European Convention make clear, a conclusion that a person lacks decision-making capacity is not an 'off-switch' for his rights and freedoms. To state the obvious, the wishes and feelings, beliefs and values of people with a mental disability are as important to them as they are to anyone else, and may even be more important. </p>
          <p eId="para_1604">Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to paternalistic attitudes. That certainly jumped out at me, as a woman, as I read all of these reports. Yes, we have made progress and we have the Act of 2015, although, unfortunately, almost four years later it has not been implemented and we still have no definitive date, although the Minister has told us it is 2020. There will then be another three years of a rollout, where all the wards of court will be reviewed. Of course, that legislation came after a very long delay. We are talking about legislation going back over approximately 150 years and using inappropriate words like "lunacy" and "lunatics". It has taken a huge effort to get as far as 2015. We were disgraced across the world because while we signed the UN Convention in 2007, we did not ratify it until 2018 and I understand we were the last country of the European Union to ratify it. We still have not ratified the protocol and, of course, without ratifying the protocol, although the Minister might correct me on this, there is no remedy if somebody goes forward under that UN convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605"> In regard to the language used, there was talk last week about the mental health legislation of 2001 and about the need to review it because it is not up to date. The extraordinary thing is that there are a whole raft of protections for somebody with a mental illness under that legislation, although it is still inadequate in the 21st century. However, much more protection is offered than is offered to any ward of court. When we look at a ward of court, we see a judge making a decision in the best interests of that ward, but the voice of that ward is really never heard. That ward is not even given a copy of the court order and I understand he or she is not given a copy of the medical reports, because the judge making the decision and the whole system think it is better that somebody who is going to be made a ward of court should have as little knowledge as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606"> I have looked through the recommendations. I mentioned the Comptroller and Auditor General and why the advice is coming now and what it is based on. There is an overlap with all of the recommendations. I want to highlight the findings of the National Safeguarding Committee because they include the recommendations made in the justice committee report. As I said, there are 18 findings, all of which are worth looking at. Although I will not read all of them, it is stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1607">The Voice of the Ward is not heard during an application for wardship...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1608">There is no automatic system of providing Respondents (prospective Wards in an application for wardship) with independent legal or non-legal advocacy... </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1609">When a person is made a Ward, he or she does not receive the order of the court. In one case, a Ward requested a copy of the order but the Office of Wards of Court declined to give it to them partly on the grounds that it would be difficult to understand. [That is some communication and some decision-making skills.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1610">There is no system of review of Wards. There is no system of unannounced visits or otherwise... There is an excessive reliance by the Office of Wards of Court and the General Solicitor on information from the Ward’s carers...</p>
          <p eId="para_1611">I wish I had more time. The findings are worth looking at and there are also all of the recommendations. The findings continue:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1612">There is no transparent protocol of complaints to the Office of Wards of Court...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1613">There is considerable confusion and lack of understanding around the Ward of Court system and what it means for individuals. </p>
          <p eId="para_1614">I would always say the HSE has a conflict of interest or at least it should be closely examining whether it has a conflict of interest on each occasion where it brings an application. The findings also state: "The HSE has no transparent protocols about when and why it will instigate wardship proceedings and also has no centralised guidelines", and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1615"> We then come back to the Act of 2015, which has not been implemented. Shame on us that it has taken so long. At this point in time, more applications are being made for wards of court that are absolutely unnecessary and will have to be undone when the legislation is finally in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1616">It does not make sense on any level, but what does not make sense at all is the feeling on the ground among the most vulnerable people in regard to the communication by the Courts Service. I understand their point of view. I have read what they had to say in regard to the losses and the Mazars report. I can see their argument. There are no grounds for the absence of good communication, particularly as we enacted the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which will be rolled out, presumably, in 2020. These are issues that should be taken very seriously and there are many more. </p>
          <p eId="para_1617"> I support the committee's recommendations, which are very basic. I understand that the recommendation that this fund be brought under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a little complicated but why was this not made clear long before now? Can we have clarity around it now?</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_376">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1618">I thank all the Deputies for their contributions and I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin, in particular, and his colleagues for their work on this most important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1619"> A number of very serious allegations have been made, in particular by Deputy McGuinness, and I am keen that they would be dealt with. It is not the first time I have heard Deputy McGuinness make these allegations. The Deputy spoke of the need for accountability, with which I agree, but I challenge him on the basis that such accountability is in place. The Deputy also spoke of the need to involve the families. I agree and again I point to such procedure and practice being in place. The Deputy alleges poor investment. I say, "Not so". I ask him for evidence and I point to the Mazars report. Deputy McGuinness did not give the evidence. I have heard him make these allegations time and again. I ask him to engage with information that he seems to have. I expect that a responsible Deputy would have evidence and information to back up allegations of a very serious nature, which Deputy McGuinness continues to make. He makes allegations of bad management. Again, I say "Not so" and I point to the investment performance. I reiterate that the Courts Service is happy to engage and keen to be apprised of evidence which Deputy McGuinness, or any other Deputy who has raised this issue, are in a position to provide, or indeed any information. As Minister, it is my expectation that the Courts Service will engage. It wishes to engage and it is happy to engage. I would regard it as a function of the Courts Service to engage having regard to its involvement in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1620"> Deputy O'Callaghan is right in his commentary on the Mazars report and the review. The 63 cases identified are cases that had been identified by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. The need for engagement was also implied in Deputy O'Callaghan's contribution. I would ask people who remain dissatisfied and upset to engage to ensure that a process of information can be provided and that questions can be answered, because I believe they should be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621"> I say to Deputy Fleming - I am sure he will understand this - that it is not the judges who manage the court funds. There is an engagement on the part of professional fund managers. They act as advisers and they are appointed by the Courts Service. Again, they are people who are engaged in a thoroughly professional capacity. This is a point that was also referred to by Deputy Catherine Murphy. On fund governance and performance, I see no reason we cannot be satisfied that the management, governance and performance compares favourably with international best practice. I do not accept Deputy Fleming's criticism of the Courts Service. It is not only unfounded, it is somewhat unfair. The Deputy mentioned, as did Deputy Catherine Murphy, the role of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA. Both Deputies will be aware that there is a representative of the NTMA on the Courts Service investment committee, who brings a certain level of expertise and experience. On the role of the NTMA, again, I would point to ensuring best practice in the performance of appropriate duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622"> For the benefit of Deputy Sherlock and anybody else who may not be clear on this issue, the 63 cases which form the subject matter of the Mazars report were those cases which sold units from the growth fund during our financial crisis. If any cases were to incur losses, I believe they would be captured in this group. Again, I would refer people to the Mazars report and the independence of that report. However, as well as the 63 cases which were captured, I would remind members of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality that requests were also made to interested parties to identify any other cases that might be the subject matter of questions or that might be appropriate for a further review. If there were issues by way of further supporting information and documentation, my understanding was that they would have been dealt with had the information been forthcoming. I would ask people to engage. I would ask Deputies who have been engaged on this issue for some time to engage with the appropriate authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623"> I want to assure Deputy Catherine Murphy that preparations are well under way in respect of the new regime. I am keen to ensure that the timeframe within which the appropriate new structures are to be set in train will be as minimal as possible and that every effort will be made to advance matters. In this regard, I point to the high level steering group that has been established. Deputy Fleming is right that there is a role for a number of stakeholders and Departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service. Recently, my Department funded a number of researchers for the National Disability Authority, NDA, to do work on codes of practice and arrangements. The Mental Health Commission has engaged a consultancy firm to develop a detailed costed plan to operationalise, as soon as possible, the decision support service. In June of last year, my Department engaged an external legal expert to assist in the preparation of the draft regulations. That is an important body of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1624">The issues that Deputy Connolly referred to will be addressed in the context of the new regime when the new Act is fully operational. Work is under way to ensure that will take place as quickly as possible. It is important that the new regime be specifically designed to meet the needs of people with age-related conditions, intellectual disabilities, acquired brain injuries and mental health issues. The Act offers an appropriate range of services to allow for support options to assist people in maximising their decision-making capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625"> I regard the issues raised in this debate with the utmost seriousness. I thank the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts before that for engaging on this issue. Having listened to Members and acknowledged a measure of dissatisfaction on the part of some, notwithstanding the preparation of the new regime and the Mazars report, I am keen to ask the Courts Service to consider if a further review might be warranted because I need to ensure that we have a system that families have confidence in, especially people who are dealing with wards of court, all of whom are in a position of great vulnerability. I ask families of those involved who still have a grievance if they would be in a position to provide evidence and details on the matter of the depletion of funds. I will ask the Courts Service to continue to engage to ensure that outstanding issues can be dealt with.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_377">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2019-07-04T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1626">I thank the Minister and colleagues who have participated in this important debate. I would like to reflect on a number of points. I welcome the initiation of Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 last October, providing for periodic payments, which I believe is an important development that could constructively help to avoid some of the more serious situations that have given rise to the committee's address of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627"> In his opening remarks, the Minister went through a series of recommendations in the report. The first of his remarks related to an independent third party carrying out an examination of the particular committees or committee funding for certain wards of court. The Minister referred to the appointment or engagement by the Courts Service of Mazars. It is important that, in the Courts Service's attendance and subsequent correspondence with the committee, it advised us that it would take this step. On behalf of the committee, I wrote to the Courts Service and requested that it would not proceed but that it would allow the committee to complete its deliberations and formulate its recommendations, whereupon appropriate steps could be pursued. We would have, at all times, believed that it was essential that the identification and appointment of an independent third party to carry out such an examination would be by agreement between the Courts Service and the individuals represented by Justice for Wards. There was no such engagement or consultation; there was only exclusion. That is not what the joint committee wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1628"> It was regrettable and the committee found it unsatisfactory that the Courts Service proceeded as it did, ignoring its appeal, which was still in the process of considering this issue. The Courts Service acted unilaterally and with disrespect to the wishes of the joint committee, which it had only a short time previously appeared before as a witness on this issue. I do not question the professionalism of Mazars in carrying out its work but the process was flawed. It was contrary to the wishes of the committee and it excluded the Justice for Wards families. We believe that exercise should still be carried out and that the families should be fully involved. The Minister is asking for evidence to present but that request can best be made and fulfilled in the context of the full implementation, to the spirit and the letter, of the first recommendation in our report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1629"> On the recommendation on the issuing of financial statements and, following on from the presentation of the Courts Service at the committee, the issuance of annual financial statements, my understanding is that these are not statements so much as a statement of a figure or balance. In some instances, many of which apply to the families concerned, it does not include the full detail of activity over the relevant period, whether for 12 months or more frequently. That simply does not provide the transparency and information that the aggrieved families feel should be proffered. Statements are now being provided but more detailed information must be shared, showing full activity, deductions, taxes and so on that may apply in any period covered, at least annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_1630"> In the third recommendation, we talk about those wards who are in a perilous financial position with funds almost exhausted. I believe that it is not good enough to say that a State agency will respond to the needs of those affected. There needs to be a more proactive person or persons who have been identified to go to about the matter. Those people should have the necessary knowledge and skills to address those needs properly and assuage the fears of that body of parents and siblings who, moving on in life, have a real fear for the future of their loved one who does not have the capacity to speak up or provide for their own needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631">It is fine for those who can, but we are looking at people who do not have the capacity in the first instance, and we are looking at those around them who are concerned because of their time of life and who have given of their best years in the service of our society and in support of their loved ones. We need to simplify and to make things happen for them in a proactive way and there is no evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632"> Our view is that recommendation 4 on the new decision support service must be established and fully operational as soon as possible. The Minister states that most of the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act will be rolled out in 2020. That suggests to me that not all of the provisions of the Act will be rolled out in 2020. It is at the core of the appeal, which I make again on behalf of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, that we see real prioritisation to ensure the speediest possible progress of the introduction of a decision support service. That is at the very core of it. The Minister referenced in the course of his opening remarks that there was a Revised Estimate with an additional provision of funds to assist that project to move forward. The great fear is that in spite of the date for the introduction of the critical element at the core of the decision support service, it will not happen before the end of 2020, and like so much else it will drift on beyond it. We should not forget that there is a further delay period in terms of the transition from the wardship scheme into the decision support service that can go on for at least another three years. We are talking about at least another four and a half years down the road before some of the families will find themselves in a new situation and engagement. That is not good enough. The matter needs to be addressed with the speed and urgency that their time in life and the needs of their loved ones clearly demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633"> I wish to respond to what was said in response to recommendation 5 and the Attorney General advising that wardship funds are not public funds and that involvement by the Comptroller and Auditor General could undermine the independence of the courts and Judiciary. I noted that the Minister stated in his closing remarks that the fund managers or advisers are professional and outside the core functions of the Courts Service. They are not judges. I wonder at the advice of the Attorney General. The people who make the decisions on all of this are not members of the Judiciary. They are professionally employed to carry out specific functions, albeit by the Courts Service. I question the Attorney General's opinion that for the Comptroller and Auditor General to have oversight over the process would in any way undermine the independence of the courts and the Judiciary. That does not stand up and it really-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1635">I welcome that. I am making the point that I believe it could be revisited and re-evaluated. It is about having the political will to make it happen because it is something that has been identified not just by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality but, as other colleagues have indicated, going back over at least a couple of decades. We need to have certainty on the issue, and if it is possible, it is better to do it than always to say there is a reason not to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1636"> The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, was ratified in April 2018. It was also indicated to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality in January of that year by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, that there would be simultaneous ratification of the optional protocol, but that did not happen. It still has not happened. Having the UNCRPD without the optional protocol is like saying a person has certain rights but, unfortunately, he or she will not be able to enforce his or her entitlements as we are holding back on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637"> So much needs to be done. I appeal to the Minister to heed the very thoughtful contributions of Members here today and to be mindful of the great hurt the people in the Visitors Gallery bear with them daily because of the position their loved ones are in.</p>
