#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The strength of the Garda Síochána at the end of 2011 was just under 13,900, along with over 2,000 civilian support staff and over 800 Garda Reserve members.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of Garda retirements from the force in the first two months of this year is expected to be around 300.  To put that figure into context, in 2009 the number of retirements was 722, in 2010 it was 362 and last year it was 436.As the Deputy will be aware, these reductions form part of a wider programme aimed at reducing the size of the public service and will contribute to reducing expenditure and complying with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement.  Of course, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the force and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made right across the public sector in order to bring our public finances back into balance.Reductions in numbers, whether in the Garda Síochána or elsewhere in the public sector, must be accompanied by reform.  New efficiencies must be introduced so that even with reduced staffing levels the best possible service continues to be provided to the public.  That need for efficiency is what underlies the recent decision of the Garda Commissioner to close some Garda stations.  In coming to his decision, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and, of course, the level of activity in each Garda station.The key objective of the station closures was not simply, as some have suggested, to save relatively small amounts of cash on station maintenance or utilities, but rather to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources.  The Commissioner concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if these particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  Deputies who oppose the closure of any Garda stations are therefore opposing what in the professional judgment of the Garda Commissioner is a better use of Garda resources.The House might be interested to note that today I announced that the Government, at my request and with the sanction of the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform, had appointed two assistant commissioners, eight chief superintendents and 23 superintendents in An Garda Síochána.  In seeking these promotions, I was conscious of the need to enable the Garda Commissioner to fill key positions in the senior ranks, and to maintain both the investigative and also the management and supervisory capacity of the force.The Garda Commissioner has reiterated the commitment of the Garda Síochána to providing a professional and effective service to the community.  This will mean continuing to promote reform and introduce efficiencies.  The Commissioner will have my full support in this regard.

Could he confirm that a so-called transition team has been established in the Department of Justice and Equality?  When was it established, who makes up the team, and what are its terms of reference?Reference was made to the announced closure of 39 stations.  The Minister indicated in January that a further range of stations would be closed during 2012.  Will it be the 2013 budget before the Minister has that list or will it be an ongoing process?On cost savings, which the Minister cited previously as one of the reasons we need to close Garda stations, he corresponded with me to say that the running costs for individual Garda stations are not available because they are compiled by district, not by station.  It is no wonder he cannot provide a figure for savings made on the closure of each station when he cannot give a figure for the cost of running each station.On the opposition of Deputies to the closure of Garda stations------

I direct the Minister to the comments he made about the reduction of Garda numbers at a Garda station in Rathfarnham.  He was most concerned about the potential closure of the station.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	6	As the Deputy is aware, under the EU-IMF agreement, substantial efficiencies must be effected.  His party, when in government, entered into arrangements with a view to reducing the numbers in the Garda force to 13,500 by 31 December 2011.  In the context of ensuring proper use of taxpayers' money and the maximum use of resources, the Garda Commissioner made the decisions he made on Garda stations.  I wish that the economic incompetence and lack of governance shown by the previous Government did not have this country in the state it is in.  I wish we were not in a position where we have to reduce numbers within the Garda force.  I am confronted with the obligations we have under that agreement and with a Garda force and Commissioner who is totally focused on ensuring the force is in a position to fully meet its duties to implement the police plan for 2012, as announced, and to provide the community with the protection required from those engaged in criminality and with a proper investigative role.In the context of dealing with matters well in advance of us getting to our current position, at an early stage in the Department work was undertaken and consultations were undertaken with the Garda Commissioner to ensure that any steps that were required with regard to the changes affecting Garda numbers would be put in place.  Today's welcome announcements with regard to the promotions that were approved in Cabinet establishes the level of planning that has gone into ensuring at management level that necessary posts are filled in the interests both of the Garda Síochána itself and the community.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I regularly meet my Northern Ireland counterpart, the Minister of Justice, Mr. David Ford, and we have developed a close working relationship.  We have a shared desire to enhance and further develop North-South co-operation across the range of our respective areas of responsibility.Structured co-operation between our Departments and the related criminal justice agencies North and South is provided for under the intergovernmental agreement on co-operation on criminal justice matters.  I meet regularly the Minister of Justice, Mr. David Ford, MLA, under the auspices of the agreement to discuss matters of mutual interest and consider strategies for more effective co-operation on criminal justice matters between the jurisdictions.In addition to these regular ministerial meetings, project groups comprising relevant officials and practitioners from the two jurisdictions have been established to take forward co-operation in the fields of youth justice, victims of crime, management of sex offenders, public protection, forensic science and social diversity.  These groups involve high level representation from relevant agencies, North and South, and their role is to promote and co-ordinate practical operational co-operation, the exchange of best practice and sharing of policy initiatives and, where appropriate, the exchange of personnel.  In the past year some of the practical initiatives to emerge from the project groups included a memorandum of understanding in respect of forensic science services and recommendations on dealing with sex offenders who had crossed the Border.An annual cross-Border organised crime conference is organised by the two justice Departments and the law enforcement agencies, North and South.  It focuses on enhancing practical co-operation in combating serious cross-Border criminality and has acted as a useful catalyst in driving ongoing efforts to tackle serious crimes such as tiger kidnapping and fuel laundering.The two police forces operate a joint cross-Border policing strategy that aims to improve public safety throughout Ireland by disrupting criminal activity in both jurisdictions and enhancing the policing capability of both police services.  The joint strategy covers a range of policing areas, including cross-Border investigations and operations, intelligence sharing and security, communications and information technology, training and emergency planning.  It indicates the scope of this co-operation and the determination of both police forces to use the tools available to ensure those who seek to exploit the Border for criminal ends will not succeed.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.This close co-operation reflects the Government's strong continuing commitment to cross-Border working which can only be to the benefit of all the people of the island.I met the Minister, Mr. Ford, and Scotland's Secretary for Justice, Mr. Kenny MacAskill, last week when we discussed a number of matters of common interest.  These included sectarianism, sharing expertise in forensic science, civil asset seizure procedures to combat crime, police reform, measures to reduce offending, prisons issues, reform of criminal legal aid, monitoring of sex offenders and vetting procedures for persons to work with children and vulnerable adults.  These are all matters of common interest and it enhances our responses, North and South, to know how these matters are being dealt with by the Scottish authorities.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is clear from the Minister's response that there is good co-operation between the North and the South.  Long may this continue.  Regarding how the strategies for co-operation are set out, is it a case of dealing with matters as they arise or is a 12 or 24 month strategy put in place?  How are strategies put in place and what criteria are used?  Are there other areas in which cross-Border co-operation is necessary?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	13	There is a series of meetings at ministerial level with the Minister, Mr. Ford.  As I detailed, at official level there is ongoing contact and strategies are being developed on a continuous basis, not as piecemeal responses to issues that arise.  For example, there is ongoing interaction between the probation services, North and South.  I attended a meeting of the two services at a conference held some weeks ago that I opened with the Minister, Mr. Ford.  We have provided for interaction and shared experiences.Co-operation goes beyond the island of Ireland.  I met the Minister, Mr. Ford, and Scotland's justice Secretary, Mr MacAskill, on Wednesday of last week when we discussed a number of matters of common interest.  The Deputy might be interested to know that these included the problem of sectarianism, for example, the difficulties experienced in Scotland, sharing expertise in forensic science, civil asset seizure procedures to combat crime, police reform, measures to reduce offending, prison issues, reform of criminal legal aid, monitoring of sex offenders and vetting procedures for persons to work with children and vulnerable adults.  We also discussed the issue of human trafficking in the context of labour issues and prostitution.  There is a range of areas in which common policies are developing.  The tripartite meetings with the Minister, Mr. Ford, and Scotland's justice Secretary, Mr. MacAskill, are annual affairs, but there is a deepening of relationships and a continuing exchange of experiences in these areas.I welcome the close co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI and the interaction between the Department of Justice in the North and my Department.This will be of benefit to the entire island of Ireland.  I also met last week the Northern Ireland Minister for Social Development, Mr. Nelson McCausland, to discuss common approaches in the area of justice, with particular reference to issues surrounding alcohol legislation.  There is a great deal of cross-Border co-operation with a view to ensuring we put in place policies to the benefit of all the people on the island.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	14	On legislation the Department is drafting, I am aware that an impact analysis is made in terms of financial requirements and so on.  In the case of personal insolvency, I understand the proposed legislation will include a discharge period of three years, whereas the corresponding figure in the North is 12 months.  In this and other matters is account taken of the situation in the North and how legislation enacted in the State might impact on an all-island basis?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The alcohol legislation is a classic example of the cross-Border co-operation in which we are engaged.  One of the proposals we are considering is for both Governments to enact legislation to prevent what are known as volume sales of alcohol, where, for example, there might be an offer of 12 bottles for the price of six.  Given their proximity, one cannot enact legislation in areas such as this on one side of the Border but not the other.In addressing issues relating to personal insolvency we were acutely aware of the legislation in place in Northern Ireland, as well as in England, Scotland and Wales.  All of these matters are factored into the considerations we apply in determining the best legislative course to follow.  That is not to say that on all issues our legislation will be identical to that enacted in the North.  However, in the area of criminal justice, for instance, the extent to which we can ensure harmonisation is very important in the fight against criminal gangs.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	16	On 6 October 2011 I announced the terms of reference of the working group to advise me on the merger of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority.  At the time I made a clear statement that the new human rights and equality commission would retain all the statutory powers and duties of the existing bodies.  The House will have an opportunity to consider whether that requirement is met when the relevant legislation comes before it in due course.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Merging two organisations with two cultures is never easy.  The Equality Authority, as one would expect, had a particular focus on the issue of equality.  Can we take it from the Minister's reply that independent legal assistance and advice will continue to be made available to those who require it and that such assistance will be provided in a proactive way?  Does the Minister intend to take the opportunity, in enacting the legislation required to merge the two bodies, to go further by introducing additional reforms?  If so, are there areas of particular concern to him?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	18	The review group I have appointed comprises four members each from the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission, as well as representatives of my Department and an independent chairman.  Its remit is to examine the changes and reforms which might be effected, at the same time as the introduction of legislation to bring together the two bodies.  It was originally my hope the working group would be in a position to report back by the end of November 2011.  It has completed an extensive body of work and I understand its report should be available to me this month.I have made clear my view that we should have an enhanced human rights and equality commission which not only meets our international obligations in these areas but provides the best possible forum for addressing issues of human rights and equality.  I do not want to prejudge the group's report, but I would be surprised if it does not suggest important reforms and innovations.  The report will be published and will inform the development of the Bill.  The preparation of the legislation has been delayed because the group has taken somewhat longer than anticipated to complete its work.  However, I hope to have the Bill published some time after Easter, although I cannot give a specific date.  I look forward to receiving the group's report, the contents of which Members of the House will have an opportunity to consider.  The Government is open to ensuring there is in place a body with real powers to allow it perform the functions mentioned by the Deputy and which may have a slightly broader remit in some areas than do the two current bodies.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	19	We all know the situation the country is in.  In that regard, was the group working within constraints in terms of what initiatives it could bring forward?  In other words, were there other initiatives that could have been brought forward in an ideal situation?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The review group was given a broad remit to present from its perspective the best possible option.  My duty as Minister is to ensure there are reasonable resources in place for what is established.  I cannot pre-empt the decisions the group may make.  While I was concerned previously that the Irish Human Rights Alliance was under-resourced, in particular during recent years, substantial resources were made available to the Equality Authority.  It is hoped that in having one body there will be an economy of scale, which will provide not alone for its application of powers and objectives but will allow the work to be done at a lesser cost.In response to the Deputy's question, no financial sum was stated to the review group although it will be conscious of how much money was made available this year and last year to both agencies.  My budget for 2012 is not substantially greater than it was for 2011.  However, it is not less than what was available for the two agencies, which is to be welcomed.  The Government takes seriously its commitment to provide an enhanced independent equality commission to replace the Irish Human Rights Alliance and Equality Authority.I look forward to receiving the report of the group, which comprises good people whom I know devoted substantial time to their deliberations.  I also look forward to the input of that report into the development of the necessary legislation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department currently accommodates more than 5,300 persons across 39 centres.  Complaints by centre residents are dealt with in accordance with the procedures outlined in the RIA's house rules, a copy of which is provided to all residents and sets out, inter alia, the obligations on the centre manager and resident.  The complaints procedure explains how one party can seek to have breaches of the obligations by the other party resolved.The thrust of this procedure is that issues are best resolved quickly, locally and informally without the need for a matter to proceed formally.  Where more serious complaints cannot be so resolved, residents may lodge a formal written complaint with centre management, to be responded to within 14 days.  If the issue remains unresolved, the resident may take his or her complaint to the RIA who will make a determination on it.  If a complaint is made in respect of a decision by a particular RIA official, the appeal will not be dealt with by that official.  This complaints system is considered by the RIA to be broadly in line with the guidelines set out by the Office of the Ombudsman for internal complaints systems.The rules specifically state that residents should not be afraid to complain when they need to and that making a statement will not affect how other official agencies consider their claims to remain in the State.  The house rules were revised arising from a working party report, which included some NGOs.  During those working party discussions, the issue of an independent appeals mechanism was fully discussed.  It was the RIA's view that no clear model was cited during these discussions as to the make-up of an independent claims mechanism or how it could be implemented without undue cost and bureaucracy.In relation to the powers of the Ombudsman, section 5(1)(e) of the Ombudsman Act 1980 provides that the Ombudsman shall not investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to asylum.  While the office does not currently have the power to investigate asylum related matters, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, including the RIA, has in place administrative arrangements with the office to assist and provide information and help resolve any matters brought to its attention.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The question of extending the remit of the Ombudsman is in the first instance a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and my officials will engage with that Department in relation to any proposals in this regard.It is important we do not lose sight of the need to ensure the amount of time asylum seekers stay in direct provision is kept to a minimum and that we do not inadvertently open up a new appeal mechanism in the asylum determination system, which already has comprehensive in-built statutorily based appeals mechanisms.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The phrase "internal complaints systems" was used and reflects the difficulty that it will be an internal process, regardless of whether the central manager or the Reception and Integration Agency is involved.  The 5,300 people concerned are in a difficult position and do not necessarily wish to draw attention to themselves.  In the opinion of the agencies involved, some independent mechanism would engender greater confidence.  As for the role of the Ombudsman, in terms of asylum Ireland was a very different place in 1980 and were the Office of the Ombudsman to be involved in a more formal role, an independent system within the Reception and Integration Agency might not be necessary.  Given the number of asylum seekers and the extent to which the position in the country has changed since 1980, I again ask the Minister to consider the involvement of the Ombudsman.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	23	There are, of course, fewer people in such accommodation than in previous years.  The numbers are falling.  I note that during the Deputy's party's 14 year term of office it did not deem it appropriate to introduce a different system such as the one he now advocates.Extending the remit of the Ombudsman is, in the first instance, a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My officials would be happy to engage with that Department on any such proposals.  It is important, however, not to lose sight of the need to ensure the amount of time asylum seekers remain in direct provision accommodation is kept to a minimum.  I am concerned that it is far too long owing to the complexities of our immigration and asylum legislation.  These issues will be addressed in the legislation being prepared and I hope a better system will be in place by the end of the year which will ensure individuals will not spend as long in direct provision accommodation.I do not wish to inadvertently open up a new appeals mechanism in an asylum determination system that already has comprehensive in-built statutory-based appeals mechanisms and which is subject to a continuing stream of judicial reviews.  While some of the reviews have merit, a considerable number are certainly brought with the intent of trying to remain unlawfully in the State for an extended time in circumstances in which there is no valid basis to seek asylum and the applicants are seeking to prevent their deportation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	24	As the Deputy will be aware, the biggest volume of crime in Ireland is tried in the local District Courts which are established pursuant to the Constitution as courts of local and limited jurisdiction.  Some jurisdictions also have developed what are sometimes referred to as problem solving courts.  Models include community courts, drug courts and restorative programmes.  These can vary in character but generally incorporate a combination of sanction for the crime, assistance in rehabilitation and reparation to either the victim or the community in which the offence took place.Some years ago the National Crime Council published a report entitled, Problem Solving Justice, the Case for Community Courts in Ireland.  The report examined the position in the United States and the United Kingdom to ascertain how such courts worked in practice and made recommendations for the establishment of a court on a pilot basis.  These recommendations have not been implemented to date and, as the Deputy is aware, are potentially resource-intensive.There are, however, a number of restorative justice options in operation, including two structural projects based in Nenagh and Tallaght that represent problem solving approaches.  Community courts also share many of the characteristics of the Dublin Drug Treatment Court which has operated in the north city centre area for some years and was expanded significantly in 2011.  I am considering the possibility of its further expansion.There are a number of non-custodial sentencing options available to the courts, including suspended sentences, community service orders, fines, compensation orders and probation orders.  I am informed the number of community service orders increased by almost 40% in 2011 compared with 2010, with 537 orders being made in the final quarter of 2011 following the commencement on 1 October last of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2011 which introduced a requirement for judges, when considering the imposition of a sentence of 12 months or less, to first consider the alternative sanction of community service.  As the Deputy is aware, community service generally is carried out in the local community, of benefit to that community and costs taxpayers a good deal less than a term of imprisonment.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.While the scale of restorative justice initiatives in Ireland is modest, this must be viewed in the context of Ireland's very small prison population.  It is worth noting that, according to the Courts Service annual report for 2010, just under 5% of offences heard in the District Court resulted in terms of imprisonment.In my address last year to the Irish Penal Reform Trust I outlined my commitment to developing workable alternatives to custody which promoted a balanced but targeted rehabilitation of offenders.  Since coming to office, I have prioritised a number of relevant initiatives, including the development of a national anti-crime strategy that is at the last stage of preparation in my Department.  In addition, a number of key recommendations contained in the Thornton Hall review group report that I published last July are receiving priority attention in my Department, most notably the introduction of an incentivised scheme for early temporary release, under which offenders who posed no threat to the community would be offered early temporary release in return for supervised community service.  A further recommendation was the establishment of a strategic review of penal policy which would incorporate an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy, including prevention, sentencing policies and alternatives to custody.  I intend to establish a working group to further this work in the near future.  Work is ongoing to ensure full implementation of the Fines Act 2010.As the Deputy acknowledges, the introduction of community courts has resource implications, mainly in respect of the intensive multidisciplinary team required by such a court.  In the context of the other related developments I have mentioned, I have no plans to choose community courts.  It is, however, an option I will keep under review.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Dublin Central has both prisons and prisoners.  There is a disproportionate number of people in prison who come from certain areas in the constituency.  I accept what the Minister stated in respect of community service, etc., but a community court could play a particular role.  I acknowledge the work of the National Crime Council and the Dublin City Business Association in respect of the process relating to that report.  Would it not be possible to try to establish a community court on a pilot basis within existing resources?  Let us face it, the current system is not working.  As one judge stated, the same people are continually being recycled through the system.  Would it not be possible to use existing resources to set up a community court which could be located in the inner city, perhaps adjacent to Store Street or Pearse Street, where there are high levels of particular types of crime?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	26	As the Deputy is aware, crime levels in particular areas are influenced by a range of issues and a community court would not provide a panacea in the context of dealing with the various difficulties which exist in such areas.  We are engaged in a number of different pilot schemes.  I share the Deputy's view that too many people currently within our prisons are serving very short sentences.  These individuals pose no risk to the community and would be better dealt with through the community service order system.  That is why we introduced the legislation that was enacted last July.  Those to whom I refer could be assisted through the restorative justice schemes.  There is a need for in-built programmes to deal with both drug and alcohol abuse.  There is no point in individuals serving a few short weeks in jail and then returning to the outside world with the addictions which led them to become involved in criminality in the first instance.As the Deputy may be aware, in the address I delivered to the Irish Penal Reform Trust last year I made a commitment to develop workable alternatives to custody which promote a balanced but targeted rehabilitation of offenders.  Since coming to office I have prioritised a number of initiatives, including the development of a national anti-crime strategy, which is currently at an advanced stage.  The Deputy may also be aware that we are operating a pilot scheme to which I referred previously in the House, whereby prisoners who are serving sentences within the prison system, who are of good behaviour and who pose no risk to the community but who have not yet reached the stage where they are eligible for remission may be released subject to their signing an agreement and condition that they do community service.  I am advised that this scheme is working well.  I hope we will have an opportunity to extend it in the future.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I welcome everything the Minister said and I am personally committed to the notion of restorative justice because there are some very good examples of where this works.  However, I remain of the view that there is a role for community courts and the judges who would operate them.  Such courts have very direct connections with the communities in which they are located.  It is, after all, certain communities in particular areas which are plagued by what is termed low level crime, although that is not how those who live in such communities would categorise it, especially as their lives are being disturbed.  To give offenders the opportunity to make amends to communities is the best way to put an end to the revolving door system.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The best way for an offender to make amends to a community is through community service.  The Probation Service is involved in extensive engagement in this area.  The effect of the community service orders legislation was evident in the final quarter of 2011 when it became apparent that there had been a substantial increase in the making of community service orders.  I welcome the latter development.  It will be interesting to see what will be the pattern for 2012 in its entirety.  I expect there will be a similar increase as the courts become used to the new legal arrangements that are in place.The establishment of a new community court, even on a pilot basis, would require additional resources.  I am operating a Department which has €100 million less available to it for 2012.  For a community court to operate successfully, there would be a need for multidisciplinary staff with particular expertise to be employed because it would otherwise be a community court in name only.  Unfortunately, I do not currently possess the resources to allow me to employ additional people in that context.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 91 together.I wish to clarify for the House that the National Women's Council of Ireland is wholly independent of my Department.  However, my Department will make up to €350,000 available to the council towards its core funding and to deliver a programme of activities in 2012.  This represents a decrease of 35% on the Department's provision in 2011 and reflects the need to achieve savings of €100 million in the justice group of Votes.Funding for the council comes from a number of sources, not only from the Department but also from the HSE and subscriptions from member and philanthropic organisations.  I understand from the council that it received Exchequer funding of €571,000 in 2011, of which €528,000 came from the Department.  The council has been very successful in accessing funding for special projects from a number of philanthropic organisations and other sources.The council is undertaking a gender mainstreaming project on behalf of the HSE for which it is receiving €130,000 in the two year period 2011 to 2012.  Atlantic Philanthropies has awarded €770,000 to the council for two projects beginning in early 2012.  The first project, for which more than €560,000 was received, will run for a period of three years, while the second, for which €190,000 was received, will run for a period of a year and a half.  These projects are contemporaneous.  The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust has also awarded financial support of almost €130,000 to the council for another special project which will run for two years and which began in September 2011.  The Peace 3 programme is also funding a project being delivered at a cost of over €57,000.  With the exception of the Peace 3 project, all other projects will make a contribution to the core costs of the council, totalling over €85,000 in 2012.As a membership organisation, the council also receives contributions from its constituent members which number about 166.  This membership income fluctuates but typically exceeds €25,000 per annum.In setting priorities for expenditure in the Department this year I decided that I would favour those organisations providing services over those providing, in the main, advocacy or research services.  Implementation of this decision has meant some difficult choices, involving, in certain cases, the complete elimination of funding altogether and the closure of some projects.Accompanied by officials from my Department, I met the chairperson and CEO of the council on 19 January to discuss the matter, following on correspondence with the CEO after the budget announcement.  During the course of the meeting I emphasised my continued support and that of the Government for the council and my belief the council could continue to play a key role in achieving positive changes in the area of women's rights and equality.  I was subsequently advised that the CEO did not feel able to continue in her post as, in her view, the €350,000 provided by the Department for this year made it impossible for her to do her job properly.  The executive board of the council has appointed an acting CEO.I have every confidence, as I said, that the council will continue to play a key role in promoting women's rights and equality and that the working relationship between the Department and the council will be maintained.  It is worth noting that the council has available to it very substantial sums for 2012, with further guaranteed sums for 2013, from philanthropic organisations and also has available to it moneys for its activities which, overall, substantially exceed the moneys that may have been available to it for many years in the past.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Minister obviously made a big impression at the meeting because the chief executive officer resigned after it.  She has stated it was her personal view that the Government had shown scant regard for women's rights and her resignation was a personal protest against its indifference.  This year the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will introduce legislation on gender quotas and all political parties are committed to increasing the number of female candidates in 2014.  The Minister has emphasised that the organisation is independent of the Department and it is this independence which enables it to obtain external funding.  For the Minister to impose a 35% cut completely disregards other Government strategies.  When did the council communicate the chief executive officer's resignation to him?  What is the average reduction to other organisations which receive funding from the Department?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	31	As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has a substantial programme in the area of women's rights.  Unlike the Deputy's party, we will put in place legislation to ensure greater participation by women in electoral politics, in particular in general elections.  This is legislation that would never have been contemplated by the Deputy's party in government.  A very successful conference was held in Dublin Castle organised by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch; there were so many women present that we had to provide a room to cater for the overflow of those who wished to participate.  I note what the Deputy said was the statement of the chief executive officer of the council.  No such statement was made by or on behalf of the board of the council.  In the current financial climate €350,000, by way of a grant to an organisation which has substantial additional funds made available to it, amounts a very substantial grant.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Deputy cannot have it both ways.  He is a member of a party which destroyed the economy of the country.  He knows there are substantially fewer resources available to my Department.  In circumstances where I have €100 million less to meet expenditure incurred through my Department-----

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	35	-----the Deputy constantly pretends there can be no reduction, regardless of the areas in which it is made.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On funding, we all know what has happened and it is regrettable that the chief executive officer felt it necessary to resign over this issue.  The one aspect we could examine is multi-year funding which might alleviate some of the concerns because it is very difficult for groups which are trying to operate on a yearly budget to plan and strategise.  The Department might examine the possibility of providing multi-annual funding because at least people would then know what was coming down the line and plan accordingly.  If it were possible to do this, we might be able to overcome some of the concerns raised.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I do not want to comment on the resignation of the chief executive officer.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I appreciate that.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	39	She had her own reasons for resigning.  All I can say is that a very successful conference was held in Dublin Castle to address serious issues to give women an opportunity to engage in electoral politics to a far greater extent.  The Government is committed to women's rights and ensuring greater participation in a broad range of areas.  The Deputy might have noticed in the many appointments I have made that there has been a substantial gender rebalancing in the context of ensuring an equal number of men and women are appointed.  I have been redressing imbalances in some areas in which clearly there has been a substantial number of men in circumstances where there are women available who are equally qualified.  We will continue to work along these lines to achieve objectives.  There is no reason the National Women's Council, as an advocacy and research body, with the funding available to it, cannot fully meet all of its commitments in 2012 and 2013.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	40	In fairness, the question had to do with the provision of multi-annual funding.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	41	We have to examine whether we can fund some of these organisations on a multi-annual basis.  As we go through the three difficult years of 2012, 2013 and 2014 choices will have to be made as between organisations which provide services for women and those which advocate such services should be provided.  We need to monitor what will happen during the course of the year to ensure we get our funding position right.  Last July, conscious of the financial difficulties we would have in 2012, I wrote to the National Women's Council of Ireland to advise it in advance that it was likely its funding for 2012 would be substantially below the figure allocated in 2011.  Therefore, it received a substantial warning of where the matter was going.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	42	As the Deputy may be aware, today I secured Cabinet approval for the appointment of two assistant Garda commissioners, eight chief superintendents and 23 superintendents, giving a total of 33 appointments to senior Garda ranks.  All of the consequential vacancies at sergeant and inspector ranks will also be filled.I was very glad to secure the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Cabinet as a whole for such a significant number of appointments.  In seeking these promotions I was conscious of the need to enable the Garda Commissioner to fill key positions in the senior ranks and maintain both the investigative and also the management and supervisory capacity of the force.With clarity emerging on the final number of retirements expected by the end of this month, I will be discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the case for filling outstanding vacancies in the senior ranks.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I welcome the fact that the Minister eventually got around to getting Cabinet approval for that and that he has got agreement to fill the consequential vacancies down the line.  What is the timeframe for the filling of those consequential vacancies?To return to a previous question, is there a transition team in place in the Department of Justice and Equality?  If so, who is on it, and when was it established to manage all these retirements and the consequences of them for An Garda Síochána and for the other organisations that come under the Minister's remit?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	44	On the question of when the other appointments will be made, I have had discussions with the Garda Commissioner - I talked to him today after these appointments were announced - and I understand he will put in place the appropriate procedures for the making of the appointments.  I do not want to give an exact date because it is a matter for him in the context of his managerial function of the force, but I understand he will proceed with all appropriate speed in that regard.I answered the question the Deputy has again raised regarding transitional arrangements in my Department.  We took a very comprehensive overview, at a very early stage after my appointment, of the different steps to be taken in dealing with the different issues that would come up, including the position with regard to Garda retirements and where we would be at 29 February.  It was deemed appropriate that these promotions would be announced today.  Other senior members of the force will retire on 29 February and those positions are the subject of conversations between myself and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I expect that appropriate decisions will be made in that regard.

That will augment the force, the members of which are doing great work.  As a consequence of the new slimmed-down public service, are there plans to create new Garda divisions and structures in the Garda Síochána, the members of which are doing great work in our communities?

As I keep on telling the Deputy, however, who seems to think there is something mysterious about this, in the context of the Department of Justice and Equality, we have, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and throughout the period since I was appointed, looked at the developments, the areas where vacancies would arise, predicted where we might be at the end of February, and made decisions accordingly.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The heads of a Bill to reform and consolidate the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 are being developed within my Department and I hope to bring them to the Government before Easter for approval and publication.  It is my intention to publish and refer them to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality prior to the drafting of the Bill.  Given that the shape of the proposed legislation is not yet in its final form and that the Government has not yet had sight of the new proposals, I do not wish to comment in any detail on the content of the proposed legislation at this juncture.  However, my overall objective is to clarify, consolidate and reform the provisions contained in the seven enactments that make up the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010.The State is party to a number of international instruments in this area, including the Council of Europe Criminal Law Convention on Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  Last November, following the approval of the Dáil, I made arrangements to have the UN Convention against Corruption ratified by the State.  Ireland's full participation in the convention is important in demonstrating our commitment to tackling corruption within the State and in a global context.  The State is also an active participant in the OECD working group on bribery in international business transactions and the Council of Europe group of states against corruption.The new Bill will make corruption legislation more accessible by replacing seven overlapping statutes with one consolidated measure.  It will also afford an opportunity to review and improve the legislation in this area in the light of our experience as a member of the international anti-corruption groups.  I look forward to publication of the heads of the Bill which will allow all interested parties to make an input to this important anti-corruption measure.I hope the number of Bills we intend to give to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration does not overwhelm its capacity to do its work, but I am looking forward to the input tDeputies Calleary, O'Brien and others may make to the development of that legislation.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I thank the Minister.  The reason I have tabled this question is that we are considering the whistleblower legislation and I thought this Bill was essential to complement it.  It would not make sense to have one without the other.  I welcome the announcement that the committee will see the heads of the Bill before Easter.  Getting the heads of the Bill before we get the Bill is very welcome; this has proved to be productive in the case of other legislation.  The programme of legislation was set out in this area included a consolidation Bill, but the Minister has said today that he is also considering reforming and improving the law in this regard, which is welcome.  As we are now in a completely different situation, this legislation needs to move beyond consolidation.  However, I welcome the improvements and reform.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I thank the Deputy for his positive comments.  As should be obvious at this stage, there is substantial work ongoing in my Department in modernising various areas of the law and consolidating legislation.  This area is particularly important; we need to ensure we have a coherent, accessible body of law to deal with corruption issues and the broad range of white-collar crimes, to which the Bill will make a substantial contribution.  I hope it will also make life somewhat easier for An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions in addressing issues that arise to which the legislation is relevant.  As I said - I genuinely mean this - I look forward to the input of Members on the heads of the Bill.  If the heads are placed before the committee either just before or shortly after Easter, we should be in a position, certainly by the summer vacation, for the committee to report back in order that we can develop the Bill further with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I compliment the Minister on the initiative of placing the heads of Bills before committees which will make the legislative process a lot easier.  Would he consider also giving the Bill to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and perhaps the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education to get their input?  We would probably have a finer process at that stage.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The formula used in the House is that a Bill goes to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, but, as Members know, it is open to any Member to participate in a committee's deliberations on a Bill.  The membership of a committee is only relevant in the case of a vote; this would not arise in the consideration of the heads of a Bill.  It is completely open, for example, to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to have a joint meeting with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, where that is seen to be appropriate, or to ask that or any other committee to make an input into its deliberations in order that when the committee reports, it can embrace the views of other Members of the House.  That is a matter for the discretion of the Chairman.  It is important that we ultimately receive feedback or a view from the main committee rather than obtaining a series of diverse views from other committees which may not engage in dealing with the legal complexities involved.  However, I would certainly encourage the holding of a joint committee meeting if it was the view of members of the justice committee and the Chairman that it would be appropriate to have such a meeting.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 398 to 400, inclusive, together.The Deputy will be aware from the replies I have provided for him in response to a number of recent parliamentary questions of my determination to ensure the necessary resources and measures will be in place to deal with organised crime, the fight against which is one of a number of priorities I have specifically set for the Garda Síochána in the Garda policing plan for 2012.The issue of organised crime on the island of Ireland was also one of the subjects discussed at the tripartite meeting held on Wednesday last involving the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Mr. Ford, and the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice, at which we considered the interaction between organised crime in Ireland and Scotland and what could be done to achieve better co-ordination in these areas.The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the allocation of resources, including personnel, within the force; this is a function which is exercised in close consultation with his senior management team.  The Commissioner has indicated that the Garda Síochána deploys significant resources for operations and strategies aimed at targeting, dismantling and disrupting criminal networks using advanced analytical and intelligence-led methodologies.  Moreover, he has confirmed that this is a process that will be maintained.In implementing Garda actions a multi-agency law enforcement approach is used as part of which Garda national units from the national support service work together to combat those involved in organised crime.  Furthermore, the multi-agency operations are supported by Garda personnel at divisional and district level.  The multi-disciplinary approach also plays a key part in targeting the assets of individuals and groups involved in criminal enterprises.  This includes the ongoing work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the use of proceeds of crime and money-laundering legislation, and co-operation between the Garda and external agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Customs service and international law enforcement agencies.  This comprehensive approach has led to many successes in combating organised gangs, depriving them of their financial resources and bringing individuals involved in such groups before the courts.I appreciate that the Deputy has asked a number of specific questions about how the Garda Síochána operates in the fight against organised crime.  Perhaps we will might back to these in a supplementary question.Additional Information not given on the floor of the HouseOwing to the nature of the relevant Garda activities, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail on the measures the Garda is adopting.  I can, however, confirm that they are extensive and have proved to be very successful.  In the circumstances, I hope the Deputy will appreciate the extent to which measures have been put in place to combat criminal gangs.  The Commissioner has indicated that the pressure being put on gangs will continue.  They will be monitored and kept under constant review, as will the level and nature of Garda resources required to continue to target their activities.

The issue I raise is specifically related to organised crime.  Has the Minister identified a number of measures which might have the effect of decommissioning, for want of a better description, highly organised criminal gangs which seem to have ready access to firearms and be the only groups in society not suffering in the recession?Further, in identifying issues to address these matters has the Minister considered the punishment that follows prosecutions and whether that is in line with what is required at present given the threat presented by organised criminals?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Obviously the Garda deploys a range of different strategies in targeting organised crime, those engaged in drug crime and those who use firearms, and the Deputy would not expect me to reveal those strategies in the House.  However, I share the concern of every Member about the extent to which those engaged in organised crime are using firearms, their lack of respect for human life and their capacity to cause serious injury not only to those engaged in competitive crime gangs but also to the general community.The Garda has been very successful in bringing prosecutions against many of those who have been involved in violence.  Our legislation prescribes a variety of sentences for conviction of a broad range of offences.  It is not for me to comment on sentences passed by our courts because they are independent.  However, it is very important that the sentence passed fits the crime that has been committed and for which an individual has been found guilty.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	92	The Minister previously indicated his intention to discuss with his European colleagues an extension of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, model on a European basis.  Can he update the House on how that is progressing?  Second, with regard to the Minister's meeting with the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, Mr. Ford, last week, are there any priorities for cross-Border co-operation in this area at present?
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Has the Garda Commissioner asked for any resources that we have been unable to provide due to the economic circumstances?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Will the Minister indicate the extent to which information is available to the Garda on the total number of people involved in organised crime who have not been brought before the courts, with obvious consequences?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I will take the questions in reverse order.  There is substantial information available to the Garda on a broad range of individuals who might be engaged in criminality.  I do not wish to say more than that.  As to those who have not been brought before the courts on criminal prosecution, the Criminal Assets Bureau has performed a very important function in targeting assets that appear to have no legitimate origin and that are clearly the proceeds of crime.  That is a hugely important mechanism.On Deputy Calleary's question, I am happy to confirm that matters are advancing substantially in Europe with regard to a framework of criminal assets bureaus across Europe.  I expect some announcements from initial work done in this area at Commission level to be made within the next two to three months.  I have had direct discussions on this issue with Commissioner Reding, who is co-ordinating with other colleagues in the Commission.  It will be a substantial priority of the Irish Presidency of the EU next January.Dealing with organised crime is a specific matter of conversation between myself and the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice, Mr. Ford, and between the two police forces, North and South.  There is huge co-operation in these areas.  There have been substantial drug finds as a consequence of that co-operation and laundered fuel has been seized.  More recently, major hauls of tobacco and cigarettes brought illegally into the State were derived from co-operation in the area of organised crime between the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and the Garda Síochána.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Part 10 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring, or tagging as it is also known, in this jurisdiction.  My predecessor made the relevant order in 2010 commencing the provisions in the context of a restriction of movement condition applying to the granting of temporary release.A project board was set up at the time to examine the area of electronic monitoring, EM.  The board recommended that a pilot project be initiated to test EM technology in this jurisdiction and assess its value for money in the management of offenders.  This recommendation was accepted and a decision was taken to explore, on a pilot basis, the use of global positioning system, GPS, satellite tracking monitoring technology on a small number of volunteer prisoners.Following a public tender competition, the Irish Prison Service tested the use of this technology on a small number of prisoners, 31 in all, who were given temporary release.  The test phase began in August 2010 and ran until Christmas 2010.  The group of prisoners involved were carefully selected having regard to a range of criteria, including the nature of the offence, public safety and overall conduct in prison.  I am informed that prisoner compliance was high and only one prisoner was recalled due to a curfew violation.Following the pilot project, the Irish Prison Service, IPS, has undertaken a review of its viability in the management of offenders along with a cost benefit analysis.  That review will be considered in the context of the IPS draft strategic plan for 2012 to 2014 which I expect will be submitted to me at the beginning of April.  Finally, in line with the recommendations in the report of the Thornton Hall project review group, the Deputy will know that I am establishing a group to carry out an all-encompassing strategic review of penal policy.  That group will also look at this issue.  We might be in a position to make some further decisions on this matter when the strategic plan has been finalised.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The review will be available in April - possibly - and the penal policy group will be examining this.  Does the Minister not agree that electronic tagging has its limitations?  It might show where a person is but it does not show what they are up to or with whom they are associating.  In the wider policy on rehabilitating prisoners before releasing them back into the community, there are pre-release programmes and peer support programmes.  Will a holistic approach be taken to this issue or is it being looked at in isolation as something the Department wishes to implement?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	98	We are not looking at it in isolation.  We have some pre-release programmes and there are a number of organisations, funded through the Department, that also look after prisoners following their release.  The Probation Service engages with a considerable number of prisoners before they are released.  Tagging is just one of a number of options available.  It has proved useful in other jurisdictions but I am anxious to see what is reported back as a result of the initial pilot scheme, on which the work has been done, and in the strategic review.  I expect it might have a role in the future but, again, there are resource issues with it.  No final decision has been made as to whether we will proceed further with tagging in 2012 or 2013 or whether priority will be given to other forms of intervention.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The names of the Garda stations which are scheduled to close in 2012 have been provided to the House in the policing plan for An Garda Síochána which I lodged with the House last December.  For ease of reference for the Deputy I am circulating with this answer a table containing the names of those stations together with the names of the stations which will have reduced opening hours.  This is information that has previously been published and circulated.In relation to closures in future years, the position is as set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005.  Under the Act, the Garda Commissioner must submit to me, by the end of October of each year, a draft policing plan for the following year.  That plan must contain, among other items, any proposals the Commissioner has for the closure of Garda stations or for amending district or divisional boundaries.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that I cannot comment on the likely contents of policing plans for the years 2013 and 2014 as they have not yet been drafted.  However, I have stated that I expect it is likely that the plan will include provision for some further closures.Table A: Garda stations proposed for closureRegionDivisionDistrictStationWestern RegionClareKilrushCarrigaholtWestern RegionGalwayGalwayCorrandullaWestern RegionMayoBeal an MhuirtheadBellacorickWestern RegionMayoCastlebarGlenislandWestern RegionMayoCastlebarTourmakeadyWestern RegionMayoWestportMulrannyWestern RegionRoss/LongCastlereaLoughglynnWestern RegionRoss/LongBoyleTarmonbarry*Western RegionRoss/LongBoyleCootehallSouthern RegionLimerickAskeatonShanagoldenSouthern RegionLimerickBruffDoonSouthern RegionCork NorthCobhGlenvilleSouthern RegionCork WestClonakiltyCastletownsend*Southern RegionCork WestClonakiltyBallygurteen*Southern RegionCork WestKanturkKnocknagreeSouthern RegionCork WestBandonBallyfeardSouthern RegionCork WestBantryGoleenSouthern RegionCork WestMacroomInchigeelaSouth East RegionTipperaryThurlesBallinure*South East RegionTipperaryMenaghBallinderry*South East RegionWexfordNew RossBallywilliam*South East RegionWexfordWexfordBaldwinstownSouthern RegionKerryListowelBallylongfordSouthern RegionKerryListowelMoyvaneSouthern RegionKerryTraleeClochanNorthern RegionCav/MonMonaghanClonibretNorthern RegionCav/MonMonaghanSmithboroughNorthern RegionCav/MonBaileboroTullyvinNorthern RegionDonegalGlentiesAn Duchoraidh (Doochary)*Northern RegionDonegalBally shannonDunkineelyNorthern RegionDonegalBuncranaCuldaffNorthern RegionSligo/LeitrimBallymoteBunnanaddenNorthern RegionSligo/LeitrimManorhamiltonDrumkeeranNorthern RegionSligo/LeitrimManorhamiltonKiltyclogherEastern RegionLaois/OffalyTullamoreGeashill*Dublin Metropolitan RegionDMR South CentralPearse StHarcourt TerraceDublin Metropolitan RegionDMR NorthBallymunWhitehallDublin Metropolitan RegionDMR NorthBalbrigganRushDublin Metropolitan RegionDMR EastDun LaoghaireDalkey* Non-operationalTable A lists four Garda stations located within the Dublin metropolitan region and 35 stations located outside the Dublin metropolitan region identified which are scheduled to close this year.Table B: DMR stations identified for reduced opening hoursDivisionDistrictStationsDMR EastBlackrockStepasideDMR EastDun LaoghaireCabinteelyDMR EastDun LaoghaireKill O GrangeDMR SouthCrumlinSundriveDMR SouthTerenureTerenureDMR WestBlanchardstownCabraDMR NorthCoolockMalahideDMR NorthBallymunSantryDMR NorthRahenyHowthDMR South CentralDonnybrookDonnybrookTable B lists the ten Garda stations identified within the Dublin metropolitan region which will have their public opening hours reduced in 2012 from a 24 hours service to being open between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. only.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Does the Minister take independent advice apart from that given by the Garda Commissioner when he recommends station closures?  Does he take advice from people in his party who are local representatives or from local community organisations?  One of the stations that will be closed is Mulranny Garda station in my constituency of County Mayo, which is also the Taoiseach's constituency.  It is a small village but the opening of the Great Western Greenway will put some 50,000 people per year through the village.  The Garda Commissioner, however, with the Minister's approval, has closed the Garda station.  With this extra volume of people - I hope there will be many more - concern is being expressed in the community about the loss of the Garda station which is now open for two hours a day.  This does not make sense to the people of Mulranny.  One might have made an argument for the closure of the station three years ago, before the Great Western Greenway was developed, but not now.  The same could apply all over the country.  Does the Minister take independent soundings before he brings the argument in favour of closing Garda stations to the Cabinet?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	101	This is a management issue for the Garda Commissioner.  It is something that can be the subject of a conversation between us, but the Garda Commissioner has a statutory function in this regard.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for the Minister to designate or identify particular stations for closure.The Deputy has made the case for closure.  He is talking about a Garda station that is only open for two hours a day.  Many police stations are in place for historical reasons; there was no overall policing strategy.  They were built before all the modern systems of technology became available and before we had internal Garda communications systems or mobile phones.  They date back to a time when there were not many cars on the road.  If we are to provide an effective policing service, we must do it using modern technology and communications systems.It is difficult to argue that a Garda station that is open for only two hours a day plays a major security role for any local community.  What is important is that the local gardaí in the overall district know the areas of difficulty and are able to respond when an incident occurs or to prevent one occurring.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The Minister does not get it.  He does not understand this is not just a security issue.  He is living in Dublin.  Any Dublin Deputy will not understand that more than security is at stake.  In a village to which 50,000 people are brought every year there may be a greater need for security, although we hope not.Extra information is available with which the Minister should be provided by the Commissioner independently.  I accept that the Minister does not wish to involve himself in a management decision.  However, he should consider independent views.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Under the Coroners Act 1962, a coroner is an independent officeholder with responsibility under law for the medico-legal investigations of the circumstances of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths.  Regrettably, there is an increasing number of cases in society that involve suicide and fall to be investigated by coroners.  In the conduct of that investigation I am mindful that coroners bear a heavy duty in reaching the verdict of suicide.  However, a coroner must be sure as to the cause of death.  He or she cannot rush to a judgment, even though on first consideration the conclusion of suicide may be very much apparent.  In that regard, I am satisfied that appropriate verdicts in relation to suicide are being recorded.Coroners must ensure a proper public investigation is seen to take place in order to reassure the public as to the cause of death in all cases of reportable death.  I am aware that it is the practice of coroners to be especially sensitive in so far as possible to the needs of families in the handling of all inquests, particularly so where suicide may be in question.  I am aware of the hurt and trauma involved for family members and relatives in all tragic deaths but perhaps especially so in regard to suicide.In regard to suicide, preventive measures and interventions can assist a person in distress from taking that very final step.  In that regard, I pay tribute to the Deputy's work on behalf of Pieta House.The Coroners Bill 2007 is before the Seanad, having been restored to the Order Paper on my initiative.  The Bill is in the course of being reviewed in my Department with a view, among other matters, to making it as cost-effective as possible.  As published, it provides for the comprehensive reform of existing legislative structures relating to coroners and the establishment of a new Coroner Service.  It incorporates many of the recommendations made by the coroners review group in 2000 and the coroners rules committee in 2003 and aims to fulfil various obligations placed on the State by the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly the Article 2 requirement in relation to the investigation of deaths of persons involving the State.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for some early reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin county and city coronial districts.  It is my hope to progress the Coroners Bill before the end of the year.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I thank the Minister for his kind comments.  I am pleased that there is greater debate across the floor of the House on the issue of suicide and the need for increased resources for suicide prevention measures.  The Coroner Service is at the heart of my question.  Is the Minister aware that there is no consistency among coroners when it comes to reporting deaths by suicide?  Is he aware that the coroner in County Roscommon, for example, will not report such deaths?  Is he that the profession is well served by the legislation governing the practice of coroners?   Coroners should have a facility to prepare people who have to attend a Coroners Court to give evidence when a tragic death takes place, whether by road accident or suicide.  A liaison officer should meet family members and those giving evidence to assist and support them through the process.  There is a need for a directive from the Minister to establish standard operational procedures whereby coroners could respond in a correct manner in order that there would not be different standards of reporting in different counties.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	105	The Deputy will appreciate that, because of the independence of coroners, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the approach taken by an individual coroner.  The duty of a coroner is to accurately record the cause of death and it is crucially important that he or she do so.In so far as reform is required in this area of the law, the Bill my predecessor published is being reviewed in my Department.  The Deputy is welcome to make a contribution to its further development because some aspects need to be amended, while further reforms will be brought forward.It is important that family members are treated with insight and sensitivity when a death occurs, whether as a result of suicide or otherwise.  Services are, of course, available within the HSE to provide assistance and counselling for families who suffer bereavement as a consequence of suicide.I would welcome the Deputy's contributing to the work we are doing on the Coroners Bill.  I would be happy to engage with him in that context.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I thank the Minister.  I will be happy to take up his offer to participate in the review.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	107	Last week I asked the Taoiseach if the Government had a national plan to protect front-line services following the well flagged and expected exodus of public servants on 29 February.  He responded that the Government "has no intention of allowing a situation where it is not possible for front-line services to be fulfilled."  He added that there was a central planning unit and sectoral planning units in place.  However, he made no mention of the establishment of transitional teams, about which we had to wait last Sunday last to hear.  A short while ago the Minister for Justice and Equality was unable to confirm the existence of a specific transitional team in his Department.It appears that the transitional teams are stable door closing committees.  This illustrates the mismatch between what is being said in the House and the reality on the ground.  This is what we are picking up throughout the services.  Various Ministers are saying the process of redeployment is being put to the test as a result.  However, the trade unions are stating redeployment is not an issue, as there is total co-operation on the issue.  It would appear that the real crux is when business plans are being sent up the line after redeployment has been agreed but are not being given the green light.  That is particularly evident in the health sector.  Maternity services are especially vulnerable to a situation such as this, and personnel are absolutely required to ensure safety and the avoidance of any difficulties.  We gave the example of the maternity hospital in Limerick.  Redeployment has been agreed locally and there is a need for additional staff after redeployment.  One month after the business plan has been sent up the line, however, it has not been approved and it has not got the green light.Yesterday the Minister for Health finally admitted that public patients will have their surgery cancelled as a result of what is happening.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	109	These things would not be happening if there had been a planned approach to this particular issue.  Why are we getting a constant drip feed of issues arising from the difficulties caused by this exit from the public service?The public and the workers are awaiting certainty and guidance from the Government on this issue.  If there is a plan, will the Taoiseach agree to publish it?  Will he publish all documentation in every Department outlining the transitional work that is under way?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Deputy Martin is aware that there have been programmes over the years, involving every commentator in the land, about the bloated extent of the public service and the requirement to reduce overall numbers and, consequently, the cost of the public sector due to the impact down the line on pension payment requirements.  Planning has been ongoing for quite a long time in this area.  However, the situation in respect of the numbers leaving the public service at the end of February has not crystallised until recent days.  While there has been quite a deal of intensive work across Departments, the figures did not become clear until very recently.Given the age profile of public servants, it was assumed that up to 9,000 whole-time equivalent workers would retire by the end of February 2012.  Provisional figures indicate that public service numbers fell to around 297,000 by the end of 2011 compared with the projected figure of 300,000.  Latest figures indicate that 6,600 people plan to retire in January and February this year.  The figures in the Department of Health go from September to the end of February.  The expectation in the education sector is for 2,000 staff to retire while for the Civil Service it is 1,008 and in the health sector it is 2,263.  There were 1,433 staff who went in 2011.  Local authorities expect 859 staff to retire while 241 plan to retire from the Defence Forces and 297 from the Garda Síochána.It is nothing new to have several thousand people leaving the public sector each year in the normal way.  Given the figures we know by the end of February 2012, it is right and proper that the transition be managed in a proper fashion so that services are not diminished for people who actually need them.  That is why there should be transitional teams in the five areas of health, education, local government, justice and defence, headed by assistant secretaries in each Department, and that this line of communication right down to local planners would have a clear understanding of how they propose to continue to provide services following these retirements.

He spoke about redeployment.  I listened to the nurses' representative this morning working towards the objective of providing proper services for everyone.  The Cabinet sub-committee on health had a meeting last week on this issue.  There is another meeting about it tonight in my own Department.  By next Tuesday, the transition teams and the way they are going to manage the business in each sector will be presented by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in a memo to the Cabinet.  There will be clarity, understanding and a communication to the people about how this will work.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I take it from that reply that no transition teams are in place today.

It is clear that there is an absence of any planning in this area.  Surgery would not be cancelled to the extent that has occurred if there was any degree of planning in advance.  There is now a nine month delay in processing medical card applications.  There is not a Deputy in the House who has not been called by people about this issue, especially those who are applying to have their medical cards renewed.  Does the Taoiseach realise that chronically ill patients who have been on medical cards for years have to pay between €120 and €150 to get life-saying medicine?  It is very serious.If people were planning and had some idea of what was happening on the ground, at least they would immediately tell pharmacists to allow the medication while the application for the medical card is being processed due to the inordinate delays at central level.  The Government could take the practical step of making an executive order stating that those applying for a renewal of their medical card keep getting their medication under the old card until a decision has been made on their renewal application.  Chronically ill patients are being put under enormous pressure when procuring life-saving drugs.  I am not making that up.  People across the House are regularly getting such calls.  The Government could immediately act on this, as it could on community services, planned surgeries and so on.Have any transition teams been established in any Department, or is it just something the Taoiseach invented on Sunday and is now going to follow through because it sounded good on "This Week"?  Could he give Members the timeline for the establishment of these transition teams?  They are urgently needed, especially in the health area.

If he just listened to what I said, he would have heard that the figures for those leaving in the sectors I mentioned only became clear at the weekend.  For that reason, it is right and proper that a plan be put in place in order that we can communicate to people about what is going to happen and how that will be managed.  In the health area, for example, I expect that local hospital managers will be available to clarify the plans they have in place.All of these discussions have taken place for quite some time, but in the absence of accurate figures.  We now know those figures.  The Cabinet sub-committee dealing with health confirmed this last week.  There is also a meeting in my own Department this evening and all of these teams will be named and placed and approved by the Cabinet next Tuesday, so that people-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I agree with Deputy Martin regarding the plight of citizens who are waiting for new medical cards and who are caught in a bind because they have not received their medication.  However, I want to talk to the Taoiseach about a different issue.  Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, announced a temporary reduction in the registration cost for septic tanks from €50 to €5 and this is to be welcomed.  However, hundreds of thousands of rural dwellers still face the prospect of punitive bills for the upgrading or replacement of septic tanks.  Does the Taoiseach accept that this discriminates against rural dwellers, that it is an attack on them and on rural communities?  Billions of euro have been spent on upgrading and providing a modern sewerage system in urban areas.  Rural households helped to pay for this with their taxes yet they are being forced by the Taoiseach's Government to bear the burden of the cost of improvements, upgrades or replacement.  Is dona an scéal é go bhfuil pobal na tuaithe faoi ionsaí ag an Rialtas agus tá na mílte daoine ag cur in aghaidh an pholasaí seo trasna an Stáit.  Sílim go bhfuil an ceart acu.  The Taoiseach insists that rural householders will have to make improvements.  We are in agreement about a clean environment and clean water and so on but on the other hand he is failing to provide standards or funding, he is threatening citizens with fines and prosecutions if they do not comply and he will criminalise rural households.  Should not all people be treated equally?  In another flip-flop, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, said this morning that some financial aid will be available but he did not give any details.  I ask the Taoiseach to assure rural dwellers and communities that a full grant aid scheme will be available for those who are forced to upgrade their septic tanks.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I understand Deputy Adams has a holiday cottage in Donegal but I am not sure if it is connected to the public sewerage scheme.  I suggest the next time he is there he should have a look.  I am quite sure this is the first time for a long time that I have heard him welcome anything in this House.  I am pleased he welcomes Deputy Hogan's common-sense approach to this matter.  I am quite sure we are going to have people spluttering into their pints and saying, "Oh God, I should not have bought this, I should have registered the septic tank instead."  For less than the price of a pint in many establishments, a person can register the fact that he or she is the owner of a septic tank.  As Deputy Adams will undoubtedly agree, what we need in this country is clean water and safe water.  I refer to the situation in Galway city just a few years ago where the reputation of our country was diminished by the existence and the extent of cryptosporidium in the water and its impact on industry.  I am quite sure that even Deputy Adams, from his party's perspective, wishes to see as many people as possible employed and to have an environment and a water quality that is up to standard.I have listened to hysterical comment about this and many other matters in the past few weeks.  I have seen startling headlines and I have heard the Fianna Fáil Party say that rectification or improvement of a septic tank will cost €20,000.  I have heard others say it will cost €17,000-----

It is not a universal inspection as was proposed in the Fianna Fáil proposal that every septic tank in the country would be inspected.  In this case a sample number will be inspected based on quality of water.  If a person is deemed to be the owner of a septic tank that is not in good condition, that is, living up to environmental standards, then the owner will be required to desludge the tank, which means, empty the tank and have the contents disposed of in the local authority system.

Just before Christmas, the Minister said this could cost citizens in excess of €8,000 but last night he said it would cost €100.  I have attended public meetings, including in my constituency, and people just cannot afford to pay this.  They see it as discrimination against them and I agree with them completely.  Those directives dated back to 1975.  Fianna Fáil, in its time, had plenty of time to bring this in.  Labour and Fine Gael coalitions, in their time, had time to bring it in but they did not do it.  Why should citizens in rural areas be expected to pay for what should be an essential right?

This has been going on since then without any action being taken.  The Minister set out clearly what it is that he intends to do.  Someone who registers in the first three months does so for €5 and inspections do not start until 2013.  The inspections are not universal in the way that applied under the Fianna Fáil proposal.  It is not a requirement to bring all septic tanks up to the 2009 standard as set by the Environmental Protection Agency.  That only applies in the case of new septic tanks.  There are matters that householders living in the country, as I do, can take into account, namely, the prevention of run-off water from the roof and outside buildings running into the septic tank-----

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Very soon more than 3,000 people will leave the health service.  Before the previous general election the Taoiseach made a big deal about the health service and reform, and also about the principle of a universal health service which many of us were prepared to support.  Many people have genuine concerns about losing top quality people from front-line services, especially those in accident and emergency units, those involved in surgery, top class nurses and other quality health service staff.  There are grave concerns about patient safety.  Even the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, accepted publicly that operations would be cancelled or delayed.Will patients suffer because of the retirements and what will the Taoiseach do about it?  Will the waiting lists get even longer?  Last week a senior citizen who is an amputee had his home help hours cut.  What does the Taoiseach say to his family on this appalling situation?  Is it true that acute hospitals will lose 330 staff, services for the elderly will lose 150 staff, the primary care area will lose 125 and mental health services will have 114 departures?  How can they cope with this situation?Who are the transition teams?  What do they do and what it their remit?  How can the Government say it can run the health service in the next few weeks given the huge loss of quality people?  Does he not accept that it will lead to chaos in the health service?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The Government has set out its plan for the development and introduction of a universal health insurance system which will apply at the end of the Government's term of office.  The Minister will publish a White Paper and there will be detailed consultations.  The end result will be a better health system for everyone based on the need of the patient as distinct from his or her income.That is precisely the reason for having competent transition teams to manage the exodus from the public sector in general.  I have read out the figures.  According to the latest figures, a total of 263 will leave the health service.  That means approximately 1,433 left in 2011.  What it means is that responsibility will be devolved to local planners in each hospital who will know how it is that they intend to deliver services depending on the numbers that leave in any particular hospital or in any particular sector in each hospital.  Clearly, it is not equal across the board and it is not equal either in terms of the category of persons who leave.  In that sense I noted the comment this morning from the representative of the INMO, Mr. Doran, on its view of focusing on the objective of giving best patient care and attention at all times.  It is true that the end of the month will test the flexibility of the Croke Park agreement.  In that sense, everything from redeployment to all of the other issues that apply in this regard, such as rosters and various categories of service provided, must be brought into play.  It is clear that given the scale and challenge of providing continuing quality health care, it is necessary to have teams in place to deal with any situation that might arise, be it in health or any of the other sectors.I cannot comment on the individual who is an amputee, to whom Deputy Finian McGrath referred, and whose home help service has been cut, but suffice it to say that care in the community such as home care packages is central to the delivery of health services by the Minister for Health.  Community care, including home help, is critical.  I have heard of reductions in home help hours in a number of cases in various parts of the country.  A decision was obviously made by a manager in the HSE at whatever level.  I would like such people being able to respond accurately and clarify why such decisions were made, but I do not have the details of the particular person to whom Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned.

How can one realistically run an overcrowded accident and emergency department, for example, which is already under major pressure and stress, with fewer people?  How can local planners deal with those issues on the ground?  Can one carry out the same number of operations with fewer specialised nurses or doctors?  That is a serious issue for many families and patients in the State.

For example, St. Michael's House has seen its staffing reduce by 123 under the Croke Park agreement, yet it has to cope with the situation.  Will these wonderful transition teams turn up at Beaumont Hospital's accident and emergency department on a Saturday night and immediately whisk all of the patients on chairs and trolleys into beds?  Does the Taoiseach now accept that within the next three weeks there could be a crisis in the health service?  How will he sort it out with 3,000 fewer staff?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The Deputy is aware that 1,433 staff left the health service in 2011.  Transition teams are not going to turn up in Beaumont Hospital or any other hospital in the middle of the night and do what he suggests.  There are local managers in each hospital who know who will leave the service by the end of the month and they will make arrangements with the HSE, working with staff and the unions, to see to it that cover is provided.The has Minister stated it may be necessary to delay some elective surgery cases.  That may well be the case.  There has been a 10% increase in general admissions to hospitals.  This may well be because of the change in the weather or respiratory problems in older people.  As the Deputy is aware, the numbers fluctuate from time to time, depending on what the issue might be, but I want him to understand it is virtually impossible to know what situation might apply in an individual hospital at any one time.  The important thing we need to do is to manage the system in the best interests of patients.  That is why there is a need for very clear lines of command and responses from the Department of Health, the HSE, regional directors and hospital managers who have responsibility at the end of the line for their hospital.  This takes into account the co-operation of staff and trade unions in order that patients who need attention will receive it.  That is why there will be a continuous focus and intensity on the part of all of the teams between here and the end of the month in order that there will not be the crisis or catastrophe that some predict.  We are all interested in matters of health, which are about patient care and patients receiving attention.It is not possible to do what the Deputy says, given the extent of the reduction in numbers, but it is possible to see the benefits of having very strong primary care and community care systems.  In Deputy Dara Calleary's town I had the privilege of opening a modern primary care centre that takes many people away from the necessity of having to go to an accident and emergency department in the first place to have minor ailments treated.  This eases the pressure on accident and emergency departments.

The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, is the only State agency under the aegis of the Taoiseach's Department.  It was established in 2006 and is the body corporate for the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  NESDO's membership, as set out in the Act, consists of the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the NESC.  The membership of the NESC, as set out in the Act, consists of a chairperson, deputy chairperson, members appointed on the basis of nominations received from representatives of the ICTU, business and employers' interests, farming and agricultural interests, the environmental sector and the community and voluntary sector, in addition to a number of public servants and independent experts.  There are 34 members in the NESC.  From time to time the Taoiseach appoints nominees and members to fill vacancies arising from changes in nominations or on the retirement of public servants.The table provides details of all appointments made by me to the National Economic and Social Council since 9 March 2011.  These are the only board appointments I have made since coming into office.NameOrganisationDate of AppointmentProf. Edgar Morgenroth,Associate Research Professor, Economic and Social Research InstituteJune 2011Prof. John McHale,Economist, National University of Ireland, GalwayJune 2011Prof. Mary Daly,Department of Sociology, Social Policy and Social Work, Queen’s University BelfastJune 2011Prof. Anna Davis,Department of Geography, Trinity College DublinJune 2011Prof. Seán Ó Riain,Department of Sociology, National University of Ireland, MaynoothJune 2011Dr. Michael O’Sullivan,Head of UK Research and Global Asset Allocation, Credit Suisse, LondonJune 2011Ms Mary Walsh,Charted AccountantJune 2011Dr. Michelle Morris,Senior Lecturer, School of Applied Social Science, University College Dublin.July 2011Martin Fraser, Chairperson of NESCSecretary General, Department of the TaoiseachAugust 2011Shay CodyIMPACTSeptember 2011John MurphySecretary General, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and InnovationNovember 2011John Shaw, Deputy Chairperson of NESCAssistant Secretary, Department of the TaoiseachJanuary 2012
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Is the Taoiseach made aware of or consulted on appointments made by each Department?  Does he have an oversight role in ensuring a gender balance on State boards?  What degree of expertise is required to function on State boards?In the programme for Government the Government committed to amending the rules to ensure no former public servant, including political appointees, or a Minister could work in any area of the private sector which might involve a potential conflict until at least two years had elapsed.  Will the Taoiseach update the House on this commitment in terms of State board appointments?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	218	I am very conscious of the requirement to maintain a gender balance and I try to meet it in the strongest way possible.  I am glad to say a number of very competent and influential persons have been appointed across a range of boards.In so far as the question relates to my office, many of the appointees, as the Deputy is aware, are nominees of organisations.  They are not solely from the list of nominations that might come from my Department.  I cannot give the Deputy details from the brief to answer the question he has raised about people working in the private sector within two years of leaving State appointments, but I will check the position and get back to him.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	219	It is a commitment made in the programme for Government.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	223	For decades the system of appointments to State boards by the Government has been discredited because of the array of political hacks of the parties in power promoted to boards as a reward for service to their parties.  The Government promised many changes in respect of this and other matters, but is it not the case that, apart from a few cosmetic changes, it has not changed the system fundamentally?  Does the Taoiseach agree that the representation of those sections of society especially affected by the work of particular boards should have a democratic structure, thereby providing real expertise and knowledge, instead of continuing in a disguised fashion the old discredited crony system?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I have set out the position on a number of occasions.  The new arrangements provide that on their websites Departments have to invite expressions of interest from the public in vacancies on the boards or bodies under their aegis.  Ministers are not necessarily confined to those who make expressions of interest, but they must be satisfied that the people concerned have relevant qualifications.  The Government has also decided that those proposed for appointment as chairpersons of State boards have to go before Oireachtas committees to discuss what it is that they have to offer to the particular board or committee to which they are being appointed.  This has been a success to date and quite a number have been before committees.The question relates to the body under the aegis of my Department.  There are representatives from IMPACT, SIPTU, IBEC, the CIF, Chambers Ireland, ICOS, the IFA, Macra na Feirme, the ICMSA, Social Justice Ireland, the INOU, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, NYCI, Friends of the Earth, the Environmental Pillar of Social Partnership and Departments such as the Departments of Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Environment, Community and Local Government and Education and Skills.  There are also independent members from the ESRI, NUIG, Queen's University, Belfast, Trinity College, Dublin, Maynooth, Credit Suisse London, UCD, as well as a chartered accountant.This group includes a mixture of very competent people, both men and women.  In so far as their responsibilities go, under the aegis of my Department, they are doing a very good job.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	225	Athruithe polaitiúla agus athruithe tríd an gcóras a dúirt Fine Gael a bheadh ann faoi Rialtas Nua.  Dúirt an Taoiseach é sin i rith an toghcháin beagnach bliain ó shin, ach ní sin atá ag tarlú nó atá á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas.  Despite what the Taoiseach said in reply to an Teachta Joe Higgins, the fact is that vacancies for all paid positions on State boards are not being advertised on the website of the Public Appointments Service or the relevant Department.  The Taoiseach promised change in six months, but 12 months later there has been little change on this issue.  In the case of the Department of Justice and Equality, none of the appointments to eight different boards was advertised.  The chair of the Equality Authority was reappointed without being interviewed by a committee. Likewise, appointments to IDA Ireland, the National Consumer Agency and An Post have ignored the new procedures.Why have so many Departments ignored the Taoiseach's stated commitment to introduce new procedures for appointments to State boards?  Instead we have seen the appointment of a flock of past or current party members, strategists and donors of the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether he decided consciously to do a U-turn on yet another election commitment or does he intend, even a year later, to introduce some process that will change the way these appointments are made in the future?  If, as he said, he is keeping a report card on Ministers, why are these Departments ignoring his commitment on this issue?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The appointments to the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, were made by me following very careful consideration of the necessary skills, knowledge and expertise relevant to the functions of the council.  In this particular case, I appoint members specifically on the basis of nominations from business and employer interests, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, farming and agricultural interests, the community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  It would not be appropriate to advertise these appointments because they are taken by the nominees of those sectors.  I also appoint up to six public servants to the council, of whom at least one shall represent the Taoiseach and one shall represent the Minister for Finance.  Historically, the chairperson and deputy chairperson posts are filled from the Department at Secretary General and assistant secretary level.  Those appointments represent the relevant Departments to ensure the council's work is integrated.  A number of independents were appointed to the NESC in June and July of last year, all of them very academically qualified people.  These independent nominations were not advertised as I was happy with the quality of the nominees who had already been compiled in the Department, mainly from the academic sector.  It could be argued that these appointments might perhaps be advertised on the next occasion.The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport advertised on its website seeking expressions of interests for appointments as chairperson of the boards of CIE companies and the Railway Procurement Agency and to the boards of transport, tourism and sport agencies.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources advertised on its website before the end of 2011 in regard to vacancies that arose on the boards of bodies under its responsibility.  These included An Post, Bord na Móna and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht advertised for board members for the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Arts Council.  The Department of Finance sought expressions of interest for appointments to the board of directors of the recapitalised banks.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine advertised for vacancies in respect of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Coillte and the Irish National Stud.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs advertised for vacancies in the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board.  The Department of Health advertised for vacancies on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  The Department of Social Protection advertised in regard to the Citizens Information Board.A number of those appointed to chair State boards have attended before Oireachtas committees to explain the particular expertise they bring to those boards.  That innovation has been welcomed as being in everyone's interest.  It ensures the public and the members of the committees can see what the appointed chairpersons bring to their work.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I have indicated to the Taoiseach on previous occasions my view that the committees do not have any real power and should instead be modelled on those in operation on Capitol Hill.  Putting that to one side, it is good that the posts the Taoiseach named have been advertised.  However, I asked him specifically about the eight different boards within the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of which none of the appointments was advertised.  I say this with due deference to the appointees who may well be the best people for the job.  The fact remains, however, that the chair of the Equality Authority was reappointed without being interviewed by a committee.  Appointments to IDA Ireland, the National Consumer Agency and others have ignored the new procedures.  If this were a report card, how would the Taoiseach mark the Minister for Justice and Equality?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Deputy Gerry Adams's Question No. 3 asks about the board appointments from my office that were made in the recent past and that I make a statement on the matter.  In response, I pointed out the appointments that were made by me in the recent past and made a statement on the matter.  That is the Deputy's question, to which I provided the answer.  In respect of the bilateral meetings I have had with each Minister in recent weeks, all are completed with the exception of two.  At the end of March, after being 12 months in office, I will present a progress report on the basis of the accomplishments and work undertaken by each Minister in so far as the programme for Government is concerned.  This will allow Members to see the work that is under way, the work that has been completed, the work that cannot be completed and the work that is a priority for the coming period.  I am sure Deputy Adams will be very interested in that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I accept that my question was specific, but I asked as a supplementary whether the Taoiseach was informed in regard to appointments to other State boards.  In other words, was he kept in the loop and was his affirmation or agreement sought in regard to appointments to boards across the system?  A lot was promised but very little has been delivered in terms of changing the way State boards are appointed.  That is essentially what has emanated from this debate.  The role of the committees is extremely limited and amounts to interviewing the chairperson after he or she has been appointed.  The committee in question has no role in appointing or not appointing a particular person; that remains a matter for the Minister.Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the way State appointments are being made?  Does he believe they correspond with what was committed to by him and his party in advance of the general election?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	230	As Deputy Martin will be aware from his own experience, it is difficult enough to find people who want to put themselves in the public eye by chairing or participating in State boards.  This is because of the pressure they may come under from one source or another.  By and large, I am reasonably happy with the way this process has operated.  The practice of having chairpersons attend before an Oireachtas committee is an innovation which is in the public interest.  The quality of those appointed, in terms of their competence to do the job, has by and large been very good.  They are getting on with their work.Ministers apprise not only me but also the Cabinet of persons to be appointed as chairs of State boards.  Obviously, not all of the appointments to all boards come before Cabinet, as the Deputy is well aware.  The Cabinet is informed of senior appointments and the filling of positions of responsibility, as is normal procedure.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	231	One of the more radical initiatives in this area, which was introduced by the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan, was the giving of power and authority to committees to make appointments to State boards, in particular in the area of broadcasting.  That initiative brought about real change in terms of committees having a role in making appointments to the commission and so on.  It was a real innovation.  We have not had any initiatives of that type from this Government.  There has been no fundamental or substantive change in this area by Government, in particular when one measures what has been done against what was promised.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	232	In a number of cases, appointments recommended by the committee were from a list given to it by the Minister.  These are matters that can be reflected on.  We would like to reach a situation whereby the people appointed to these boards are competent people with a measure of experience which can assist a board in completing its body of work in a professional and competent manner.  I believe the appointments made to date have measured up in terms of competence and experience and that those appointed are doing a good job.  What is the best system is always debatable.  One can have in place what one believes to be a perfect system but an appointee might not be the type of person one requires to do a job.  The Deputy will be aware that some of the bodies and State boards concerned have particular decisions to make, some of which will be difficult, and in that regard will require people who are decisive and focused on Government priorities and how to deliver in the public interest.  I have taken note of what Deputy Martin said in regard to the initiative of the former Minister, Eamon Ryan.

As I understand it, in terms of the procedure which the Taoiseach described, public appointments to the boards of banks were advertised eight months ago, in respect of which the banks received approximately 500 applications.  A large majority of those who applied have already been told they will not be getting the job, which is perfectly reasonable if proper procedure is being followed.  Why, given the length of time this procedure has been going on, have no appointments been made at this stage?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	236	The Minister for Finance is considering all these matters.  The Deputy will be aware that he responded to Deputy Adams in January in respect of appointments made by him as Minister and the Department under the new procedures.  On 7 July 2011, the Minister announced the appointments to the independent fiscal advisory council and pointed out that the council is part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland's budgetary architecture.I do not have to hand up-to-date information in regard to appointments to banks.  However, the Minister outlined that there had been two appointments to the board of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  He also pointed out that owing to the specific skills required given the nature of the business model that applies at IBRC, he would not be proceeding with public advertisement of the vacancies.  He further pointed out that for the sake of completeness, he had in 2011 formed a panel of suitably qualified people for possible appointment or nomination to the boards of particular banks following a public expression of interest process and that the Bank of Ireland had recently appointed an appointee from this panel to its board.  I must stress that these appointments were in areas where a specific expertise was required by the boards concerned.If the Deputy wishes to table a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister for Finance, he will provide him with an update on the evolving process in so far as the banks and boards of banks are concerned.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, together.As I stated in the House a few weeks ago, I met the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, on 12 January in London, at which time we discussed a range of matters of mutual interest to both our countries and to our bilateral relationship, including developments in the eurozone and Northern Ireland.In our discussion on developments within the European Union and the eurozone crisis, we discussed the evolving situation with the draft intergovernmental treaty agreement, which, as the House knows, was agreed last week by 25 EU member states, with the Czech Republic and Britain deciding to stay outside.Prime Minister Cameron and I also discussed the idea of a financial transaction tax.  I set out the Government's position that a financial transaction tax in the eurozone would adversely impact on the competitiveness of the IFSC in Dublin relative to the City of London.  Such a tax should apply globally.We did not get into a discussion on the details of the current proposals on banking regulation.  As Deputies know, this matter is currently being dealt with by finance ministers at ECOFIN and the European Commission has proposed a wide range of regulatory reforms to the financial sector.  One of the key roles of ECOFIN is to adopt such proposals in co-decision with the European Parliament.As I have previously stated in the House, during our meeting the Prime Minister and I discussed recent developments in Northern Ireland.  I also raised the matter of legacy issues, including Pat Finucane and the Ballymurphy and Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Deputies will be aware the Finucane family obtained leave for their judicial review process some weeks ago in Belfast.  That hearing is expected to take place in May.I hosted the 17th summit meeting of the British-Irish Council, BIC, in Dublin Castle on Friday, 13 January.  It was an excellent meeting which provided an opportunity for BIC member Administrations to discuss current economic developments, with a particular focus on the many challenges we all face from youth unemployment.  We agreed to examine further the effectiveness in our respective jurisdictions of initiatives for youth unemployment and to report on this at the next summit of the British-Irish Council, which will be hosted by the Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, in June.  We also had a discussion on the misuse of drugs, focusing particularly on rehabilitation.  The misuse of drugs workstream is one of 11 workstreams under the British-Irish Council and is chaired by Ireland.  The discussion at the summit on the misuse of drugs was led by the Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall.We also welcomed the establishment of the standing secretariat of the British-Irish Council in Edinburgh, with the support of the Scottish Government.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Yes, Question No. 9 deals with the same issue as Question No. 4.  As regards the Taoiseach's discussions with the British Prime Minister on the financial transaction tax, it appears the momentum behind this is well under way, in particular given the announcements made by President Sarkozy.  However, it may be that this will only last as long as the election campaign in France.  We will have to wait and see what happens in that regard.  I would like confirmation and clarification from the Taoiseach as to the Government's position in this regard.  This is not only about Ireland, Dublin and the City of London.  I would argue it is about European and eurozone competitiveness with the rest of the world.  It is important that Ireland should adopt a joint approach with the British Government on the overall issue of a financial transaction tax and a European approach regarding European competitiveness vis-à-vis Asia or the so-called BRIC countries or in respect of what is happening globally.  The world is much more mobile today than it was.I refer to a matter of greater importance.  A statement was made in December that the common tax base was to be put on the agenda in the context of enhanced co-operation.  The Taoiseach mentioned earlier that he intended to discuss this with Prime Minister Cameron.  As the Taoiseach is aware, the common consolidated corporate tax base is an extremely serious issue.  The Department of Finance has commissioned research that indicated this proposal would have a significant impact on Ireland's gross domestic product, GDP, and would result in a reduction by a number of percentage points in Ireland's GDP.  Did the Taoiseach discuss this matter in detail with Prime Minister Cameron?  Did they agree on a joint approach in respect of the evolution of Europe's position on a common consolidated corporate tax base?The corporation tax rate is central to Ireland and the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, provides 33,000 jobs on foot of a very far-seeing initiative by a former Fianna Fáil-led Government in the 1980s.  More than 33,000 people work there at present and it is of crucial importance to Ireland.  Both a financial transaction tax and the common consolidated corporate tax base would be harmful, as would any attempt to undermine Ireland's corporation tax rate on foreign direct investment in general and in particular in respect of the IFSC.  In this context and in the context of the fiscal treaty, the Taoiseach is aware that before the second Lisbon treaty referendum, the then Government secured a protocol that safeguarded Ireland's corporation tax rate and which entailed all the other European states signing up to a commitment not to undermine or to make any attempt to affect Ireland's corporation tax rate.  Has a similar agreement or protocol been attached to the European Union fiscal treaty?  Alternatively, is there an understanding that as this intergovernmental approach develops, there will not be moves to undermine Ireland's position in respect of corporation tax?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The Deputy raised a number of important questions.  The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, is a subject of a paper prepared by the European Commission.  Deputy Martin is aware the European Commission is the body responsible for the promotion and initiation of legislative measures within the European Union.  As a member of the European Union, Ireland has agreed to engage in the discussions about this matter.  I can inform the Deputy there is much resistance to that matter around the European table.  It was not discussed in any shape or form or to any extent at the European Council meeting and was not the subject of a discussion between Prime Minister Cameron and me.  However, a financial transaction tax was the subject of discussion between Prime Minister Cameron and me.  Clearly, this is an issue Deputy Martin rightly identifies as being broader than simply being between Dublin and London.  It also is of serious import to people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris.  I note the comment of the French President that he intends to introduce unilaterally a financial transaction tax in France.  While that of course is his right if he wishes to do so, it is the view of the Government that were a financial tax to apply, it should apply on a global basis.  One cannot have differences of impact between, for instance, the cities of London and Dublin.Deputy Martin is correct when he stated that 32,000 people are directly employed in the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin, which is the location of more than 5,000 firms.  Moreover, substantial indirect employment also is generated and the sector contributes €2.1 billion in corporate and payroll taxes to the Irish Exchequer.  International financial services account for 10% of multinational employment and represent an estimated 7.4% of GDP.  In addition, 5% of European Union international financial services activity is carried out from Ireland.  The fundamental goal of public policy in respect of the IFSC is to develop an international financial services industry in Ireland that is built on sustainable, responsible and internationally respected foundations to maximise both the number of jobs and the quality of the employment, as well as the future sustainability and growth prospects of the industry.  The Government believes it is necessary to continue to adopt, articulate and implement a clear vision for the future of the IFSC and to demonstrate Ireland's commitment to promotion and growth there.The Deputy also will be aware that I announced a new IFSC strategy for the next five years, which came from the industry itself.  It reckons it is possible to achieve 10,000 net new jobs in that period and the strategy sets out the key drivers in this regard.  Its foundations are a tax system and tax framework that are competitive and internationally respected, as well as a regulatory regime that supports responsible business operations and ensures effective oversight and control.  As Members are aware, the oversight of that and the clearing house in respect of the IFSC and all these areas are vested in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The strategy I launched recognises and fully supports the critical importance of a credible, responsible and proportionate regulatory system, the capacity and reputation of which will provide in itself a source of competitive advantage for this jurisdiction, attracting reputable, responsible and sustainable financial services activity.  I have met numbers of representatives of the firms in question and they always have proposals and observations to make on the manner in which the IFSC is structured and run and I appreciate that.  The sector is convinced that given the system that applies in Ireland, it will be possible to achieve 10,000 new net jobs in this industry over the next five years in the green area and in the Islamic finance sector, which is growing rapidly.  From this perspective, the Government obviously understands its absolute importance.I can inform Deputy Martin there was no discussion, good bad or indifferent, on the financial transaction tax or the corporate rate of tax at any of the Council meetings.  I discussed it specifically with the British Prime Minister, who is completely opposed to it unless it was to apply globally.  While tax obviously is a national competence, universal endorsement is required if there are to be changes across the board.  While individual countries may wish to take measures, they cannot apply in an overall universal sense.  It is a very important industry for Ireland and on foot of the publication of the strategy, all concerned are anxious to drive it on.  I make the point that a chief executive from the United States observed to me the reason that organisation shifted its primary financial products to Ireland was because of the passion - that was the word used - of its young people to do the job and to move on to evolving new financial instruments and products, which are of enormous interest to Members in respect of the creation of jobs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It disturbs me there was no discussion on the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, with the British Prime Minister because Ireland must work much more proactively on this serious issue.  Its potential impact on multinationals coming into Ireland and investing further is very serious and would be negative.  The Department of Finance commissioned research that makes this point.  However, Ireland appears to be adopting a silent approach in respect of corporation tax and the CCCTB.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	247	No, we are not.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	248	We have gone along with Europe on the basis that we had better be co-operative and so on, whereas up to approximately two years ago, Ireland's position was to oppose the CCCTB as a policy and as an initiative.  There has been a change, whereby Ireland now is engaging in discussions.  In addition, I refer to French statements on corporation tax and note their recent pronouncements on this matter have been clear enough as to the future direction they seek in this regard.  Ireland should be clear that the European Union fiscal treaty does not represent a threat to its corporate tax rate.  Moreover, people must be assured in respect of the enhanced co-operation approach, which is in line with the intergovernmentalism that is being driven by the German and French Governments in the context of this treaty.  It must be emphasised that this does not pose a threat to Ireland's corporate tax structure.  People are not clear about the matter to which I refer, particularly in light of the various pronouncements that have been made in respect of it.  We have not adequately asserted how central to our economic regeneration are our corporate tax structures.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	249	We are asserting that fact and we have made our position very clear.  Since the day after I was appointed as Taoiseach by this House, I have resisted a great deal of pressure in the context of changes to the corporate tax rate.  That rate will not change and will remain at 12.5% - 11.9% effective - across the spectrum.  That certainty and decisiveness and the position I have adopted have been responsible, in part, for the restoration of the reputation of the country.  There is not any confusion about this matter, neither is there a lack of clarity in respect of it.  People are absolutely clear on what is our corporate tax rate and it will not be moving either way.My position on the CCCTB has not changed.  The fact that it is the right of the Commission to initiate legislation and promote proposals for such legislation does not mean that by participating in discussions on these one must change one's position in respect of them.  Far from this matter being on the back burner, when the relevant discussions are held in the future we will participate in them.  The issue of corporate tax levels was not discussed at the European Council meeting.  The fiscal treaty has no bearing on that matter.  We are very clear on that point.  This is an issue upon which Ireland has not equivocated in any way.  We have been very clear and decisive.  The announcements made by a number of foreign investors in the country give credence to that.  The latter are very clear with regard to what is on offer when they come here.I reiterate that when I visited the Deputy's city in recent days, it was made perfectly clear to me that there are 800 vacancies in the Cork region for IT personnel.  We must identify where the changes are occurring and consider how we can take steps, on behalf of our young population, to ensure we can meet the demand which exists.  Prime Minister Cameron and I were extremely clear with each other in respect of the financial transaction tax.  I can testify that equally strong views - which would align with my own - were expressed by other leaders present at the European Council meeting.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I thank the Taoiseach for raising the issues of the Ballymurphy killings, the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the killing of Pat Finucane with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  I would like to recap the position.  Sunday next will be the 23rd anniversary of the killing of Pat Finucane.  His family have been campaigning since his death occurred.  Sinn Féin is totally against any hierarchy of victims and has argued for an independent international commission to consider all of these cases and deal with the various victims and those who were hurt in the course of the conflict.  In this instance, however, the British Government has acknowledged that there was collusion.  Every member of the squad which killed Pat Finucane - an officer of the court and a human rights lawyer - was either a member of the British Army or an RUC special branch agent.  There is no doubt at all about that.The British Administration is currently in breach of the Weston Park agreement, an accord between the two Governments.  The Dublin-Monaghan bombings occurred almost 40 years ago and successive British Governments refused to deal with any of the inquiries or investigations into them.  In the case of the Ballymurphy killings, there is no doubt the British paratroop regiment killed all of the citizens involved and then went on to Derry to kill more on Bloody Sunday.  Its members then went to Belfast and killed further civilians on the Shankill Road, on Springhill Avenue and in other parts of the city.The Government must develop a strategy for dealing with these matters.  It is a deeply traumatising obstacle to the furtherance of the peace process if these citizens are left outside it and if the British Government, which is clearly responsible for the killings to which I refer, is not prepared to give the families involved their entitlements.  I ask the Taoiseach to develop a strategy such as that to which I refer.  He stated at one point that he would raise this matter with the relevant people in the USA and seek their support.  It is clear that Prime Minister Cameron has no responsibility for events which took place almost 40 years ago and others which occurred 23 years ago.  However, the fact that he will not deal with the issue poisons the relationship between the British Government and a new, changing Ireland which is putting war behind it.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to come forward with a strategy.Justice for the Forgotten is a group which comprises the families of the victims of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and which is not being provided with funding.  We refer to victims, we deplore what occurred and we try to ensure that events of this nature will never happen again.  Surely, therefore, the group to which I refer should be at least given the minimum amount of funding it requires.  Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála from Dublin, Deputy Ó Caoláin and I have raised this matter a dozen times in the House.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide a commitment that the minimum amount of money this group requires to continue its work will be given to it by the Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Deputy Adams and I can agree on this matter.  Before he became a Member, the House agreed an all-party motion which was very clear in calling for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  That is accepted by everyone in the Dáil.  The British Government has clearly admitted that collusion took place in this instance.  Prime Minister Cameron was very forthright, strong and correct in respect of the Blood Sunday inquiry.  I have a difference of opinion with him in respect of the matter to which the Deputy refers.  As a result of what Judge Cory stated and on foot of the agreement between both Governments which was made at Weston Park, I am of the view that holding a public inquiry would be the correct route to take.  I am still of that opinion.I cannot direct any other government.  However, I raised this matter with the Prime Minister and I will continue to raise it with him.  I am aware that my meeting with him took place on the day before the Finucane family was granted a judicial review which, I understand, is to be held in May.  I do not know the position with regard what has happened in respect of the Queen's Counsel de Silva being appointed or any other related matters.  We remain of the view that the best thing to do would have been to hold a public inquiry, specifically in light of the Weston Park agreement and because Judge Cory recommended that one should take place.  I said that to Geraldine Finucane directly when I met her and her family in Belfast on the occasion of presenting an award to her.  I undertook to raise this matter in the United States and I will do so when I have the opportunity to meet representatives over there.As stated in the House on many occasions, I do not believe in any hierarchy of victims.  Regardless of which side they were on, those who were shot, murdered or died as a result of the Troubles were lost by their families and loved ones.  In the case of Pat Finucane, there was an agreement between the two Government to the effect that whatever Judge Cory recommended would happen.  In this jurisdiction, the Smithwick tribunal was established as a result of the agreement to which I refer and on foot of the judge's recommendation.  It continues to be my preference that this is what should happen in the case of Pat Finucane and I informed the Prime Minister directly of that fact.  In light of what Mr. Cameron did in respect of the inquiry into the Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, I made sure to make that point very clear to him on behalf of all the representatives here and of the people of our country.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I thank the Taoiseach for raising these issues with the British Prime Minister.  My colleagues and I were involved in very close negotiations with the British Government for at least ten years in a very open way.  I know how it works and what it takes to get it to come to conclusions.  The decision to establish the Saville inquiry after decades of campaigning by the families and others came to be made not least because some very good work was done on the ground assisted by the Irish Government at the time.  Martin McGuinness and I were with Mr. Tony Blair in Chequers and he had a report; he left us to read it and it changed his mind.It is not enough to raise the issue with the British Prime Minister.  It is not enough to state there is a difference of opinion.  It is entirely within the grasp of the Government to bring forward such a report on Pat Finucane's killing, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings or what happened in Ballymurphy and present it to Mr. Cameron.  It is entirely within the width of the Government to enlist its diplomatic and consular services to raise this issue globally.  I recommend this approach and know how it works.I also know how deeply wounded all the people concerned are.  I lost family members also.  I hear the Taoiseach railing against IRA killings, as he is perfectly and fully entitled to do.  I regret that there was a war at any time in the history of the island.  We need to deal with these legacy issues, the issues which are subject to acknowledgement and admissions by the British Government that it was involved - in the case of Pat Finucane there is an agreement between the two Governments.  I recommend this approach and ask the Taoiseach to consider making a solemn declaration to the Dáil that he will do everything possible in his power to seek closure for the families.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	253	It is very important to stress this point.  I am not sure on the report about which the Deputy spoke and about what he gave to Mr. Tony Blair.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I did not give it.  The Irish Government helped the people in Derry.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	255	All of the facts, in so far as we know them, lead to the inescapable conclusion that there should be a public inquiry.  I do not say this just as a public representative or as Taoiseach.  The agreement between the two Governments at Weston Park was that whatever Judge Cory recommended would be followed through.  This was very clear and straight.  Judge Cory recommended that there be a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  We know about collusion which has been acknowledged.The British Government decided not to hold a public inquiry but to appoint a Queen's Counsel to go through all of the documentation - all 1 million pages of it.  The Finucane family was very aggrieved by this because their clear understanding was that there was agreement between the two Governments that tJudge Cory's recommendation would be followed through.  They were upset, as they told me to my face.  We support the holding of a public inquiry.For my part, I will follow through on my conviction.  I do not know what will happen in terms of the judicial review which will be held in May, but I will continue to raise the matter on each and every occasion on which I have an opportunity to do so with the British Prime Minister.  I cannot speak about what will happen at the judicial review in May, as I am not aware of what work is being undertaken by the Queen's Counsel, but my view, to put it simply, is that the Weston Park agreement should be honoured, that the recommendation of Judge Cory should be followed through, and that there should be a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  I will continue to raise this issue on each and every opportunity on which I have to do so.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I want to return to the financial transactions tax.  This is one of the instances in which people from the United Left Alliance have a very different view from the political establishment on both sides of the House.  I am amazed that in a situation where Europe faces its gravest economic crisis since the 1930s and this country faces its gravest economic crisis in its history - we all know the crisis was caused by the anarchic casino-like behaviour of the financial markets - the strategy of the Government, with Mr. David Cameron's Government, is to block a tiny measure to regulate and rein in these same financial markets that have wrecked the European economy.  The excuse that we cannot do it unless everybody else in the world does it also is pathetic because it is a recipe for never doing it, as the Taoiseach and Mr. Cameron well know.I find it amazing that the Taoiseach, like the previous Government, has rammed poisonous destructive austerity down the throats of the people, ordinary citizens who bear no responsibility for the economic crisis, and says he is being made do it by the European Union and the troika.  However, when one half decent proposal comes from the European Union, that we should put a tiny tax on the crazed financial markets that caused the crisis, we cannot do it because it is too difficult and would wreck the economy.  We can wreck the lives of working people, force hundreds of thousands into mass unemployment, send tens of thousands abroad by way of forced emigration, but we cannot put a tiny tax on the financial institutions which wrecked the economy, as well as the entire European economy.How will we ever have a financial transactions tax if this is the attitude?  The previous Government which bankrupted the country made similar arguments about the property sector; it called on us to look at the employment created in property development and the stamp duty received and stated it could not possibly do anything to dampen the sector because of the economy's dependency on it.  It seems the Taoiseach wants to do the same with the financial services sector.  This is very shortsighted.  Any short-term advantage the Taoiseach or Mr. Cameron may think they will get from-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Is it not the case that any perceived short-term advantage - the Government has not given any statistics or figures to back up the assertion that jobs will be lost in the Irish financial services sector - by essentially blocking the imposition of a financial transactions tax on the financial markets in Europe will amount ot a pyrrhic victory because it will make the position more volatile?  It is inevitable there will be further shocks on the international financial markets and we will be hardest hit, along with Britain, because we will have failed to put a tax on the institutions and diversify and sustain the economy, which is what we desperately need to do, by getting some money back and investing it in economic, industrial and manufacturing activity that could provide jobs and a sustainable economic future instead of riding on the backs of the anarchic financial markets.

The same applies to any other country that wishes to do so.  We have no intention of introducing a unilateral financial transaction tax here.  The Deputy's question was whether I discussed this-----
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Does the Taoiseach intend joining the rest of Europe in doing it?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	307	-----with Prime Minister Cameron.  The answer is "yes".  Did I discuss the possible implications for the City of London and the IFSC?  The answer is "yes".  As was pointed out here before the Deputy came in, there are 32,000 people working in the IFSC.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I was here.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	311	That has neither relevance nor resonance in terms of people who are working and contributing to a €2.1 billion corporate tax payment to this country and payroll from the IFSC.  The answer is "yes".  I did discuss this with the British Prime Minister and I made it clear to Deputy Martin that quite a number of other leaders around the table in Europe do not want to see a situation where unfairness in terms of competition or in terms of a financial transaction tax applies in one place-----
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	312	So there will never be a financial transaction tax here.

The Deputy has a very different view: play for nothing, work for nothing and come in here and rant day after day.  I am not sure that he ever did a day's work in his life.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	322	No.  I like a bit of to and fro.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	325	On proposed legislation, in terms of the governance of the health service I am extremely concerned with what I would perceive to be an absence of overall governance and some serious issues emerging as a result.  I instance today the situation regarding the delay in medical card applications and particularly the renewal of medical cards.  I ask the Taoiseach to update the House on when we can expect to see the Bill on the governance of the Health Service Executive since the changes the Minister announced.  In the interim, while we await that legislation, will the Government take immediate steps to come to the assistance of those who are chronically ill and depend on their medical cards for life-saving medication in that while their applications are in for renewal they would continue to receive cover for the medication they require?  It is an urgent issue.  Deputies across the House are getting calls about it.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene directly on that specific issue while we are awaiting the HSE (amendment) Bill on the governance of the health service.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Is that on the Order of Business?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I ask the Deputy to give me the details of the case to which he refers.  If we set in train a system to provide answers to applications for medical cards, I do not understand the reason that cannot operate in the way it should.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	328	There is a huge delay.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The centralising has caused enormous delay.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	335	-----while people are in the process.  Chemists are now refusing them the medication.

Some may be granted and some may be refused but that does not mean the system should not operate effectively.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	341	It is not the only problem we have come across in health, Deputy Martin.  Let us see if we can fix it.  It is not the only problem we have come across in this system or across the structure of health governance in general but it is one that must be fixed to ensure it operates in the patients' interest.  Either they get them or they do not but at least they deserve an answer quickly.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	347	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I was waiting for you to read out motion No. 11.  I may be remiss but I want to put it on the record that this effort to put together participation in the European Union battle group with a 20 minute debate is not sufficient.  Sinn Féin has consistently placed on record our opposition to Irish involvement in these EU battle groups.  There are clearly elements within the EU who want to move towards a European army model.I missed an opportunity in this respect but I do not believe the gravity of the issue has been discussed or that it can be properly dealt with in the 20 minutes that have been allocated for it.

#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Following on from the programme for Government and with respect to promised legislation on airports, will the Taoiseach comment on the serious situation pertaining in the Cork-Swansea ferry service?
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	350	That is not a matter on which there is promised legislation.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	351	It is.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I will ask the Taoiseach about it.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I am asking him about it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	354	It is related to a review of ports legislation.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Yes.  This involves some 78 jobs, a potential loss of €30 million to the south west region and during a period of 18 months that service brought 150,000 passengers into the south west.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach knows not only every highway but every byway in the south west because he is a regular traveller to the region.  He will appreciate the importance of that service to the south west region.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I call on the Taoiseach to reply.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	358	The Deputy cannot debate the issue, all he can ask is when a matter, if it is the subject of promised legislation, will be brought forward.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I was in Cork last weekend and this matter had come to a conclusion the night before I arrived.  I commended all those who had put up their money to see if that proposal would work.  There were a small number of staff in permanent jobs in the business and a sizeable proportion of the staff were agency workers who pay their taxes in another country but, be that as it may, it was undoubtedly a fact that the local spend from this service in the Cork-Kerry region was of the order of €30 million and a substantial number of persons were carried on that ferry.I met some other people who might have views about re-attempting another programme there, but this is a case of where, clearly, State assistance could not be given in one case and not in another.  While I commended those who put together the proposal and raised, by all accounts, serious money, it just was not possible to see it through.  The position regarding the workers is that the number of permanent employees was small and the remainder of the staff were agency workers who pay their taxes in a different country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Would the Government support the restoration of the ferry?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The Cabinet approved this morning the appointment of 33 senior personnel and I expect that the Commissioner, in looking at the rostering arrangements and appointments to different localities around the country, will see to it that the appointments made today, 33 in all, will add greatly to the stability and the importance of the gardaí being able to do their jobs in protecting citizens from criminals.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The arrival of the Minister for Finance is timely.  Given that the heads of the personal insolvency Bill have been published, will we have a comprehensive statement by Government on the strategy for dealing with mortgage arrears?  The Taoiseach had said all along that the personal insolvency Bill was the reason that was not forthcoming.  We have been assured that work is going on in the background since the Keane report was delivered at the end of September last, but can we now have a statement from the Minister setting out the strategy, in its totality, for dealing with the problem?When will the legislation dealing with the European stability mechanism, to which we have signed up, the new treaty on that, be brought to the House?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	368	In respect of the personal insolvency Bill and the implementation of the Keane report, the Minister for Finance outlined in some detail the schedule ahead for that.  The heads of the personal insolvency Bill have been published.  A detailed press conference was given by the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will take the Bill, and by the Minister for Finance.  I can confirm that there is an implementation group in the Department of Finance dealing with work on the Keane report.  It is part of a package which needs to be right and comprehensive to deal with the very many varied cases that exist.  As the Deputy is well aware, they are not all the same, those concerned all have different circumstances with which to contend.  We need to get it right.  The Minister will continue to update the House as the process evolves to the point where we can legislate and get on with attempting to ease the pressure and stress on the many thousands of families affected.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Will the Taoiseach instruct the Whips to facilitate a debate on the crisis in the health services with regard to the exodus of about 8,000 staff?  I support what Deputy Martin said about the issuing of medical cards.  We have all encountered serious problems trying to resolve it and the issue is much more serious than just one of paperwork.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Deputy can raise with the Whips the matter of having a debate on that issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	371	This request was made a few weeks ago and we had a special debate on the HSE and the situation in the health services in the House last week.  I do not see why we cannot have evidence from Deputies of all parties about particular cases in respect of medical cards.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	372	We have it all.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	373	If there is a system in place, it should operate and the people who apply for medical cards should get an answer as to whether they are entitled to them or not, but they should not be left in limbo.  I take into account what Deputy Martin said.  I have such cases raised with me and it is not very nice when somebody feels they have been thwarted by the system, and if they need medicines, they deserve to have them made available to them, and the Minister for Health stands by that.  It is a case of finding out where is the blockage in the system and releasing it in order that everybody who applies for a medical card can have a response efficiently, competently and professionally.  As these issues are all about patient care and attention, we could consider that.  I am not sure that the Deputy wants another debate on health, we had one last week.  We could have such a debate at the Joint Committee on Health and Children in a short while if Members wish to raise the issue again at that committee.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I wish to raise another health matter and one that is the subject of promised legislation, the health insurance risk equalisation Bill, which concerns quite a number of people.  When is it likely to be published and have the heads of the Bill being discussed?  To what extent has the scope of the Bill being decided on by Cabinet and when is it likely to come before the House?The bail Bill, to be taken by the Department of Justice and Equality, is to consolidate and amend the bail laws.  There is some considerable body of opinion to the effect that the bail laws, as currently constituted, are not adequately updated to deal with the level of recidivism and general increase in crime.  The Taoiseach might be able to indicate when that Bill is likely to come before the House and if the heads of it have been discussed in that context.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I can inform the Deputy that the first Bill he raised is due in May 2012.  I do not have a date for the bail Bill to which he referred.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The Taoiseach outlined on Leaders' Questions today that the Minister for Health has published detailed plans in the context of the universal health insurance but will he outline exactly at what stage are those plans?  To date we have been unable to gather any information with regard to detailed plans.  All we have is a commitment to set up an implementation body to oversee the Minister's opaque views on the whole issue of funding of the health services.  That leads to the question raised previously by Deputy Martin in context of medical cards.  If Members on the other side of the House are saying there is not an issue, they are not listening to the many thousands of people who contact all our offices on a daily and weekly basis who have been refused medical cards.  It is a crying shame that we all have had cases brought to our attention of------
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Is there promised legislation on the first issue the Deputy raised?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	378	-----people who are dying as we speak who cannot get medical cards.  If the Taoiseach wants the details of those persons' queries, I will give them to him and I will give him the details of many more as well.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	379	We could all give them.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I did not say the Minister has published details plans in respect of universal health insurance.  I said it is the intention of the Government to introduce a universal health insurance system at the end of this Oireachtas which will mean everybody will have medical attention made available to them on the basis of their medical requirement as distinct from their income.  The Minister has set up an implementation group and it will meet very shortly.  His intention is to produce a White Paper which will be properly discussed.  It will not be implemented this year.  As I said, it is part of the programme for Government to introduce it towards the end of the lifetime of this Government.  The medical card situation here seems to be similar to the passport problem we had some time ago.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Worse.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	382	That was dealt with and the medical card problem will be dealt with as well.  There is a difference between not getting a medical card and being granted one.  The system that operates should be professional, competent, efficient and up to date, and if a person applies for a medical card and complies with all the conditions on the application form, there is no reason he or she should be left in limbo.  That is an issue we will take up to see if we can sort out the problem.  If Deputy Kelleher wishes to give me the details of that particular case, I would be happy to take them from him.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	383	We all have dozens of cases.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	385	During the statements on Dáil reform last week, the Minister for Justice and Equality made a personal attack on me when I was not present in the Chamber, although I was about the only one present in the environs of Leinster House other than the few who were participating in that debate.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The Tánaiste was playing pool down in Galway and the Taoiseach was in my fine county of Cork, yet I was the one accused of not being here.  Just to let everyone on the Government side know, I was here.  I did sign on in the one-stop shop and was witnessed by very competent officials, so for anyone to insinuate that I was not in the Chamber is untrue.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	400	When can we hope to see the companies (miscellaneous provisions) Bill?  The Taoiseach met the workers in Vita Cortex last Friday, on which I commend him.  Also yesterday, Members of the Oireachtas from Cork city, including Deputies Martin, Michael McGrath and me, along with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Lynch, met the workers, who have been protesting for more than 50 days.  The promised legislation is aimed at strengthening and improving the enforcement of company law.  I hope we will see it before the House soon because the workers at Vita Cortex are suffering today.  I know the Taoiseach met them on Friday and I thank him for that, but we need to see legislation that will prevent people who have given a lifetime of service from being treated badly.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	401	That Bill is due late this year.  I can confirm that I did meet representatives of the union and workers at Vita Cortex last week in Cork.  I found them to be a very real and honest group of people, and what they are looking for is respect.  One of them has given 47 years service to this company.  I met the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, today.  Clearly, this is a difficult problem.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement cannot find sufficient grounds with regard to the company.  The workers' case is that everyone else who left Vita Cortex was given a redundancy payment of 2.9 weeks per year.  The Minister for Social Protection has been processing the applications for redundancy by these workers.  I hope to meet again with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to see what assistance, if any, can be given from here.The Labour Relations Commission is, of course, available and continues to be available to facilitate talks.  I intend to write to the commission following my meeting with the Vita Cortex workers.  As I said, what they are really looking for is a sense of respect based on the many long years of service they gave to the company, including, I might add, facilitating the release of sophisticated machinery for overhaul in recent months in order that the company could meet its targets and objectives, and they feel very aggrieved at the way this is turning out.

#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this issue, as it is one that affects thousands of people around the country, not least in my home constituency of Wicklow, and has recently been highlighted in the media.These past few years have been difficult for many home owners who are struggling to keep their heads above water.  I have been contacted repeatedly by constituents from Bray to Greystones and from Arklow to Baltinglass who are worried about how to cope with mortgage payments they cannot sustain. There are too many in negative equity and too many who bought at the height of the market for fear of being left behind by a market that eventually had a hard landing.The Government, I know, is doing what it can to help people caught in these untenable situations.  I have in past times welcomed such initiatives as were contained in the Keane report, and I look forward to seeing the personal insolvency Bill passed as soon as possible.  Indeed, as Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I very much look forward to hearing from interested parties with regard to the heads of the Bill, which will come before the committee soon.  While I welcome the actions that are being taken by the Government on these important issues, I cannot understand why the recent budgetary measures on mortgage interest relief have not been passed on.Last week I heard from a young couple in Blessington who are in severe financial difficulty.  The man was employed in the construction industry and was earning great money during the boom.  The woman is a homemaker who looked after their three young children.  They bought a very comfortable home a few years ago to provide for their growing family, when they could afford to pay for it.  They paid more than €500,000 for this house, but in today's market it is not worth even half that amount.  He has lost his job and they are struggling to keep up with mortgage repayments.  They worry for their future and the future of their children.  They told me that anything that would make their lives a little easier would be very welcome, and this included the mortgage interest relief.I have a number of questions for the Minister.  Why has the situation arisen whereby the computer systems of the Revenue Commissioners are not in co-ordination with those of the banks?  How is it that the more than 270,000 people who are eligible for this relief are being forced to wait?  People are trying to balance their personal budgets on a daily, weekly and monthly basis and they need to have more certainty on issues such as this.  Can the Minister confirm when this problem will be resolved?  I understand from local media reports that the necessary alterations might not be made until April.  Why would there be such an extensive delay?  How much will it cost the State to bring the computer systems into line with each other?  Are any other payments affected by this lack of communication?Can the Minister confirm which financial institutions have passed on the interim rate of 25%?  Can he say why most customers who have been switched to the interim rate have not been informed of the change by their respective banks?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Mortgage interest relief is available in respect of qualifying interest on a qualifying loan in respect of a qualifying residence.  A qualifying loan is a loan used for the purchase, repair, development or improvement of an individual's principal private residence.  The relief is provided at source through financial institutions.  This means that the mortgage holders get the benefit of the relief directly from their mortgage providers in the form of reduced monthly repayments which take account of the tax relief.The cost of mortgage interest relief is a significant burden on the Exchequer.  At its peak in 2008 mortgage interest relief cost the Exchequer €705 million.  It is estimated that the cost of mortgage interest relief was €457 million in 2011.It is acknowledged that the early years of a mortgage are the most difficult for mortgage holders.  Therefore, since 1993, mortgage interest relief has been focused towards first-time buyers, granting this cohort a higher rate of relief, as it was considered that these mortgage holders were most in need of assistance.  In the supplementary budget of 2009, mortgage interest relief was entirely focused on mortgage holders who were in the early years of their mortgages.  Mortgage interest relief was ceased for mortgage holders who had already received mortgage interest relief for seven years or more.In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, mortgage interest relief was increased in budget 2012 to 30% for first-time buyers who purchased their first homes between 2004 and 2008.  This measure was intended to help mortgage holders who purchased at the peak of the housing market.  The Government also reversed the previous Government's decision to reduce the rates and ceilings of mortgage interest relief for those purchasing in 2012.  The previous rates are maintained at 25% for first-time buyers, reducing to 20% on a sliding scale, and 15% for non-first time buyers.  Anyone currently qualifying for mortgage interest relief or who purchases in 2012 will receive the relief up until the end of 2017.  These measures will cost in the region of €55 million per annum.  Mortgage interest relief will not be available for new loans from 2013 and it is set to be abolished altogether from 2018.  Further technical details will be set out in the Finance Bill to be published later this week.When any time-limited measure is introduced, there is always pressure from individuals, falling outside the scope of the measure, for it to be extended to them, for example, individuals who purchased in 2003.  However, it is necessary to choose a cut-off point as otherwise the measure will become untargeted and very costly.  It is evident that house prices increased significantly during the period 2004 to 2008.  As the Deputy will appreciate mortgage interest relief is most valuable to mortgage holders in the early years of the mortgage, when the interest makes up most of the repayment.I am aware that some mortgage holders have pointed out that they are not eligible to benefit from the new measure, despite having purchased in the period, because they have rented out their homes.  While these individuals are not eligible for mortgage interest relief, because it is not now their principal private residence, they would be entitled to a 75% mortgage interest tax relief against the rental income from this property.Mortgage holders who find themselves in difficulty may qualify for mortgage interest supplement.  This is a means-tested payment made by the Department of Social Protection to provide short-term support to help pay mortgage holders' interest repayments.Finally, it should be noted that the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears governs the relationship between lenders and borrowers who are in arrears and contains a number of important protections for borrowers.  It has established a mortgage arrears resolution process for handling cases in arrears and dedicated arrears support units and appeals processes.  The code of conduct also provides that a lender must not apply to the courts to commence legal action for the repossession of a borrower's private residence until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower.Mortgage interest relief is available only in cases where mortgage interest is being paid.  Therefore, I appreciate that the current relief is not going to help those in arrears.  As I have mentioned, other solutions are available for this category of mortgage holders.

I referred to the recent media reports that people who were due to get their mortgage interest relief increased to 30% were not getting it.  It has also been highlighted that the computer systems of the Revenue Commissioners and those of the various banks are not talking to each other.  We had similar problems in the past but they were resolved.These people cannot afford to wait month by month.  They are now being told by the banks and the Revenue Commissioners that it could take two or three months for the problem to be sorted.  People throughout the country are struggling for any little help we can give them.  I appreciate that the Minister and this Government have done a great deal to help people who are struggling to pay their mortgages but why is there a delay since the Minister announced this in the budget?  It is the beginning of February and we are being told these people will have to wait until April.  Why is there a breakdown in communications between the Revenue Commissioners and the banks?  What is the cost to the State of getting the two systems to work together?People's opinion of the banks is at a very low ebb, and has been for some time.  Why have the banks not implemented the mortgage interest relief?

#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	427	I thank the Minister.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon.I have been contacted by numerous teachers who have been trying to get accreditation for a long period of time from the Teaching Council.  In one instance, a teacher with 17 years experience has been waiting for more than two years, while another teacher with specific qualifications in applied mathematics has been waiting for more than a year.  It has gone beyond the point of frustration for these teachers.  They want to get the proper accreditation and get on with their jobs.  I raise this issue because I do not understand why should it take this long to do it.  Why should a teacher be told, over the telephone, by a person in the Teaching Council that he or she will be dealt with within the following 16 to 18 weeks?We politicians live in the real world.  If someone rings us on a Monday morning, he or she expects us to get back to him or her by that afternoon and to have the issue sorted by the Tuesday morning.  That is the world in which we and many people in the private sector live.  Many within the public service live in that world also.  I am not disparaging or making generalisations about the public sector.  However, I would like to know why an official can recite over the telephone that it will take 16 to 18 weeks to sort out a problem that could be dealt with much more quickly.  It sends a message about the lack of efficiency, due process and initiative on the part of officials in such positions.We need to look at these instances in the context of the overall reform to which the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister of State are aspiring.  There will be considerable change and reform in the education system.  We should emulate countries such as Finland that are spending minimal amounts of Exchequer funding on administration but pumping money into the classroom and the coalface of teaching.  They are also empowering schools and devolving power to the local level.  We have inherited a centralised education system.  While checks and balances are needed in any system, our model which concentrates control at the centre needs to be examined closely when we go through the reform process.When the public sees what is happening to the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools and teachers' jobs being threatened, the issue of fairness comes up.  Members of the public are not considering fairness in relation to what is happening in their own backyard but in other places where savings could be made.  I am not saying we should abolish the Teaching Council.  I am saying we must send a strong signal that efficiencies are being made in the Teaching Council.  Making a telephone message to say it will take 16 to 18 weeks to sort out a very simple problem does not augur well for the efficiencies towards which we aspire to making.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I am taking this Topical Issue Debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.The Minister sees the Teaching Council as key to implementing the Department's strategic objectives on the quality of teaching and learning in schools.  Much work has been done by the council to develop education, in particular, in maintaining and improving teaching standards.  When the Act is fully commenced, the State will have a comprehensive regulatory framework in place for the teaching profession.The Teaching Council was established on a statutory basis in March 2006 under the Teaching Council Act 2001.  Its functions and objects are set out clearly in the Act and cover matters such as the promotion of teaching as a profession, the promotion of the professional development of teachers, the improvement of the quality of teaching in the State and the registration and regulation of teachers.The Teaching Council Act includes provisions governing membership, funding, accountability and the council's relationship with the Department.  The legislation provides for the appointment of a 37 member council, of which 22 members are either directly elected teachers or nominated by teacher trade unions.  The term of each council is limited to a maximum of four years.  The council has responsibility for operationalising the provisions of the Act and the development of the necessary organisational and collaborative strategies and structures for the effective regulation of the teaching profession.  It is responsible for the conduct of its affairs and meeting any obligations arising in this regard.As a public body, the Teaching Council complies with a range of Government policies and requirements applicable to public bodies generally, including policies on employee numbers and remuneration and corporate governance.  Under the Act, the council is a self-funding body but is subject to independent audit and required to publish its accounts, together with its annual report, which are lodged in the Houses each year.A number of other obligations fall on the Teaching Council which enhance its accountability.  It is required to implement the Department's policies on teacher education, probation, qualifications, professional conduct and so on.  The approval of the Department is required for the drawing up of regulations in areas such as the election of members, the charging of fees and the registration of teachers.  The council is required to provide the Minister with information and advice on matters relating to its functions having regard to resource implications and other relevant matters.  In certain circumstances, members of the council may be removed.Aside from the formal provisions, there is ongoing contact and communication between my Department and the Teaching Council at official level.  The Minister meets the council from time to time.  He is satisfied that the accountability of the council is in order, both in terms of regulation and in practice.The matters raised by the Deputy stray into the operational day-to-day functioning of the Teaching Council, particularly how it interacts with those who seek to avail of its services.  I share his concerns regarding the instances he referenced.  I will work closely with him in addressing these concerns if he wishes to raise them with me later.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I welcome the Minister of State's response and appreciate his offer to work with me in addressing my concerns.  I look forward to working with him on the matter.On a broader level, the single biggest sickness in the country in the past 20 years has been the increase in bureaucracy and red tape.  It will be difficult to grasp this nettle.  We need to change to a culture in which efficiency and providing a response for the public will be priorities.  In the first 12 months of the Government Ministers have gone about their business in a very efficient and proactive way.  However, we must now tackle the bureaucracy and red tape that are holding back people in business and preventing decisions being taken in a reasonable period of time.  This challenge faces both Opposition and Government Deputies.  I do not speak specifically about the Teaching Council; I am talking in general terms.  The single biggest challenge for the Dáil is to tackle the sickness of bureaucracy and red tape.  That responsibility rests on people on both the Opposition and Government sides of the House.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I concur wholeheartedly with the Deputy in the sentiments he expressed.  Bureaucracy, properly administered, can be wonderful, but it can be a drag on job retention and creation.  As the Deputy pointed out, we must be careful in the coming months and years to root out unnecessary bureaucracy.  Internationally, there are many wonderful examples of how this has been done.  Having worked closely with a number of public servants in the Department, I am adamant that there is a willingness to make this happen.  Whether that willingness permeates all sections of the public service is questionable.  A report published by the European Commission last May, which was carried out by Accenture and the department of economics at the University of Oxford, concluded that if our public service acted in the manner it should act, eliminating bureaucracy and encouraging job creation where it may happen, we could create up to 15 million new jobs across the EU by 2020.  That is the challenge we are facing.  We urgently need to engender an innovative and almost entrepreneurial culture in the management of the public service.  The situation in which we find ourselves now, where those people are working with severely reduced resources, may actually cause that to happen, because it certainly has not happened in the past.If the many silos in our public services were run as efficiently and creatively as some entities in the private sector, that cultural shift which needs to occur would actually occur.  We need to have our public services essentially serving the public.  It sounds very trite, but that is how simple it is.  That is not happening at the moment, but it most certainly needs to happen in the future.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the Minister of State's strong personal commitments on the issues covered in her own brief.I would like to talk today about the cuts to community-based counselling services.  They provide family therapy, counselling to youth work and marriage guidance and support to families in crisis.  There are about 29 of these community-based projects throughout the country.  In 2009 they received about €8 million in funding.  What is unique about these services is that they developed organically within our communities.  The drive to set up these counselling services came from people living in their communities such as community development workers, people from religious orders and people involved in all sorts of community activity.  They recognised that there was a huge gap in family support and that there was a need for access to quality counselling for families, many of which are on a low income and which simply could not afford to access this type of support in the private sector.  These facilities were established within communities.  They have boards of directors that are set up within the communities as well.  They provide a vital service to those communities.In recent months, these community-based services have received notice from the Family Support Agency that they will receive a funding cut of 12% this year, 12% next year and 12% the year after.  This is on top of a 10% cut they received last year when Fianna Fáil was in power, and this makes up a 46% cut over four years.  These services simply cannot sustain such cuts.  If the cuts go ahead, many of them will close.The Genesis counselling service in my own constituency of Dublin West was established in 1993, based on a needs assessment of the community.  It is located in the Corduff, Mulhuddart and wider Dublin 15 area.  Its establishment was a recognition that there was a huge gap in supports for working class communities to ensure that people get access to counselling services.  The service provides counselling for parenting and for relationships in difficulty.  It receives referrals from organisations like Women's Aid, the Garda Síochána, child protection agencies and legal aid.  It plays an incredibly important role in providing support to people.I met the board of directors of Genesis counselling service a few weeks ago.  The people on the board are not prone to histrionics or grandstanding.  They are rooted in working class communities throughout this country and they are saying that if the cuts go ahead, these services may close and this will have a devastating impact on the communities that we serve and seek to represent in the Dáil.  We need to review the cuts urgently.If families do not get access to support and assistance for young people experiencing difficulties, what will be the outcome?  More young people will become involved in criminal activity.  There will be more family breakdown, more drug use and alcohol abuse.  It will lead to a range of social problems.  It will also cost the Exchequer far more than the cost of the provision of services in the community.  Crude cuts of this nature do not equal savings for the taxpayer.  They do nothing to address the economic crisis in which we find ourselves.  They do nothing to address the 14% unemployment rate.I implore those making these decisions not simply to look at a balance sheet.  I appreciate the Minister for Finance may have other commitments, but it is a pity he was not able to stay to listen to this debate.  The decisions that have been made on spending cuts are impacting locally.  They are greatly affecting community services, youth projects, and community development programmes.  That will undermine the progress that has been made in our communities.  I cannot see how that is in anyone's interest.I know the Minister of State has a very strong track record on these issues over many years.  I ask her, through her office, to bring any support she can to have these cuts reviewed.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I thank Deputy Nulty for raising this issue.  The mental health of the population plays a vital role in the vibrancy and economic life of the country.  Investing in the promotion of positive mental health and in early intervention is an investment not only in the individual's quality of life, but also in that of his or her family and even the community in general.Expenditure reductions in 2012 will challenge all areas of the health system to provide continuity of services that are both appropriate and safe for patients.  Like other care areas, efficiency savings and other savings will be required from the mental health service nationally, which will necessarily involve some rationalisation and reorganisation of services at local and regional level.  We have shifted the emphasis in mental health service delivery in recent years from the old model of institutional care to community-based multidisciplinary services which necessarily engage with service users at local level and often in their own homes.  As a result, in many instances the family will also benefit through supports appropriate to the individual's needs.  Such services assist families in coping with what is often a very difficult and stressful environment.Cuts to services have not been targeted at this particular area.  We have in fact prioritised mental health services for children and adolescents and have sought to expand inpatient provision as well as extending the reach of the service in this area to the community level, including home based treatment where possible.  An example of the improvement in the child and adolescent area is the planned relocation of the Warrenstown inpatient service to recently vacated and redecorated facilities at St. Loman's Hospital in Palmerstown - I know the Deputy is familiar with this - which will involve more efficient use of staff resources available and the delivery of a higher level standard of service overall, including additional inpatient beds.  Further down the road, these services will transfer to the new facilities in Cherry Orchard.Despite all the cuts that have had to be applied across the board in health, I am glad to say that it was possible in the 2012 budget to announce a special new allocation of €35 million for mental health services in line with our programme for Government commitments.  This funding will be used primarily to strengthen community mental health teams in both adult and children's mental health services by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is on every team.  It is intended that the additional resources will be rolled out in conjunction with a scheme of appropriate clinical care programmes.  Approximately 400 additional staff will be recruited to support these initiatives.  In addition, further inpatient child and adolescent beds will open this year, something that for a long time has been a critical gap in the spectrum of mental health services.Some of the new funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self harm presentations, and to improve access to psychological and counselling services in primary care, specifically for people with mental health problems.  Some provision will also be made to facilitate the relocation of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities in line with the health document, A Vision for Change .
It is imperative that the Government gets the best value for money for our available resources in these most difficult of economic times.  The duplication of mental health services needs to be avoided to provide a more streamlined service.  We need to co-ordinate our efforts and work together to develop our mental health services in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  In essence, we need to provide more with less and this has already been achieved in mental health service provision in many areas.I am fully committed to working closely with the HSE and voluntary agencies to introduce programmes and services which will deal more effectively and appropriately with the issue of mental health.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I agree that there is a need for value for money on every item of public expenditure and that the people we represent expect this.  This is the annual report of the Genesis psychotherapy and family therapy service which gives value for money.  If there is a 12% cut in services such as this this year and in the two following years, value for money will not be achieved.  It will result in a higher level of family breakdown in our most vulnerable communities.  As an example, the Genesis service has a waiting list of 100.  It costs money to provide mortgage interest supplement, rent supplement and send people to prison.  I do not believe reductions in expenditure of this nature help us to bridge the gap between income and expenditure.  It is a case of moving the furniture around the house when we should investing in the provision of early support such as that provided by the Genesis service.  I welcome the Minister of State's personal commitment and invite her to visit the service to see the work being done.  I appreciate she is not in a position to give a commitment today, but I ask her to ask her departmental officials about the cut to this service.  The people who raised the issue with me are dealing with mental health issues on the ground in working-class communities and deeply concerned about the closure of such facilities.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I have no doubt that the service to which the Deputy refers is an excellent one and doing an exceptional job.  The difficulty from our perspective is that we need to provide an exceptional service in all areas of the country.  We hope to do this by means of the community mental health teams which, in combination with primary care teams, will give us a bigger bang for our buck.  While I acknowledge that groups such as Genesis provide an excellent service in particular areas, we must ensure a service is delivered to everyone.  That is our objective. It will be a nationwide service.  I am confident that the expertise of the Genesis service will be well utilised because additional personnel will be needed to staff the community mental health teams.  We need to be cautious about saying young people with mental health or personal difficulties automatically end up in prison because that is not necessarily the case.  I have no doubt that Genesis is providing an invaluable service.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	436	We are seeing a repeat of a trend in the health service since the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, took office.  There has been almost a 50% increase in the cost of health insurance for families.  At the start of the year the Minister announced a 40% increase in the health insurance levy charged to health insurance providers.  The levy was to ensure the companies would not increase their prices, but VHI increased the cost of cover for older people by up to 12.5%.The Minister said he would not be closing any hospitals.  This was the same promise given during the general election campaign with regard to Roscommon County Hospital and other hospitals, yet when the HSE service plan was published just a few weeks ago, up to 900 community hospital beds were to be closed across the country.The Minister stated the retirement of staff under the early retirement scheme would not result in a diminution of services or have an adverse impact on patient treatment times.  This week, however, he has admitted that elective treatments may have to be postponed or delayed, for which he makes no apology, despite having tried to create a mirage in the past few weeks by saying there would not be an impact on services.The one area in which treatment is not elective is maternity services.  Babies will continue to be born; the Minister cannot apply the brake and tell people to hold off in terms of the number of babies born in the State.  However, as of last week, staff were leaving maternity units across the country and the Government had no plan as to how the situation would be dealt with.  The Taoiseach has announced that transition teams will be in place, but how will the Government ensure services for newborn babies and their mothers will be in place?I refer to comments made by some of the professional staff working in maternity services.  The director of the HSE obstetrics and gynaecology programme, Professor Michael Turner, said staff reductions and cuts to HSE maternity service programmes could result in an increase in maternal and infant mortality rates.  His concern is that unless we prioritise maternity services, we will see an increase in the number of maternal deaths if resources are cut too severely.  That is the price that will be paid.I refer to staff reductions in the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital which will occur next month.  Consultant obstetrician Gerry Burke has stated a huge exodus of the most experienced midwives from the hospital is taking place.  He has also said that if the HSE has a comprehensive plan, it is not sharing it with staff.  The Rotunda Hospital is losing 11 midwives, while eight are due to leave Holles Street Hospital.  One in four midwives is leaving the maternity hospital in Limerick.  How can the service be maintained?  Will the Minister of State outline the plans in place and how this most non-elective of services will be maintained to ensure newborn babies and their mothers are given the service they require and expect?  I hope she can give the House some information on the transition teams and how maternity services will be protected.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter to which I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.The question put to the Minister by the Deputy was: "To ask the Minister for Health if he will publish the plan for dealing with midwifery services, particularly in Holles Street, which may be affected by retirements at the end of the month".  There is no indication in this question of the additional issues raised by the Deputy.  I ask him, therefore, to excuse me if I do not respond to them.  Any additional information required will be provided for the Deputy.The Minister is aware of the impact the early retirement package will have on the provision of maternity services and all services nationally.  He has requested the HSE to prioritise the safety of patients and the avoidance of risk in the delivery of services for them.  Planning for the delivery of health services is undertaken within the context of the annual national service planning process which ensures all factors, including budgets and staffing levels and any other emerging issues, including the impact of retirements, are factored in in the plan for the services to be delivered within the coming year.  In parallel with this process, each of the HSE's four regions is required to develop a more detailed regional service plan.  Managing the specific risks associated with the forthcoming retirements has been undertaken within this planning context and will form part of the soon to be published regional service plans.It is anticipated that 9.16 whole-time equivalent midwives and nurses will retire from Holles Street Hospital.The hospital is planning to take a number of steps to minimise the impact of these retirements and to ensure the ongoing delivery of safe services for mothers and babies.  Some of the posts affected are in the management area and their duties will be reallocated among other staff.  The hospital is examining options around re-organisation of wards and rosters to minimise the impact on services to patients.  Contingency plans and measures are in place at service level and will continue to be refined in advance of the end of February deadline and will focus on staff redeployment, streamlining and cross-cover arrangements.  In addition, revised staff rosters and skill mix options are also being utilised.The accelerated implementation of the national clinical programmes are key strategic supports to the risk management process which is in place around these retirements.  The related work of the special delivery unit on emergency departments, surgical and outpatient waiting times and reorganisation of specialist medical services and bed utilisation will also be critical in supporting the achievement of overall resource management in the coming year.  The national service plan recognises that certain positions may need to be filled, subject to the overall pay and number targets for 2012 being met.  Agency staff may be used where there is a critical requirement.  However, any reliance on agency staff will be in the context of the HSE's objective to reduce overall agency costs by 50% in 2012.  The Minister is determined to ensure the measures being taken now will lead to a smooth transition in services for patients following the retirement of staff at the end of February.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter.

I refer to how the Minister for Health and the HSE has prepared for the retirements.  The Minister of State referred to how the HSE's regional service plans will deal with the situation, yet the HSE's national service plan was only published in mid-January, two weeks into the year.  As of last week it became clear what the retirement levels would be at the end of next month, but we have now to wait on the HSE's regional service plans to deal with that.  What advance planning has taken place?  What effort has been made to ensure cover for those critical services that cannot be replaced overnight, such as midwifery?  I got no reassurance in that regard from the response I received.It is one mirage after another with the Minister.  He said there would be no cuts to the number of beds, no increase in health insurance premia and no reduction in services as a result of retirements.  That is the mantra we get from the Minister, yet when it comes to the crunch that is not the case.  When it comes to the crunch in terms of retirements, the Minister has said we will have to cut back on elective procedures and we will probably have longer waiting lists.  The need for midwifery services does not fall into the elective category.  One cannot simply click one's fingers and get new midwives in overnight or the next week simply because a number of them have retired.I see no evidence to date, nor in the response today, that the HSE or the Minister is on top of the issue or has any grasp of how we will deal with it.  Consultants have said that if there is a plan, they have not seen it.  That is not good enough.  There has been a failure in terms of advance planning.  Today's response does not in any way address the issue.  I hope that in the coming days remedial action is taken to ensure the health of new babies and mothers is not put at risk in any way by this failure by the Minister and the HSE.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The regional service plans are completed.  Every region must make its submission to the national service plan and, therefore, most of the work has been done.  Despite the fact that the bulk of what happens in midwifery is the delivery of babies, not all of it relates to the delivery of babies.  The remit is a little wider than that.  I will not go into detail but, nevertheless, more is involved than that.It is difficult to put a plan in place when one inherits a country that has been wrecked.  The scale of what the Government has to deal with is enormous.  As Deputy McConalogue's colleague, Deputy Calleary, is aware, I do not go in for the rhetoric of blame.  We are busy enough trying to sort out the problem.  The depth of the recession that this country is in dictates that we must make hard choices in the future.  We must manage how we go forward.  I agree entirely with Deputy McConalogue that the safety of mothers and babies is paramount.  We must examine where we can plug those gaps.  That is being considered as we speak.  No one should underestimate the scale of the trouble this country is in.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America on enhancing co-operation in preventing and combating serious crime which was signed at Dublin on 21 July 2011 and a copy of which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 10 January 2012.As Deputies will be aware, our citizens currently benefit from Ireland's eligibility to participate in the visa waiver programme, VWP, of the United States.  Following the events of 11 September 2001, the United States has set standards which it requires participating states to meet if they wish to ensure continuing eligibility for the VWP.  The conclusion of an agreement on enhancing co-operation in preventing and combating serious crime, such as this one, is among the requirements set down by the United States.  Similar agreements have been, or are in the course of being, finalised between the United States and 19 other European Union member states.Deputies may wish to note that the agreement draws inspiration from, and mirrors very much, the EU Council Decision of 2008, the Prüm treaty, on stepping up cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, the aim of which is to improve police co-operation through the exchange of fingerprint and DNA data.Briefly, the agreement provides that fingerprint and DNA reference data from each country's national database should be shared in specific defined circumstances, namely, for the prevention, detection and investigation of serious crime.  The agreement therefore permits a national contact point, designated by each party, to access and search the fingerprint reference data and DNA reference data of the other party.  The purpose of the search is to establish if there is a match with data held by the requested state.  The process does not involve the exchange of data at this stage.  It merely establishes if identical data exist in the other state's database, that is to say a "hit or "no hit" search facility.Should the search procedure show a match between DNA profiles or fingerprint data, the supply of any relevant further data is governed by the national law, including the provisions of the mutual legal assistance treaty between Ireland and the United States.  Therefore, any transmission of additional data by An Garda Síochána will be governed by Irish law.  As I mentioned, the provisions of the mutual legal assistance treaty between Ireland and the United States will also apply.  The treaty provides that mutual legal assistance shall be afforded for the purpose of investigation with a view to a criminal prosecution.  Assistance will not be available, therefore, in cases where no prosecution or referral for prosecution takes place.Provision for the mutual legal assistance treaty between Ireland and the USA is already made in our domestic legislation by virtue of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  The threshold for criminal activity under Irish law for the purposes of this agreement is criminal activity which attracts a prison sentence of 12 months or more.The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill will facilitate the establishment and operation of a DNA database for criminal investigation purposes, a commitment in the programme for Government.  Work is progressing on the preparation of the legislation.  The Bill will enable Ireland to meet its obligations arising from the agreement in relation to DNA data.The Garda Síochána's criminal automated fingerprint identification system, AFIS, is currently operational.  However, it requires further development to allow it to accept remote searching of its records as required by the Prüm treaty.  This work is currently being carried out and it will also facilitate the operation of the Ireland-US agreement.International co-operation between states is an essential component in combating the ever-increasing global nature of criminal activity, in particular organised crime.  Since the events of 11 September 2001, the world has become aware that no country is safe from the threat of international terrorism.  Despite the extensive progress made in our own peace process, we must remain mindful of the threat posed here by dissident activities.We must also recognise that there are other elements in society that have a contemptuous disregard for the rule of law and are prepared to take any measure to subvert it.  I refer in particular to organised criminal gangs that have shown themselves capable of activities in furtherance of their interests not just within the confines of the State but also beyond its border.  This agreement will provide the US and Ireland with a valuable resource in seeking to combat these threats.  I commend this motion to the House.

Our participation in the visa waiver programme is another testament to the strong links between Ireland the US.  These links are economic, cultural and social and extend to every aspect of life in and part of our country.  The experience of travelling to the US now is much enhanced over the experience that obtained prior to our participation in the programme.  However, it comes with responsibilities which the Minister has outlined.  During Question Time, we discussed the complexities involved in dealing with international crime, including terrorism.  The agreement forms part of that approach.I do not doubt that our citizens have nothing to fear from our participation in this programme.  On Committee Stage, we raised issues with the Minister in respect of spent convictions and so on.  He intends to deal with them in new legislation later this year.  We support the agreement and the continuing strength of the relationship between Ireland and the US.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	444	In principle, we are not opposed to the sharing of information or enhanced co-operation in combating serious crime.  However, it is important that the rights of the individual be respected and upheld.  For this reason, proper procedures and safety mechanisms need to be put in place.  Greater clarity concerning the agreement is also required.  For instance, we need to know what exactly is being shared, with whom, who is responsible for the data once they have been shared, who the contact points are, how the deletion of information takes place, who is responsible for its deletion and how the country that supplies the information can know that the other participant to the agreement has deleted the information.  Possible amendments to the agreement have been mentioned.  We need to know whether they will be presented to the committee and the House before they are agreed.Article 7 relates to national contact points.  In Ireland, the Garda will be the contact point.  Who will be the contact point in the US?  Will it be the CIA or Homeland Security?  We do not know who it will be.  Nor do we know what safeguards are being put in place to ensure the information we share is used for no other reason than that which is proposed in the agreement.  We have no guarantee and no way of checking that the information we share will be deleted after the proposed timeframe.The list of data to be shared is long and includes surnames, aliases, the spelling of names, current and former nationalities and dates and places of birth.  We will be handing over a great deal of information to America, yet there is no indication as to who will be responsible for it and for what it will be used.  On Committee Stage, I raised the question of Article 13 with the Minister.  It refers to preventing serious threats to public security, but nothing in the agreement defines what constitutes a serious threat.  This matter needs to be explained.  The timeframes pose an issue.  The right of the individual to correct the information supplied needs to be addressed.For all of these reasons, we will not support the motion.  It goes far beyond sharing information for the purpose of combating serious crime.  We cannot support it.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	445	Despite the Minister's claim, this is a case of sharing fingerprint and DNA information collected in Ireland with the US authorities.  Under the process, when a hit is made, it triggers a system of information exchange.  The definition of serious crime as one where a sentence of 12 months or longer is given is ambiguous and would see many misdemeanours included.As Deputy O'Brien stated, given the questions over DNA and individuals' right to privacy, this situation must be strictly monitored.  I have grave concerns about information belonging to Irish citizens being exchanged with the US, particularly when we consider how some of our citizens, such as Mr. Seán Garland, have been treated.  Extradition proceedings were pursued against an elderly, ill person who denied all responsibility for the charges, yet he was persecuted.  A campaign was run to ensure he received justice.The question of whether these standards are compliant with human rights is important.  Why is the DNA being taken, what is the process used, for how long will the information be stored, can it removed and who has access to it?At the heart of this matter is the US regime.  We are discussing combating terrorism, but there is such a thing as US terrorism and this issue needs to be considered.  The standard of justice in the US is less than that enjoyed by our citizens.  The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed grave concerns about the types of sample being maintained on databases, including the DNA of people who have not been convicted of anything yet are not allowed access to that information to prove their innocence.  We only need to consider the example of Guantanamo Bay where more than 800 people have been detained during the past decade and of whom only six have been convicted.  Is this the type of society with which we want to share our citizens' DNA?  The death penalty exists in many parts of the US.  On the last day of last year, Congress passed an Act that, for the first time, enshrined in the US legal system the right to indefinite detention without charge, which is in direct violation of habeas corpus.
This agreement is an affront to the civil liberties and human rights of Irish citizens and nothing is given in return.  The idea that introducing measures such as this will somehow make the world safer is a sick joke.  Instead of descending into paranoia and introducing measures that undermine civil liberties and attack human rights, the US would be better off addressing the conditions that breed alienation and young people's disenchantment, for example, poverty and US imperialism.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves Ireland's accession to the memorandum of understanding concerning the principles for the establishment and operation of a battle group to be made available to the European Union in the second half of the year 2012.In commending the motion to the House, I would like to briefly outline the background to Ireland's participation in the Austro-German battle group.  The ambition of the EU is to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises with the key objective being the continued development of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.  The European Union has set itself the objective of being able "to respond with rapid and decisive action, applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations covered by the Treaty on the European Union".A key element is the capability to deploy forces at high readiness, broadly based on what the EU defines as the battle groups concept.  The purpose of this concept is to undertake operations known as the Petersberg Tasks, as outlined in the Amsterdam treaty and expanded upon by the Lisbon treaty.  These include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and peacemaking, crisis management by combat forces, joint disarmament operations, conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation.  These tasks are those that are already undertaken on UN mandated crisis management operations, combining the efforts of civilian and military personnel.  They recognise the need for a comprehensive response to crises to prevent conflicts and for co-ordinated action in post-conflict situations to ensure stability.  The purpose is to enable the Union to be more effective in contributing to international peace and security in support of the United Nations by putting in place a rapid response capability.A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is to support the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  Ireland has worked to uphold the primacy of the Security Council in maintaining international peace and security.  This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Participation in EU battle groups represents another means for Ireland to express its commitment to the United Nations and its principles.At its meeting of 19 July 2010, the then Government formally approved the arrangements for Ireland's participation in the Austro-German Battle Group 2012, agreeing to provide a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to participate in the battle group.  The contribution will involve a Recce-ISTAR company, together with staff posts at the operational and force headquarters.  Recce is an abbreviation of reconnaissance, while ISTAR is an acronym for intelligence, surveillance, target, acquisition and reconnaissance.The total number of personnel involved in this battle group will be approximately 175, incorporating the Recce-ISTAR core of the battle group, a command and control function, a combat service support capability and a force protection capability.  I must emphasise that this level of resource commitment will only arise should the battle group be deployed and should Ireland agree to participate.  The commitment in terms of personnel, other than with a deployment, will be one officer.The memorandum of understanding is an agreement between all the participants, namely, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, setting out principles in relation to the operation, deployment and management of the Austro-German battle group.  There are various sections within the MOU covering areas such as definitions and reference documents; the consultation process; exercise, training, certification and operation of the battle group; financing, logistics, classified information, the status of forces and the issue of claims and liabilities; additional participation by other countries; timelines for coming into effect and termination of the MOU; and dispute resolution.Most training will take place within the contributing member states' own borders.  However, some level of joint training with other elements will be required.  In this regard, Defence Forces personnel will participate in joint training exercises alongside other members of the battle group in preparation for the stand-by period.  Exercise European Endeavour 2012, the main Austro-German Battle Group 2012 exercise, will be conducted in May 2012.It is important to note that each participant retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of any EU decision.  Equally, each participant retains the sovereign right to withdraw its contingent at any time.  The command of each contingent remains under national control, with operational control delegated to the operational commander.  As a result, any deployment of the Irish contribution will still be subject to a unanimous European Council decision and then to the triple lock of a UN mandate and Government and Dáil approval.  This will remain unaffected by Ireland signing the memorandum of understanding.In 2007, following the approval of Dáil Éireann, Ireland previously acceded to a similar memorandum of understanding in relation to the Nordic battle group.  While no battle group has deployed to date, the concept has yielded many benefits to the Defence Forces by improving interoperability with other member states' forces.  It has also enabled the EU to develop its decision-making processes for rapid deployment on crisis management operations.Ireland's active engagement in this area with the EU enhances our capacity to influence the ongoing development and evolution of the rapid response capacity of the EU, in particular reinforcing and acting as a strategic reserve for UN blue hat operations.  Active engagement by Ireland across the range of activity under the Union's Common Security and Defence Policy means that Ireland can help shape this policy in a manner that is consistent with its values and its support of multilateralism and for the United Nations.In summary, Ireland's participation supports the development of rapid deployment skills and capabilities within the Defence Forces, together with improved interoperability with like-minded states.  It also enhances Ireland's credibility as a provider of professional and effective military forces for crisis management operations.  Finally, it reinforces our standing and capacity to influence the ongoing development of the Union's Common Security and Defence Policy in support of international peace and security and the United Nations.  I therefore commend the motion to the House.

While serving as Minister for Defence, both Deputy O'Dea and former Deputy Killeen invested much of their time in this initiative.  I am sure Members will join me in extending sympathies to Deputy O'Dea on the death of his mother.  The most intensive discussion during the relevant meeting of the Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was on the use of the term, "battle groups".  It is a highly unfortunate term given the role envisaged for these operations.  The danger, with the passage of time, is forgetting the reason such functions were given to the European Union.  It was because of its complete ineffectiveness at the time of the difficulties in the Balkans, which possibly was the time of the greatest shame for the European Union project.  As time goes on, people forget that shame and forget the various proclamations to the effect this could never happen again.  As the Minister has stated, this proposal is subject to the triple lock and, consequently, a decision on any engagement must come before the Cabinet and before this House again.  Given this level of protection and given the circumstances within which these operations were envisaged, Fianna Fáil has no difficulty in supporting the motion.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	448	It is only fair to begin by reiterating what Sinn Féin Members have stated previously in this House regarding the proud record of peacekeeping enjoyed by the Defence Forces.  As with all deployments of personnel overseas, the triple lock mechanism applies.  The last deployment subject to the triple lock mechanism was for a peacekeeping mission to the Lebanon and that deployment was supported by all parties in this House.  I make this point lest anyone think there are Members who are opposed to overseas deployments in all circumstances, as this clearly is not the case.  However, Sinn Féin has grave concerns regarding the possible deployment of Defence Forces personnel under the battle group arrangements.  Sinn Féin considers battle groups to be more about military powers in Europe wishing to push Europe in a certain direction militarily than about any sense of responsibility to peacekeeping.The term, "battle group" must be addressed.  The terminology is important and the Minister already has recognised this fact during the select committee discussion on the motion.  I have no doubt that some of our so-called partners in this battle group, such as Germany, for example, and others within the wider European Union seek the formation of a European army.  Angela Merkel has repeatedly stated her desire to see the establishment of a European Union-wide army.  This is the reason, when I hear terminology such as "battle groups", I suspect it may be perceived by those who favour the creation of a European Union-wide army to be a first step towards this goal.Sinn Féin's other major objection pertains to the cost associated with these battle groups.  The stand-by cost of €380,000 may not appear excessive in the context of the overall defence budget.  However, it comprises a significant amount at a time when the State is closing Army barracks, reducing personnel numbers and when the financial cost of serving in the Defence Forces is rising due to rising transport costs associated with barracks closures.  This is not to mention the additional cost of €10.7 million that would be incurred were we ever obliged to deploy personnel.  While I acknowledge Ireland would be able to recoup most of these costs from the European Union, even were it obliged to bear one fifth of the cost, that would mean finding approximately €2 million from the defence budget.  Ireland simply could not afford to deploy troops, which begs the question as to the reason we are so fixated on being part of the battle groups.  While Sinn Féin would oppose this motion for financial reasons alone, far more importantly we will oppose it because we consider it to threaten the neutrality the State has maintained proudly since its foundation.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	449	As the present Government and its predecessor have sought to justify Ireland's participation in these battle groups, they try to present the case as though Ireland is doing something that complies with the military neutrality for which this State stands and that we are merely involving ourselves in what essentially are benign humanitarian undertakings and that there is nothing to worry about.  However, as already has been mentioned, the game is given away by the term "battle groups".  The Government can try to put whatever spin it wishes on that but it speaks for itself.  Battle groups are battle groups and they are being prepared, trained and equipped for battle.  Moreover, over the years, those who have promoted the increasing militarisation of the European Union and the development of what is an embryonic European army have been clear in some of their statements as to what is the real agenda.  I believe it was Romano Prodi who spoke of the need to be able to fight the resource wars of the 21st century.  It does not get more explicit than that.  Even the Minister's former party leader referred to the new tasks these battle groups would be allowed to undertake and pointed to the fact that peacemaking and crisis management by combat forces constitutes war by another name.  If one makes peace using military force, one is making war.  All sides in a war claim their intent is peace but pursuing peace through military means is peace on one's own terms and is another name for war.  This is what these battle groups are about and this is what the major promoters of the battle groups envisage as the ultimate intention.If one considers the European Defence Agency's vision documents and various position papers over the years, which are all part of the growing military-industrial complex that is being promoted and pushed within the European Union, they also are highly explicit about what it considers to be a role for the European military forces and-----

This is what is of concern to me.In addition, the financial cost of this measure is extraordinary.  The Minister is closing down the barracks of soldiers and their families in the face of significant opposition from those soldiers and their families.  He states it is necessary to do this for financial reasons because of the troika and all the rest, but yet we can afford to spend more.  When Ireland participated in the Nordic battle group, I understand it cost €850 million and involved 100 soldiers.

Briefly, the first reason is that in accordance with the ruling of the Chair No. 138 from the third edition of 2006, an international agreement scheduled to a Bill is open to rejection by the House but because there is at least one other party to the agreement it is not subject to amendment.  The second reason is the amendment seeks to negate the object of the Bill and therefore must be ruled out of order as being in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time.

It is a regular occurrence in the Chamber that the Government deletes the entirety of a Private Members' motion and replaces it with something that completely negates the motion as tabled by the Opposition and this is allowed consistently.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The Government, in my opinion, has been extremely dishonest in how it has presented the Bill.  On Second and Committee Stages and whenever it has commented on the Bill, it has suggested it is purely a technical Bill.  It is not a technical Bill.  Its measures arise out of an intensely political response by the IMF to a crisis of legitimacy it has suffered since its disastrous policies in the Asian crisis at the end of the 1990s produced a huge reaction against the IMF by many of the Asian countries.  As it had done in many Third World countries previously, the IMF slavishly enforced neoliberal dogma as a response to the Asian crisis, propelling Asia into a very serious recession by imposing its economic shock therapy on Asian countries, specifically lifting capital controls leading to a massive flight of money out of Asia which turned a crisis into a deep recession.  The result was that many of those Asian countries boycotted the IMF, and the IMF was on the brink of falling apart.  That produced a political rather than a technical debate within the IMF on the need to rebuild its legitimacy and credibility on the international stage or face extinction.  There was a long period of debate, and gatherings took place in which the way they intended to address the deeply undemocratic nature of the IMF and its failing legitimacy was discussed.  The thrust of the criticisms of the IMF at that time was that it was dominated entirely by the United States, the big European powers and the big industrial powers in the world such that the United States, for example, with 17% of the votes within the IMF, could block any proposal even if it was supported by all the remaining states because 85% of votes is needed to get a proposal through in the IMF.  That has not changed.This Bill, and these so-called reforms, purport to be recalibrating the IMF in a reformist or more democratic direction but it leaves the US veto intact and a situation where the 27 industrialised nations still have more than 60% of the votes in the IMF and completely dominate it.  That contrasts with the poorest countries that far out-number the industrialised countries and have far bigger populations.  In many cases their resources fuel the economy of the industrialised nations but are plundered in many cases by those industrial nations with the assistance of the IMF enforcing its structural adjustment programmes and its dogma about gearing up economies for export in the global markets that have devastated those countries.  Their dominance, which is due to the undemocratic governance structures of the IMF, has meant they have been able to ram that stuff down the throats of African, Latin American and Asian countries.  There was a huge reaction against that because of the Asian crisis.  That was most dramatically seen through the 1990s and the early 2000s in the big demonstrations in Seattle and the anti-globalisation movement, which caused a major crisis of legitimacy for the IMF, and this is what they come up with - nothing.Our Government is rubber stamping what is a con job, and it is not just left wingers or activists who are saying that.  The Brookings Institution, a right wing think tank in the United States, described these so-called reforms as follows:a decades-old building that is in need of major repairs and renovation.  The plumbing is ancient and needs updating.  The roof is leaking in places.  Termites have been found in the joists in the basement.  Yet the building owners recommend, as a first step in renovation, merely a fresh coat of paint in the entrance hallway and the fixing of some broken glass panes in the windows facing the street.In other words, it is a purely cosmetic exercise with no attempt to address the substantial and deep democratic deficit within the IMF that allows it to be dominated by the United States and the major powers.It is also worth putting on record again what Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize winning economist, said about the IMF.  He stated:When the IMF arrives in a country, they are interested in only one thing.  How do we make sure the banks and financial institutions are paid? … It is the IMF that keeps the [financial] speculators in business.  They're not interested in development, or what helps a country to get out of poverty.That is what Stiglitz said and that is the reality.  Our Government is giving succour to this institution and is trying to give it the stamp of renewed legitimacy precisely at a time when its entire structures and modus operandi should be challenged in the most fundamental way.In terms of the IMF's policies and the undemocratic nature of that institution, which remains unchanged, it is now trying to apply its witchcraft in this country and in Greece, with devastating consequences.  This is a time when we should have a serious debate about the nature of the IMF.  Of course we need a global financial institution that is genuinely acting in the interests of all states and the global economy but that is not what the IMF is; it is a creature of the United States and the big industrial powers which are trying to gain advantage from the misery of others.  That is the reason it is vitally important to oppose this Bill and call for real democratic reform of the IMF and the other global financial institutions.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I outlined my concerns and those of my party regarding the reform, theoretically, of the IMF that is supposed to be happening but is not happening.  What we have before us is legislation that will not make any major changes.  It removes the fact that five of the larger countries in the IMF can appoint members to the executive board, and they will all be directly elected.  On that point Sinn Féin will not stand in the way of this legislation but we should not pretend, and the previous speaker hit the nail on the head in this respect, that this will lead to any real change or governance reform within the IMF.  The wealthiest countries in the IMF represent 15% of the membership but it has 60% of the voting rights within the IMF.  That is the issue that must be addressed if we are to have credibility for that organisation and real democratisation of the IMF.Would any party in this House support the concept, for example, of France and Germany, with 15% of the population of the European Union, having 60% of the votes?  No party in this House would tolerate such a system so why should we ask the less well off countries to accept that?  The IMF is undemocratic in its nature and is fundamentally flawed in terms of its governance.  This legislation is about window dressing but at the same time the legislation is before us.  Does it make it fairer in terms of the appointment of the executive board?  Of course it does.  It removes some of the power of the five major countries in the IMF but that is not where the game should be.  There must be proper fundamental reform in regard to the IMF and the best way of doing that is for Ireland to start batting on behalf of other countries that are being penalised as a result of the lack of democracy within the IMF.  We should make that clear.  During this debate on the Bretton Woods agreement we have not had a Government spokesperson taking a principled stand on this issue.  Traditionally, the Irish people and previous Irish Governments have stood up for less well off countries.  Unfortunately, that was a missed opportunity on the part of this Government.  I accept the legislation addresses some small issues in terms of appointment of board members and so on but this debate could have been used as an opportunity to signal Ireland's intent that there must be proper, serious structural reform in terms of democracy within the IMF instead of the type of window dressing we have here, which is marginally better but misses the picture.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  I would like to reply in the first instance to Deputy Boyd Barrett on the points he has just made.The context for this Bill is the decision by the IMF governors in 2010 to propose wide-ranging governance reforms including increased representation for emerging markets and developing countries.  The reforms are also designed to protect the position of smaller, poorer countries.The Bill provides for acceptance of the amendment to the IMF Articles on the reform of the executive board.  The amendment is designed to make the board more representative by making it an all elected body.  This will also facilitate better representation of emerging markets.  Taken together with the earlier reforms agreed in 2008, the voting shares of the emerging market and developing countries as a group will increase by well over 5%.The change in voting power is undoubtedly an important step in the right direction.  It is the outcome of lengthy discussions with the full IMF membership and is worthy of support.  The quota adjustments and the reform of the board are parts of an overall package agreed by the board of governors in December 2010.Other elements of the 2010 reforms include a review of the quota formula, which is due to be completed by January 2013, and a further review of quotas by January 2014.  The 2010 reforms also include a commitment to reduce by two the number of executive directors representing advanced European countries.  These measures will continue the process of adjusting quota shares to reflect shifts in the global economy and are likely to result in further increases in the share of emerging market and developing countries as a whole.The increase in Ireland's quota at the IMF will result in a reduction in the cost of our borrowings from the fund.  The Central Bank has estimated that the overall impact of the 2008 and 2010 quota changes, when effective, will be a reduction of the order of 100 basis points in the weighted average interest rate margin on the borrowings.  This is a very welcome development and the Bill supports this process.When the amendment has been accepted by the requisite majority of IMF members, the related quota increases will come into effect.  This will be a very welcome development for Ireland and will result in a reduction in the cost of our borrowings from the fund.  The quota increase will also assist in strengthening our representation and influence in the IMF.Some Deputies opposing the Bill questioned the legitimacy of the IMF.  I do not share these views.  The Bill will assist the ongoing process of making the IMF more representative of the world as it stands today and will help strengthen the position of emerging markets in developing countries within the institution.I thank Deputies for their co-operation in advancing the Bill.

Déanann sé déileáil le ceist atá tábhachtach do a lán daoine, agus ní hamháin iad siúd atá gafa leis na scéimeanna fostaíochta pobail.  Tá a lán den phobal atá ag brath ar na seirbhísí a chuireann na scéimanna ar fáil don phobal áitiúil.  Muna ndéanann an Rialtas athrú cuí ar an chinneadh a ghlac sé i mí na Nollag beimíd níos boichte as mar sochaí.Táim ag impí ar an Aire agus ar a cúlbhinseoirí tacú leis an rún seo.  Níl mé ag iarraidh uirthi coimre a dhéanamh ar an chinneadh a rinneadh i mí na Nollag ach athrú iomlán a dhéanamh air, infheistíocht cheart a dhéanamh ins an gcóras, an t-airgead a sciopadh ós na scéimeanna a chur ar ais iontu agus iad a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí ná mar atá siad faoi láthair.They say a society should be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members.  A Government can be judged by what it chooses to cut or support, and this Government's priorities are becoming clearer by the day.  We are focusing in this debate on the cuts to community employment schemes, but the Government has already chosen to cut funding to disadvantaged schools, to make a host of cuts to social welfare payments and to send front-line services into disarray with its ill-conceived and ill-managed early retirement scheme.Two weeks ago, when I debated this issue with the Minister, I charged that after she had decided on the cuts in the budget, the review of those cuts was announced solely for the purpose of allowing her backbenchers to give the impression that they were active in highlighting the dangers of this attack on communities.  She failed to reject that charge, which is confirmation that all this reviewing of the community employment cuts is intended simply as respite for her backbenchers and is not a genuine row-back from her mistake, and I believe it is a mistake.If further evidence were needed to demonstrate that the outcome of the ongoing review was predetermined, it came in the form of a letter issued by the Minister on 3 February.  The note enclosed with that letter stated: "It is essential that the review be completed promptly ... so that the Department has the time remaining in 2012 to achieve the level of savings agreed in the Budget."  That sounds like a review for review's sake, but with a predetermined outcome of tearing the heart out of CE schemes.  It is bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake, because the note goes on to outline that the human and financial cost of the administration of funding to CE schemes is about to multiply no end.  Under the Minister's plans, in future, rather than having per capita grants, every penny will be argued for with the Department case by case.  I suspect the Department is hoping that individual schemes will not have the time or capacity to do this and will simply close up shop.How much money is the Government cutting from the CE budget in total?  The Minister has been keen to emphasise a figure of €27.5 million, but this is a mere fraction of the actual cuts being imposed on CE schemes and their participants.  The 66% reduction in the training and materials allowance is just one of the cuts being pursued.  Add to this the abolition of concurrent payments, which after three years represent an annual cut of €128 million, and the cuts to allowances for child dependents, and the total is greater again.  What is the real figure?  Is it €27.5 million, €128 million or closer to €200 million?Many community employment schemes have developed in recent years to plug the gaping holes in public service provision left by successive Governments, about which there is no argument.  The schemes were welcomed because they provided services for local communities.  These services included child care, after-school clubs and meals on wheels, as well as providing the community facility staff required to maintain our basic community facilities.  One of the key programmes often forgotten when the discussing community employment scheme is the special community employment programme aimed at addressing the peculiar and challenging problems faced by those in recovery from addiction.  The Government is even undermining this service safety net, while at the same time failing to introduce public services to address the gap if and when community employment schemes fail because of the recent cut.Nobody denies the value of the community employment scheme to communities.  I take it as a given that all Members agree on this; I have not heard anybody say the scheme has not played an important role in their community. If that is a given, why cut it in such a drastic fashion?  Later in this debate Government Deputies will laud the programme, yet it is likely they will vote against the motion tomorrow night.The Minister appears to want to measure community employment schemes and make funding conditional on financial factors alone.  In announcing the review she promised not to close schemes that could prove they were financially viable.  A cost-benefit analysis cannot easily be conducted for some projects.  For some schemes their financial viability or otherwise should not even be an issue.  Some are intrinsically valuable and one cannot put a cost on them, for example, projects offering recreational opportunities to people with disabilities.  One such project was under major threat of closure only a few weeks ago because of the cut in its training and materials allowance.  We should fund such projects because it is the right thing to do, not close them on the basis of a short-sighted economic rationale.  Yes, they should be evaluated but not solely on a financial basis.If the Government parties are determined to deal only in economics, I ask them to consider the consequential cost of cutting community employment schemes.  If community employment and other community programmes are cut, there is the consequential cost of increased imprisonment and crime, the effect some closures will have on mental health services, the cost of a lifetime on social welfare that faces many people who previously found a safety net, a way out and social inclusion based on their participation in community employment schemes, and the cost of lengthier dole queues because people cannot afford child care.  The community child care centres will be in danger of collapse, a point to which I will return.  There is also the issue of isolation both for people living in rural areas and for people with disabilities who will suffer social isolation if they cannot participate in community employment schemes.  These schemes were successful in the past, but they could have been better organised, financed and resourced to provide greater outcomes for the community, the participants and society in general.By voting for the budget cuts targeted at community employment schemes the Labour Party and Fine Gael are undermining the fabric of Irish society in more ways than one.  They are undermining the overstretched, underfunded, yet efficient community infrastructure.  They are undermining their own activation agenda, as well as recovery and rehabilitation.  They are condemning lone parents and their children to long-term social welfare dependency.  The Government claims to be all about activation, but it is actively undermining one of the main activation planks.  The community employment scheme must be treated and fully funded as an integral part of a successful activation agenda.  It is not just about the progression of the community employment scheme participants themselves; the scheme also enables the activation of others.  The Minister says she wants people on dole queues to actively engage and avail of options to keep them close to the labour market and get back to work as soon as possible.  For many on the dole their sole meaningful advice is actually supplied by community employment scheme participants trained by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and operating out of community resource centres and so forth.Accessing training, education and work is also contingent on the availability of affordable child care and the community employment scheme is the bedrock of community child care.  Community child care services are in serious jeopardy as a consequence of the Government's cuts; by extension, the entire activation agenda is in jeopardy.  It costs more than €500 a year to bring someone to the FETAC level 5 required.  Does the Minister want children to be minded by unqualified persons?  Obviously, she does not.  However, this requires investment.Community child care services also rely heavily on lone parents who staff centres.  However, by abolishing concurrent payments and the community employment qualified child increase the Minister is making participation in the programme unaffordable for lone parents.  I have been speaking with community employment scheme supervisors and other organisations and I am aware that already they cannot fill posts in child care services as a consequence of recent cuts.  As one person put it to me in an email last week:the eligibility criteria are rigid in such a way that [CE] has become "Sheltered Employment Scheme" as the majority of the participants joining schemes do so because they are unable to access the Labour Market; this is because they may have health issues (mental & physical), education difficulties (learning difficulties or early school leavers), social issues, addiction issues, lone parents, carers etc...  The review of course is going to prove that CE does not progress participants as the vast majority of participants who want to come onto CE to progress are excluded.There should be two forms of community employment scheme - one focused on progression into the labour market and the other focused on community-based service provision.  The Government must start creating jobs, not shirking its responsibilities by saying it is its role to create an environment in which jobs can be created by others.  It must create jobs, not leave it to others.  Certainly, the environment is important, but given that there are already 440,000 on the live register, the Government must create some jobs.  Expanding the community employment scheme should be part of the job creation programme, given that, as we heard last week, there are 26 people unemployed for every vacancy in the State.I had intended to say a great deal more about other aspects of the community employment schemee, but I wish to focus on lone parents.  The Government's first budget placed the burden of recovery squarely and unfairly on the shoulders of social welfare recipients.  Within this it targeted lone parents and people with disabilities in a particularly vicious manner.  Following a public outcry and pressure, it paused some of the cuts to disability allowance.  However, lone parents have been hit very badly.  The community employment scheme was one of the few activation measures open to lone parents, but the associated social welfare cuts now make it unaffordable and are closing it off to them.  Likewise, special rules designed to make work pay for lone parents have been targeted by the Government; for example, the earnings disregard has been drastically reduced, while the transition payment has been abolished.  So much for its activation measures.  A total of 60% of lone parents are in employment of some form, but the cuts will force them back into full welfare dependency.  The Minister is reinstating old unemployment traps, and she knows it well.  She is condemning lone parents and their children to poverty and isolation.I urge the Members of the House to support this motion and reverse, not review, the cut announced in December.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The cuts to community employment, CE, schemes in the 2012 budget were dressed up by the Minister for Social Protection and her colleagues as some form of enhancement of training opportunities and employment prospects for the jobless.   Of course, they are nothing of the kind.  They are spending cuts, plain and simple.Why did the Minister announce a review of the schemes in the wake of the budget decision to cut?  It was because the Labour Party came under enormous pressure, and rightly so, from communities across the State.  Most reasonable people would have expected a review and then a decision about reorganisation and funding if such were necessary.  Instead, we had the slashing of funding in the budget and a face-saving announcement of a review once people had realised what was about to be done to these schemes.  The Minister herself admitted last week on the floor of this House that: "There is no shortage of reviews of community employment, of which there have been a great many right up to the time when community employment schemes joined my Department."  The latest review is only a temporary reprieve, as the Minister herself admitted in the Dáil last week when she said that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, "pending the completion of this review at the end of March".  That is some certainty and assurance for people in community employment.As the Sinn Féin motion states, the sequence of events since the budget has created confusion and frustration.  Deputies of all opinion, if they are in touch with their communities, know that is the case.  Initially, the focus was on the 66% cuts to the FÁS materials and training budget for CE schemes.  It is this element that the Minister had to place under review because of the absolutely justified response to such a massive cut in the budgets of CE schemes.Less attention was paid initially to the other, and very insidious, element of the cut.  At the end of January, CE schemes were informed that new participants in CE schemes will not be able to claim another social welfare payment simultaneously.  This includes one-parent family payment, deserted wife's benefit, widow's or widower's pension, illness benefit, disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind pension.  From 20 February, the CE rate of payment for those who are also on one-parent family payment, deserted wife's benefit or widow's or widower's pension will be reduced to €108 and there will be no increases for qualified children.The materials and training budget cuts are bad enough, but the related social protection payment cuts will be especially damaging.  The participants in one project, who made representations to us, put it very well when they said:The budget cuts from FÁS, if implemented, will damage our programme, but the changes notified on 26 January 2012 have the potential, over a two year period, of possibly closing the programme down.  This prediction is based on our current position, where we have 18 adult recovering drug misusers on our CE programme, 14 on disability or illness benefit, two on one-parent family payment and two others, and on the fact that our programme attracts a high proportion of people on disability or illness benefit.This is a prime example of the type of special CE programme that would be worst affected by these cuts.  In this case, the programme plays an important role in recovery and rehabilitation for former misusers of drugs.  Not only does it have a role in serving the community and providing training and employment, it also has an important public health function.  This is but one example of many others across the State.Has the Minister even considered the effect of these cuts on community child care?  This is one of the range of services affected which provide vital supports for people requiring care, such as meals on wheels for incapacitated older people and after-school projects for children.These cuts are hitting the most vulnerable in our society.  Are we to have a situation where, at the end of March, the Fine Gael-Labour Government approves the hand-over of €3.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders and, at the same time, confirms these CE cuts?  That is a prospect, most certainly.  Is that what people voted for when they voted the Government into office, most especially when they voted Fine Gael into office?I acknowledge that the only Government representatives in the Chamber for this debate are Labour Party Deputies.  I know that each of them cares about this issue.  I urge the Minister to allow the situation to maintain, to put these cuts aside entirely, despite the review, and accept the Sinn Féin motion.  It represents the views of the overwhelming number of her elected colleagues in this Chamber.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	513	The Minister may pontificate about not touching community employment schemes but she is fooling no one. The significant reductions in CE payments will jeopardise the future viability of community employment workers, their schemes and the communities in which they operate.  This has nothing to do with building or constructing a fairer or more just society.  These cuts to CE schemes will impact on the employment prospects of thousands of people who want to move from welfare to work.There can be no justification for the Government slashing funding for materials and training grants for schemes that provide a range of essential services to children, the elderly, the disabled and disadvantaged.  What was announced in December will amount to a €1,500 cut per participant to just €500 for next year, leaving many schemes struggling to survive.  As Elaine Harvey, co-ordinator of the local employment service for Galway City Partnership recently stated:This is the money that provides the heat and the light, the telephone, all of the stuff that lets the CE scheme run and provide services for our communities.  Schemes already have to raise their own money for rent of premises.  These cuts are a step too far.  They are a direct attack on communities and their supports.CE schemes play an important role in driving communities forward yet they are in danger of being ground to a halt.I also note that attempts by sponsors and supervisors to get Department officials to put into writing the names of participants that will be affected by these cuts, their dates of birth, the PPS numbers of the participants, their current rate of payment and the deduction to be made in their wages has been ignored.  Can the Minister explain why the request for this information has met with a flat refusal by the former management of FÁS?  Is this because the Minister is protecting herself from these cuts?  These cuts will cut people's salaries at the end of this month.In a cruel change of policy, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has singled out lone parents and the disabled who are making every effort to return to the workforce using community employment work and training schemes.  From January, new participants on community employment schemes will not be able to retain their lone parents or disability allowance, a loss of €210 per week.  Until now, both of these groups could keep their existing allowance and be paid for 19.5 hours work carried out as part of their CE scheme.In another crippling blow to families that are struggling, the amount single parents can earn without reducing their social welfare entitlements will be slashed from €146.50 to €130.  The Minister also confirmed that this figure would be shrunk to €60 per week by 2016.I know of one lone-parent with three children who is facing an €89 reduction in their weekly allowance.

This is money she needs to provide her and her children with a basic standard of living.  The Minister lives in her ivory tower, on her big wages and with her middle class background.  She has all the answers to how this woman will deal with the crisis she is in.  More and more families will be forced into poverty.  That is the reality of the changes the Minister has brought about.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	516	It is worth repeating the deep irony of discussing cuts in the field of community employment at a time when there are almost 500,000 people on the live register.  It is an obvious point and I have repeated it in the House, but it strikes me that this fact sails over the heads of those on the Government benches.  It also strikes me that the Government has made a decision that people such as those who avail of community employment are soft targets.  After all, that is the view that its members took of the DEIS schools and the so-called legacy posts.  It is certainly the view they take of people who parent alone, the vast majority of whom are women.It seems to me that the value of community employment has been completely missed, not just as a labour activation method and a crucial gateway back into employment for so many citizens, but also as a service provider.  Perhaps it has been deliberately missed by this Government.  What does the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs make of the cuts to CE by the Minister for Social Protection?  The child care sector in this State is heavily reliant on community employment.  Has she conferred with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and has that Minister taken a position on this matter?  What is the view of the Minister for Health?  My colleagues have already mentioned the very valuable work done by special CE schemes in the area of drug rehabilitation.  Does the Minister for Health have a view on this matter?  Did the Minister for Social Protection seek it?  Do either of them care about the collateral damage that will be done to real people in the real world if the cutbacks that she proposes go ahead?The services provided by CE schemes are many and varied.  The Minister wants to cut the scheme to Pavee Point Travellers' Centre by €15,000.  She wants to take €15,500 from Aware, which is an organisation that deals with vulnerable people who suffer from depression.  In my constituency, the Dublin Adult Learning Centre faces a loss of income of €23,000 and could lose as much as 50% of its participants.  This organisation provides a service to the most disadvantaged in our community.  It offers a very valuable level of opportunity and access to citizens who otherwise would be denied those chances.  Like so many CE schemes, it stepped in where the State failed.If the Minister is so gung-ho not only to cut, but to undermine community employment to the extent that she will force the closure of many projects, then what does she and her colleagues propose to do to replace those services?  What compensatory measures will she take, if any?  Does she imagine that she can slash and burn and introduce cutbacks such as this, which damage service provision, families and communities, and walk away and wash her hands of the consequences?  We do not want a review of these matters.  The manner in which her review is being carried out is deeply unsatisfactory.  I have yet to speak to anybody from any CE project across the State who believes that her review has engaged with the projects in any kind of meaningful way beyond crude bean counting.A review is not sufficient.  We want a reversal of these cuts.  We know the Government is hell bent on handing over billions of euros to bondholders and bankers.  That is its decision, but how deeply unethical and dishonest of the Government to do that on the one hand, and then literally to cut the ground from under disadvantaged people who wish to return to employment and who want a decent chance and a decent future for their children.  What kind of a message does that send?  Perhaps the message from the Government is that it will continue to look after the interests of the rich, but those who are struggling and those who are in need will get the deaf ear.

Along with the Minister's colleague, Senator Jimmy Harte, I attended a meeting not so long ago where the array of community employment projects in the county came together.   It was a very well run meeting organised by SIPTU.  Everybody outlined what their project does in their community, and why their services are so vital to their community.  Some of the participants then talked about what community employment meant to them.I would like to get the Minister's attention when her colleagues is finished speaking to her.

Now that I have the Minister's attention, I tell her that there were 8,000 people on the live register in Donegal, but today there are around 23,000 people on the register.  Emigration is a big issue in our county.  Thousands of our young people across the county have emigrated.  When unemployment has trebled in a county that has historically suffered from disadvantage, then how in the name of God can the Minister possibly justify cutting community employment schemes?  She should double or treble the contribution towards these projects.  These projects are on the front line and they deal with the devastation that has been caused.The reason I wanted the Minister's attention is that she was such a passionate opponent of what the last Government did.  I remember her being so prominent on the television.  I used to watch her at home on news reports as one of the leading voices against the impact of what has happened.  How can she possibly stand over cutting the funds to community employment in a county like Donegal, not to mind the other disadvantaged areas of the State?  How can she possibly stand over cutting projects that provide support to young people, the elderly, crèches, community resource centres and tidy towns committees?  This is the thread that holds our communities together.  At a time when we face such economic hardship, some of the few good news stories come from such people in those centres.  They are the "can do" people who are rolling up their sleeves and meeting the demands the Government makes of them in respect of local leadership and positivity.  The very people who are providing that leadership in local communities are seeing these cuts.I am happy to provide the Minister with the details of the meeting after my contribution.  I will send her an e-mail about it.    I ask the Minister to become again the woman, the leader she was before she assumed her position last February.  I ask her to look into her heart, to remember what she has stood for all her life.  I reiterate what I have said before that I do not presume to be a better person than the Minister nor do I consider myself to be a more decent person than her.  I do not believe that I care more about these issues than the Minister does.  However, she needs to prove me right.  She needs to put it into action.  She knows the impact of this crisis on communities which have been historically disadvantaged and which suffer from unemployment and all the resultant challenges.  I ask her not to take from those at the front line; please do not undermine the morale and spirit of those local leaders whom we need to help get this country back on top again.  That is my appeal to the Minister and I thank her for giving me her attention.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.The Minister and her colleagues stated there would be no threat to community employment schemes and that the review being conducted will somehow make up for the taking of two thirds of their funding.  It will be interesting to know how the schemes will be able to continue to operate within the constraints of a 66% cut in the overall budget.I will give the Minister some idea of the impact of the cuts.  One of the Listowel centres has provided the following information.  I have the figures from every area in Kerry and west Limerick.  The funding for materials and training has been cut from €35,420 to €11,960.  The fact that rent, insurance and telephone costs will remain the same, means that the cuts impact directly on the participants and on the services provided to an even greater extent than the 66% cut.  They will now have only €3,860 with which to run the centre for a year.  I ask the Minister or her colleagues how the centre will be able to function on this amount of money.  In effect it means the centre will be unable to provide any engagement with the community in Listowel as was possible in the past.  The knock-on effect will also impact on local businesses and service-providers as well as the local tidy towns committee, the family resource centres, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and even the flagship event which is the annual Listowel Writers' Week.The scheme in Listowel has had a significant impact on the participants.  Unemployed people who have lost personal and social confidence have rebuilt this sense of their own value along with acquiring practical skills and qualifications.  By undermining community employment schemes, the Government is in effect telling those people that they might as well not bother.  This fits with the overall depressing anti-initiative and anti-employment spirit of a Government which seems to believe that the only people who need State intervention to put money in their pockets are low wage employers.  Everyone else and society at large is apparently expected to thrive on cutbacks.While the Minister continues unabated this policy of austerity that targets the most vulnerable and weak in our communities, the unemployed, those on CE schemes, DEIS schools and small rural schools, there are other people who have a responsibility, particularly the trade union leadership.  They have a responsibility to defend people in need and to defend the most marginalised and those most discriminated against in our society and communities.  At one time the trade union movement boasted that it had the Labour Party in its back pocket but now it is the other way around; the Labour Party has the trade union leadership in its back pocket.  I appeal to the trade union leadership listening to show leadership and to fight the policies of austerity being perpetrated by this Government.

I thank Sinn Féin in particular for bringing this Private Members' motion before the House.  I truly believe that in her heart and soul the Minister knows the valuable contribution made by community employment schemes to their communities.  I truly believe that both she and the members of the Labour Party realise that the CE schemes are more than just about jobs; they also do very important work which cannot be taken up by anybody else.  They are helping voluntary community organisations who have no other funding from any other sources.  I have heard the Minister say that we will not lose the CE schemes but the truth is if the funding is cut, the schemes will be in danger.  If we lose them, what will take their place, who will do the work?  Who will work in conjunction with the family resource centres?  Who will work with the local tidy towns committees to keep public areas in order?  Who will help our elderly people?  There has been massive work and organisation put into setting up CE schemes and helping them to perform excellent work.  They deliver a great service and it is a shame if we are to allow that to be destroyed because there is no alternative and nothing can take up the slack.I plead with those who are thinking of coming in here tomorrow night and voting against this motion.  I ask them to reconsider and to vote, as I stated last week, with the people and not with the party.  The Government has a massive majority and the problem is that the majority is too big.  That is why people think they can inflict this hardship on people.

pathway back to work";— notes that the Government has commenced two reviews of community employment, both of which are to be completed by the end of March 2012, to ensure that:— adequate funding is provided (taking account of all funding and revenuesources available to sponsors); and— the schemes meet their labour market activation and progression targets whilst taking cognisance of the rationale and relevance of all scheme objectives;— acknowledges that no CE scheme has been closed as a result of the reductions in training and materials grants since the announcement of the reduction, and further notes that the Government has committed that all schemes will be supported during the period of the ongoing financial review;— recognises that there is a considerable variation across CE schemes in relation to the amount of training provided, materials required, overhead costs and the potential for sponsoring organisations to meet certain costs;— notes that schemes will no longer receive a standard grant per participant but rather, will be provided with a specific level of support aimed at meeting their specific costs;— further notes that the baseline amount of the grant remains at €500 per participant announced in the budget, but that there will be discretion to make up to €1,000 per participant available to schemes in respect of the training and materials grant this year, based on a clear demonstration of need by the CE schemes; and— welcomes:— the engagement by the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with Department of Social Protection staff to ensure that schemes are supported during the period of the reviews;— the commitment by the Minister for Social Protection to ensure that the role played by stakeholders in community employment is acknowledged in the ongoing reviews of community employment;— the assurances given to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of the financial review of each CE scheme by the end of March 2012; and— the commitment of the Minister for Social Protection to ensuring that, following the completion of the financial and activation review, community employment will support both the labour market activation and progression of individual participants, in addition to the maintenance of local community services."I thank Deputies for their contributions and for their concern about the future of community employment schemes.  I am equally as concerned.  This debate is an opportunity to discuss how we move forward in a positive fashion to give the people who are currently unemployed an opportunity to have a brighter and better future.This Government's priority is jobs.  We want to ensure that those on the live register are ready and able to return to work as soon as possible.  This is why in 2012 we are spending over €960 million on employment supports, including €315 million on CE schemes.  I think Deputies will agree that these are not small sums and they have been provided for in the budget.  While the overall spending on employment supports will increase this year from the €882 million expended in 2011, the spend on CE schemes will be reduced somewhat.  At a time when the public finances are more constrained than ever before, this employment spending represents a very significant increase on 2011.  Currently, there are 1,143 community employment schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 places, approximately 22,000 participants and 1,300 full-time equivalent supervisor posts whose wages account for an expenditure of approximately €57 million.I remind the concerned Deputies that there will be no reduction in the number of places on CE schemes and no reduction in the number of supervisors.  Some speakers may have sought to make misleading statements in that respect.  There are no reductions in the number of supervisors or in the number of places.  I know this matter is of great concern to communities all around the country.

I know the valuable contribution they can make.  However, if we are honest we must say that not every community employment scheme has the same positive outcomes for the people who participate.  As Minister, I take seriously what researchers say.  For example, the 2011 report of NESC - with which all the social partners, NGOs and voluntary bodies participate - Supports and Services for Unemployed Jobseekers: Challenges and Opportunities in a Time of Recession, was critical of community employment in terms of labour market progression.  The 2011 ESRI report, What Can Active Labour Market Policies Do? noted that "participation in community employment was not associated with increased post-programme employment chances".  If we are to have a serious discussion we must recognise that some of the people who are the greatest champions of the disadvantaged have had serious, constructive criticism to make.I received the community employment schemes into the Department of Social Protection on 1 January.  I would be derelict in my duty as Minister if I did not look at how the money is spent.  That is reality.  The study of the 2006 to 2008 period found that "previous participation in a CE scheme was associated with an increased risk of long-term unemployment, even when a range of personal characteristics and labour market experience was taken into account."  The authors stated that it is essential that investment in employment supports "achieves the best value for money".  I do not apologise for that.  It is a sensible use of taxpayers' money that we try to ensure that we get value for money, and that we allocate spending to schemes that "do most to enhance the employment prospects of those who participate in them."The earlier 2009 OECD report on activation policies in Ireland had also raised a number of serious concerns in respect of the community employment programme.  The authors noted that "CE now functions for some participants as low-paid public-sector employment."  We must all think about that, because it is honest.  Some of the contributions acknowledge that.  Community employment plays a role at local level.  I acknowledge that.  I share that concern with the Deputies opposite.  What we are trying to do is eliminate the flaws in community employment.  That is the purpose of the exercise we are carrying out.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	554	That said, the OECD stated that "even allowing for the diversity of CE, Ireland should have scaled it back further during the long period of low unemployment, when its participants could more easily find regular jobs."  I accept that relates to the past but it is pity it was not done.  The OECD concluded that "The existing Community Employment (CE) programme should not be expanded greatly, even if unemployment increases as a result of the weaker economic conditions, partly because it was not downsized enough during the years" when there was a great deal of money.  That suggests we that should examine the schemes, identify those that represent important services to the community, give good experience to participants and provide value for money.  I hope even the Deputies in Sinn Féin might share that as an objective as it is a reasonable one to have.A greater emphasis on reforming activation policies and associated measures is also a major condition of continued financial support from the troika and was included in the original agreement with it.  It is my job to see that this country exits successfully and safely from the troika programme to economic recovery, including mass regains in employment.  That is our objective.  However, the troika fails to recognise the intrinsic social value of some community employment schemes which play such an important role in communities, in particular by helping the disabled to live independently or delivering meals-on-wheels to older citizens.  That is a point that tends to get lost in the economic analysis of community employment schemes, which almost exclusively focuses on labour market progression.  There is work to be done in that regard, which is the purpose of the reviews being carried out.  I have just received the schemes into my Department, along with 700 former FÁS employees.  I ask Deputies why they would have difficulty with the review of spending of approximately €1 billion on labour market supports, including €315 million on important community employment schemes, and not seek to ensure the money is spent as well as possible in the community.

I want to develop policies that help people keep close to the labour market, taking into account advice on new employment growth areas and developing skills needs.I am pleased that many community employment schemes provide valuable qualifications to people who never had the opportunity to achieve that in their earlier lives.  Some 15,000 participants received FETAC awards in 2011.  In addition, 10,000 other awards in occupational skills and health and safety by other awarding bodies were achieved.  It must be remembered that a large number of community employment scheme participants have low formal educational qualifications and achievement and, for such people, community employment provides a second chance to catch up and gain qualifications that can help to make them more employable.  However, not all schemes are sufficiently focused on the employability of participants; the provision of the service by the scheme can sometimes take precedence over the needs of the individual.  Likewise, for some schemes there is insufficient focus on progressing the individual into employment.As Minister for Social Protection, I am determined to ensure that the positive contribution of schemes is recognised in any future decisions on the operation, funding and role of community employment.  I have asked for an initial review of the financial resources of all schemes to be completed by the end of March 2012.  This was also promised to the troika some time ago, which is the reason for the time line.  The commitment was previously entered into in other commitments given to the troika.  The review is being carried out with the full involvement of scheme sponsors.  Standard templates have been developed and issued to the Department's staff responsible for the schemes to ensure consistency in approach.  There is a considerable amount of variation across community employment schemes in terms of the amount of training provided, materials required, overhead costs and the potential for sponsoring organisations to meet certain costs in some situations.  Some sponsors have significant streams of income while others do not.  There is much variation across the range of the 1,100 schemes.  The review is being carried out in the knowledge that there are community and voluntary organisations that receive funding from a multiplicity of State agencies and it may be possible to achieve savings by examining that.  There are also sponsoring organisations where income is generated as a result of the contribution of community employment participants and there may be potential to utilise some of these funds to cover project costs.While a reduced level of grant for training and materials is unavoidable in 2012, given the budgetary position, we are making all efforts to minimise the impact of the reductions.  The financial review is identifying that certain schemes are better resourced than others and, therefore, less reliant on the training and material grant for their successful operation.  Let me be clear: we will be ceasing the current practice of giving the same level of training and materials grants to all schemes, irrespective of the length of time participants are on schemes.  Approximately 2,000 have been on schemes for five years or longer.  Their need for training is considerably less than that of new entrants.  Neither does the current approach take into account the varying requirements of schemes.  In this regard, it is anticipated that all community employment schemes will see a reduction in the level of training and materials grants compared with those payable in 2011, but the reduction will vary according to the needs of participants and project circumstances.  No scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reduction in the materials and training grants during the period of the financial review.I will state something every Deputy knows.  Every year some schemes close for a variety of reasons, for example, a scheme's changing nature, amalgamations, etc.

#PatrickODonovan	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-party	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-dob	unknown-#PatrickODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	619	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion.  I concur with much of what has been stated about the importance of community employment schemes at local level.  I draw the Minister's attention to an important aspect of the schemes, namely, the role of supervisors.  As she is aware, supervisors have been left in limbo, particularly those who have retired.  In 2008 the Labour Court recommended that supervisors receive a pension, but the matter has not progressed.  While the review is under way during the coming months and years, I encourage the Minister and her office to consider the role of supervisors.  They hold permanent positions in the public service, yet that are in limbo because the change recommended by the Labour Court has not been made.I welcome the Minister's commitment in respect of the review, but, as many Deputies have stated, to put it mildly, communication between the Department and community employment schemes has not been good.  Departmental officials should view the review as an opportunity to open the channels of communication.  While efficiencies of scale are necessary, much could be done by the Minister to encourage better communication.  For example, while all schemes are currently required to produce audited accounts, they cannot adopt a collective bargaining position whereby a number of them might seek a marked down price in return for giving an auditor their collective business.  Likewise, they are unable to engage in collective bargaining for the purpose of purchasing materials.  If their hands were not shackled in this manner, they could find a range of ways in which to secure savings.  If schemes in rural areas in particular are allowed to pool resources to purchase services and materials, the savings the Minister requires could easily be achieved.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I agree with Deputy Patrick O'Donovan's comments on the very difficult situation in which community employment supervisors find themselves in regard to pension rights and so on.  I hope the Government will consider that matter in due course.  I commend the Minister for Social Protection on her achievement in reducing the cuts that were initially proposed to be imposed in her Department by more than €300 million.  Nobody knows where those cuts might have fallen, but she certainly deserves credit for holding that line.  In addition, it is to her great credit, at a time of substantial cuts in services across the board, that the budget for employment supports has increased from €822 million to €950 million.  That is an important and welcome achievement.I am a strong supporter of the work carried out by community employment schemes.  Not only have they helped many people through training towards employment and greater self-development, they have also brought great benefits to communities throughout the State.  That can be seen in a range of areas, whether through the provision of child care, supports for drug taskforces, the provision of meals on wheels, assistance to sporting organisations and so on.  The ESRI has not sufficiently acknowledged this important social aspect of community employment schemes.  I support the review of the schemes, but it is important that there is greater clarity in terms of the training that will be available for people as they seek to better themselves and find a way back to work.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	621	As a director of several sponsor companies and an active proponent of the community employment system, I join colleagues in welcoming the opportunity to debate the Minister's review into the operation and efficacy of the schemes.  In doing so, we must be honest with ourselves, as the Minister urged.  We also must be honest with the communities we represent and the schemes which depend on the community employment framework.  Communities need community employment and community employment-type supports to enable them to function properly.  In any debate about these schemes, we must be straight with those whose future prospects and life chances depend on robust and relevant labour market activation measures.The first question we must ask ourselves is whether the community employment system has the full capacity to set the jobless free from the clutches of social welfare.  That is arguable.  Is it fit for purpose as a passport to a new job?  Are the training and education opportunities and the way in which money is spent appropriate to the needs of those who must be equipped to do themselves justice in a very competitive labour market?  We would all acknowledge that these schemes have played an important role as a community intervention.  They have built capacity in our communities and occupy a vital space from which the State generally removed itself decades ago.Whether one agrees with the findings of the ESRI report to which the Minister referred, we must take seriously the institute's position, as well as that expressed recently by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and give them the credence they deserve.  If the community employment framework is not the route to a job, as many reports have contended, and if we can spend the money in a way that better delivers real opportunities in sustainable sectors of the economy and in our communities, then we must give consideration to changing our approach to some degree.However, a straight accounting exercise on the value of community employment schemes would miss the point entirely.  Instead, we must measure the social value of community employment, in so far as that is ever entirely possible, and look at it from the perspective of what our communities would look like if these schemes were removed from the landscape.  We should move towards a situation where there is acknowledgment of the intrinsic social value of community employment schemes and a commitment to resource a community employment-type model of service provision for the communities that need it most, while at the same time devising a new, responsive system which properly caters for the needs of the labour market gaps that exist today and the economic opportunities that will arise in the future.

The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, said it is not the Government's intention to close down any community employment schemes.  That is certainly not the view of the people participating in community employment schemes across the country or of those organisations for which such schemes are a key part of the activities they carry out.  We have heard the same claims from the Government in regard to various other cuts.  We are told, for example, that there is no intention to close hospital beds and hospitals.  Yet when it comes to the crunch, the opposite is the case.We are now hearing from the Minister, Deputy Burton, that it is not her intention to close down any community employment schemes.  However, she must realise that the materials grants, which heretofore amounted to €1,500 per participant, are an essential component in the day-to-day operation of these schemes.  To make a cut of this magnitude unilaterally, without any consultation, discussion or review - to use a favoured word of the Government - is unacceptable.  The 66% reduction in the materials grant, from €1,500 to €500, is effectively putting many of these schemes in jeopardy.That is the message the Minister will get if she talks to scheme supervisors, participants and sponsoring organisations.  They have no doubt that this cut is putting the very future of their schemes in danger.  That is why so many of them throughout the State have come together, held meetings and met public representatives, both Opposition and Government Members, to get this message across.  It is also why the Minister, Deputy Burton, has launched her famous review, a review announced only after she decided to make the cut and in response to the pressure she came under-----

For her to talk about this cut as being part of a review, a component of her master plan for employment services, is unconvincing.  I agree that we must ensure back to employment services are structured so that they are as efficient as possible in equipping people to return to work.  There is nothing wrong with that objective, but it is not what the Minister is doing here.  Rather, she is attempting to justify the reduction in the materials grant by "bigging" it up into some type of review.  It is simply not acceptable.  These CE schemes are the lifeblood of many of our communities.  They assist GAA clubs, parishes, tidy towns groups, community resource centres and crèches.  Deputy Nash stated that CE schemes might not be maximising their potential to assist people in returning to work.  There is no such thing as a community employment scheme that does not contribute effectively and in an important way to its local community.  While we need to improve and enhance our back-to-employment schemes and the options available to those who find themselves unemployed, we need also to ensure continuation of CE schemes and the work they do.  Where CE schemes are not assisting in directly leading people back to work but are contributing to the benefit of local communities, as is the case in many instances, we should to be improving them rather than cutting their funding.  We need to increase the opportunities of the many talented people on the live register who are sitting at home but would like to be contributing to society.The demand for participation in CE schemes has increased dramatically during the past couple of years.  There are people at home unemployed who want to contribute, to be doing something useful, to better their chances of getting back into employment and to use their skills to benefit their local areas.  The Minister's plan will, by default if not intent, result in the closure of many CE schemes or in making it impossible for many of them to work.CE schemes are important.  As of December there were just under 22,000 people on the live register in Cross, County Donegal.  While in 2010 more than 500 young men in the area came off the live register, more than 400 women went onto it.  The dynamic at work here is emigration.  There is no room on CE schemes for talented people previously involved in construction who wish to bring their skills to bear in a way that contributes to their local area, thus providing them with a hook to keep them at home while awaiting an upturn in employment opportunities.I urge the Minister, Deputy Burton, to reverse these cuts.  CE schemes are essential to many areas, groups and local communities.  I urge her to reverse these cuts.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am delighted this issue is being discussed.  I have been trying for a number of weeks to have this matter put on the agenda such is the concern relayed to me by many people likely to be impacted by the proposed cuts to CE schemes.I remind some of the Members opposite of some of the promises made by the Labour Party and Fine Gael in their collective manifestos.  The Labour Party promised to create a new national employment service that would integrate community employment participants, but it has simply cut the resources available to these schemes in what appears to me to be a ham-fisted manner of balancing the books.  The Fine Gael election manifesto specifically stated that community employment schemes would be maintained and expanded but would be managed by local authorities, which is an interesting idea but there has been no movement on it.  CE schemes will certainly not be expanded on the basis of the type of cuts announced.  Fine Gael's manifesto also stated that CE schemes would be earmarked for an overhaul and expansion by 5,000 places.  It stated:This will offer community employment places to people currently on the live register. We will reform CE to make it more market-orientated with many more placements in private sector businesses. With this aim in mind, we will cut in the length of the standard Community Employment Scheme to six months, except for specific progression purposes, and strengthen the programme with regard to job search support.Sadly, this has not happened.  What we are now seeing is the Minister dealing in a blunt way with the problem of trimming back her budget.  It is hoped that during the course of this debate we will get answers to the specific questions raised by Members on all sides of the House.  I acknowledge that Members on the other side of the House are also concerned about CE schemes.  I do not want this to be a game of ping-pong.  We all represent our communities and know how effective CE schemes are in the communities they serve and how important they are to the people fortunate enough to participate on them.As I understand it, based on the announcement on budget day - we have yet to get sight of the Finance Bill which may contain some changes in this regard - funding for CE schemes is to be cut from €360 million to €315 million, which is a €45 million cut which will impact severely on the capacity of CE schemes to operate.  The Minister stated that she would close no scheme.  However, inherent in that is the requirement to ask the question, if the Minister is not going to close the schemes, will she replenish the money she has already cut?  How does the Minister expect schemes to operate without the €1,000 per head materials grant?  While the Minister has stated that she will not close any schemes, these proposed cuts will force them to close.I have visited many of the CE schemes in my county, urban and rural, all of which represent a mix of different people and mix of different types of work.  They have made clear to me that they will not be able to sustain a cut to the tune of €1,000.  A cut in the materials grant to the extent proposed will have a dramatic impact on their ability to carry out their work.  I went through budgets with all of them.  I am sure all Members have had budgets laid before them.  I am not a forensic accountant.  One does not need to be to work out that these schemes will not be able to function based on the cost of running their schemes last year, despite their operating prudently.  They must have the capacity to put in place activation and training measures for participants on their schemes.  If the Minister is suggesting that a valid scheme is 15 participants and a supervisor who sit around a room drinking tea all day, then schemes probably will survive.  However, that is not what CE is about.  CE is about providing a useful opportunity within the community for individuals wishing to participate on a scheme.  It is about delivering a service.There is a clear correlation between the reduction in the number of local authority outdoor workers in rural areas and the emergence of people on CE schemes.  These people do exceptional work and provide excellent value for money.  There has been a huge decrease in the number of outdoor workers employed by local authorities and an increase in CE participation.  CE schemes are doing the work once done by local authorities, and at a fraction of the cost.  They are, in addition to increasing the confidence of participants to find jobs, keeping our rural villages and towns clean, thus assisting in the promotion of tourism, maintaining graveyards and churches, protecting our heritage, assisting in child care crèches and providing assistance in day care centres.Deputy Nash suggested that because people are not progressing into employment, CE schemes may no longer be fit for purpose.  Many young people coming out of university with PhDs are not progressing to employment in the current climate.  It is wrong to suggest that if the rate of progression to employment is not what it should be, there is something wrong with the scheme.  Far from it.  CE schemes are keeping people's minds active.  They give people a sense of purpose and a reason to get up in the morning.  Despite this, it is being suggested that these schemes should be cut.I am concerned about the level of payments to supervisors.  Sadly, there is no pension scheme in place for these people.  I appeal to the Government to address this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.  These people have given much of their lives - 15 years or more - yet they are being ignored when it comes to retirement, which is dreadful.  There are only a relatively small number involved.  The Government needs to address this issue.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	630	My involvement with community employment schemes extends back as far as the AnCo days, which pre-date FÁS.  Consequently, I am familiar with the valuable work done by such schemes for and within the communities, as well as for the participants.  Part of my experience has been with highly disadvantaged and long-term unemployed people in the north inner city.  The schemes there gave the participants the opportunities to progress into the workplace and even into further training and education.  Community employment schemes supply an array of services to communities and I refer to an internal report of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on child care and after-school schemes, which stated such schemes do not help people to get a job.  I disagree because these schemes have given the parents of those children the opportunity to avail of schemes.  In addition, one must recognise that certain schemes are mainly social in nature and are for extremely marginalised and vulnerable people.  They provide such people with a focus for each day and what they do is invaluable in respect of enhancing confidence and self-esteem, as well as in providing courses on parenting skills, nutrition and health.As for drug rehabilitation programmes, I acknowledge the recent positive response from the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, about the ring-fenced places in this regard.  Participants in such schemes have a history of little formal education, very low literacy and numeracy, mental health issues and general poor health.  In addition, some have criminal records and extremely difficult family circumstances.  They have been supported through the schemes, which have done monumental work.  Some of those schemes had participants who were highly medicated when they joined the schemes but who now are drug-free, which is something on which the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is very keen.  I know many of those involved and have attended such programmes where one can see men and women, boys and girls with their lives back.  They do not cost the State what they would cost, were they still in addition or within the criminal justice system.  They have gone on to employment, further education and act as support and as mentors for those struggling with their addictions.The cuts will disproportionately affect certain people.  While reviews are welcome, the manner in which this was announced was most unfortunate.  It was followed by confused and contradictory messages and cuts were implemented while the review was going on.  Finally, the review cannot be an exercise in filling in a form about expenditure.  There is a different kind of review and a different balance sheet, which is about life and the effect on life.  These schemes have let people back into society to become productive members of, and contributors to, community life and many of them have regained their families in the process.  Moreover, they have not burdened this country in the way the faceless financial gangsters have.

At the outset, I thank and commend Sinn Féin on bringing this matter before the House for this two-day debate.  In addition, I hope the Minister and the Government will listen to the people on the ground, particularly those who are involved in community employment schemes.  I must declare a special interest as I have been a voluntary director of the Northside Centre for the Unemployed in Coolock for more than 20 years.  I am familiar with the valuable work carried out by those involved in community employment schemes.  Only today, one of my constituents contacted me about his wife, who is a participant in a community employment scheme.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is listening to this point.  My constituent stated that last week the participants in his wife's community employment scheme did not get paid on the normal day, which is Thursday.  No explanation was forthcoming and they eventually were paid on Friday.  This week, the workers received a call to inform them their pay may not reach their bank accounts until next Monday as apparently, the community employment scheme overdraft has been cancelled by the bank.  My constituent asked whether this is a new tactic being employed by the Department of Social Protection and others to save money at the expense of the people who need it most and stated it was a bloody disgrace.  I raise this issue in this debate because it is important that people engaged in community employment schemes receive support, equality and respect.In the real world, I visited Coolock last Monday where I listened to details of a highly valuable community employment scheme.  It has dealt with many people who are at risk.  Although it deals with dysfunctional people, that is, people with major problems in their personal lives in respect of finances and personal issues, at the same time, 66% of those involved came through the scheme and began to go out to work in the morning.  Many of them commented it was a new lease of life for them and for their families.  This is the positive side of community employment schemes and this also makes a positive contribution to the north side.  Tonight, I call on the Government to reverse immediately the cut of 66% to community employment schemes' training and materials budget and to reinstate immediately the training and materials budget to 2011 levels.  I also note the Department of Social Protection's review is creating confusion and frustration.  Finally, I urge all Members to support this motion to ensure that all people participating in community employment schemes are treated with respect and dignity.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations into Anglo Irish Bank by An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) are ongoing with a full Investigation team employed at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  I am further informed that 26 members of An Garda Síochána are engaged in these investigations, comprising fifteen personnel at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, including fourteen Garda investigators and a forensic accountant as well as eleven members of An Garda Síochána seconded to ODCE.The detailed deployment of Garda personnel is a matter for Garda management who inform me that they are satisfied there is sufficient personnel and technical expertise available to assist in the various aspects of ongoing investigations.  I can assure the Deputy that this Government will continue to provide the necessary legislative and administrative supports for the investigations and that I attach the highest priority to the full investigation of white collar crime and bringing the perpetrators of such crime to justice. In particular, on taking office, this Government gave priority to satisfying itself that the necessary resources both personnel and legal were available to the investigation.  Within eight weeks of taking up office, I moved urgently to draft and seek Government approval to the introduction of additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act, 2011, was enacted on 2 August.In the light of some misleading comments which have been made publicly, it is important that I make one point very clear: I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that this investigation remains an absolute priority for An Garda Síochána, there has been no question of personnel changes being allowed to hamper in any way the investigation, nor will there be.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I should say at the outset that the recent Law Reform Commission document referred to by the Deputy is a consultation paper on mandatory sentences which invites submissions from interested parties and is not a final report. The Law Reform Commission was asked by the previous Attorney General to look at the general question of mandatory sentencing.  This was done at the instigation of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The consultation paper  recently published is a  first step in that process.  Among the issues raised are:sentencing guidelines;the possibility of a court when imposing the mandatory life sentence for murder, recommending a minimum term of imprisonment;not extending the presumptive minimum mandatory sentences regime that currently applies to drugs and certain other offences pending a review to determine its effectiveness in reducing criminality.I look  forward to receiving the Commission's final recommendations in due course and those recommendations will be given full consideration.  However, I do not want to pre-empt the work of the Commission in finalising its recommendations by making any detailed comment in advance of receiving concrete proposals.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service is in the process of drafting a new Strategic Plan for 2012-2014 which will be presented to me, by the Director General, in the first week of April. The development of prisoner welfare and resettlement functions will form a central part of this Strategy, and will be considered by me in due course. In the meantime, the Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.  Several programmes and services have a specific post-release focus. These include the Gate Service operated by Business in the Community Ireland (BITC) which provides a training, education, and employment placement programme for prisoners and ex-prisoners, and operates in seven of the country's fourteen institutions.  The BITC Linkage Programme provides a similar service in the remaining institutions and operates in partnership with the Probation Service.The BITC Mentoring Service which is jointly funded by the Prison Service and Dormant Accounts Funding is in place in Castlerea, Cork and the Training Unit.  Mentoring has been shown internationally to have a positive impact on the resettlement and desistance of ex-prisoners.  Focus Ireland operates a pilot homeless service in Cloverhill Prison which supports remand prisoners in accessing appropriate services and accommodation on the pathway to independent living.  The project is supported by the Irish Prison Service, the Probation Service and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Homelessness support services are also provided in Cork and Limerick prisons.A weekly clinic service is provided in ten prisons by the HSE Community Welfare Service through the Homeless Persons Unit (HPU).   Referrals generally are at the pre-release stage and Community Welfare Officers provide information and clinic services, and arrange emergency and other accommodation options, supplementary benefits and fast tracked medical cards. The Prison Education Centres provide pre-release and post-release programmes aimed at assisting prisoner resettlement. Prisoner resettlement is also an objective of the Prison Service's integrated sentence management system and focuses on the prisoner's resettlement from the moment of committal to release. The Probation Service also works with prisoners assisting in coping with imprisonment, maintaining contact with family and dealing with areas of difficulty such as addiction. Probation Officers work with prison based teams to help offenders manage their sentence and to resettle back into the community without committing crime.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	635	As the Deputy is aware, the provision of legal aid within this State is split into two separate categories, namely civil legal aid and criminal legal aid. Under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, the courts, through the Judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid. An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself. The assignment of lawyers or the granting of aid are matters for the Court and, as such, are handled by the Judiciary.  Civil Legal Aid on the other hand is provided by the Legal Aid Board. Under the terms of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995, as passed by the Oireachtas, the Legal Aid Board is entirely independent in the operation of its functions and decisions on individual cases are a matter for the Board.I wish to inform the Deputy that in 2009 there were 16,371 applications granted for civil legal aid and 55,664 criminal legal aid certificates granted by the District Courts. The equivalent figures for 2010 are 18,623 and 55,412 respectively and for 2011, the equivalent figures are 19,706 and 54,092 respectively. There are no figures yet available for 2012. I am informed that as of 1 January 2012, there are 4,443 civil legal aid applications waiting to be processed. There are no appointments or waiting lists associated with criminal legal aid.I am very conscious of the challengers facing the Legal Aid Board as a result of rising demand and limited resources and have actively worked to mitigate the challenges they are facing. I have ensured that the Board's grant-in-aid for general civil matters, which accounts for the vast majority of its funding, has effectively been maintained for 2012 at its 2011 level.  I have also now incorporated the grant for asylum services into the grant-in-aid which should give the Board greater flexibility in using its resources.  There are a number of other measures taken or being taken by the Board which I believe can have a positive impact for persons seeking services including:The Board assuming responsibility for the Family Mediation Service;The arrangements on foot of which barristers are retained have been in place since 1998 and are currently under review;The Board is working with individual law centres with a view to trying to deliver greater efficiencies in a number of its centres;The Board will be piloting a ‘triage' service commencing next month;The Board is involved with the Courts Service and the Family Mediation Service in a pilot integrated mediation initiative in Dublin;The Board is developing a new legal case management system that is likely to improve the efficiency of service delivery and the management of risk in the organisation;The Board has utilised to a significant extent the National Internship Scheme;The Board is examining the scope of the civil legal aid services that come within the ambit of the Civil Legal Aid Scheme and how those services can be further prioritised to ensure that those most in need of its services can access them effectively.I am confident that both the Board and management of the Legal Aid Board are very focussed on deploying their resources in a manner designed to ensure the continued availability of quality front line services and I expect that some of the changes now being introduced will, over a period of time, have a significant positive impact on service delivery.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The House will appreciate that it is the Revenue Commissioners who take the lead role in investigating fuel laundering and smuggling in this jurisdiction and are supported in that role by An Garda Síochána.  An Garda Síochána remains fully committed to providing the necessary support to the Revenue Commissioners. Searches are regularly undertaken by members of An Garda Síochána, at the behest of the Revenue Commissioners as part of intelligence-led operations led by Customs. These searches have resulted in the arrest of persons involved in such activities, significant seizures of diesel and the closure of diesel-laundering plants, particularly in border counties. These operations also target individuals involved in the dumping of illegal waste products associated with the laundering of diesel. Furthermore, the Criminal Assets Bureau has and will continue to deploy all the resources at its disposal in countering such criminal activity. The Bureau has seized properties and cash belonging to those involved in such crime and continues to assist other national units in the preparation of criminal prosecution files against some of the major players involved in this trade.In addition to this, arising from a Cross Border Organised Crime Co-operation initiative established under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Northern Ireland, and my own Department, a multi-agency Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group has been in place since 2008 to specifically deal with the illicit trade in mineral oil. This group, which meets on a regular basis, is comprised of representatives from a wide range of Departments and Agencies from both jurisdictions, including An Garda Síochána. Since its establishment, this group has continued to successfully target a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels operating in both jurisdictions and will continue to introduce and implement new targeted initiatives to further tackle such criminality. I can assure the Deputy that all of the agencies involved will continue to have the full support and backing of the Government in tackling criminality in this area.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the additional costs arising for the Gardaí from the policing operation of the Shell Refinery project at Bellanaboy from 2006 to December 2011 is €14,566,262. I am enclosing a detailed breakdown of the figures as a tabular statement with this reply. The figures do not include the basic salaries as these are incurred in the normal course as part of Garda rostered hours. It is not possible to further break down the figures into the various ranks without the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought.I am further advised by the Garda authorities that they are not in a position to provide projected costs in relation to future policing operations at the Shell Refinery. Those operations arise from the need for the Gardaí to respond to protest action in the vicinity of the gas terminal in order to prevent public order offences, to enable persons to go unimpeded to and from their place of work and to enable the construction of the refinery and pipeline to be completed. The level of protest activity fluctuates and as such a projection of likely costs is not possible.It is deeply regrettable that so much Garda resources have to be tied up at the North Mayo site. However this is absolutely necessary in view of the actions of some of the protestors — many of whom are not from the area and who engage in a form of protest tourism — who have engaged in acts of public disorder as well as damage to property. Such action cannot be tolerated and the Garda presence is there to prevent it.The House will appreciate that, at a time when many people are under severe financial pressure because of our very difficult economic circumstances, it is scandalous that some protesters behave in a self indulgent way that has no regard for the rights of others.  In turn, this requires the expenditure of a substantial amount of taxpayers' money which could be devoted to far better purposes if it was not for the actions of many of those involved in the protests.  In addition, this type of behaviour runs completely contrary to the public and national interest and furthermore will act as a disincentive to inward investment and the development of our national resources.  An Garda Síochána have my full support in taking all necessary action within the law to deal with their activities.Subhead description200620072008200920102011Total€€€€€€€Overtime and Allowances923,5742,693,7062,206,3332,539,352315,400449,0849,127,449Travel and subsistence410,8571,999,970846,851737,031246,279416,4034,657,391Employers PRSI47,842127,401106,181144,71618,74829,091473,979Miscellaneous Expenses57,21984,40031,66375,11139,89919,151307,443Total1,439,4924,905,4773,191,0283,496,210620,326913,72914,566,262

The Irish Prison Service is also preparing a 40 month Capital Expenditure Plan which will form a central part of this Strategic Plan.While it is not possible at this time to be specific on the funding for use in respect of Cork prison, I can advise the Deputy that as part of this process, a plan has been drafted by the Irish Prison Service to address the issues of lack of in cell sanitation and inadequate physical infrastructure in the prison. That plan is currently being considered and an announcement will be made in due course.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	640	Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, the management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions.  To be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made.  The Courts Service has informed me that, in allocating resources, the Courts Service is prioritising the provision of its front line services, including court sittings.  The full complement of High Court registrars is 28 and there are three vacancies.  These posts have been identified as key operational posts.  Discussions are under way with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fill these vacancies.  I am informed that every effort is being made, in conjunction with the President and the judges of the High Court, to limit the impact of these vacancies on court hearings.  A contingency plan has been implemented with the agreement of the President of the High Court whereby temporary provisions have been made in respect of two of the three current vacancies.  I am informed that due to this contingency plan and the continued efforts of management and serving registrars. the impact on waiting times for trials has so far been minimised.  The service will continue to work with the President of the High Court in keeping waiting times under review and supporting court hearings.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	641	I can inform the Deputy that the Government has taken note of the Garda Inspectorate report, Responding to Child Sexual Abuse, and that the report and a document responding to the report's recommendations were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 1 February 2012.  The report and the response document were also published on my Department's website, www.justice.ie, on that date.  I am grateful to the inspectorate for its analysis and recommendations which are focused on improving the investigation of child sexual abuse and better protecting children.  The Government and I are determined to ensure an effective collaborative response to child sexual abuse is in place and the substantial progress being made in this regard is set out in the response document.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	642	All deaths of prisoners are subject to independent investigation.   Every case of a death in prison custody is the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a Coroner's Court.  The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the court.  There are procedures in place within the Irish Prison Service for the investigation of all deaths in custody.  New procedures were drawn up by the Irish Prison Service to provide for the investigation of all deaths in prison to be conducted by independent people.  In addition, a number of statutory measures are available for investigating deaths and are used as appropriate.  In particular, the office of the Inspector of Prisons has been established on a statutory basis since 2007 by virtue of Part 5 of the Prisons Act 2007 and is independent.  The inspector has an important role in ensuring there is effective independent oversight of our prison system and has my full support in carrying out his remit, which includes the investigation of deaths in appropriate cases.  He and my Department are in discussions as to how best to address the issue.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I wish to advise the Deputy that meetings have taken place with the Governors and prison doctors regarding the new procedures for the operation of safety observation cells and close supervision cells.  The Irish Prison Service is finalising the policies and procedures which will underpin the future operation of these cells.  When this is completed, further meetings will be arranged with all relevant stakeholders operating in prison settings to ensure the new arrangements are uniformly applied.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	644	As the Deputy is aware, an expert group, established under the auspices of my Department, is engaged in a comprehensive review of the Proceeds of Crime legislation with a view to identifying possible improvements that would serve to strengthen the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  A number of matters are being reviewed by the group, including decreasing the amount of time which must elapse before criminal assets which have been frozen become the property of the State; increasing the powers of receivers over properties to immediately deprive criminals of the use of those properties; short-term seizure of assets believed to be the proceeds of crime pending determination by the courts; and further improving measures supporting international co-operation.  The expert group comprises representatives of the Crime and Criminal Law Reform Divisions of my Department, the Chief Bureau Officer and Bureau Legal Officer of the Criminal Assets Bureau and a representative of the Office of the Attorney General.  I expect the group to have concluded its work early this year.  When that happens, I intend to make available, in due course, the outcome of that review and to bring forward my proposals in the normal way.  It is not possible to provide the Deputy with a particular date for when the outcome of the group's work will be made available.  The work of the expert group has not given rise to any additional costs.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda vetting certificates for employment purposes are only provided for those seeking employment in Ireland with registered organisations where the employment involves substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.  The service is provided by the Garda Central Vetting Unit.  A phased roll-out of employment vetting is being carried out to ensure the most critical sectors are covered initially while not overburdening the system that is being developed.  Unfortunately, this means that criminal history vetting for general employment purposes, here or abroad, is not available on demand.  The Garda vetting certificate is also non-transferable.  It is important to emphasise that it is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued.  Furthermore, non-transferability protects against the risk of fraud or forgery of such certificates and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system.I am further advised that Police Certificates of Character are provided for the purposes of foreign consular and immigration requirements and for foreign business establishment.  An individual may apply to the Garda Síochána for a disclosure under section 4 of the Data Protection Act 1988 (as amended) for a copy of the personal data which is maintained by An Garda Síochána.  Such a disclosure is made to the individual to whom the data relates.

The operational policing plan for a particular event is formulated by local operational management.  I am further informed that An Garda Síochána does not recover the full cost of policing such events.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I understand the Deputy is referring to the introduction of a pilot project, the Community Return scheme, in October, 2011 under which offenders who pose no threat to the community are offered earned early temporary release in return for supervised community service. I understand that the Probation Service has sufficient resources to support the scheme at present. Should additional resources be required, that will of course be considered in due course.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I can inform the Deputy that consultation has been central to the development of the White Paper on Crime and was principally structured around four discussion documents.   As part of this process my Department has consulted extensively across Government, non-Governmental and community sectors, as well as with individual members of the public.  Consultation has taken place both through seminars and written submissions in response to advertisements for submissions. Over the course of the White Paper process, some 650 people attended consultation meetings and 182 submissions were received.  Documents summarising the outcomes of each of the four consultation stages of the process are published on the Department's website www.justice.ie and include lists of those organisation and individuals who made written submissions. I can confirm that work on the development of a White Paper on Crime is at an advanced stage and is expected to be completed this year.

This is intended, inter alia, to enable ratification of the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (OP-CAT).When the General Scheme has been completed, I will be seeking Government approval for its publication to facilitate a consultation exercise in advance of drafting and publication of the Bill. At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the Bill will be published.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	650	I have previously indicated to the House my intention to keep under review the legislative framework underpinning the State's response to organised crime to see whether any further improvements could be made to render it more effective.Further to this, my Department is currently undertaking a specific review of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, to which the Deputy refers,  to see if its provisions can be strengthened.Figures available with regard to the operation of the 2009 Act up to 31st   January 2012 indicate that, although no convictions have been recorded, the legislation has been used on 160 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime activity and eight individuals have been charged under the provisions.Two persons had been charged under Section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (directing a criminal organisation) and six persons charged under Section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (participating etc in organised crime).I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána continues to vigorously tackle organised crime through undertaking a range of activities designed to disrupt and dismantle the operations of criminal organisations.The Garda Síochána Policing Plan 2012 sets out the key actions in tackling organised crime for the year ahead, which includes a focus on drug trafficking, e-crime, financial crime, and the targeting of organised gangs through  a number of measures, including the use of intelligence and analysis to inform operations against organised crime groups.With regard to forthcoming legislative proposals, I shall be bringing forward proposals for changes in the Proceeds of Crime legislation to increase the powers available to the Criminal Assets Bureau. Financial gain will always be a focus of organised criminal activity and measures that target the proceeds of such activity are key to tackling such operations.Where there is an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions tackling organised crime, I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	651	The Deputy will be aware that, having obtained Government approval for urgent drafting by the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel, I published the text of the General Scheme of the Personal Insolvency Bill on 25 January last.There is a requirement under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland to publish the Bill in Quarter 1 of 2012 — since extended to end of April. The Bill will also fulfil the relevant commitment in the Programme for Government.The Bill will provide for a new framework for settlement of debt and for personal insolvency. The proposed reform will consist of following main elements:a revised judicial process (bankruptcy) to provide for a 3 year period for automatic discharge from bankruptcy from the current 12 years.the introduction of a new non-judicial debt settlement process for unsecured debt only amounting to over €20,000 (Debt Settlement Arrangement).the introduction of a new non-judicial debt settlement process for both secured and unsecured debt amounting to over €20,000 (Personal Insolvency Arrangement) (secured debt will primarily relate to property debt, be it residential, commercial and investment).the introduction of a new debt forgiveness process (Debt Relief Certificates) for low level indebtedness where the debtor has effectively no income and no assets and has unsecured debts amounting to up to €20,000.Critical to the operation of the new debt settlement processes will be the establishment of an Insolvency Service. This will be an independent statutory agency.

The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights requires that there should be some form of an effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force and this includes the death of a prisoner even if that prisoner  died from acts of violence of another prisoner.  The Court also stated that the form of investigation may vary in different circumstances. The suite of investigations available to inquire into the killing of a prisoner can include:(i) an inquest under  Coroner's Act 1962;(ii) a Garda criminal investigation possibly leading to a criminal trial;(iii) civil proceedings;(iv) an investigation by the Inspector of Prisons pursuant to section 31 of the Prisons Act 2007;(v) a commission of investigation under the Commission of Investigation Act 2004;(vi) a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts.All prisoner deaths are automatically the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a Coroner's Court.  The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the Court. The bringing into play of the other measures can depend on the circumstances of the death.  For example a commission of investigation was established to look into the circumstances surrounding the death of Gary Douch and the Inspector of Prisons is looking into the death of Shane Rogers.We are currently reviewing the procedures for the investigation of prisoner deaths to determine if procedures can be further improved.

To put that figure into context, in 2009 the number of retirements was 722, in 2010 it was 362, and last year it was 436.As the Deputy will be aware, these reductions form part of a wider programme aimed at reducing the size of the public service, and will contribute to reducing expenditure and complying with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement.  Of course, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.The Deputy will also be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation.

One of those systems — the Debt Relief Certificate (DRC) — provides for the writing-off of debt where debtors with no assets and no income may be unable to meet qualifying debts totalling not more than €20,000. The purpose is to create an efficient non-judicial means, of allowing persons to resolve unmanageable unsecured debt problems.The intention is that the approved intermediary will assist debtors at the application stages of the process and will submit the completed applications on their behalf to the Insolvency Service for decision. While it is not stated in the Heads of the Bill, organisations such as MABS could operate as the approved intermediary if they wish. In this regard I should mention that it remains to be determined, in consultation with the Department of Social Protection, how MABS might take on such a role (as recommended by the Law Reform Commission in their Report on Personal Debt).Other organisations might also be involved in the processing of DRC applications. These would most likely be non-profit organisations as a viable business model for money advisors or personal insolvency trustees would not appear to apply in the context of a DRC.

Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role of visiting prisons, meeting with prisoners, and liaising on their behalf with prison authorities.  The arrangements for membership of the Committees will be changed and a link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.  As part of these plans, it is intended to expand the Inspector of Prison's role which I believe will greatly enhance his independent oversight of the prison system.Under these proposed new arrangements, Visiting Committees will report regularly to the Inspector of Prisons on issues they may wish to bring to his attention.  Any urgent or major issue may be reported to the Inspector at any time.  Each Visiting Committee will comprise no more than six members, and only suitable people with appropriate qualifications and a genuine interest in prison issues will be appointed.The current role of the Inspector of Prisons and the Prison Visiting Committees are set out in statute.  My proposals for change will therefore require amending legislation and I will be bringing forward Heads of a Bill for Government approval in due course.In the meantime I am presently in the process of making appointments to Visiting Committees and within the last few days have written to the people concerned informing them of their appointment.

In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.It must be stressed that the key objective of the review is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings. In this context the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the frontline if the public offices in some stations, including Malahide, no longer had to be staffed and maintained on a 24 hour basis. There are no plans to review that decision.

Its three key themes of equalising socio-economic opportunity for women, ensuring the wellbeing of women and engaging women as equal and active citizens largely correspond with the aims of the Programme for Government for National Recovery in fostering gender equality.Progress on the implementation of the Strategy is monitored by a committee chaired by my colleague, Minister of State Kathleen Lynch. An annual Progress Report is made available on my Department's website.  The Strategy also contains a commitment to periodically undertake an evaluation of the Strategy to assess its effectiveness within the operating environment and in light of changing circumstances.The first such review of the Strategy is currently ongoing in my Department. It is anticipated that this report will be finalised in Spring 2012 and may be submitted to Government prior to its publication.

Under new legislation to be prepared, I intend to make Visiting Committees more effective while they continue their role.  The arrangements for membership of the Committees will be changed and a link will be established between the Visiting Committees and the Inspector of Prisons.There are also procedures within the Irish Prison Service for the investigation of complaints by prisoners.  I am not satisfied that the existing IPS procedures are sufficiently robust and independent of the local staff to meet best practice for the investigation of serious complaints.  It is my intention to bring forward amendments to the Prison Rules 2007 which will introduce an independent element to the investigation.  I have asked the Inspector of Prisons to give consideration to this matter and to advise me as to the most appropriate approach to be taken in an Irish context so as to ensure compliance with best international practice. The Inspector's views will then be taken into account in relation to the framing of the amended Rules in this regard.The Deputy can be assured that every effort will be made to finalise this work as soon as possible.

Each Divisional Officer with responsibility for a Division that will be affected by this decision has been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Division. They will consult with the various stakeholders within their respective Divisions during this process.The priority will remain, that an effective and professional policing service is provided to every part of the community, both rural and urban.

It should be noted that the specific information regarding job losses requested by the deputy is not available as the QNHS is a measure of the level of employment only. Changes in the level of employment therefore are a function of both jobs lost and jobs created over the period in question. The most recent figures available for employment levels are for the third quarter of 2011.Estimates of the level of employment by sector up to and including the third quarter of 2011 are presented in the following table. Given the seasonal nature of changes in employment across the year the estimates presented have been seasonally adjusted. Between the first and third quarters of 2011 there has been some level of fluctuation in numbers employed across all sectors of the economy with increases being recorded in some cases and decreases being recorded in others. As mentioned in the first paragraph above, a decline in employment in a sector is not a measure of the jobs lost within that sector. As the QNHS is a sample survey the CSO urges some caution in interpreting changes of relatively low orders of magnitude.Economic sector(NACE Rev. 2)Q1 2011Q2 2011Q3 2011

This is mainly provided through the structural business surveys conducted by the CSO e.g. the Census of Industrial Production and the Annual Services Inquiries. Final results of these inquiries only become available approximately eighteen months after the end of the year to which they relate. Account must be taken of the fact that, in order to facilitate businesses, data can be provided for the nearest accounting year in these surveys. The accounting years of some firms can relate to the year ending in May, for example, and in such cases an inquiry form may not even be issued to these companies until some months after the end of the year. The main delay is in the completion and return of the survey forms by enterprises.It should be noted that Ireland meets its international deadlines for the completion of the Regional Accounts by transmitting data to the EU Commission within two years of the reference year. The fact that the Commission allows two years for the transmission of the data indicates that this is the earliest date by which most member states could provide the results. The results for Ireland are not unduly delayed therefore by comparison with other member states.The CSO could not commit itself to produce the results within 12 months of the end of the reference year as the matter is not entirely within their control. However every effort is being made by the CSO to shorten the time limit within which results of its inquiries are published.  Several initiatives have been taken in the survey areas such as the use of electronic versions of the forms etc. to improve the timeliness of response. CSO will continue with its endeavours in this regard and is mindful of users' requirements to obtain results of the Regional Accounts and County Incomes at the earliest possible date.

The Irish negotiating team — political and official — pursued a number of priorities, each of which was fully secured.    These included ensuring that the position of countries in an EU/IMF Programme is fully reflected in the text — nothing in the new Treaty alters in any way the terms of the Programme; ensuring that the Treaty remains as close as possible to existing EU Treaties and to existing and proposed EU secondary legislation; ensuring that different legal traditions and practices are accommodated in the Treaty text; and ensuring that the new deficit brake can be applied in a way that makes sense in all Member States.These objectives were advanced though active participation in negotiating sessions, including in offering suggestions on text, and through a number of written submissions on drafts as they evolved.In offering views on the ‘deficit brake' set out in Article 3.2, the Irish team, while fully subscribing to the view that commitments in this area should be binding, successfully argued for the inclusion of a degree of flexibility to give appropriate recognition to the different legal and constitutional traditions and requirements that apply in different countries. We made it clear that, unlike many other participating countries, we do not have a tier of law between statute law and the Constitution, that the Houses of the Oireachtas take decisions by means of a simple majority (subject to specific exceptions set out in the Constitution) and we do not generally include detailed provisions in the Constitution.A number of other countries joined with us in seeking this degree of flexibility, given their respective domestic legal circumstances.  To meet those concerns, it was agreed to include the word ‘preferably' ahead of ‘Constitutional' in Article 3.2.Accommodating such differences has always been a feature in the conduct of European business, and the final text is a balanced one that Ireland can accept.As the Deputy will be aware, following last week's meeting of the Government, I have written to the Attorney General formally seeking her advice on whether a referendum will be required to allow Ireland ratify the new Treaty.  The Attorney General is now studying the legal implications carefully, and will deliver her advice in due course.  Once her advice is received, the Government will consider it carefully and will take whatever decisions are necessary.  As it has made clear, if a referendum is required, one will be held.

The strong emphasis of the Programme is on supporting culturally sensitive, frontline welfare services, which are targeted at the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities, including the elderly and homeless.  These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish people living abroad, particularly in Britain and the United States, through reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local, statutory entitlements.   Thanks to Irish Government support, all the major urban areas in Britain with substantial Irish populations have dedicated, professional, Irish welfare organisations that provide support and assistance for elderly Irish people, including with end of life issues.Where an Irish citizen who is resident abroad dies my Department through our Embassies or Consulates will offer consular assistance with regard to the repatriation of the remains if it is requested. The assistance can involve contacts with local authorities/undertakers etc and liaison with family members here in Ireland. My Department does not have funds available to assist with the financial cost involved in the repatriation of remains.

Given our current economic circumstances this allocation represents a real commitment by the Government and people of Ireland to the world's poorest people.Through the overseas aid programme the Government provides assistance to over ninety countries worldwide. Nine have been designated as Programme Countries for Irish Aid, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance. These are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia.We are now in the process of allocating the overall budget for 2012, and therefore no individual country budgets have yet been identified. As has been the case in recent years however, the allocations to Irish Aid's Programme Countries will be prioritised to the extent possible.Ireland has a long-standing commitment to Lesotho, which dates from 1975.  Since 2003, we have provided almost €90m in bilateral aid to the country.  In 2011, the annual budget for Lesotho stood at approximately €10.7 million.  I expect the allocation to fall slightly in 2012 although on a per capita basis Lesotho will remain one of our largest programmes.This year we will continue to target priority areas such as the provision of health services for those infected with HIV and AIDS, measures to improve access to education, along with quality, and a programme that is helping to strengthen Government accountability to the citizens of Lesotho.  Support will also be provided for disaster management as well as a programme to improve food production at the household and community level.  An evaluation of the Country Programme will be conducted later this year which will help to inform our future strategy in Lesotho.

The Deputy will be aware that the lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a substantial shareholding are independent commercial entities. The lending institution mentioned by name, in the details supplied by the Deputy, is not one in which the State has a direct shareholding. Neither the Central Bank nor I have the power to compel financial institutions to reduce their mortgage interest rates.Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of each lending institution, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to each lending institution, including deposit pricing, is under pressure.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	673	The Central Bank revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the key framework that governs the relationship between lenders and borrowers who are in arrears, or facing arrears, on their mortgage, provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as the framework for handling such cases, the establishment of dedicated Arrears Support Units and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis. The Code also provides that a lender must not apply to the Courts to commence legal action for the repossession of a borrower's private residence until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement with the borrower and that, where a borrower co-operates with the lender, the lender must wait at least twelve months from the date the borrower is classified as a MARP case before applying to the Court to commence legal action for repossession of a borrower's primary residence.This twelve month period does not include any time where the borrower is complying with the terms of any alternative arrangement agreed with the lender, or being processed by the internal Appeals Board, or any time during which a complaint against the lender against any aspect of the Mortgage Arrears Code is being processed by the Financial Services Ombudsman's Office.  In addition, lenders are restricted from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears to which the Code applies and in respect of which the borrower is co-operating reasonable and honestly with the lender in the MARP process.  The Central Bank has published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears ‘Mortgage Arrears — A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender' and this is available on the Central Bank website.More recently, the Central Bank has also required licensed mortgage lenders to develop comprehensive strategies and implementation plans to deal with their individual mortgage arrears situations.  The Central Bank is currently reviewing these strategies and plans to ensure that they are addressing the problem and that mortgage lenders are looking at appropriate longer term solutions, such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group report and other options that banks may develop themselves, for their customers who may have unsustainable mortgages.  The Central Bank will continue to engage with lenders on the further development and implementation of these strategies and plans.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	675	For the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax (gift and inheritance tax), the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (known as the "disponer") and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (i.e., the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold (known as the "group threshold") below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. There are, in all, three separate group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.Group A: €250,000 —applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child. Group B: €33,208 —applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer. Group C: €16,604 —applies in all other cases.When calculating whether a beneficiary has received benefits in excess of her/his group tax-free threshold, any other gifts or inheritances received by that beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same group are also taken into account.A son or daughter who takes a gift or an inheritance from their parents falls into the Group A threshold above.Apart from the tax-free group thresholds available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code also exempts a gift or an inheritance of a dwelling house completely from gift or inheritance tax in certain circumstances.Where a parent transfers by way of gift a dwelling house, which is not the only or main residence of the parent, to a son or daughter, that gift will be exempt from gift tax if the son or daughter has resided in that dwelling house for a minimum of three years prior to the gift and if the son or daughter does not have an interest in any other dwelling house. In addition, the son or daughter must continue to occupy that dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of six years from the date of the gift.If, therefore, the conditions for the dwelling house exemption are met by the son or daughter, the gift of the second home will be completely exempt from gift tax and the gift will not reduce the Group A tax-free threshold available to the son or daughter of €250,000, which will still be in place in respect of any other gifts or inheritances that the son or daughter may receive from their parents in the future.

As such, it is debtors and receivers who are responsible for the preservation and maintenance of such property, including protected structures and residences which are of architectural significance.    In cases where NAMA becomes aware that debtors are neglecting their duties in this regard, the Agency advises me that it demands of them that they take appropriate remedial action. Should the debtor fail to take the appropriate action, NAMA can appoint a receiver to take control of the property concerned or under the provisions of section 141 of the NAMA Act, it can apply to the District Court for an entry and maintenance order, for which the overall costs can be charged back to the debtor.  NAMA informs me that it has not been necessary to move beyond the first option in the very few cases relating to period buildings and protected structures that have arisen to date. Should the Deputy have any concerns about such buildings or structures, however, he should inform the Agency through the dedicated e-mail address, oir@nama.ie, to which members of the Oireachtas may direct questions on matters of public interest provided the terms of Section 221 of the National Asset Management Act 2009 are respected.

As part of the move to the greater use of shared services in the public sector in order to drive efficiencies, the Paymaster General's Office, which is part of my Department, took over the payment, on an agency basis, of pensions of the retired staff of the Vocational Education Committees. Payment of these pensions was previously made through the local authorities. When those in receipt of pension paid via Fingal County Council moved to the payroll of the Paymaster General's Office in November 2011, there was no period during the transfer when they were not covered under their VHI plans.

In both cases the State Pensions are exempt from the USC.As the Deputy is aware, the USC was reviewed by my Department in the lead up to Budget 2012 and the report can be obtained at www.finance.gov.ie.

In computing the net amount of the rents received, only those deductions that are specified in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 are allowable. The legislation is quite clear in this matter.   Section 97 of that Act 1997 sets out what are the allowable deductions in computing rental income. The main deductible expenses are:Any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease.The cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant.The cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property.Interest on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property.Payment of local authority rates in the case of rateable properties used for commercial purposes.Payment of the Non-Principal Private Residence charge is not an allowable expense in computing taxable rental income as it is not included on the list of allowable items.

A "Qualifying Organisation" means a philanthropic organisation which is not funded primarily by (a) the State, (b) any board established by statute, or (c) any public or local authority.

Properties under the control of receivers or other insolvency professionals appointed by NAMA are listed on its website at http://www.nama.ie/PropertiesEnforced.php. Potential purchasers are encouraged to contact the receivers to obtain additional information on specific properties and to submit expressions of interest if they wish to make a purchase. I understand that in cases where NAMA receives inquiries from potential purchasers about specific properties under the control of debtors, it can facilitate contact with debtors or receivers with a view to enabling sales transactions to take place. Under the National Asset Management Act, 2009, NAMA has a commercial mandate. Given this commercial mandate, the Agency would not be in a position to change the prices of domestic properties for specific categories of purchasers.

However, following further contact from the taxpayer when he was making a claim for the additional PAYE Credit for 2011, it transpired that his spouse did not have a pension in her own right but was in fact receiving the Adult Dependent portion of his pension.

The focus of Government at present is on adhering to the 8.6 per cent of GDP deficit target set for 2012 as well as on reducing the deficit to below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015, as we are committed to. It is vitally important that we restore sustainability to the public finances as soon as we can, bearing in mind the need to foster economic growth.   The Intergovernmental Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union agreed last week requires us to achieve a balanced budget in structural terms, in other words after adjustment for the impact of the economic cycle on the budgetary position.  This requirement will be deemed as respected if a Member State’s structural balance is at its so-called Medium Term Objective, with a lower limit for the structural balance of -0.5 per cent of GDP (except in exceptional cases for countries with inter alia   very low debt).  The timeframe for convergence towards the MTO will be proposed by the Commission for each Member State taking into account country-specific sustainability.At this point in time, it would be speculative to put forward a possible timeline for reaching the structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP and what the corresponding actual General Government deficit might be at that point.

The relevant interest relief ceiling will of course apply so that if the overall interest repaid by the person concerned exceeds the relevant ceiling, interest relief for interest payments beyond that ceiling will not be available.

The proposed reform will consist of the following main elements:a revised judicial process (bankruptcy) to provide for a 3 year period for automatic discharge from bankruptcy, from the current 12 years.the introduction of a new debt write-off process (Debt Relief Certificates) for low level indebtedness where the debtor has effectively no income and no assets and has unsecured debts amounting up to €20,000.the introduction of a new non-judicial debt settlement process for unsecured debt only amounting to over €20,000 (Debt Settlement Arrangement).the introduction of a new non-judicial debt settlement process for secured (and if applicable also unsecured debt) for amounts of between €20,000 and €3 million (Personal Insolvency Arrangement).The draft Bill as published for consultation does not exclude debt, either unsecured or secured (including mortgage related), owed to a local authority.Part 5 of the draft Bill, which provides for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) framework, proposes that, subject to certain eligibility criteria, an insolvent debtor may make a proposal to address unsustainable secured debt, including mortgage debt, in a non-judicial manner.  The debtor can also propose to concurrently address unsecured debt, if any, in this framework.  The PIA as set out allows for a high degree of flexibility as to the type of solution that could be agreed for mortgage and other secured debt and does not exclude the possibility of shared ownership scenarios.Upon conclusion of the consultation process, the Bill will be considered further by Government in advance of the publication of a Bill before the end of April in line with the revised commitment in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support. The Bill will also fulfil the relevant commitment in the Programme for Government.

Following discussions with the airlines in that regard, the Government decided to retain the Air Travel Tax in 2011, pending a further review in the spring.

A revised Tax Credit/USC Certificate has recently issued to this person and their pension provider.  This person's pension provider will refund any USC deducted since January.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I am informed that the meeting referred to by the Deputy did take place and that it was at the request of Mr. O'Mahony. I understand that it was a listening exercise from the Department's perspective and that Government policy deliberations were not discussed. It would not be unusual for the Department to agree to such requests for a meeting.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 to 146, inclusive, together.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 134(3) of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended) and Statutory Instrument No. 353 of 1994 (Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994) (as amended) provide for permanent relief from the payment of specified maximum amounts of VAT and VRT for persons registered under the scheme.The legislation specifies that, where a person satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that s/he is a Disabled Driver who complies with all the conditions of the Disabled Drivers Scheme, that person shall be entitled to relief in respect of a vehicle with an engine capacity of up to but not greater than 2,000 c.c.The legislation also specifies that relief will be granted in respect of Value Added Tax (VAT), Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) or residual VRT borne in respect of a vehicle, or in respect of the adaptation of a vehicle, subject to the limit specified in Regulation 9 (Driver) or Regulation 11 (Passenger).  There is no restriction on the extent of the adaptations but relief is subject to the specified limits. The specified limit in respect of a disabled driver is € 9,525 and in respect of disabled passenger is €15,875.Disabled drivers purchasing second-hand vehicles may participate in this scheme provided they comply with all the conditions of the Disabled Drivers Scheme as outlined. Regarding VRT, the legislation specifies that the claimant must have borne the residual vehicle registration tax. In the case of the purchase of a second-hand vehicle, if there is no vehicle registration tax on the second-hand vehicle because it was either remitted or repaid when purchased as new, then there is no residual vehicle registration tax to be borne by anyone on a subsequent purchase and hence there is no amount available for refund.The legislation does not provide for any exceptions and the provisions of SI 353/1994 must be fully adhered to.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	700	Legislation providing for the dissolution of the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) and its amalgamation with the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) was published in July 2011 and is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas. In order to manage the transition of functions to the new amalgamated agency, FETAC has decided that no new applications for provider registration will be accepted. I hope to establish the new Authority in the first half of the year and it will begin processing new applications for provider registration shortly thereafter. However, it should be noted that the Accreditation and Co-ordination of English Language Services (ACELS) is a function of NQAI.   ACELS provides quality assurance for English language services in Ireland through the management and operation of an Inspection/Recognition Scheme for English language schools and an Accreditation Scheme for English Language teacher training providers.  ACELS is the longest standing and most widely recognised scheme of inspection and recognition in the English language sector.  An application for recognition by ACELS may be submitted at any time and details are available on the NQAI's website at www.nqai.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 155 together.The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network and a school placement is available for the child referred to by the Deputy. Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge. Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.  My Department's policy on autism strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism.  As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. In arriving at the preferred policy which is currently in place, my Department has considered published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department's website. The report of the Taskforce includes a comprehensive list of contributions.  My Department was also mindful of contributions of many others experts at international conferences/visits.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not appropriate to comment on professional  reports relating to individual cases. The National Council Special Education (NCSE) has been fully engaged in securing a placement for the child in question. The NCSE continues to be available to the parents for assistance with regard to available placements and the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) have also offered their services to assist in this regard.

Almost 3,700 of these places are provided by VECs in just over 100 Youthreach centres. The majority of the remainder of places are provided by FÁS in Community Training Centres.  I am aware that there is significant demand for further education and training programmes in general but my Department does not collect data on waiting lists, including for the Youthreach programme.  The overall number of approved Youthreach places is set at its current level because there is a continuing requirement to plan and control numbers and to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision.

He was informed that his back money will be paid in due course.  The delay in making payment is due to the fact that when the person presented himself to register with FÁS, his Department of Social Protection (DSP) documentation indicated that he was not in receipt of a DSP payment prior to commencing his training with FÁS.  Confirmation of entitlement to such a payment is a prerequisite for payment of a FÁS training allowance. On 25 January, 2012, FÁS received this confirmation from the local DSP Office. It was also confirmed that he should receive back money from the effective date of 21st October, 2011.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	704	FÁS staff members in the North East region identified issues in respect of the operation and administration of FÁS assessment procedures, the resultant certificates to be awarded and several of the underlying processes. While these issues were initially identified in the North East Region, it became apparent that there were systemic problems in this regard within the organisation.FÁS undertook a wide ranging examination of the underlying issues and a series of reports were produced, either internally by FÁS or by or with the assistance of external consultants or bodies.  Some relate solely to the North East region and others to FÁS as a whole. The details requested are set as follows:WRC Report: This report details a review of all FÁS regional centres in respect of Contractor Training. The report was part of a three phase review. Phase 1 and 2 were carried out by FÁS and involved monitoring over 300 courses and reviewing over 32,700 individual assessments in respect of 4,825 learners. Phase 3 was carried out by WRC Economic and Social Consultants to independently ratify that Phase 1 and 2 were conducted consistently and to a high standard in accordance with the agreed processes. Arising from the outcome of this report, FÁS implemented a number of new systems and procedures, including:—The introduction and implementation of a new Training Standards System;—A new and automated Contractor Training System (CTTL) with new procedures and safeguards;—A dedicated unit for Curriculum and Assessments.The report was published in October 2010 and is available on the FÁS website. The total cost of this report was €40,560, excluding VAT.Boyle Report:  In September 2010 an independent review was carried out at the request of the FÁS Assessment Standards Group, in relation to the process for handling thirteen non-conforming contracts in the North East Region. The review was undertaken by Dr Liam Boyle of the Limerick Institute of Technology.  Arising from this review, the FÁS Assessment Standards Group approved certificate requests for eight courses, recommended that the marks for four courses be reviewed and that a re-sit was required for one course. In addition Dr Boyle made seven recommendations ranging from "Shared understanding of assessment requirements across Training Standard Officers in all regions" to "The need for a feedback mechanism to gather information from second providers on assessments and assessment issues". All recommendations have been addressed in full by FÁS.  This is an internal report to FÁS and has not been published.  The total cost of this report was €3,000, excluding VAT.Investigations Report 2010: "An investigation surrounding the inputting of information in respect of applications for FETAC Certification in FÁS North East" was an independent report prepared by Michael Tyrell (former Managing Partner, Matheson Ormbsy Prentice Solicitors).  Its purpose was to establish the facts behind the inaccurate inputting of results which could have resulted in the issue of incorrect certificates to certain learners.  In establishing these facts Mr Tyrell was asked to assess whether this occurred deliberately.  The main finding of this report was "that there is no evidence of a deliberate intention on the part of any person to incorrectly seek certification for a person not so entitled".   It also reported on the sequence of events leading to this inaccurate inputting of certain results.  This was an internal report for FÁS and has not been published. As it was an investigative report, there were no recommendations.  The total cost of this report was €9,350, excluding VAT.North East Review 2011: The North East Project Report (North East Review) was a follow on from an in-depth review of issues relating to assessment results which arose in FÁS North- East. This major review was carried out by FÁS, involving External Examiners to review and mark Summary Assessment Forms. An Independent Chair was appointed to oversee the Results Approval Group. Of the 103 courses reviewed by the External Examiners, a total of 92 courses involving 1,884 learners were recommended for certification. An extensive exercise was completed on the remaining 11 training programmes and issues were resolved. Arising from the feedback from the External Examiners, FÁS has addressed issues of concern by means of the Training Standards System, its new contracted training procedures and revised contracts. This process also involved the introduction of External Authentication prior to requesting certificates and the rollout of the RCCRS (Results Capture Certification Request System).  This report was an internal report prepared by FÁS to summarise the outputs of the exercise and it has not been published.  No additional costs arose. For the sake of completeness, the cost of the services of the External Examiners who undertook the primary exercise was €61,169.  This includes costs in respect of the Independent Chair of the Results Approval Group.FETAC Report 2010: An examination of FÁS procedures regarding requesting certificates was published in full by FETAC in February 2011.  FETAC conducted the examination and produced the report from within their monitoring resources and no additional costs were incurred.  There was no cost to FÁS in relation to this report.  A follow-up report on implementation of the examination's actions, which outlines the corrective actions taken by FÁS, was published by FETAC in November 2011.  The follow-up report states that FETAC is satisfied that FÁS is implementing the corrective actions identified and enhancing their quality systems as outlined in the February report.  Both reports are available on the FETAC website.

The Report of the Group, Improving Financial Capability — a Multi-stakeholder Approach, was published in July 2009. The Group also developed a Financial Competency Framework which sets out a comprehensive set of learning outcomes detailing the knowledge skills and competences a financially competent person should have at different stages of their lives. This can be used as an important resource for those developing educational materials for young people and adults in the field of financial literacy. The learning outcomes cover Levels 1 to 4 of the National Framework of Qualifications.  Aspects of financial literacy are included in the curriculum at present in such areas as Mathematics, Home Economics, Economics, Business and Accounting, Enterprise Education and the Mathematical Applications within the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. The programmes cover computational skills, using appropriate tools to estimate and measure, to compare value for money, to calculate prices, compound interest, profit and loss, discount, VAT, PRSI, income tax, domestic bills and charges, recording and interpreting financial data, converting into other currencies and solving problems. Consumer studies, money and banking, housing finance, credit and insurance are also covered. These areas will be further strengthened to the extent possible in line with ongoing curriculum reform. In addition, Ireland has participated in the EU Dolceta programme designed to provide on-line education resources for financial literacy and consumer education. Get Smart with Your Money has been developed by the Financial Regulator as a specific resource for use within Transition Year. In addition, the National Adult Literacy Agency working in collaboration with the Educational Building Society, has developed a website www.makingcents.ie to help adults learn more about money and financial matters.

The Design Team are currently working on finalising the Stage 2(b) Submission (Detailed Design and Tender Documents) which will then be forwarded to my Department for review.  Thereafter, officials from my Department will be in contact with the Board of Management with regard to the further progression of the project.  The Department will shortly publish an outline five year programme on the projects to be constructed in that time.  The school building projects currently in architectural planning, including the project at Clifden Community School, will be considered in the context of that programme, taking into account the funding available, the building costs involved and the progression of other major projects required to meet demographic needs.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	708	Given the scale of our economic crisis, adjustments have had to be made across all areas of the public sector. Despite this challenge, the Government has sought to do this in as fair a way as possible.  We have protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, continue to prioritise targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintain the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.  My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year.  At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools.  It is worth noting that we have 3,200 primary schools across Ireland.  Over two thirds of those schools have more than 86 pupils and, as a result, have far higher average class sizes than all of the schools affected by this measure.  For example a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for sixteen pupils.  In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.  It is important to retain a sense of perspective and balance when discussing this matter and to realise the exceptionally favourable supports my Department will continue to provide for small schools.For that reason, as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 191 together.My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for the 2012/13 school year.  It will include detail of the staffing appeals process and appeal criterion for those small schools that are projecting increased enrolments that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.  All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	710	Circular 3/2012 issued on 31 January 2012 provides that, pending the outcome of a review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries; ie those who become eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1 February 2012.  No additions to the common basic pay scale may be paid to new beneficiaries.  Examples of such additions include any form of qualification allowance or the supervision and substitution payment paid to teachers, and the secretary to the Board of Management allowance paid to school principals. The position of teachers who, on 31 January 2012, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances announced in Budget 2012 which is being led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This decision was taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances.  Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services.

In view of the above I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.  I wish to inform the Deputy that in all cases where a school/parent or student is dissatisfied with any aspect of the SEC's decision in relation to an application for reasonable accommodations, they have access to an Independent Appeals Committee.  All members of the Appeals Committee are drawn from outside the SEC.  The remit of the Appeals Committee covers appeals against all elements of a decision taken by the SEC.  All appeals are considered in light of the published principles.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 to 165, inclusive, together.In July 2011, following a wide-ranging review of options regarding the provision of further education and training and the structures to support it, the Government announced the establishment of a new further education and training authority — SOLAS.  I chair the Implementation Group established by the Government, which is charged with drawing up an Action Plan to set out the change process involved.  The Group is comprised of representatives from the Department of Education and Skills, FÁS, the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA, representing Vocational Education Committees) and the Department of Social Protection.  The Group decided to initiate a stakeholder consultation process and published a consultation paper to assist in that process.  In response to a request from the IVEA, I gave additional time to VECs to make submissions, so that they would be able to consult with their committees and provide substantive input.  I intend to hold an information seminar for stakeholders shortly and all stakeholders who made submissions, including VECs, will be invited to participate.  As part of the change process, FÁS and the IVEA have established joint transformation teams which are analysing a range of issues as part of the process of establishing SOLAS and the structures to support it.  This puts VECs at the heart of developing and implementing reforms in further education and training.  Taken together with the framing of the consultation process and the participation of the IVEA in the Implementation Group, I believe this enables the VECs to contribute positively to the ongoing process.

An Outline Planning Permission has been obtained by the Office of Public Works and the Chief State Solicitor's Office are engaged in pre-contract enquiries with the Vendor's legal representatives with a view to finalising contracts for signing.  Due to commercial sensitivities, I am not in a position to comment on the matter any further.  Once the site acquisition process is concluded, the proposed school building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.  The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including the school in question, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year. The Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.   In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects and smaller projects devolved to schools to meet the demographic demands nationally as well as the demands in the area to which the Deputy refers, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  I have previously committed to publishing shortly a five year plan outlining the school building projects to be constructed in that time.

Draft criteria had been developed by an international expert commissioned by my Department following the publication of the national strategy on higher education.  In developing their advice, the Authority undertook a consultation process on the criteria which was completed last Autumn.  The Authority has now submitted their advice, which I am now considering and intend to publish in the relatively near future.  The criteria will set out a roadmap for the potential re-designation of any institutes of technology, who can meet the performance requirements set out, as technological universities.

In order to achieve the necessary reduction, the Department of Public  Expenditure and Reform is conducting a review of allowances and premium payments across the Public Service.Pending the outcome of this review, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has advised my Department that delegated sanction for the payment of allowances to new beneficiaries is withdrawn with effect from 1st February 2012.Circular letter 3/2012 applies to the awarding of allowances to all teachers, including new entrant teachers, who become eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1st February 2012.  No additions to the common basic pay scale may be paid to new beneficiaries, pending the outcome of the review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The only exception to the prohibition on the awarding of new allowances is Principal and Deputy Principal allowances.The common basic pay scale for new entrant teachers remains at the level announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement to Dáil Éireann on 7th December 2010.

Tenders have been published for the development of a post graduate course to enable  teachers of Mathematics who may not have a qualification in the subject to upskill to the recognised levels.  The Teaching Council has also published a consultation document setting out proposed revised degree entry requirements for post-primary post graduate initial teacher education programmes relating to the teaching of 35 curricular subjects, including Mathematics.Project Maths began in all second level schools in September 2010, building on the experiences of 24 Project Schools which started the programme in 2008. This is being supported by a national programme of professional development for teachers which began in 2009, and will continue to at least 2013. A Project Maths Implementation Support Group, as an industry/education partnership, reported in 2010 on how stakeholders from business, second level and higher education can work together to achieve the objectives of Project Maths. The recommendations of this report are being progressed.Research has also been commissioned on the impact of Project Maths on student's attitudes and attainment.  In the meantime, the results of the examinations in the 24 Project Maths schools have been published in the Leaving Certificate in 2010 and 2011, and the Junior Certificate in 2011.  These show an improvement in the proportions scoring Grade ABC, and fewer students scoring at Grade EFNG.My Department has produced The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020, "Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life" which is designed to promote a significant improvement in mathematical skills across primary and second level schools. The Strategy sets out a range of integrated actions in regard to helping parents to support their children's learning, professional development of teachers, expansion of the duration of initial teacher education, and improving school leadership, assessment and school management and review.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	734	I fully acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools will be challenging for schools.  However, the change must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. In the budget announcement for education I made clear that the net impact of the measures relating to second level schools for the school year commencing next September would, after taking account of demographics, amount to about 450 posts.Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in second-level schools over the level originally planned. This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students. A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools. My Department is currently notifying schools of the new staffing arrangements for 2012/13 school year.

The terms of reference of the Forum are to advise me on:how it can best be ensured that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none;the practicalities of how transfer/divesting of patronage should operate for individual primary schools in communities where it is appropriate and necessary; andhow such transfer/divesting can be advanced to ensure that demands for diversity of patronage (including from an Irish language perspective) can be identified and met on a widespread basis nationally.An Advisory Group appointed to convene the Forum has held a number of meetings in public, during June and November 2011. The Group sought and received submissions from the education stakeholder groups and from the public as part of its work. The Group is currently finalising its report and I expect to receive it shortly. Progress regarding divesting patronage of schools in any area, including the areas of North Dublin referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of the recommendations of this report.

Given the importance of meeting this challenging numbers target, the moratorium on recruitment will remain in place. Any exceptions to the moratorium will continue to be directed towards areas of most need.In order to mitigate the impact on frontline service provision as far as possible, with the co-operation and flexibility of individual public servants, we will fully use the mechanisms set out in Public Service Reform Plan, including the filling of essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment. Public Service Organisations must fully use all options for discharging work through reorganisation and redeployment of staff. Only after this will the issue of recruitment for current or emerging business needs arise.Should a Department identify a potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment the sanction of my Department must then be sought. Exceptions to the Moratorium may be granted on the following basis:a) statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;b) where failure to fill posts would result in a breach of EU/international regulations and impact upon exports, etc.;c) safety related posts — failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;d) specialist/technical posts to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers, laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;e) to ensure continuity of frontline services.In addition, in the case of the Education and Health Sector, special arrangements apply that allow for limited recruitment in essential frontline services.Each Sector in the Public Service has been establishing its own Strategic Workforce Planning Group to ensure that sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from staffing reductions. The sectoral groups are feeding into a central Strategic Workforce Planning Forum under my Department. Factors such as emerging demographic gaps in management grades will also be considered; measures such as the recently advertised graduate recruitment competition at Administrative Officer level will address such gaps.

Apart from instances where statutory rates of pay apply, pay rates in the private sector are generally a matter for negotiation between individual employers and employees.  My responsibilities in relation to pay extend to the public service where the Government has a direct role in the determination of pay rates as employer.Pay rates in the public service have already been reduced by up to 15% and a progressive pension related reduction applied through the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009.  In relation to the remuneration of senior positions in the public service and the Commercial State Companies, the Government accepted my proposals to introduce a general pay ceiling of €200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of €250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies and a voluntary waiver system of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceiling. I have no plans to undertake further reviews of public service pay based on policy proposals in other jurisdictions at this time.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	745	I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 202 together.Following the informal European Council meeting on 30th January, EU Commission President Barroso has launched a special initiative to boost growth and tackle the problem of youth unemployment.The Commission will work with the eight Member States with the highest youth unemployment rates to develop a plan which could use unallocated structural funds to strengthen national programmes. The Commission will be promoting a plan in each Member State with measures to deal with youth employment and strengthen support schemes for SMEs.  President Barroso envisages that the funding would come from existing unallocated EU funds and from any available national funding, from either public or private sources.Ireland has been allocated a total of €901m in EU Structural Funding for the period 2007-13. Of this,  €750 million is assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) objective, and the balance to Territorial Co-operation programmes, including the PEACE III (Ireland/NI), INTERREG IVA (Ireland/NI and Western Scotland) and the Ireland Wales Programme.  The RCE objective is being delivered through three operational programmes, the National ESF Human Capital Investment OP, managed by the Department of Education and Skills, and the Border Midland and Western (BMW) and Southern and Eastern Regional ERDF (S&E) OPs, managed by the BMW and S&E Regional Assemblies.   The general programme priorities in Ireland are the promotion and encouragement of innovation, the knowledge economy, enterprise, research and development, up-skilling the workforce and increasing the participation of groups outside the workforce.It is expected that the overall objectives of each programme will be achieved and that Ireland will drawdown the funding we have been allocated. At present, Ireland has no unallocated Structural Funds. Recent Commission figures show that Ireland has the highest Cohesion absorption rate in the EU at 48% for the current 2007-2013 Structural and Cohesion funding round and it is estimated that the remaining 52% allocated to Ireland will be drawn down.I strongly welcome President Barroso's initiative. I and other members of the Government will be working closely with the EU Commission.As there are no unused Structural and Cohesion funds available for Ireland at present, we will, in the first instance, be looking at whether employment programmes might be re-focused to better effect. If, at a later stage, additional EU funding becomes available, Ireland will make the necessary application.Dealing with unemployment is the major priority for the Government and this is an initiative which must be utilized to maximum effect.

It is the employer's duty to ensure that worker's health and safety is managed in workplaces.Employers have a duty under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to ensure that the potential hazards to their employees are identified and controlled so as to either eliminate or minimise the risks associated with the identified hazards.In all workplaces, an employer is required to have a health and safety management system, including a site-specific safety statement and risk assessment that identifies the controls that are in place to control the identified risks and protect those at work.Employees at a place of work should be advised of and familiar with what the identified risks and controls are.The Health and Safety Authority is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing occupational safety and health law and, where breaches of such law are identified, the Authority takes appropriate action which can include criminal prosecution.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	764	In May 2005 the Director of Corporate Enforcement sought additional staff for his Office. In 2007 it was agreed to provide 8 additional staff to the Office. The Department of Justice and Equality also agreed to provide an additional Garda to the Office at that time. At the initiation of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement's investigation into events at Anglo Irish Bank five additional civilian staff were provided to the Office as well as two Gardaí staff from the Department of Justice and Equality. There are currently no outstanding staffing requests from the Director.No request has been made by NERA for additional staff.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21513	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	765	The Government will shortly publish a policy statement on labour market activation, "Pathways to Work", which will set out its strategies to tackle unemployment and help job seekers to get back to work.In addition, I am currently finalising the 2012 Action Plan for Jobs on behalf of the Government, for publication in the coming weeks.  The Plan will contain a significant number of tangible measures to protect existing jobs and to support the creation of new jobs across the economy.  It will set out a range of initiatives to promote enterprise growth, improve competitiveness and develop key sectors of the economy where Ireland can gain a competitive advantage, including in areas such as manufacturing, cloud computing, agri-food and digital gaming.The 2012 Action Plan will mark a new process by the Government of outlining its plans to support job creation on an annual basis, with the aim having 100,000 more people in work by 2016 and two million people at work by 2020.  If we can achieve this level of ambition, it will have a significant impact on tackling unemployment amongst young people.

An eligible employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum ceiling on gross weekly pay of €600.  Where an employer is unable or fails to pay the statutory redundancy entitlement to a former employee, a payment can be paid directly to the employee from the Social Insurance Fund.The right of the employee to a redundancy payment must first be established either by a completed Redundancy Certificate (RP50) or, in the absence of that, a decision of the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) following an appeal from the employee.The time limit for making a claim for a lump sum redundancy payment is 52 weeks after the date of termination of employment.  Accordingly, there are 52 weeks in which:a redundancy payment can be agreed upon and paid orfor an employee to give a written claim for a redundancy payment to his/her former employer orfor the employee to lodge an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to adjudicate on the right of the employee to a redundancy payment.While it should be noted that the period of 52 weeks for submitting a claim is the normal period that applies, the Employment Appeals Tribunal has discretion to extend the 52 week time-limit to 104 weeks provided that it receives the necessary claim within 104 weeks of the date of dismissal and is satisfied that the delay by the employee in making his/her claim arose due to reasonable cause.

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 5 January 2012 and the appeal will, in due course, be assigned to an Appeals Officer for consideration.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I would like to say at the outset of this reply that it gives me no satisfaction to have to make any cuts in social welfare payments. However, given the scale of the fiscal crisis the Government inherited and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, savings have to be found in the social welfare system.In the welfare package presented in Budget 2012, I sought to minimise the impact of the necessary adjustments in my Department's welfare expenditure on groups vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion. The Government has endeavoured insofar as it could to limit cuts in social welfare to households where there is some additional income over and above the basic social welfare payment and in that regard, successfully avoided any general reduction in primary weekly welfare payments.In addition to the Budgetary imperative, there is an important  long-term policy context  for the proposed changes to  State pension, including the proposed change to pension rate bands being introduced for new customers from September 2012, which is that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  The period for which a pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.   This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision and for the sustainability of pension provision into the future.Reform of the State pension system is therefore necessary and the proposed changes to the rate bands, outlined in Budget 2012, are part of the reform process under way in my Department.  In this context, there are a number of changes planned to State contributory pensions.  The changes are as follows:The minimum paid contributions requirement for State pension (transition) (SPT) and State pension (contributory) (SPC) will increase to 520 in April 2012 as provided for in legislation since 1997.State pension age is being increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66 and SPT will no longer be payable to those who reach age 65 in 2014 or later.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.As announced in Budget 2012, a change to the rates bands for contributory pensions is being introduced from September 2012.  This supports the policy objective of aligning the proportion of pension paid with the person's contribution to the PRSI system over a working life.  This policy needs to be adhered to if we are to be able to fund pensions into the future.  Currently a person with an average of 20-47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life receives a weekly State pension of only €4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions, a situation which is neither fair, equitable nor sustainable.With effect from September 2012, the rate band of between 20 and 47 yearly average contributions will be replaced with  new rate bands of between:(i) 40 and 47 yearly average contributions,(ii)  30 and 39 yearly average contribution, and(iii)   20 and 29 yearly average contributions.Therefore, the rate of State pension paid to new applicants will be appropriate to the average number of contributions paid.  Those who have fewer contributions will receive a lower rate of pension.  The maximum rate is unchanged as is the rate for those with yearly average contributions of between 40 and 47.   While existing pension recipients are unaffected the changes proposed will apply to new claimants from September 2012.For those claimants who qualify for a reduced rate of State pension (contributory) and have income needs, they may qualify, depending on their means, for a higher rate of State pension (non-contributory).Details of the new rates bands for both State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory) are set out in the tables below.Finally, the current proposed date for the introduction of the ‘total contributions approach' to State pension is 2020 and there are no plans at present to bring this forward to 2012.Yearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Week€48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0024-29196.00Yearly Average ContributionsPersonal Rate Per Week€48 or over230.3040-47225.8030-39207.0020-29196.0015-19150.0010-1492.00

Their role is to decide any appeal where a person is dissatisfied with the decision given by a deciding officer in relation to entitlement to benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  They act in a quasi-judicial manner and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant gets full and fair consideration.An oral hearing is required where the case cannot fairly be decided by way of summary decision.  This may be because there are conflicts in the evidence presented by the parties or there is insufficient documentary evidence to enable an appeals officer to decide the case.   Whether an oral hearing is required is at the discretion of the appeals officer.  In 2011, some 35% of decisions by Appeals Officer were made following an oral hearing.

The amount due will issue this week. He has no entitlement from 26 July 2011, as his wife has been awarded a State pension (transition) from that date.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals.Overall, the average processing time for all appeals in 2011 was 25.1 weeks in cases dealt with by way of summary decisions and 52.5 weeks where an oral hearing was required.These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 9 additional Appeals Officers during 2011 who augmented the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010.   In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brings the total number of Appeals Officers to 39.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.

This exercise covered the 930 DCA applications processed during the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011 with a stated medical condition within the autism spectrum.  Of these, 55% (507 claims) were deemed to satisfy the qualifying criteria, with 45%, (413 claims) deemed ineligible.Approximately 46% of all claimants were awarded the allowance on initial application in the same period.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	782	I propose to take Questions Nos. 247 to 252, inclusive, together.The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The scheme is intended as a temporary income support payment and is not designed to be a medium to long term housing support or a permanent solution to a person's housing needs. In order to qualify for a payment under the rent supplement scheme a person must satisfy all of the conditions of the scheme including that the accommodation is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the person. Expenditure for 2010 and 2011 was €516 million and €503 million respectively. Provision of some €437 million has been made for the 2012 scheme.Budget 2012 has provided for two main changes to rent supplement from 1 January 2012. First, an increase in the weekly minimum contribution payable by all tenants under the rent supplement scheme from €24 per week to €30 per week with a higher rate minimum contribution of €35 per week for coupled households. Secondly, the introduction of new maximum rent limits.As the Deputy will be aware the community welfare service (CWS), and the community welfare officers providing it, transferred formally to the Department of Social Protection (DSP) from 1 October 2011.  The service and the staff are now part of the DSP. As with all statutory schemes, the Minister has no function in relation to the determination of individual entitlements.In general there is no limit or restriction on the proportion or number of people that may receive rent supplement in an area. However Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides that a payment of rent supplement can be refused in respect of accommodation which is situated in an area notified to the Minister for Social Protection by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, as being an area of regeneration.Rent supplement payments can, at the request of the tenant and with the agreement of the Department, be paid directly to the landlord.  If the Department were to introduce a system whereby all rent supplement payments were to be made directly to landlords the efficiency of the scheme would be significantly affected. For example, the Department would potentially have to create a formal relationship with some 96,000 additional clients, the landlords. This would involve greater complexity and significant resources to deal with a new set of third parties.It would not be an effective use of resources to have departmental staff negotiating rental agreements for those with a short term need who generally enter the scheme with an existing tenancy agreement in place and leave again when they re-enter the workforce.The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long term reliance on rent supplement. The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) is in operation since 2004 and the new Housing Policy Initiative as announced by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Planning on 16 June 2011.Both initiatives give the local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement. Latest figures show that over 37,700 rent supplement tenancies have now been transferred from rent supplement to RAS and other social housing options since its inception.

Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support by the relevant local housing authority, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	786	Limerick Community Services Ltd provide a very valuable service in Limerick.Budget 2012, has resulted in the following changes being made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme: a reduction in the training and materials grants from €1,500 to €500 per participant per annum; the ending of the concurrent entitlement to a CE payment and a social welfare assistance payment for new CE entrants; and the ending of the dual payment of Qualified Child Dependent Increases to CE participants in receipt of certain DSP payments.In relation to the reduction in the training and materials grant the Department is seeking to minimise the effects of these changes on those schemes most affected and will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb the changes made to the grant.I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual schemes be completed by the end of March.  The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme.  As part of the review alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State Agencies.  The review will also seek to establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.  The outcome of each review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist the Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.Assurances have been given to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of this review at the end of March.  Officials from the Department are engaged in discussions with Limerick Community Services to complete this review.

One of the conditions for receipt of the household benefits package is that an applicant who is under age 70, must be living alone or only with excepted people.  These excepted people include: a qualified adult; a dependent child or children aged between 18 and 22 years of age, if in full-time education; a person who would qualify for the allowances in his or her own right; or a person providing full time care and attention.The rules relating to the household composition do not apply where the person who is getting the household benefits is 70 years of age or over.The household benefits package is made up of three allowances, electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence.  These allowances provide contributions towards electricity or natural gas or bottled gas refill bill and telephone bill and cover the cost of the television licence each year. Provision for 2011 on household benefits was €382 million.  As of end of December 2011 there were over 400,000 customers on household benefits package.One of the objectives of the household benefits package is to provide assistance to older people who are living alone or with certain excepted people by targeting them with specific benefits that provide both income and social inclusion gains.  Given the current economic situation, I am not in a position to consider extending the scheme to provide for temporary changes to household composition.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	789	As announced in the Budget, from 16 January 2012, new participants on community employment (CE) schemes will not be able to simultaneously claim their original social welfare payment and a CE allowance, as per section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 2011. This measure affects those in receipt of the following payments commencing CE after that date: One-Parent Family Payment; Deserted Wife’s Benefit; Widow(er)’s Pension; Illness Benefit; Disability Allowance; Invalidity Pension or Blind Pension.These new CE participants will receive payments directly via the CE scheme at a rate equivalent to their original social welfare payment (including any increase for a qualified adult and/or child dependants) plus an additional €20 CE participation bonus.New participants are defined as those persons who, with effect from 16 January 2012, have not been employed on a CE scheme in the 12 months prior to commencing the current CE placement.  CE participants on maternity leave or sick leave at 16 January will not be considered new entrants when they return as they will have participated on CE within the 12 month period.  Persons who were approved by DSP staff for CE positions before 16 January 2012 but, due to operational reasons, only commence working on or after 16 January 2012, will be treated as existing CE participants for the purpose of retaining their social welfare payments.Existing CE participants who have their contracts renewed after the 16 January 2012 will retain their social welfare payment provided they are continuously employed on CE from that date.  This provision is subject to the standard CE participation limits and a final cut-off date for double payments of December 2014.  All CE participants will receive a single payment only from that date. In addition, payment of two qualified increases per child where the person is employed on a CE scheme and in receipt of either One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Benefit/Allowance or Widow(er)'s Pension will cease for new and existing recipients with effect from Monday, 20 February 2012.  Existing CE participants will continue to receive increases for qualified children from their original social welfare payment only.  New CE participants will receive the qualified child increase (where applicable) on their CE payment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 at end 2011, a 61% increase.Budget 2012 provided for an increase in the minimum contribution for a single person on rent supplement from €24 to €30 per week and a new rate of minimum contribution for couples of €35 per week.  These measures are applicable to all rent supplement tenants, including those in receipt of disability allowance.Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  These rent limits are set at levels that enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the State.  Household size is taken into account and the objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation having regard to the size of the household.  The Department may exceed these levels in certain circumstances, e.g. where the applicant may have special housing needs such as those incurred by a disability.As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for low paid workers and students.New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.The new maximum rent limits will not change the after accommodation costs income of persons receiving rent supplement.  Rather the impact of the change in the rent limits will be on the rents received and expected by landlords.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	794	Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These ENP payments are a vital component of the SWA scheme and link the income support function of the scheme with the wider welfare role of the Department's Community Welfare Service.There is no automatic entitlement to a payment, or no predetermined amounts under the different categories for exceptional needs payments.  ENP's are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.A review of the guidelines on Exceptional Needs Payments has recently been carried out by the Department by a working group made up of former Community Welfare Service staff. One of the recommendations emanating from this review is to address the different approaches taken, in different areas, in relation to the payment of exceptional needs payments in respect of religious ceremonies, mainly Communions and Confirmations, and to ensure that the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme is responding to financial need and not occasions.In future, where the Department is satisfied that an exceptional need exists, it is recommended that a maximum payment of €110 can be made in respect of the religious ceremony (mainly Communions and Confirmations).Persons who consider that they have an entitlement to an ENP under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme should contact the local officials administering the scheme (former Community Welfare Officers).
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The average time taken to award a claim for carer's allowance for quarter to end Sept 2011 was 17 weeks.  The average time to award for the last quarter of 2011 is unavailable as, due to the phased introduction of a new claims processing system in the carer's allowance area, new claims are being processed on the new system while older claims are still being processed on the old system.As mentioned above, a major service delivery modernisation project is under way to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer. Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department.  This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.Some 7,719 applications are awaiting a decision at present, down from 8,540 at the beginning of September 2011.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.   In addition to dealing with the approximately 330 new carer's allowance applications that are received each week, overtime working is being applied to help reduce backlogs that have built up chiefly as a result of the effort associated with the service delivery modernisation project.While the new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times, it should be noted that the intake of new carer's allowance applications continues to increase and that individual claims may continue to take some time to process. Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. In determining entitlement to the allowance, in certain cases unavoidable time lags are involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if those applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.In the meantime, if a person's means are insufficient to meet his or her needs while awaiting a decision on a claim, he or she can apply for a means tested supplementary welfare allowance payment from their local community welfare officer.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	798	The query referred to by the Deputy asks whether the Minister has any plans to reform the number of hours worked eligibility criteria for the family income supplement (FIS) payment.The FIS payment provides income support for employees on low earnings with children.  The payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.The "hours worked" eligibility criteria has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984. The requirement was initially set at 30 hours per week but was progressively reduced to 19 hours per week in 1996.I have no immediate plans to make any significant changes to the qualifying criteria for FIS. Further reducing the "hours worked" requirement could have expenditure implications and could only be decided on in a budgetary context.  More generally, however, I recognise that   creating jobs and tackling poverty are two of the key challenges that we face. It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these issues and ensure that work is worthwhile. To this end, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare in June of last year with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience in order to address a number of specific issues. These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes.

Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home. Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.The household of the person concerned has been visited by an official from the Department and a report of their individual circumstances has been completed.

There is absolutely no question of an agenda, covert or otherwise, to cut ten per cent or any other percentage of welfare payments that are being made to genuine claimants. In fact, protecting the vulnerable by securing the long-term financial viability of the social protection system is one of the main benefits the Government is seeking from the restoration of equilibrium to the Government's finances.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	812	There were a number of measures regarding One Parent Family Payment announced in Budget 2012. The following is a brief description of each of those measures:1. Up to 2010, One-Parent Family Payment could be claimed in cases where the youngest child was up to 18 years of age (22 years of age if in full-time education).  The maximum age was reduced to 14 in 2010.  As a result of Budget 2012, the maximum age will be reduced from 14 to 7 progressively over the period 2012 to 2014 inclusive — to age 12 in 2012, age 10 in 2013 and age 7 in 2014.2. It was also announced in Budget 2012 that the amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the One Parent Family Payment means test will be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012 for new and existing recipients. Further reductions will be introduced over the following four years.3. From January 2012, payment of a six month transitional payment of half of the rate of One Parent Family Payment where the recipient's earnings exceed €425 per week will be discontinued.  Existing recipients of the temporary payment were not affected.4. Finally, Budget 2012 also provided that participants on Community Employment (CE) schemes would no longer be simultaneously entitled to both One Parent Family Payment and a CE payment. That measure affects new entrants to CE from January 2012.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	813	The claim for disability allowance, by the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an assessment by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was medically unsuitable for the allowance.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an appeal has been opened and in accordance with statutory requirements the Department was asked for the documentation in the case and the Deciding Officer's comments on the grounds of the appeal.  In that context, a medical examination by another Medical Assessor has been arranged for 09th February 2012.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	814	The Department of Social Protection, through the wide range of schemes and interventions it provides, impacts on the lives of almost every person in the State at some stage. A number of these measures already support those under 25 years of age.In this regard the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.A BTEA applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and be at least 21 years of age (24 years postgraduate courses) prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of jobseekers payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years.Changes made to rate of payment of jobseekers allowance to young people since 2009 were undertaken in order to incentivise under 25 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and try to avoid them becoming welfare-dependent from a young age.  The full adult rate of the relevant payment will be paid to under 25 year olds who participate in full time approved education or training programmes.  This measure provides this group with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.In addition JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, assists individuals to bridge the gap between unemployment and the world of work.  It provides those seeking employment with an opportunity to undertake a 6 or 9 month internship in a host organisation.  Participation on the scheme assists in breaking that cycle whereby unemployed people are unable to get a job without experience.  On completing their internship, participants will have improved their prospects of securing employment. The scheme is scheduled to run for two years with a maximum of 5,000 places at any time.  Interns receive an allowance of €50 per week on top of their social welfare entitlement payable for the period of the internship.It is intended that both the BTEA and the internship programme will be reviewed to assess their effectiveness and the outcome of those reviews will be used to determine whether policy changes are required to meet labour market activation objectives.

The application has been forwarded to one of the Department's Medical Assessors for review of the original medical opinion. Upon receipt of the review report, a decision will issue to the customer.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	816	The primary purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 2011, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  Compensation is based on the worker's length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of €600 per week.It is the responsibility of the employers to pay statutory redundancy to all their eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to the employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State.  Rebates to employers and lump sums paid directly to employees are paid from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).Significant and increasing amounts have been paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF in recent years. While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers' contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government's decision to revise the rebate rate was the increasing costs of rebates in recent years.The deficit in the Social Insurance Fund is a matter of concern.  Prior to the implementation of the revised rebate, the Social Insurance Fund refunded employers 60 per cent of the cost of making people redundant.  €152.2 million was paid out in rebates to employers in 2006; €167.4 million was paid in 2007; €161.8 million was paid in 2008; €247.9 million in 2009; €373.2 million in 2010 and €188.2 million in 2011.  The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.As part of the deliberations on Budget 2012 it was decided that the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable in the current economic climate.  While I acknowledge that this may cause difficulties for employers it should be noted that redundancy rebate payments to employers are not common in many EU and other jurisdictions.

The development of the commemorative programme is therefore orientated towards the entire Decade of Centenaries 2012 to 2022 with official consideration currently being focussed on the period 2012 to 2016.The Government envisage a framework that will feature, not only the official commemorative programme, but also the initiatives of local authorities, national cultural and sporting organisations, heritage groups and community organisations. A special effort will be made to ensure that all events are organised on an inclusive basis with respectful regard for the different traditions in Ireland. As we explore our shared heritage, we will also be mindful of the interest and affinity of the Irish abroad in the commemorative programme.With a view to the enhanced engagement required of all partners, I have made arrangements to strengthen the Oireachtas Consultation Group on commemorations. In future discussions with the group, I will be accompanied by Minister of State, Dinny McGinley and other representatives of government parties. I have also invited Senator Martin McAleese to join the group. The next meeting of this group will be on 8 February 2012.All Government Departments, State Agencies and services of government are now being consulted in relation to their intended contribution to the official commemorative programme.  There has been considerable progress recently on several elements of the commemorative programme and specific announcements can be expected shortly.  I would like to emphasise my personal welcome for all suggestions and contributions to the development of the commemorative programme. If the Deputy has particular interests or concerns, I would be grateful to hear from him.

It has been agreed that this year's National Famine Commemoration will take place on Sunday, 13th May in Drogheda, County Louth.  Full details of the work of the National Famine Commemoration Committee since 2008 in implementing a varied and diverse annual programme of events to coincide with the National Famine Commemoration are available on the National Famine Commemoration page of my Department's website at http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/NationalFamine Commemoration2012/.In relation to the reference to plans to develop a permanent exhibition dedicated to the Great Famine in the National Museum of Ireland, the Deputy should be aware that this is an operational matter for the Museum itself. However, the Deputy should note that the National Famine Commemoration Committee, of which the Director of the National Museum is a member, has previously considered the possibilities around exhibiting a collection dedicated to the Irish famine in the Museum. It has been given to understand that much of the evidence relating to the Great Famine is statistical and pictorial, and there are very limited artefacts that could be exhibited at the National Museum.  In this regard, I am advised that there is insufficient material to support an exhibition of the type referred to by the Deputy.

Processing of applications on hand under this scheme has been slower than anticipated, due to capacity constraints in undertaking the work involved.In 2011, the Government announced a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme consists of a payment of €1,000 per year, index linked, over 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of cut turf while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The cost of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.Where applicants under the Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme have not received a letter of offer, or have received a letter of offer but contracts have not been signed, my Department will be writing to them to outline their options under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme.

In February of last year my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to Tamboran Resources Ltd over parts of Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo, the Lough Allen Natural Gas Company Ltd over parts of Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo and to Enegi Oil Plc over parts of County Clare.  The licensing options are for a two-year period from 1st March 2011. Exploration drilling, including drilling that involves hydraulic fracking is not permitted under these licensing options.Before the companies concerned could apply for an exploration licence and proceed to an exploration drilling phase, they must first complete the licensing option work programme agreed with my Department.  These work programmes are primarily based on desktop studies of existing data and should be completed by February 2013.  When they have completed their work programmes each company will then have to decide if it wishes to move to the next stage and apply for an exploration licence.Any application for an exploration licence that proposed using hydraulic fracturing would be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  That assessment would include a Public Consultation Phase, of four weeks or more, which would be advertised on my Department's website and in the local press.  This would provide an opportunity for the public to input into the decision making process.  My Department would also seek and be guided by the expert advice of other relevant statutory authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Local Authorities. The outcome of the EIA would help determine whether or not an Exploration Licence would be granted.

It provides that the regulation of upstream safety will be achieved through the establishment and implementation of a new risk assessment based Petroleum Safety Framework in line with best industry practice.I understand that as part of its initial planning and scoping for the establishment of the new Safety Framework, the reports referenced by the Deputy were produced.  These reports, i.e. Report on the Existing Legislative and Regulatory Framework for Petroleum Exploration and Extraction in Ireland; and Review and Comparison of International Petroleum Safety Regulatory Regimes were undertaken by consultants GL Noble Denton on behalf of the CER.While the specifics on how unconventional gas exploration and extraction were not explicitly addressed in the above documents, neither were the specifics with regard to any other petroleum activity to be regulated by the CER.  It was never the intention, I understand, to cover the detail on how specific petroleum exploration and extraction activities are regulated in Ireland or the comparator countries in these reports.  The reports simply set out the broad legislative and regulatory approach to the regulation of petroleum activities, thereby providing the background information to enable the CER to begin its work on the consulting on the Petroleum Safety Framework itself.The CER published its consultation paper on the High Level Design of the Petroleum Safety Framework in August 2011, and hopes I understand, to publish its draft decision in this regard shortly.As exploration drilling and extraction are likely to be designated by CER as petroleum activities, unconventional gas exploration and extraction would fall to be regulated under the Petroleum Safety Framework by the CER from a safety perspective.

The PSO levy is calculated and certified by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  REFIT payments under the first REFIT scheme to those included by the CER in their 2011/2012 PSO levy decision are currently being paid on a monthly basis, and there is no delay.Five months ahead of the start of the PSO year (which commences 1 October), electricity suppliers are obliged to advise CER of those generators with whom they have entered into REFIT Power Purchase Agreements that will be exporting electricity to the grid during the following period and on behalf of whose exported metered generation the suppliers are eligible to receive REFIT payments from the PSO levy fund.  Those projects are then included in the PSO decision by CER and only those projects included in the decision are eligible for payments.The calendar year 2012 as is the norm with the PSO mechanism straddles two PSO years.  The 2011/2012 PSO year runs to 30 September 2012 and the 2012/2013 PSO year will commence on 1 October 2012.  Those projects that were included in the 2011/2012 levy fund calculation by CER are currently being paid and will continue to receive payments up to 30 September.  Those eligible for payment in the 2012/2013 PSO year which commences 1 October will be determined on the basis of information provided by suppliers to CER 5 months ahead of the commencement of the next PSO levy year.My Department is currently also working to finalise the terms and conditions for the new REFIT Scheme recently cleared by the EU Commission, with a view to its launch shortly.

As part of the balance between these constraints and assessed demand, it is necessary to manage the lakes within the resources available and in that context it is not currently in a position to open the lakes referred to by the Deputy any earlier than proposed.IFI advise that Lough Fadda and Barfinnihy Lake are community managed trout lakes. They are run effectively as put and take fisheries (i.e. IFI stock the lakes prior to opening for fishing on a pay per use basis). In this regard they are no different from any other ‘put and take' fishery in the country. They are managed on a commercial basis in that IFI endeavours to at least cover the cost for the stocking and management of these lakes from the permits fees derived from anglers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	828	The liability of a landowner in relation to a person engaging in a recreational activity on their land, if an accident were to occur, is governed by the provisions of the Occupiers Liability Act, 1995. This Act provides definitions of recreational activity and outlines the duty of care of a landowner or occupier to entrants onto their land, including recreational users.The Occupiers Liability Act, 1995 was introduced to address the question of the exposure of landowners to claims arising from injuries to recreational users and others including trespassers. The Act defines categories of entrants onto land and specifies the duty of care owed by occupiers. An occupier is anyone in charge of a premises such as the owner or a tenant. Under the Act there are three categories of entrant: visitors, recreational users and trespassers. The duty of care owed by the occupier of land to recreational users and trespassers under section 4 of the Act is a duty not to cause injury intentionally and not to "act with reckless disregard" for their safety.  A higher duty of care is owed to visitors.  A landowner charging recreational users for entry (as opposed to a reasonable charge for parking) increases his/her duty of care to that owed to visitors.

This latter provision is, however, subject to the following qualifications—that the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the Regional Planning Guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,that the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section, and/orthat the planning authority is satisfied where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or an appropriate assessment, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.This means that in cases where substantial works have not been carried out, and where the relevant development plan objectives or the objectives in the relevant regional planning guidelines have changed since the permission was granted to the extent that the development in question would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, the duration of the permission will not be extended.It should be noted that the previous provision remains in the Planning and Development Act 2000, whereby an extension of permission is automatically given on application, in a case where substantial works have been carried out within the original duration (subject only to the condition that an application complying with the relevant Regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period).I consider that the amendment made in 2010 strikes an appropriate balance and that in cases where substantial works have not been carried out, the duration of permission should not be extended in respect of developments for which the planning authority would now refuse permission in respect of current applications.  I have no plans to further amend the Act in this regard.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	831	I propose to take Questions Nos. 305, 312, 322 and 349 together.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge. The Act provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.  The exemptions from payment of the household charge are—Residential properties that are part of the trading stock of a business and have not been sold or been the source of any income since construction,Residential property owned by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive,Voluntary and co-operative housing,Residential property subject to commercial rates and wholly used as a dwelling,Residential property owned by certain charities or discretionary trusts, andResidential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).The waivers which apply concern—Owners of residential property entitled to mortgage interest supplement, andOwners of houses in certain unfinished housing estates.There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge.  An online system www.householdcharge.ie is in place in the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) to enable homeowners to pay the household charge by credit/debit card or in four instalments by direct debit.   In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit/debit card or in four instalments of €25 by direct debit by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments are available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way must register their details by 1 March, 2012.A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.  In addition, all county/city councils have been requested to have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge up to 31 March, 2012.  I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive suite of payment options available to persons with a liability to pay the household charge.

The Memorandum of Understanding with the EU, the IMF and the ECB also contains commitments for the reform of water services delivery and operation and the introduction of domestic water charges.To meet these commitments, the Government intends initiating a universal water metering programme in advance of the introduction of domestic water charges. This will facilitate moving to a charging system for domestic water users that is based on use above a free allowance as provided for in the Programme for Government.  A procurement strategy for the metering programme is currently being prepared and this will include detailed specifications for meters and related equipment. The metering programme will be the subject of a competitive procurement process in accordance with EU and national procurement rules.

As announced in the Government's Housing Policy Statement published on 16 June 2011, all affordable housing schemes, including shared ownership, have been stood down in the context of a full review of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. A request for tenders in respect of the review was published last week, and the review will commence as soon as possible.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	834	As part of the implementation of the recommendations in the Keane Report my Department is developing a mortgage to rent scheme on a pilot basis. This work has been assisted by Clúid Housing Association, a number of local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, AIB, and more recently, New Beginning and another lender.  The Keane reported recommended 2 such schemes or models on which a mortgage to rent option might operate.   The same categories of household would be targeted under each scheme. These are households that:have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (as provided for under the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears);agree to the voluntary repossession of their home;do not have significant positive equity; andare eligible for social housing.In addition, the house must also be appropriate to household need. In other words, the household are not significantly over-accommodated (e.g. a couple residing in a home that is too large for their needs) or under-accommodated/overcrowded. Households availing of the scheme will become social housing tenants, paying a differential rent calculated on the basis of household income. The treatment of any mortgage shortfall or residual debt will be a matter for bilateral resolution between the borrower and lender.   The essential difference between the 2 options relates to ownership of the property after the voluntary repossession has taken place.Under the first model, after voluntary repossession has taken place the property would be purchased by an approved housing body at current market value. The household would become a social housing tenant — they would no longer be homeowners.  The purchase of the property would be part loan financed, using loan finance generally obtained from the initial mortgage provider, and the Exchequer using funds available under the 2012 allocation for the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. My Department is also consulting with the Central Bank to ensure that the process through which households might be offered the option to participate in the scheme complies fully with all existing consumer protection and other regulatory requirements.Under the second model, the lender would become the long term owner of the property after voluntary repossession had taken place. The household would become a social housing tenant of the relevant local authority and the local authority would, in turn, lease the property from the financial institution for the period of the lease. The household would enjoy the same benefits as any household already accommodated under the social housing leasing initiative in terms of security of tenure, differential rents, eligibility, etc.It is anticipated that the first transactions under the first model will take place very soon. Ultimately, the schemes will be rolled out nationally using the criteria set out above and it is hoped that all lenders will agree to participate. I have not set definitive limits on the numbers of cases that will be addressed in the pilot phase.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	835	I propose to take Questions Nos. 309, 310, 323 and 351 together.As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorization process include, inter alia:the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; andwhere there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.In some cases a local authority may have found that conditions in respect of a certain phase of a development were relatively good and that, for example, no serious public safety issues could be identified. This phase of the development may have been categorised under category 1 or 2. Conversely, safety issues may have been identified in another phase of the same overall development, or development in that second phase may have been abandoned altogether, implying a category 3 or 4 identification for that phase.    This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 and forms the complete list of such developments for this year. The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 does not provide for an appeals facility in this regard. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.

The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.The 2009 Act is structured from a starting position of a universal liability for the charge in respect of all residential property.  Liability arises each year on a point-in-time basis, which is 31 March in each year.   A number of exemptions from the charge are provided for in the Act, the most significant being where a property is an owner's sole or main residence.In a situation where a person owns a property in which he or she does not live and his or her sole or main residence is another property, there may be a liability for the non-principal private residence charge in respect of the property owned by the person, unless it is otherwise exempted under section 4 of the Act.The Act places the charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.

A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests. As one might expect, a consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed. All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie
I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals in relation to household waste collection to Government by Easter this year. All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives. The respective waste management roles of the public and private sectors have evolved considerably in recent years. Such developments will be among the issues for consideration in this context.

However, the operational and legal implications of the transfer of waste collection services are a matter for the City Council itself.  Queries on the matter should therefore be addressed directly to the City Council.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	841	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities through the introduction of the charge on non-principal private residences. The charge is set at €200 and is being levied and collected by local authorities. The Act places the onus on the owner of a residential property to assess his or her liability to the charge in the first instance.There is no legal obligation on local authorities to issue notifications, invoices or reminders.   In practice, a number of measures are undertaken to assist collection of the charge.  Nationwide advertising has taken place in each year since the introduction of the charge in 2009 to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In addition, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.   As a shared resource, I understand that reminder notifications were issued by the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and local authorities to those who paid the charge last year in respect of their possible liability for 2011.It is intended that similar advertising will take place in the context of liability for the NPPR in 2012, including reminder notifications from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) and local authorities to those who paid the charge last year in respect of their possible liability for 2012.  Reasonable efforts have been and will continue to be made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.  However, the charge is based on self assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability to pay the charge by the due date to avoid late payment fees.

The local authority administers the scheme in its entirety from the transfer of RS recipients, including the sourcing of suitable accommodation and the accommodation of eligible households together with the payment of rent to landlords. As part of their overall role in sourcing accommodation, local authorities engage in regular advertising of the scheme aimed at landlords.  They also produce, along with my Department and the Housing Agency, detailed explanatory leaflets, including website information, on the scheme and the conditions/requirements on landlords who are entering or wish to enter the scheme.Local authorities are best placed to administer RAS and I do not propose to compile a national list of landlords willing to take part in the scheme.Since the Rental Accommodation Scheme commenced in late 2005 local authorities have transferred a total of 37,759 households from RS up to the end of December 2011. Of these 21,892 were housed directly under RAS and a further 15,867 were accommodated under other social housing options.

Planning permission for the redevelopment of the centre and adjoining lands was granted in September 2009. The proposed redevelopment did not proceed at the time due to the prevailing economic conditions.  However, provision of commercial, retail and other services in Ballymun, and at this prominent site in particular, remains very important within the context of the overall regeneration programme.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	844	Sections of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 dealing with social housing support, and related Social Housing Assessment Regulations, 2011, were commenced on 1 April 2011. The Regulations contain national eligibility criteria, including maximum income limits. These mandatory criteria must be applied by all housing authorities in assessing a household's eligibility for social housing support.The new arrangements seek to streamline the process of applying for social housing support, both for the applicant and the local authority, while at the same time allowing a reasonable level of choice to households as to the areas in which they would like to receive social housing support.   The new system includes a requirement that applicants may only make an application for housing support to a single housing authority for the purpose of determining whether or not they have a housing need. It requires completion of a new standard application form and provides maximum net income limits according to the area of application.The ultimate aim of the new system is to provide a fair, consistent and transparent approach to eligibility for social housing support across the country and I am satisfied that the provisions are generally working well.  My Department is currently reviewing the operation of the new regulations and, when the review is finalised, will implement any changes necessary.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	845	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) is administering the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 3 February, 2012, a total of 75,050 properties were registered for the household charge and that it has been paid in full in respect of 61,669 properties while 13,381 are making payment by direct debit in four instalments.  The LGMA does not have the sub national details of the registrations sought in the Question.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	846	I propose to take Questions Nos. 324 to 329, inclusive, together.There is an unauthorised hazardous waste site (known as the East Tip) within the site of the defunct steel works at Haulbowline, County Cork.  Irish Ispat, the last company to operate the steel works, applied for, and was granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licence.  However, the company went into liquidation in June 2001 before the conditions in the licence could be met and the liquidator applied to the High Court seeking to disclaim the IPC licence.  In its judgment on 29 July 2004, the Court found as a matter of fact that the IPC licence was granted after the company had ceased production of steel and that the conditions of the licence could not be applied retrospectively.In 2003 the State, acting through my Department in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the site from the liquidator as mandated by Government.  The mandate required my Department to, inter alia, cover issues such as ongoing site security, ongoing maintenance, and other issues arising once the site was vacated by the liquidator and also to enable a site investigation to be carried out to determine the best option, economically and environmentally, for site remediation.Following a complaint relating to the failure to ensure that the site was covered by a waste permit, the European Commission sought information from the Irish authorities on 7 May 2009 through the EU Pilot complaint system on the measures being taken to ensure that the waste was covered by a valid waste permit.  In this request, the Commission cited the judgment in European Court of Justice Case C494/01.  In an additional Letter of Formal Notice in October 2010, in relation to deliverables required of the State to close Case C494/01, the European Commission cited the unauthorised hazardous waste site within the site of the defunct steel works at Haulbowline, County Cork — the East Tip.  It stated that it was evident from the response that no waste permit is in place for the sludge pit although it relates to an industrial site that was functioning up to 2001 (i.e. over a period when the Directive was applicable).  The Waste Framework Directive applies to waste deposited after 1977 and the State is obliged to ensure that all such waste deposited since 1977 is covered by a valid waste permit.Following Government consideration, my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Mr. Simon Coveney TD, on 27 June 2011 announced the establishment of a Steering Group to oversee an application for a licence to the EPA to address the issue raised by the Commission in its Letter of Formal Notice and to oversee any necessary remedial action required.  The Steering Group is chaired by Minister Coveney and also comprises representatives of the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Defence, Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department and the Office of Public Works.  Cork County Council has agreed on behalf of the State to prepare the licence application, under the supervision of the Steering Group.  The timeline and outline of proposed works in this regard are set out on the Council's website, www.corkcoco.ie.In so far as the South Tip is concerned, the waste in that location was deposited in the 1960's and, therefore, is not covered by waste legislation licensing requirements.  However, Cork County Council will in due course be reviewing the data which exists and will carry out a risk assessment based on that data.  The outcome of that risk assessment, which will take account of the relevant EPA Code of Practice and will be incorporated into the overall programme of works to be undertaken under the aegis of the Steering Group chaired by Minister Coveney, will inform decisions on what actions may be required in relation to the South Tip.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	847	In 1998, the then Government approved a Water Pricing Policy which required the local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from non-domestic users of these services.  Detailed guidance on the implementation of the policy was issued by my Department to local authorities between 1998 and 2004.  The policy provides for cost recovery without profit, with charges based on actual metered consumption.  The volumetric rates for water and waste services are set each year by each local authority based on the cost of service delivery within their functional area.  The determination of the consolidated charge is a function of the local authorities and the charges being applied in 2012 are available from the local authorities. The Programme for Government provides for the reform of water services delivery including the establishment of Irish Water, a new State-owned water company and the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The Memorandum of Understanding with the EU, the IMF and the ECB also contains commitments for the reform of water services delivery and operation and the introduction of domestic water charges.  The Government is also proposing to establish an independent economic regulator for water within the Commission for Energy Regulation.  The regulator will be responsible for setting a clear determination of the efficient costs for the provision of water and waste water service and ensuring efficiencies are driven and costs for customers reduced.On 16 January 2012, I commenced a public consultation on the Government's proposals for reform of water services delivery in Ireland, including metering and water charges, seeking views from the public on the establishment of a public water utility and the introduction of domestic water charges.  The details of the consultation process can be found on my Department's website and submissions can be made to my Department until 24 February 2012.

The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority.Monaghan County Council recently submitted revised proposals under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) for a group home for people with physical and sensory disabilities at Carrickmacross.  These proposals are currently under consideration.I will, in the context of an examination of existing programme commitments under CAS, give consideration to the financial scope for new CAS projects during 2012.  It will be a matter for Monaghan County Council to prioritise projects locally having regard to the relevant merit of any proposals received and the extent to which they meet housing need.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	851	In line with overall national policy which promotes a reduction in energy use, the enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department's overall strategy for the improvement of local authority housing.My Department does not operate a grant scheme in this regard for individual local authority tenants but under the Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock.  The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers.Given the constraints on new local authority housing supply, it is important that the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need.  Under the allocation to be made in respect of this year's programme there is a particular focus on returning vacant properties to productive use.  Works to occupied units may also be carried out, from within the allocation provided, where the local authority considers this appropriate.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	853	The European standard EN 12566 is a suite of standards for wastewater treatment systems consisting of 7 parts of which parts 1, 3 and 4 are harmonised product standards. These standards set out the testing and factory production control regimes for septic tanks (Part 1 and 4) and packaged wastewater treatment systems (Part 3).  Ireland recently set minimum performance levels for the tests in these standards through National Annexes which ensure that the products being used in Ireland are fit for purpose.  The performance levels set are in line with current practice and are no more onerous than the existing requirements.If a septic tank or biological treatment unit has to be replaced, for whatever reason, then the new product should conform with the relevant harmonised European Product standard and meet the requirements of the Irish National Annex.There is no obligation under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 to provide a specific type of on-site wastewater treatment unit.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	854	I propose to take Questions Nos. 341 and 342 together.As stated in the previous reply referred to, under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 it is the function of local authorities to provide the primary response to littering.  My Department's role is to provide the legislative framework for combating litter pollution, and to motivate and energise anti-litter responses as necessary.The Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme, which is administered by my Department, allows local authorities the opportunity to apply for grant funding for suitable projects such as adopt a road schemes.  Under the scheme in 2011, I requested local authorities to examine and investigate the possible roll-out of adopt a road schemes in their functional areas, where practicable.34 submissions were received from local authorities in respect of the €1 million funding which was made available in 2011 under the scheme and a total of €985,218 was paid out in grant assistance in respect of eligible projects.  Of the 34 submissions received, 14 local authorities applied for and were allocated funding for adopt a road type projects.  The total amount of funding provided for these projects was €91,042.Details of the individual payments to local authorities for adopt a road projects in 2011 are set out in the table:Local Authority NameIndividual Cost of Adopt a Road Schemes in 2011Carlow County Council€2,000.00Cavan County Council€3,000.00Clare County Council€1,800.00Donegal County Council€28,750.00Fingal County Council€10,392.00Galway County Council€5,300.00Kerry County Council€2,500.00Leitrim County Council€2,000.00Louth County Council€6,000.00Meath County Council€7,000.00Roscommon County Council€6,300.00Tipperary South County Council€4,000.00Westmeath County Council€7,500.00Wicklow County Council€4,500.00Funding for the Anti Litter Awareness Grant Scheme is provided from the Environment Fund and the 2012 Environment Fund allocations are currently being finalised.  Local authorities will then be invited to apply for grant aid for projects which meet the criteria set out in the Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme.  As in 2011, I will again be requesting local authorities to examine the further roll-out of additional adopt a road projects in their functional areas, where practicable.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	855	The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.  The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees due to it and all charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.  In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the courts.My Department is currently engaged with the City and County Managers' Association in the development of guidelines for local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the legislation.  In particular, this guidance will deal with situations where significant arrears of non-principal private residence charges and late payment fees have arisen and where a person can demonstrate genuine hardship in having to discharge their liability in a single payment.  In such cases, the guidelines will set out the modalities for local authorities, exercising their functions under the care and management provisions, including where payment of the outstanding liability in a single payment would result in hardship, entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	856	As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, published by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas.  Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver.

Accordingly, questions concerning the status of the project should be directed to the City Council.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	858	I assume the question refers to the €200,000 maximum grant aid currently allowable under the Rural Development Programme (RDP).  Up until recently community projects could apply for grant aid of up to €500,000; however a State Aid issue identified in late 2011 resulted in the suspension of grant aid for any project with grant amount of €200,000 or more.State aid refers to any aid granted by a Member State which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or goods.  EU Member States are required, under State Aid rules, to submit a notification to DG Competition in the European Commission (EC) when they propose to provide state support for schemes and programmes that could be considered to distort competition in any way.  Commission Regulation EC 1998/2006 allows for aid of up to €200,000, known as de minimis aid, to be provided from public funds to enterprises over a period of three years as this amount is considered too small to have an effect on economic activity between competing forces.In the original Rural Development Programme (RDP) document approved by the EC in July 2007 Ireland outlined that, as the aid to be granted under two of the Axis 3 measures of the RDP would not in any way distort competition, it would not constitute State Aid and would, therefore, not require notification to DG Competition.  The measures concerned, Basic services for the economy and rural population —€49.61m and Village renewal and development —€54.2m provide support for non-commercial community based projects and focus particularly on community infrastructure.Recently Ireland was notified by the EC that only DG Competition has the competence to judge whether or not state support can be deemed to be State Aid and that a State Aid notification in the context of these two measures should have been submitted when the original programme was being prepared in 2006/2007.The notification process was not undertaken at the time of programme design and the EC now require Ireland to complete the notification process as soon as possible and obtain the necessary state aid clearance in order to proceed with projects requiring grant aid in excess of €200,000.  As the consequences of non-compliance with State Aid rules are significant, particularly for project promoters, it is necessary to suspend the allocation and approval of projects with grant amounts of over €200,000 in order to avoid non-compliance.The documentation for the State Aid notification has been submitted through the relevant EU notification systems.  As soon as my Department receives the Commission decision we will notify all Local Development Companies.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	859	The current tenant purchase scheme, known as the 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme, is provided for in section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966.  The details of the scheme are set out in the legislation and in the associated regulations.  Housing authorities have adopted Purchase Schemes to implement the scheme in their areas.The criteria for a tenant purchasing a home under the tenant purchase scheme include that a tenant must have a period of reckonable tenancy of at least one year's duration.  The Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1997 provides that a housing authority may refuse to sell a dwelling to a tenant where the authority considers that the tenant is or has been engaged in anti-social behaviour or that a sale to that tenant would not be in the interest of good estate management.  Certain classes of houses, as distinct from tenants, may be excluded from sale under the Regulations and in accordance with the provisions of individual tenant purchase schemes adopted by housing authorities.There is no specific expiry date yet set for the 1995 Scheme.  However, it remains the intention, as announced in 2010, that the tenant purchase arrangements be wound down in 2012 to be replaced by a new scheme based on the incremental purchase model. This change will require amending legislation.  Details of the proposed new scheme and the arrangements for winding down the 1995 scheme will be announced when proposals are further advanced.  My Department has reminded housing authorities to inform all existing tenants of houses of the decision to end the tenant purchase scheme in 2012 so that they have sufficient time to apply to purchase their home under the existing scheme if they so wish.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I assume the Question is referring to the household charge.The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.The Act places the household charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the courts.Section 2 of the Act sets out the meaning of "residential property" for the purposes of the Act.  In particular, section 2(2)(d) of the Act provides that a building that is wholly used as a dwelling (other than a dwelling that forms part of a mixed hereditament within the meaning of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1978, and in respect of which local authority rates are payable, is not a residential property for the purposes of the household charge.  There would be a liability in respect of a residential property that forms part of a mixed hereditament, within the meaning of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1978, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to a waiver.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	861	The reform of personal insolvency law, the Heads of Bill which I have published, will involve the introduction of three new non-judicial debt settlement systems, subject to relevant conditions in each case. These are as follows:A Debt Relief Certificate to allow for the full write-off of qualifying unsecured debt up to €20,000, after a one-year moratorium period for debtors with "no assets — no income";a Debt Settlement Arrangement for the agreed settlement of unsecured debt of €20,001 and over with two or more creditors;a Personal Insolvency Arrangement  for the agreed settlement of both secured and unsecured debt of €20,001 to €3 million with one or more creditors. The Personal Insolvency Bill will also continue the reform of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, begun in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 and will include, critically, the introduction of automatic discharge from bankruptcy, subject to certain conditions, after 3 years in place of the current 12 years.It is not for me to speculate as to the future conduct of any of the participants in an insolvency process. However, I am of the view that new personal insolvency laws, including the bankruptcy law reform, should provide a significant incentive for financial institutions to develop and implement realistic agreements to manage or settle debt with their customers. Such agreements should in time become the norm as the most sensible and cost-effective arrangements, particularly where the issue is one of dealing with repayment difficulties for a single major debt, secured or otherwise. These agreements could include measures to address mortgage arrears.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	862	I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 193 of 12 January 2012 in which I said that: "The Government Legislation Programme, published on 11 January 2012, indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in this session.  The Bill will reform the law on mental capacity taking into account the Law Reform Commission's Report on Vulnerable Adults and the Law.  The enactment of new mental capacity legislation is one of the core elements of the remaining work to be completed towards ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the total number of Garda Stations in the country at the end of 2011 was 703.  I have been further informed by the Garda Commissioner that there are currently 421 networked Garda locations in the country.  While not every Garda station is a networked location, every District and Divisional Headquarters is, therefore providing access to that network for every member of An Garda Síochána.  All Garda stations which are not directly linked to the Garda network have secure voice communications to their local networked station which meets the current operational requirements.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	864	I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the personnel strength of the Kerry Division on the 31 December 2011, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 314 which compares with 334 on the 31 December 2010 or a reduction of approximately 6%.  As the Deputy will be aware, the allocation of resources, including personnel, vehicles and other equipment, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in consultation with his senior management team.  Reductions in Garda strength must be seen in the context of a wider programme aimed at reducing the size of the public service, and will contribute to reducing expenditure and complying with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement.Today I have secured Cabinet approval for the appointment of 2 Assistant Garda Commissioners, 8 Chief Superintendents and 23 Superintendents, a total of 33 appointments to senior Garda ranks.  All of the consequential vacancies at Sergeant and Inspector ranks will also be filled. I was very glad to secure the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Cabinet as a whole for such a significant number of appointments.  In seeking these promotions, I was conscious of the need to enable the Garda Commissioner to fill key positions in the senior ranks, and to maintain both the investigative and also the management and supervisory capacity of the Force.Local Garda Management closely monitors the allocation of all resources in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. Senior- Garda Management is satisfied that a comprehensive policing service continues to be delivered and that current structures in place meet the requirement to deliver an effective and efficient policing service to the community.  This situation will be kept under review.While a policing service may not always be provided in the same way as it was in the past, it is no less effective and the commitment of An Garda Síochána to the community is not diminished.  The importance of the partnership between An Garda Síochána and the community in preventing and detecting crime and maintaining a safe environment for everyone can never be over-emphasised and the pledge of An Garda Síochána is to continue to invest time and energy in those partnerships and relationships to the benefit of all.

This programme is progressed in co-operation with the Office of Public Works, who have responsibility for capital expenditure in relation to Garda accommodation.  The Deputy will recall from the reply I gave to her in Parliamentary Question No. 130 on 1st December 2011 that proposals in relation to the refurbishment of Clane Garda station are being developed.  The Garda authorities have indicated that these proposals will be taken forward with reference to An Garda Síochána's overall accommodation priorities and the availability of resources.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	866	The Deputy will recall that the Government announced in December last that it had decided not to proceed with legislation in the area referred to in his question.  There was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge. In addition, at this difficult time in our economic circumstances, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed, in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Government was strongly of the view that payment of compensation to landlords in such circumstances could not be justified in the current economic climate.I am well aware of the difficulties in which parts of the retail sector finds itself.  The Minister for Finance outlined in his Budget speech that NAMA can play a role in dealing with the problems caused by upward only rent reviews which apply to NAMA properties.  NAMA has published on its website its policy guidance which will inform the approach to be taken where relevant tenants are experiencing difficulties in paying rents.  I would also note the existence of a rent review arbitration code which was developed by an expert group whose membership was drawn from all relevant stakeholders and which provides a mechanism to deal with the resolution of rent review disputes in the commercial property sector.While it has not proved possible to bring forward legislation in this area, I urge those landlords who have not yet engaged with their tenants to do so and to have regard to the realities of the market.  It is important to remember that a tenant paying some rent, even at a lower level, is of more use to a landlord than an empty property which is not attracting any rent at all.

These numbers are augmented by officers from the Garda National Immigration Bureau whose deployment in Dublin airport is dependent on the passenger numbers flowing through the airport on any given day.  The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation and it is therefore not possible for me to state what the strength will be in 2012.  I can inform the Deputy and the House that a pilot scheme for the provision of civilian Immigration Officers is currently being introduced in Dublin Airport to free up Gardaí for frontline operational duties.

In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the place to which a person appearing before the District Court is remanded is at the discretion of the presiding judge.Section 27(3) of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953 provides that the judge may transfer or adjourn business to another occasion at the same court or another occasion at some other place in his district.  Section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997 provides that notwithstanding section 27(3), the judge before which a person first appears charged with a particular offence may remand a person in custody to appear at a sitting of the District Court (alternative court) in the District Court District in which the prison or place of detention in which a defendant is being held or a District Court District adjoining that District Court District.The Deputy will appreciate that, as outlined above, this issue is one for the judiciary who are independent in their functions.  I understand that section 5 of the 1997 Act is used regularly where appropriate in relation to Harristown Court.  A working group to identify efficiencies in the Circuit and District Courts which includes members of the judiciary is currently examining how this practice can be more widely deployed in other locations where appropriate.

The spouse of an Irish citizen may attain Irish citizenship through naturalisation at the absolute discretion of the Minister.  Under Section 15A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, a foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation if they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	874	The strength of the Garda Síochána at the end of 2011 was just under 13,900, along with over 2,000 civilian support staff and over 800 Garda Reserve members.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the total number of Garda retirements from the Force in the first two months of this year is expected to be around 300. To put that figure into context, in 2009 the number of retirements was 722, in 2010 it was 362, and last year it was 436.As the Deputy will be aware, these reductions form part of a wider programme aimed at reducing the size of the public service, and will contribute to reducing expenditure and complying with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement.  Of course, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.  Of course, even with a reduction in overall Garda numbers, there will still be a need to ensure that key positions are filled, especially in the senior ranks.  As the Deputy may be aware, I today secured Cabinet approval for the appointment of 2 Assistant Garda Commissioners, 8 Chief Superintendents and 23 Superintendents, a total of 33 appointments to senior Garda ranks.  All of the consequential vacancies at Sergeant and Inspector ranks will also be filled.I was very glad to secure the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Cabinet as a whole for such a significant number of appointments.  In seeking these promotions, I was conscious of the need to enable the Garda Commissioner to fill key positions in the senior ranks, and to maintain both the investigative and also the management and supervisory capacity of the Force.  With clarity now emerging on the final number of retirements expected by the end of this month, I will be discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the case for filling outstanding vacancies in the senior ranks.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	875	The Deputy will be aware that law enforcement in relation to the smuggling of tobacco products and the sale of illicit or counterfeit tobacco products within the State is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  While it has not been possible to identify the specific report to which the Deputy refers, the Revenue authorities have informed me that a survey commissioned in 2009 by the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Tobacco Control estimated that 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction. This figure was further broken down as 14% illicit product and 6% legal purchases by passengers arriving into the State from other jurisdictions.  A similar study in the last quarter of 2010 was consistent with these estimates and I understand that a further survey is currently underway.There is a close working relationship in place between the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda Síochána in tackling this form of criminality.  Searches are regularly undertaken by the Gardaí as part of intelligence-led operations led by Revenue.  An Garda Síochána also continue, on district and divisional levels to target those involved in the sale and distribution of illegal products, at markets and via door-to-door sales.  It is difficult to establish a comparative basis in relation to the smuggling of controlled drugs and the smuggling of tobacco products.  This is mainly due to the fact that in contrast to controlled drugs such as heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis, there is a legal domestic market for the consumption of tobacco products and the smuggling of tobacco products involves the criminal evasion of a commodity tax, a tax from which the Exchequer benefits.  Furthermore, given the covert nature of  the illegal importation of both controlled drugs and tobacco it would be extremely difficult to draw any comparison between the overall volumes of each substance being trafficked into the State.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	876	One of the principal objectives of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 is to ensure transfer of the common areas of multi-unit developments from developers to the owners' management companies concerned. Section 4 of the Act, which deals with partially completed developments, and section 5, which deals with substantially completed developments, provide that transfer of the relevant parts of the common areas must have been completed within 6 months of the coming into operation of the Act, i.e. before 1 October 2011.Section 24 of the Act establishes a new Circuit Court jurisdiction for the resolution of disputes in relation to multi-unit developments. It means that if such a dispute cannot be resolved by the parties concerned by means of mediation or other dispute resolution mechanism, the Court may, where it is satisfied that a right has been infringed or an obligation has not been discharged, make an order with a view to ensuring effective enforcement of the right or effective discharge of the obligation concerned.  Such an order may include an order directing the developer to complete the development or an order transferring control of an owners' management company from a developer to the apartment owners where the Circuit Court is satisfied the developer has unreasonably refused to effect such a transfer.  However, section 30 of the Act provides for restoration of companies that have been struck off the register for breaches of company law without the involvement of the courts where application is made in the prescribed form before the expiration of 6 years from publication of the notice that the company was struck off the register.  I should add that the taking in charge of estates is a matter for the relevant local authority and I am aware that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has issued a guidance document to the local authorities on this matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	877	The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a comprehensive series of provisions aimed at protecting children and other persons.  Part 2 of the Act makes persons convicted of a range of sexual offences subject to notification requirements.  The provisions of the Act also extend to any offenders convicted abroad of the same range of sexual offences who enter the State.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were 1,194 persons subject to the requirements of Part 2 of the Act on 1 February 2012.All offenders subject to the notification requirements are monitored by the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit (SOMIU) at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.  The Unit is supported by Garda Inspectors nominated in each Garda Division throughout the State.  I am informed that the nominated Inspector in each Division has access to all necessary resources within his/her Division to assist him/her in carrying out his/her duties.  Where An Garda Síochána becomes aware that an offender subject to the notification requirements has breached those requirements, appropriate action is taken.  I am confident that the appropriate level of monitoring is carried out by An Garda Síochána and all breaches of the requirements which come to notice are pursued.I am also informed that when the Garda authorities become aware that a convicted sex offender has left or is intending to leave the State, the Sex Offender Management and Intelligence Unit ensures that the relevant law enforcement agency in the country of destination is advised via Interpol.An Garda Síochána receive, on a regular basis, notifications regarding convicted sex offenders who travel to this country.  When SOMIU receives such a notification, it is recorded on the Garda PULSE system and the relevant nominated Divisional Inspector is notified as a priority.  I am advised that the information requested regarding the number of such notifications received is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of time and resources to collate.I can also inform the Deputy that my Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences and a review of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 formed an integral part of that examination.  Arising from the review, I expect to bring forward legislative proposals, including a number of amendments to the 2001 Act, in the coming months.

I have no plans at present to reform the legislation on citizenship and naturalisation beyond those changes contained in  the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2011.

My primary objective for legislative reform in the immigration area is to progress the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 through the Oireachtas.

I will, of course, continue to keep the Act in question under review.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	879	I am sure the House will join me in condemning all subversive groups and their activities.  We should be clear that the so-called ‘dissident republicans' are no more than criminal terrorists using violence in pursuit of their own, often personal, ends.  They have no support in the wider community, North and South, for either their criminal activities or their violent methods.Since early 2009 the threat level in Northern Ireland from these groups has been classified as severe.  The threat faced on this island from these subversives is a shared threat and I can assure the House that the Gardaí continue to co-operate seamlessly with the PSNI in actively pursuing them.  These groups have targeted the security forces in Northern Ireland, as the tragic deaths of PSNI Constables Ronan Kerr and Stephen Carroll and the murder of two British soldiers, Patrick Azimkar and Mark Quinsey, at Massarene Barracks attest.  The House will be aware that there have also been a number of other attempted murders and other bomb attacks.Operational policing co-operation is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI and their respective forces.  Both police chiefs have emphasised the close nature and the high quality of the ongoing co-operation between their forces and it has been instrumental in preventing attacks, combating criminality and saving lives.  The two police forces operate a Cross-Border Policing Strategy, which covers areas including cross-Border investigations and operations, intelligence-sharing and security, ICT and emergency planning.  Combating the subversive threat has always been an absolute priority for the Garda authorities and it remains so, even in the current economic climate.  I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Government is committed to maintaining that high level of co-operation between the Gardaí and the PSNI.I meet regularly with the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, David Ford, and with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, and there is also a close and ongoing working relationship between our officials.  Indeed, by working together on matters of mutual concern and interest we can improve community safety for all the people on this island.  We will continue, in co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, to spare no effort to ensure that those criminal terrorists who seek to subvert the democratic will of the people will face the full rigours of the law.

The letter in question was written after the announcement in the Budget to that effect.  That decision was taken on foot of consultations with the Attorney General, which made it clear that the proposed legislation gave rise to significant constitutional difficulties.  It was also clear that any legislative proposal would require the payment of compensation to those whose property rights would be infringed if that proposal were to be compatible with Constitutional and European Court of Human Rights norms.Consultations with the Attorney General commenced in March of last year and continued until November, when the relevant Government decision was taken.  That decision was informed fully by the legal advice made available to Government by the Attorney General.

The Bill will also fulfil the relevant commitment in the Programme for Government.The Bill will provide for a new framework for settlement of debt and for personal insolvency.  The proposed reform will consist of following main elements:a revised judicial process (bankruptcy) to provide for a 3 year period for automatic discharge from bankruptcy from the current 12 years.the introduction of a new non-judicial debt settlement process for unsecured debt only amounting to over €20,000 (Debt Settlement Arrangement).the introduction of a new non-judicial debt settlement process for both secured and unsecured debt amounting to over €20,000 (Personal Insolvency Arrangement) (secured debt will primarily relate to property debt, be it residential, commercial and investment).the introduction of a new debt forgiveness process (Debt Relief Certificates) for low level indebtedness where the debtor has effectively no income and no assets and has unsecured debts amounting to up to €20,000, andthe establishment of an Insolvency Service to operate the new arrangements.I have referred the Heads of the Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for its consideration.This is a complex area of the law where a careful calibration is required between the rights of debtors and creditors.  Legal considerations aside, the economic and financial impact of any policy changes to personal insolvency also require serious deliberation.  These matters will continue to be examined by Government in the development of the Bill.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	894	I take it the Deputy is referring to a recent High Court case involving Judicial Reviews of decisions by Chief Superintendents in firearms cases.  What was at issue were decisions by Chief Superintendents to refuse applications for licenses for high calibre handguns. That case was settled with no admission of wrongdoing on the part of the State but with an undertaking to consider applications afresh and give reasons to applicants where applications are turned down.In the light of issues which arose in those proceedings I sought a report from the Garda Commissioner. I have now received a detailed interim report.  The Commissioner has indicated that he shares the concern expressed by the Judge in the case about the alteration of documents after proceedings had commenced and, in the first instance, has sought an explanation as to the circumstances in which this occurred.In the case of the evidence given by another member of An Garda Síochána, the Commissioner has indicated that, while an issue did arise in relation to the completion of parts of the application forms, he is satisfied that the applications were decided in accordance with that person's understanding of the relevant firearms legislation, decisions were recorded in notifications to applicants, and those decisions were informed by understandable concerns of public safety in the light of the difficult situation concerning crime in his Division.  The Commissioner points out that the parts of the forms in question are not a statutory requirement under the Firearms legislation and are geared towards the requirements of recording data on the PULSE system through the ticking of a number of boxes.The Commissioner is addressing as a matter or urgency the whole process of firearms licensing and the administrative functions associated with it in the light of the outcome of those Court proceedings.  The Commissioner has assured me that he, of course, accepts fully the desirability of application forms being completed fully and properly and has indicated that as part of that review he intends to remove any impediments being experienced by his Officers in achieving this.  The Commissioner is to report to me again when he has completed that review.Tragically, the House will have been reminded in recent days of the dangers which licensed firearms can pose for members of An Garda Síochána and others.  For my part, I am determined to ensure that in the operation of the firearms licensing system, the question of public safety is paramount.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	895	I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 389 together.There has been a substantial increase in the volume of vetting applications received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) over recent years. The numbers of applications processed by the GCVU for the years 2008 to 2011 are as follows:2008200920102011218,404246,194291,938315,100The GCVU does not grant or decline to grant clearances. The position is that a registered organisation submits a vetting application on behalf of a prospective employee or volunteer. The application is signed by the latter.  In response the GCVU issues a vetting certificate to the organisation. It is for the organisation alone to make the final decision about taking on the person as an employee or volunteer. The GCVU merely responds to the vetting request.I am advised by the Garda authorities that details of the number of times an individual has had a vetting request made on his/her behalf is not readily available, since each application is considered new. In the circumstances, it would take an inordinate amount of Garda resources and time to provide information on the number of secondary applications. Furthermore, figures related to the cost of processing each application are not readily available and again it would take an inordinate amount of Garda resources and time to provide this information.For the sake of clarity I would point out that Garda vetting certificates are issued to specified registered organisations in respect of a particular post or employment in response to a written request and with the permission of the person who is the subject of that request.  Decisions on the suitability for the recruitment/engagement of the person concerned rest at all times with the recruiting organisation. All organisations registered for Garda Vetting are aware of the processing time frames for the receipt of Garda vetting and have been advised to factor this into their recruitment and selection process.The Garda Vetting certificate is non-transferable. It is important to emphasise that it is a disclosure to the requesting, registered organisation of the position at the time when it is issued. Furthermore, non-transferability protects against the risk of fraud or forgery of such certificates and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting system.Since I became Minister I have taken a particular interest in improving the Garda vetting process. In that regard a number of measures to ensure improvements in the time it takes for the processing of vetting applications were put in place. I remain very conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain a vetting to the minimum possible.I am informed by the Garda authorities that at present, there are approximately 8,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed and that the average processing time at the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) now is 2 weeks approximately.  This is a substantial improvement on this time last year when there were 55,000 cases on hand and processing took 11 weeks.This processing time can, nevertheless, be affected by seasonal fluctuations or the necessity to seek further information on particular applications which may result in the processing time exceeding the present average of 2 weeks.

In this regard, the Law Reform Commission has made detailed recommendations in its Report on the Legal Aspects of Family Relationships. In particular, the Commission recommends that legislative provisions be introduced to facilitate the extension of guardianship (parental responsibility) to civil partners and step-parents either by agreement with the other parties who have parental responsibility for the child or by application to court. The Commission’s recommendations are under consideration in my Department with a view to preparing legislative proposals.

In that context the efficient deployment of Garda vehicles within each Garda Division is a matter for the Divisional Officer in the light of operational requirements.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the allocation of vehicles within each Garda District is continually monitored in the context of crime trends, the identified policing needs of the area concerned and the existing operational strategies in place, to ensure that the optimum policing service is provided to the community.I am informed that there is currently one marked patrol car assigned to each of the Garda stations in Balbriggan, Skerries  and Lusk. The marked patrol cars assigned to both Balbriggan and Skerries are fully operational while the vehicle assigned to Lusk is undergoing a technical assessment.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	900	I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the total number of Garda retirements from the Force in the first two months of this year is expected to be around 300.  To put that figure into context, in 2009 the number of retirements was 722, in 2010 it was 362, and last year it was 436.As the Deputy will be aware, these reductions form part of a wider programme aimed at reducing the size of the public service, and will contribute to reducing expenditure and complying with the terms of the EU-IMF agreement.  Of course, what will ultimately determine the sustainable level of Garda numbers is the level of budgetary provision that can be made for the Force, and the House will be conscious that difficult decisions will continue to have to be made, right across the public sector, in order to bring our public finances back into balance.The Deputy will be aware that the Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team, is responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, throughout the organisation.  Garda management closely monitors this allocation of resources, including transfers and retirements, in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	901	I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána on 31 December 2011, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 13,894 broken down by rank as per the following table:An Garda Síochána on 31 December 2011Commissioner1D/Commissioner2A/Commissioner7C/Superintendent37Superintendent149Inspector319Sergeant2,024Garda11,355Total13,894As the Deputy may be aware, I today secured Cabinet approval for the appointment of 2 Assistant Garda Commissioners, 8 Chief Superintendents and 23 Superintendents, a total of 33 appointments to senior Garda ranks.  All of the consequential vacancies at Sergeant and Inspector ranks will also be filled.I was very glad to secure the agreement of my colleague, the Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Cabinet as a whole for such a significant number of appointments.  In seeking these promotions, I was conscious of the need to enable the Garda Commissioner to fill key positions in the senior ranks, and to maintain both the investigative and also the management and supervisory capacity of the Force.With clarity now emerging on the final number of retirements expected by the end of this month, I will be discussing with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the case for filling outstanding vacancies in the senior ranks.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	902	The Deputy will appreciate that membership of organised crime gangs tends to be fluid and offences committed by members of criminal gangs may or may not be connected with an individual's membership of such gangs.It is therefore not feasible to provide the Deputy with the particular information sought.However, the Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which entered into force on 23 July 2009, introduced a number of provisions which strengthened the law dealing with organised crime.Since the enactment of that legislation on 23 July 2009, up to  31 January, 2012, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the provisions of the Act have been used on 160 occasions where arrests have been made relating to organised crime.In the same period, eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, six under section 72 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as inserted by section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (participating in organised crime), and two under section 71A of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, as inserted by section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 (directing a criminal organisation).  In addition, a number of investigation files are currently with the Law Officers awaiting directions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	903	The Irish Prison Service facilitated a major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology, the findings of which were published in May, 2008.  The study found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence with one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.  The fact that over 50% of prisoners do not re-offend within four years of release compares well internationally.The Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes with the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.  These interventions are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self-management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.The Probation Service is in the process of conducting initial research in order to measure the recidivism rates of offenders under their management.  Preliminary findings from the work done to date indicate that the percentage of offenders who did not commit an offence in the 12 and 24 month periods after their initial conviction is high.  However, this is a complex area of study and this research needs to be validated further before exact figures and findings can be published.Crime prevention and reduction is a core part of the mission of An Garda Síochána.  The Force attaches great importance to working in co-operation with the community, those directly affected by crime, and relevant Government Departments and Agencies.    There are dedicated Crime Prevention Officers (CPOs) within each Garda Division who are trained to encourage, promote and advise on crime prevention.At local level, inter-agency co-operation includes in particular the work of Joint Policing Committees which are a forum to consult, discuss and make recommendations on policing matters arising in their area, including the prevention of crime.  The Programme for Government makes a commitment to build on existing community policing partnerships and forums to enhance trust between local communities and their Gardaí.  Accordingly, my Department has commenced a review of how the Committees have operated since their establishment, to be followed by a broader consultation process with the aim of seeing how their operation might be improved.  My Department is in contact with local authorities in this regard.More generally, work is underway in my Department on the development of a White Paper on Crime following an extensive consultation process with a broad range of Governmental and non-Governmental agencies and the public.  It is intended that the White Paper will incorporate a framework National Anti-Crime Strategy which will reflect and respond to issues raised during the consultation process, including issues relating to crime prevention and offender rehabilitation initiatives.  The White Paper is expected to be completed this year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	904	I can advise the Deputy that out of the 3,578  prisoners serving sentences during  the week ended Friday 16 December 2011, 1,683 or 47% participated in education placements.  It is not possible to separate out how many were serving 3 years or more from this number as this would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort that could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources.Prisoners are encouraged to participate in education activities and waiting lists, where they occur, are generally for the more popular programmes. Where demand exists for specific courses every effort is made to facilitate prisoners in the shortest period of time.Educational services are available at all institutions and are provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies including notably the VECs and Public Library Services. The Department of Education and Skills provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents.  Literacy, numeracy and general basic education provision is the priority and broad programmes of education are made available which generally follow an adult education approach. An average of 38% of the prison population attended classes in 2011.A significant expansion and development of vocational training programmes has taken place in recent years and there are now over 100 workshops in place in our prisons capable of catering for in excess of 800 prisoners each day.  There was a significant increase in the number of prisoners who participated in accredited vocational training courses in 2010, the latest year for which figures are available, when 874 prisoners attended such courses.I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service is in the process of drafting a new Strategic Plan 2012-2014 which will be presented to me, by the Director General, in the first week of April.  The development of prisoner education will form a central part of this Strategy.The Irish Prison Service provides a range of other rehabilitative programmes that include healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These programmes are available in all prisons and all prisoners are eligible to use the services.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	905	I can inform the Deputy that on 31 January 2012 there were 3,590 sentenced persons in custody; of these 2,326 persons were serving sentences of 3 years or more.  On the same date, there were 839 persons on temporary release; this figure includes 53 persons who were participating in the Community Return Programme.It is not possible to provide the Deputy with the other information requested as this would require the manual examination of records.  Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and cannot be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  It is anticipated though that the new Prison Information Management System (PIMS) which will shortly become "live", will be able to provide such data in the future.

Figures relating to the number of persons who absconded from custody in 2011 are currently being compiled for the Annual Report and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available.It should be noted that the vast majority of prisoners who abscond, do so from the two open centres, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House. The profile of open centres generally includes, either low risk offenders who are serving short sentences for minor offences or offenders nearing the end of longer sentences, whose transfers have been approved, as part of a sentence management programme. In most of these cases, the offender is very much at the lower end of the risk to the public spectrum.  The Gardaí are informed when prisoners abscond and have the power to detain, arrest, and return such persons to prison.

An Garda Síochána reviews missing persons cases on a regular basis.  The District Officer (Superintendent) in the area where a person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for all investigations and searches carried out.  Local investigation teams are appointed by the District Officer, and all means necessary, including the services of specialist units, are deployed to assist in these investigations, as considered appropriate.  The services of Interpol and Europol can also be availed of during such investigations, if necessary.The Garda Missing Persons Bureau, which is responsible for all data relating to missing persons, provides expert assistance and advice to District Officers in all high risk missing person cases.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technology, are in place to deal with this issue and investigations are carried out in line with international best practice.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.

In response to the revised strength ceiling, a major re-organisation of the Defence Forces, including the Reserve Defence Force, has been initiated.  This will encompass a reduction in the number of Army Brigades from the current three to two. I can confirm that no further barrack closures are envisaged as part of this process. The primary focus of the re-organisation is to maintain operational outputs and capabilities to best effect, within a reduced strength.I have asked the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department of Defence to bring forward detailed proposals for my consideration.  This will include proposals regarding territorial areas of responsibility.  I anticipate that this work will take some months to complete. You will appreciate that in advance of my receipt and subsequent consideration of the proposals, I will not be commenting on potential future organisational matters.  As the options for consideration are still being formulated, the question regarding publication of recommendations does not arise at this stage.

Clancy Barracks was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001. Two bids were received, both of which were considered too low to permit acceptance and the property remained on the open market.In June, 2002 the Department accepted an offer from Florence Properties Ltd for the purchase of Clancy Barracks in the sum of €25.4 million, following detailed consideration of the matter and receipt of confirmation from the selling agents that no other party which expressed an interest in the property was prepared to make a higher bid.  The sale of the barracks to Florence Properties Ltd. was completed on 26 March 2004.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	921	It is widely recognised that the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme is a very important one for this country, as the total area designated as disadvantaged is almost 75% of Ireland's total land area. From an economic perspective, the Scheme is particularly significant, contributing to the support of in excess of 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted by the physical environment and, in particular, the impact of the prevailing wet cold climatic conditions.  The Scheme, which is co-funded by the EU, is an integral part of Ireland's Rural Development Plan, 2007/2013, and as such, any proposed change to Scheme criteria requires the agreement of the EU Commission. In this regard, therefore, the changes announced in the context of the recent Budget have been submitted to Brussels; the Commission's response is expected shortly.The budgeted expenditure under the 2012 Scheme will be reduced from €220 million to €190 million and, in order to achieve the €30 million saving in expenditure, it is proposed to introduce specified changes to the Scheme eligibility criteria for 2012. This will be achieved by making technical adjustments to the Scheme criteria to ensure that the aid payment is focused on farmers, whose farming enterprises are situated exclusively in Less Favoured Areas and who are making a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Scheme. It is not possible to give a county by county breakdown at this stage.The savings will be achieved without the need to reduce the existing rates of aid and, in addition, there will also be no reduction in the maximum area payable — 34 hectares. The proposed changes are designed to ensure that the payments under the Scheme are focused on those farmers who (i) are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, (ii) make a significant contribution to the maintenance of a viable rural community and (iii) contribute to the enhancement of the environment.With the intention of targeting those farmers who are farming exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas, it is proposed that digressive payments will apply for farmers whose holdings consist of land situated in both Disadvantaged Areas and non-Disadvantaged Areas.I remain committed to supporting farmers who choose to farm to environmentally friendly practices and to ensuring that these farmers are rewarded for their efforts.  However, given the state of the public finances, I had no option but to announce a 10% cut in the rate of payment to existing REPS participants, including 717 farmers participating in REPS 4 in Co Offaly. The cut, which will apply to 2012 payments onwards is subject to the approval of the Commission. I am not yet in a position to indicate how the change will affect applicants on an individual basis or impact on the distribution of payments at county level.

The scheme provided an incentive for sugar processors to renounce sugar quota and dismantle the associated sugar processing plant and it provided compensation for affected stakeholders. Greencore, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the Irish sugar quota, decided to avail of this scheme and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme.The total compensation package negotiated in November 2005 in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime, as modified in 2007, was worth €353m to Ireland, made up of €220m to beet growers, €6 million to machinery contractors and €127 million to Greencore plc. The beet growers' share was made up of restructuring aid of €53 million, diversification aid of €44 million and €123 million via the Single Farm Payment. All elements of the restructuring aid package have been paid in full.A High Court judgement in 2007 quashed the original Government decision on the percentage of aid to be reserved for growers and contractors. The ruling also stated that the EU Regulations do not empower the Member State authorities to direct how the restructuring aid is to be applied by the processor. Therefore, the Deputy will appreciate I have no remit in how the aid was allocated by the processor.

Greencore, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the Irish sugar quota, decided to avail of this scheme and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme. This was a commercial decision taken by the Company having regard to the deteriorating market situation.The total compensation package negotiated in November 2005 in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime, as modified in 2007, was worth €353m to Ireland, made up of €220m to beet growers, €6 million to machinery contractors and €127 million to Greencore plc. The beet growers' share was made up of restructuring aid of €53 million, diversification aid of €44 million and €123 million via the Single Farm Payment. All elements of the Restructuring Scheme have now been implemented, not just within Ireland but across the EU.Post reform production is now concentrated in 18 Member States. The present regime runs from 1 September 2006 to the 30 September 2015. There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations which would allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar.Notwithstanding the current legal limitations, I have strongly supported the abolition of the EU sugar quota regime from September 2015, as part of the CAP reform discussions which are currently underway in the EU Council of Ministers. I also raised the issue with EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Dacian Ciolos during his recent visit to Ireland. In this regard, I have also met in 2011 with two separate groups here who have conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility. At both meetings I stated that any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition, financed in total by investors and interested parties and make sound economic sense in order to be viable.

Such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013.  Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  Therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bi-lateral agreement developed to the standards of the Hague Convention.An official  delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held preliminary discussions regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement. I am awaiting an assessment from the Adoption Authority which will inform the next steps to be taken in relation to this matter. The immediate priority of the Adoption Authority  is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention.  Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Convention.

Ireland currently has no bilateral agreements in respect of intercountry adoption. With regard to non-Hague countries, a number of adoptions are being processed under the transitional arrangements provided in the Adoption Act, 2010. Such adoptions may take place up to the end of 2013.In the period between the commencement of the Adoption Act, 2010, and 26th January 2012, the latest date for which information is available, a total of 368 foreign adoptions have been registered by the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI). Of these, 244 were intercountry adopters resident in Ireland with Declarations issued by the AAI and 124 were Irish ex-patriates resident abroad and seeking recognition of adoptions effected abroad.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	936	In accordance with the Adoption Act, 2010, which came into effect on 1 November 2010, intercountry adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. Ireland currently has no bilateral agreements in respect of intercountry adoption.The Hague Convention is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention. In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country. Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions. This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.It is not realistic that the Government, or the AAI, could regulate activities relating to the adoption process outside of these State-to-State arrangements. Nor would it be possible for the AAI to work on a case by case basis to oversee individual adoptions extra-jurisdictionally as they are being effected. A system whereby the AAI considered whether adoptions are compliant with the required standards after they have been effected would be unfair both to the children and prospective adoptive parents involved. It leaves open the possibility of adoptions being unrecognised which is contrary to the best interests of the child. The role of the Central Authority in the sending country is therefore critical to the process of national assurance.The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) has indicated that its immediate priority is the development of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention. In this context, the AAI is currently developing administrative arrangements with a number of countries which are signatories to the Convention.With regard to non-Hague countries, a number of adoptions are being processed under transitional arrangements provided for in the Adoption Act, 2010. Such adoptions may take place up to the end of 2013. An official delegation from Ireland recently visited Russia and held exploratory meetings with authorities there regarding the potential for a bilateral agreement. I am awaiting an assessment from the AAI which will inform the next steps in relation to this matter. In addition, I have recently given the AAI approval to commence the process of examining the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. Any future bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.

Accordingly, adoptions from Kazakhstan have been temporarily suspended by the authorities in the Republic of Kazakhstan.In October, 2011 the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) commenced a review of the adoption laws of Kazakhstan. The review of laws is to clarify the precise effects of adoptions effected in Kazakhstan vis-à-vis the Irish legislative regime for recognition so that the effects of recognition are consistent with the effects of the original adoption order. This is a standard check carried out in respect of all countries of origin. Once this review process has been completed, the AAI will advise prospective applicants regarding the issue and may enter into administrative arrangements with that country.

Parental declaration forms are submitted in the Autumn of each year to my Department and the PPS numbers of those parents are transmitted to the Department of Social Protection (DPS) and the HSE for verification.  Information supplied by the DSP and HSE is used to determine the level of subvention which applies to each individual parent.  Following verification, letters issue to participating services confirming the total annual CCS subvention amount approved for that service together with a list of qualifying parents and confirmation of the subvention level applied to each parent.  Services are also advised that if any parent disagrees with the level of subvention applied to them, they have a right of appeal.  The deadline for the submission of appeals in this instance was Friday, 3 February 2012.I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy has submitted an appeal against the initial determination of subvention and that this appeal is currently being considered. The childcare service in which her children are enrolled will be advised of the outcome in due course.

While issues relating to carers span a number of different Departments, the Taoiseach has allocated responsibility for co-ordination of the preparation of the Strategy to me with the support of the Minister for Social Protection. The Strategy will address the needs of informal and family carers. It will be conceptual and visionary and will establish a number of high-level principles, goals and objectives and a road map to implementation.The State already faces challenges in maintaining existing levels of services from within limited resources and the Strategy is being developed in that context. The Strategy will not be an operational plan but will set the strategic direction for future services and supports for carers in recognition of their role and contribution to maintaining children, adults and older people with physical or mental health difficulties in their own homes. Work on developing the Strategy is on-going, and it is hoped that a draft will be completed by end March 2012. Discussions have taken place between officials of the Departments of Health and Social Protection in relation to the Strategy.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	942	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 456 to 459, inclusive, and 461 together.The Government has decided, on foot of my recommendations, that the VHI should make an application for authorisation by the Central Bank, subject to further Government decisions to be made relating to capitalisation, once the level of its capital shortfall is clarified.  The VHI has been working for some time in preparation for this.As the Deputy will be aware, the European Commission took a case against the State regarding the VHI's derogation from the EU Non-Life Directives which had exempted it from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the State on 29 September last.The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 provided for the VHI to acquire sufficient funding in terms of its capital reserves to enable it to make an application to the Financial Regulator for authorisation.   The date by which the VHI must accrue the necessary reserves is set at 31 December 2013.  It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the level of capital which may be required as it will be subject to market fluctuations and will ultimately be determined by the Central Bank. Should the State decide to provide the funding requirements for authorisation, approval of the European Commission under State Aid rules would be required.VHI's regulatory status is bound up in a range of issues relating to the private health insurance market which I have been addressing over the past number of months.  In order to be considered for authorisation by the Central Bank, VHI will need to present a sustainable business plan.  Due to the current imbalance of the community rated private health insurance market, where the vast majority of claims are paid out by the VHI, the market requires an effective scheme of risk equalisation to address that imbalance.  Work is ongoing in my Department to legislate for such an effective, robust and permanent scheme in the coming months, following the Government's recent agreement to my proposals in that regard.  The new scheme will need to be cleared at EU level in relation to State Aid rules.  In the meantime, on foot of recommendations of the Health Insurance Authority following its analysis of the market, the level of age-related tax credits payable in 2012 in respect of customers over the age of 60 has been significantly increased.In any application for authorisation by the Central Bank, the Board and management of the VHI will be subject to examination on a range of governance issues. VHI expects to be in a position to satisfy the Central Bank as to its compliance with these requirements shortly.Following the Court of Justice judgment, the Government made decisions on how best to address the Court's findings.  The Government's plans and a realistic timetable were outlined to the European Commission on 9 December last.  I believe the Commission will be satisfied with the Government's proposal and they have not indicated that any sanctions are under consideration. Resolution of the issues will involve a number of steps.  The timescale for some of these steps is outside of the State's control and will depend on the time it takes for decisions to be made by the European Commission itself regarding State Aid issues, as well as by the Central Bank.Once it is clear, following the analysis of the Central Bank and the European Commission, what additional capital the VHI would require in order to secure authorisation and to satisfy any State Aid implications which may arise, the Government will consider the matter and make further decisions in that regard.It is clear that all of these actions must be undertaken in an orderly and efficient manner but that this will take time.  The timescale outlined to the European Commission is intended to allow for these issues to be addressed in such an orderly and efficient way.  Officials from my Department remain in contact with the European Commission on an ongoing basis and will work to satisfy the Commission's concerns and to advance the resolution of the regulatory status of the VHI as quickly as possible.

Subscribers can be assured that VHI is committed to satisfying the Central Bank of its ongoing compliance with the Consumer Protection Code. This forms part of the steps the VHI is taking in the context of the application which it is currently preparing for authorisation by the Central Bank.In addition to the Code, the VHI is working to satisfy a range of other qualitative issues which the Central Bank requires from any authorised entity.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	949	Patient Private Property Accounts (PPPAs) are governed by Section 9 of the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.  Their operation is subject to the HSE's National Patients' Private Property Guidelines which set out the procedures to be followed in operating all PPPAs. A fundamental concept underpinning the guidelines is that all funds held in PPPAs belong to the client and to no other person or body, including the HSE. I am not aware of any difficulty in relation to individual PPPA holders having access to and effective control of monies in their accounts, where they have the mental capacity to exercise such control.Where monies have been lodged to a PPPA, and where the patient concerned lacks capacity, the HSE ensures that this money is used only for the benefit of the patient in accordance with the National Guidelines.  The HSE is always happy to involve interested family members in the management of each patient's finances, so as to ensure that the patient's available funds are used to best effect in providing benefit to the patient concerned.

Community pharmacists are authorised to dispense a maximum of seven days supply of medicines prescribed for persons who have been in-patients in a hospital or who have attended an Emergency Department and because of the circumstances of their discharge and/or the urgency of the prescribed medication it would not be possible to attend their GP to have the hospital prescription transcribed to a GMS prescription form. This arrangement relieves any difficulties that patients might encounter due to being discharged from hospital late in the evening or at weekends.I wish to assure the Deputy that it is best clinical practice that a person in need of treatment should regularly attend their GP and that the GP is fully aware of the medications that any patient may be being prescribed.  This is entirely consistent with the gatekeeper role played by the GP in the delivery of primary care. As GPs receive an annual capitation fee per GMS patient there are no extra costs incurred by such patients.

To date, the Pension Levy deducted has not been remitted by the IBTS to the Exchequer. My officials are in discussion with the Board of the IBTS on how best to resolve the issue of the deficit in the IBTS pension fund, and this may involve using a proportion of pension levy funds. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service pension scheme comes under the scope of a public service pension scheme as defined in Section 1 of the Act.

There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the Scheme.Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.

It is run by a voluntary organisation, Valentia Community Health and Welfare Association Ltd, and has a service level agreement with the HSE under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  Section 39 agencies are not public service bodies and their employees are not public servants. In this regard the Minister has no function in relation to staffing levels at Valentia Community Hospital. Minister Reilly recently met a group representing Valentia Hospital in Dingle and undertook to examine positively the issues raised by the group in regard to services provided at Valentia.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	985	A Vision for Change recommended the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals and a move from the traditional institutional based model of care to a patient-centred, flexible and community based mental health service, where the need for hospital admission is greatly reduced, while still providing in-patient care when appropriate.This Government is committed to implementing A Vision for Change and reforming our model of healthcare delivery so that more and better quality care is delivered in the community.  This commitment was clearly shown in Budget 2012 with a special allocation of €35m for mental health in line with the Programme for Government.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children’s mental health services, improve access to psychological therapies in primary care and implement suicide prevention strategies in line with Reach Out — the National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention.The HSE Service Plan for 2012 provides for the recruitment of over 400 staff  to the mental health service to deliver on these objectives.Although final figures are not yet available, 436 mental health staff have indicated their intention to leave our mental health services by the end of February 2012.  In March 2009, the mental health workforce was 9,972 WTEs and the HSE's National Service Plan 2012 projected that at the start of January 2012 there would be 9,207 staff in the mental health services. The HSE's Service Plan includes a commitment to reduce acute in-patient capacity by a minimum of 153 beds nationally in 2012, in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  A key priority for the HSE is the reconfiguration of acute in-patient services and the redeployment of staff resources away from old institutional settings or over-provision of  acute in-patient beds towards community based services.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	987	Government policy is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible. This is realised through a range of community based services such as mainstream Home Help, enhanced provision via Home Care Packages,  or through other service elements such as Meals-on-Wheels or Day Care.The recently agreed HSE Service Plan for 2012 involves a reduction in Home Help hours nationally, from around 11.2 million hours in 2011 to 10.7 million hours this year. While this equates to a reduction of 4.5% in terms of hours, the corresponding reduction proposed in the actual number of people receiving this service has been kept to 1.2% or, in other words, from around 50,600 recipients last year to 50,000 in 2012. This reflects an increased focus by the HSE on more personalised care for the most vulnerable older people. I would also draw  the Deputy's attention to the fact that the levels of community based supports for older people contained in the HSE Service Plan maintains Home Care Packages for this year at 2011 levels.In the case of public nursing homes, the HSE is facing a number of challenges including staffing, funding and environmental factors around the age and structure of the units. A further reduction in staff is anticipated between now and the end of February, and the HSE have been asked to carry out a risk assessment in relation to the staffing situation. The Plan anticipates that a minimum of 555 beds will close in the course of the year.  It should be noted that this is an indicative number only.  The HSE is also carrying out a viability review of all its long stay nursing homes. The review is focusing on a number of areas including the unit's ability to meet HIQA Standards in terms of environmental structures; staffing availability; and location and stock, etc.The approach indicated above, in tandem with various other measures contained in the HSE Service Plan for this year, reflects the commitment of the Government to provide the best possible services to the most vulnerable older people, in light of increasing competing demands, and severe resource limitations overall.

The HSE is moving additional staff to this area to help address the unsatisfactory waiting times.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	I propose to take Questions Nos. 537 and 538 together.Eligibility for medical cards specifically for those over the age of 70 years is based on means.  Under the Health Act 2008, the income thresholds for entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over is €700 (gross) per week (€36,500 per year) for a single person and €1,400 (gross) per week (€73,000 per year) for a couple.  Income thresholds are reviewed annually.  The last annual review was conducted in September 2011 and a decision was taken not to amend the income thresholds. There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria at this time.A new streamlined user-friendly medical card review process for the over 70's was recently introduced by the Health Service Executive which ensures that where a person's circumstances have not changed since their last review/application, they simply certify this and return a single sheet review form to Primary Care Reimbursement Service central office.  Where their circumstances have changed to the extent that they may no longer be eligible for a medical card, their case is reviewed in the normal way.  The validity period for medical cards issued to people aged 66 and over is now 4 years.  Notwithstanding, there continues to be an obligation on all card holders to notify the Health Service Executive of any change in their circumstances which would disentitle them from holding a medical card.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1014	The final part of the centralisation project took place on the 1 of July 2011 with the centralisation of Medical Card processing and associated tasks for the entire country in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) office in Finglas, Dublin.For the first time in the State's history a single uniform system of application processing has been put in place. This system replaces the different systems previously operated through more than 100 Offices across the country.   Some of the changes that have been introduced include the medicalcard.ie website and the standardisation of medical card assessments.However, I am aware that there have been difficulties. These issues are a matter of serious concern and I have held several meetings with the HSE to raise the concerns.  As a result of these discussions a number of changes are being introduced to the medical card application system.  These changes will assist in speeding up the turn around for applications by easing the level of pressure on the medical card system, particularly with respect to the review process which, due to the timing of the re-issuing, and hence review, of a large cohort of medical cards has placed a large demand on the resources of the centralised office.In 2010 the Central Office introduced a self assessment review process for people aged 70 years and over, as that cohort was managed entirely by the central office.  Following on from this development the HSE has eased the review process for all pensioners. The change will mean that reviews for medical card holders who are 66yrs or over will operate on a self-assessment basis, as currently happens with over-seventies. The self-assessment review model will also be extended to medical card holders under 66, who were granted their medical card on the basis of a means assessment, where the HSE is satisfied is living in this jurisdiction.The HSE is also standardising eligibility periods from two years to three years for people aged under 66yrs, with a new four year eligibility period for medical card holders aged 66 or over. Notwithstanding, there continues to be an obligation on all card holders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances which would disentitle them from holding a medical card. The HSE is in the process of arranging access to data in the possession of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection to allow them conduct reviews without troubling medical card holders for further documentation. It is also intended to increase the fine applying to false claims in a forthcoming Bill.Discretionary cards, emergency cards and cards held by people in a small number of other categories will continue to be reviewed in the normal way, but the HSE are confident that the extension of the self assessment model to the great majority of medical card holders will simplify the process substantially, will improve the service to the client and will improve turnaround times for reviews. It is hoped that ultimately about 80% of renewals will be dealt with in this way. This new process also focuses attention on active users of the Medical Card to ensure that those most in need are involved in the streamlined process.In addition, from this month, the HSE will implement a new system that gives GPs the additional ability to identify and assist the most vulnerable Medical Card holders in our society.  GP's will be able to maintain the eligibility of these patients where they are going through the renewal system.  GP's will also be able to add new babies onto the medical card system on-line.I wish to emphasise that in no circumstances should a medical card holder who genuinely engages with the review of their medical card have their entitlement withdrawn before that review is complete. Some such cases were brought to my attention in recent weeks and this is unacceptable. The HSE is taking steps to ensure that this rule is properly implemented.In addition the PCRS's central office is working to deal with some of the processing issues that have been arising. This has included reviewing and refining their systems for the receipt and logging of applications and documents being sent in as a result of requests for additional information. In addition, the PCRS has received further staff resources this month as a result of a transfer from the Central Statistics Office and this should make an impact on processing times.  I am continuing to engage with the HSE with regard to other possible improvements.I will continue to monitor the situation and have arranged to meet the HSE on a regular basis to discuss any issues which may arise with respect to medical cards.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1026	Directive (2010/63/EU) on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes will strengthen the protection of animals still needed for research and safety testing. The Directive will also play a significant role in minimising the number of animals used and require alternatives to be used where possible, whilst ensuring a level playing field for EU industry and enhancing the quality of research conducted in the EU. The "Three Rs" principle of replacing, reducing, and refining animal testing is firmly anchored in the new legislation and this is something that I strongly support.In July 2009, my Department provided an information note to the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on the then proposed Directive and indicated that the transposition of the agreed Directive would be done by Statutory Instrument (i.e. Regulations). Section 2 of the European Communities Act, 1972 states that "acts adopted by the institution of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law" while Section 3 enables the Minister to make Regulations to transpose Directives into national law. It is my view that this is correct mechanism to adopt but I acknowledge that there may be some matters which require primary legislation.The Directive is required to be transposed into Irish law by 10 November, 2012 and to take effect from 1 January, 2013.  My Department sought the views of the public and interested parties in July, 2009 on the proposed Directive. These views informed Ireland's position as negotiations on the proposed Directive progressed at EU level. My Department again sought the views of the public and interested parties in October, 2011 after the adoption of the Directive. My officials have also met with industry and animal welfare groups on the Directive. Many of the provisions set out in the Directive are mandatory.

Following the establishment of the National Transport Authority (NTA) in December 2009, the implementation and development of infrastructure projects in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), such as Metro North comes under the remit of the NTA.   I understand from the NTA that €154.5 million has been spent on developing the Metro North project to end 2011.  The NTA advise me that most  of this funding will retain its value when the project re-emerges in the future.Obviously, the procurement process for the project would have to be re-run in the future and, depending on whether that would be a conventional or Public Private Partnership (PPP) process, the cost  for such a major project would amount to several million Euro. However, in essentially all other respects, the investment to date in the project for which planning permission (Railway Order) has been secured will retain its value.   This is relevant to work  relating to design, railway order and statutory approval, land and property acquisition and advance works.Large scale projects such as Metro North were not affordable within current funding constraints for inclusion in the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 — Medium Term Exchequer Framework published last November.  However, this project will be reviewed again in 2015 in advance of the next capital programme which will cover the period from 2016 onwards.

Like the provision of any other service, the consumer is protected by consumer protection legislation.Fáilte Ireland operates a number of Tour Guide Training Programmes — A National Tour Guide Training programme certified by HETAC at Level 7 and a Dublin and Environs Tour Guide Training Programme certified by FETAC at Level 6.  Tour Guides who successfully complete one of these programmes as well as completing a specified number of tours, which must be evaluated by a tour operator or employer, and who hold a current Occupational First Aid Certificate can become a Fáilte Ireland Approved Guide and apply for a Fáilte Ireland Tour Guide Badge.I am satisfied that these programmes and the qualifications awarded are sufficient not only to provide participants with the communication and information skills necessary to offer a quality tourist guiding service, but also to reassure the tourist as to the quality of the service on offer.  The operation of these training programmes is a day-to-day matter for Fáilte Ireland. I have asked the agency to advise the Deputy of its future plans for these programmes. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.

The principal functions of the Commission are the regulation of airport charges at Dublin Airport, and the regulation of aviation terminal charges levied by the Irish Aviation Authority.Other regulatory functions include the licensing of air carriers, travel agents and tour operators, the approval of ground handling operators at the State airports and the implementation of certain aspects of Community legislation in relation to the allocation of aircraft landing and take-off slots.In addition, the Commission is designated as the National Enforcement body in Ireland for EU rules under:Regulation (EC) 261/2004 (rights of air passenger in respect of, cancellation, delays and denied boarding), andRegulation (EC) 1107/2006 (the rights of passengers with disabilities and reduced mobility (PRM) when travelling by air),and as such the Commission deals with consumer complaints arising from infringements of rights under these Regulations.The Deputy may wish to refer to the Commission's Annual Report for 2010 which gives a more detailed account of the Regulator's activities in the area of consumer complaints during 2010 and which is available on the Commission's website www.aviationreg.ie.  The Annual Report is also available in the Oireachtas Library.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	Firstly, I would like to explain that the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  It is important to note that works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.There are two phases to the Limerick Northern Distributor Road.  Phase 1 relates to the Coonagh Knockalisheen Road around Moyross.  This project is a crucial component of the Limerick Regeneration Plan.  This project is progressing through the planning stages.  The CPO was submitted to An Bord Pleanála in September 2010 and was subsequently approved by the Bord on 23rd September 2011.  There is now a period of 18 months during which the Notices to Treat must be served.  Limerick City Council have been allocated €2m towards this project in 2012.In relation to Phase 2 of this project, it is my understanding that the emerging Preferred Route Corridor was presented at a public consultation in the Radisson Hotel, Ennis Road, Limerick, on Wednesday, 18th January 2012.  Furthermore, information on the emerging Preferred Route Corridor for Phase 2 was on display with local authority personnel and representatives of Roughan and O'Donovan Consulting Engineers available to answer questions.  All comments received at the consultation were recorded and there is a an extended period until  the 12th of March during which members of the public will be able to make submissions to Clare County Council. I would encourage members of the public to make their view known through this process.In respect of regional and local roads my priority is to maintain the roads network.  Due to the current financial circumstances, priority is being given to providing funding for projects which are already committed to and therefore it is unlikely that this project will progress any further than route selection at this time.However, I understand this project is part of a long term plan for the economic development in  for Limerick City and its environs within County Clare. Completing the route selection stage will enable the preservation of the route corridor for the project in the relevant local authority plans. This  will enable the Council to progress this project in the future when further funds are available.It should be noted that this project was proposed by the local authority concerned, Clare County Council and is supported by Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.  As Clare County Council is the relevant roads authority in this instance, they are the appropriate body with which to raise further issues relating to this road project.
