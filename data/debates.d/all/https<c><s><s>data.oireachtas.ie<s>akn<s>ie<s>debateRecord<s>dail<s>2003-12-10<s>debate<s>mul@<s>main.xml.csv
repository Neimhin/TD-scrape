#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The announcement last week by the Government of a major programme of decentralisation has caused consternation in some areas and has been a source of consolation in others.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Either the programme is a reaction to the Government's fear of the decimation of its parties in the local elections or it is a consequence of a well-thought out and well planned strategy. If it is the latter, then I assume the Government had access to reports and detailed criteria on which some towns were selected for decentralisation and others were not selected.I assume the Tanáiste does not want Ministers of State claiming decisions were made based on their positions and political interference. Is such evidence available? Did the Government have at its disposal detailed criteria and reports upon which decisions were made to relocate public servants to various places around the country? Has the Tanáiste seen this material and were judgments based on it?Given that 80 towns were not chosen as locations for public servants, will the Government publish the criteria, reports and assessments so everybody can understand the basis upon which these decisions were made?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The first criteria is to determine how we can have an effective public service. The most important issue is that we have an efficient and effective public service. If some of the larger companies in the world operate effectively on a decentralised basis, many operating from this country from places like the Deputy's constituency in the west, there is no reason the Government of Ireland cannot operate accordingly.We considered relocating whole Departments and decided to relocate eight of them. The headquarters of the Department of Education and Science is being relocated to Mullingar, the Department of Agriculture and Food is being relocated to Portlaoise and so on. We also considered the cluster effect so that, within a region, public servants would have the opportunity to develop a career path and would not have to remain in a particular grade or organisation, or move back to Dublin, as often happened in the past. It was on that basis and on the basis of the submissions from 130 towns, that we made our decision.Many areas have yet to be identified. There is no reason towns not successfully identified last week by the Minister for Finance cannot make a good case for areas such as the IT section of the Revenue Commissioners and some 500 people working in the area of health who are going to be decentralised. Those issues remain to be resolved in terms of relocation destinations.At the end of the day, the decision was a political one. There was widespread consultation four years ago throughout Departments at every level. From my experience, the Government's announcement has been well received in Departments.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Tanáiste has not answered my question. I accept this issue was discussed for four years and that Irish companies operate on a worldwide scale from Ireland. If the decision is based on a well thought out and planned strategy, then the Tanáiste as a member of Government had at her disposal reports based on four years of discussions, criteria based on four years analysis and indicators based on the national spatial strategy. She, therefore, has a volume of information which she should now publish. She has not answered my question in this regard.The Tanáiste rightly said there are towns that have not been identified for inclusion in this regard. They are entitled to know the reason they have not been included. We heard comments from the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that public servants were included in a sort of raffle for relocation to various parts of the country based on his appointment and interference.Has the Tanáiste seen the evidence of four years of discussions and reports? Was the matter discussed by Cabinet? In the interests of fairness and equity, will the Government now publish the criteria and documentation so those towns not included can have that information at their disposal? Will the Government publish, or not publish, that information?

Is the Tánaiste aware that it operated on the basis of arranging the letting of development land to builders on a short-term basis so that the transactions of sale of site and sale of buildings could be separated? The result was enormous moneys forfeited by the Exchequer. Is the Tánaiste aware how long this has been going on? Will she tell the House how much money has been lost to the Exchequer? When did she first become aware of this loophole? Is it the case that this has been going on for almost eight years? Is it the case that hundreds of millions of euro have been lost to the Exchequer? Is it the case that a number of Ministers were well aware of this for years?It was not until the whistle was blown and it was brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee that any action was taken. Will the Tánaiste explain how, having spent the last eight years rubbing shoulders with developers on every conceivable occasion, including the tent at the Galway races, Ministers could have been ignorant of this and hundred of millions could have been forgone?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I am not aware that this loophole has existed for eight years. A measure was passed last week to put this beyond doubt. It gives the Revenue Commissioners the necessary power to look again at cases that might have availed of the loophole. I became aware of this only in November of this year when the Revenue Commissioners brought it to the attention of the Minister for Finance. I was not aware that a loophole of this kind had been in existence for quite some time. I do not believe that a Deputy ever raised this in the House. We have closed off this loophole and it is right that we should have done so.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	47	It is not that this loophole might have been used – it was used extensively. On questioning the Taoiseach, he instanced one small scheme where €18 million was forgone. Deputy Perry brought it to the attention of both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. If this has been going on for seven or eight years, given the close nexus between developers – the major source of funds for Fianna Fáil – how could this not be known? Does the Tánaiste agree with me that in circumstances where capital gains tax had been cut for developers from 40% to 20%, where they engaged in excessive profit-taking beyond their wildest dreams for the past seven or eight years and where the 60% capital gains tax introduced as a penalty in the 1998 Finance Act was repealed when it came to bite, it is unreasonable to believe that this was not known in Government circles and was effectively facilitated over those years?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	48	If it has been happening for the past eight years, then Deputy Rabbitte was in Government when it started.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	52	That may well be the case. However, beneficiaries are not going to blow the whistle on themselves. There is an onus on us all when we become aware of loopholes like this to do what we can to remedy them.When he was debating the resolution, the Taoiseach said that we had become aware of one scheme where the sum of money involved was €16 million or €18 million. This is the only knowledge I have on this matter.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	55	We have put the matter right and did so as soon as it came to the Government's attention. I understand that the Revenue Commissioners brought it to the Government's attention. If the Public Accounts Committee was aware of this, it should have brought it to our attention. Perhaps the Chairman of the committee spoke to the Minister for Finance and if he did, I would welcome that. The important thing is that the loophole is closed and no one else can avail of it. No matter what tax schemes we have, we seem to have professionals in this town who know no boundaries when it comes to finding a way through the tax code with a view to creating avoidance measures.

The programme revealed the extent of the problem and exposed the fact that those accessing the sites are now being obliged to provide their own images in order to access further images from other site users. It is clear that the sexual abuse of children is driven as never before and the Internet is the engine of this vehicle.Does the Tánaiste agree that this is as serious an issue, both locally and nationally, as all of the cases revealed regarding State and religious-run institutions going back many years which have been the subject of Ms Justice Laffoy's attention? Does the Tánaiste also agree that the issue regarding State and religious-run institutions is not that the people who were trusted to operate these institutions were a group apart, but that the issue is opportunity and the Internet has provided opportunity on a scale never seen before? Is the Tánaiste concerned that the extent of this abuse was exposed by a media, rather than Garda, investigation? Does she believe the gardaí dealing with this crime are properly resourced and have the necessary strategies to address this sick pursuit? Does the Tánaiste believe we should ensure that measures, including legislation, should be explored and introduced to address this terrible scourge in our midst that threatens children throughout society?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I agree it is a very serious issue. One of the downsides of the development of modern technology is that it creates the scope for widespread abuse of this kind. In many ways, this is why these matters have to be dealt with on a more European or global level. We have strong legislation and there have been a number of Garda investigations and prosecutions in Ireland in recent times. Certainly, if there are gaps in the legislation or resource related issues to be considered, this will be done. We also have an Internet Advisory Board, which has representatives from child interests as well as gardaí and others. I have no doubt that the Government will consult the board on the issues that arise.I did not see the "Prime Time" programme but I believe it was an act of public service broadcasting. It has certainly had a major impact. If a response is required from Government by way of resources or legislation, it will certainly be forthcoming. In the main, we must consider some of these issues on a more global or European scale. I know there is much concern at European level about the matter raised by the Deputy. There has also been much co-operation in this area, which has led to successful detection and prosecution in recent times.

In light of the revelations and the concern that exists, not only in this jurisdiction but throughout the European Union and globally, as the Tánaiste rightly stated, is it not incumbent on Government to initiate a review of Garda strategies, child protection and legislation regarding the Internet? I certainly believe it is an imperative and I would appreciate if the Tánaiste would confirm the Government's intentions in this regard.Staying with the theme of the abuse of children, today is International Human Rights Day and it is also the last of the 16 Days of Action Against Violence Against Women. It must be noted that the statistics published by Women's Aid show that in 52% of cases of domestic violence, both wife and child abuse are perpetrated by the same offender. There is a great need to recognise—

I am certain that the Garda process is under constant review regarding the use of modern technology for crime. The Internet Advisory Board has issued safety guidelines and I urge parents with computers in the home to which children have access to follow them. They could be of great assistance. The same applies to others who have computers that may be accessible to children.Ultimately, it is important that we have the determination and vigour at national level and internationally through co-operation with police authorities to root out those who are making considerable sums of money abusing children. Let us face it, this is what is happening. We must all co-operate in combating the abuse of children by serious criminals.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Central Statistics Office issued the principal demographic results of the 2002 census on 19 June 2003. The report gave a breakdown of the population by age, sex, martial status, household composition, usual residence, nationality and place of birth. Information on the Irish language, religion and the Traveller community was also provided.The following are the highlights of the report. The population enumerated on census night, 28 April 2002, was 3,917,203, representing an increase of 291,116 persons, or 8%, since the previous census in April 1996. It is interesting to note that the Central Statistics Office issued further figures this morning that suggest it is most likely we now have a population of over 4 million. Six out of every ten persons lived in urban areas in 2002. Leinster continued to gain population share and there are now in excess of 2 million persons living in the province. The number of separated, including divorced, persons increased by 52%, from 87,800 in 1996 to 133,800 in 2002. As a result of declining fertility, the average number of children per family fell from 2.2 in 1986 to 1.6 in 2002. Over 400,000 foreign-born persons were usual residents in the State in April 2002 compared with 250,000 six years earlier. Increasing numbers have come from African, Asian and eastern European countries.Based on the results of the census, more persons indicated that they could speak Irish in 2002 – 1.57 million – compared with 1996 – 1.43 million. However, in percentage terms there was a slight decline from 43.5% in 1996 to 42.8% in 2002. The percentage of Roman Catholic adherents declined from 91.6% in 1991 to 88.4% in 2002. Increased immigration has contributed to rapid growth in the numbers of Muslims, Orthodox Christians and adherents to certain other minority denominations. Nearly 24,000 members of the Traveller community were enumerated in April 2002 and the census revealed that they have a much younger age profile than the population in general.All in all, the census results confirm the rapid change that is taking place in many sectors of our society and therefore they are worthy of consideration by all Members of the House.

She will be aware that one of the most remarkable statistics arising from the census is that, for the first time ever, net immigration into the State is now higher than the natural increase in population. Will the Minister join me in welcoming this development and welcoming to this country people of diverse origins? Will she also join me in welcoming the major contribution that immigrant communities make to the Irish economy? Furthermore, will she join me in urging the Government to revisit its policy on the denial of the dignity of work to many who come to our shores, including those who are either fleeing oppression in their own countries or, as is often the case, looking for a new economic opportunity? While the papers of people in both these categories are being processed, many of them are denied the dignity of work, which is a critical and fundamental human right. I would appreciate the Minister of State's support in my appeal that this be addressed.One of the most disturbing aspects of the census report statistics concerns the Traveller community. They show that Travellers over 65 years of age account for just 3.3% of the Traveller population whereas overall people over 65 account for 11.1% of the general population. The census also shows that the median age of Travellers is 18 while that pertaining to the general population is 32. This demonstrates that the birth rate among Travellers is higher than that in the general population—

Has the Government studied these statistics? What are the implications for policy on Travellers, especially the failure of many local authorities to provide an adequate and proper range of housing, accommodation and stopover options that the Traveller community desires?

A passing reference to how one feels about the statistics question is fine, but it would be unfair to expect the Minister of State to be able to deal with policy issues in every Department. I suggest that Deputies submit their questions directly to the line Minister if they have a problem with policy.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I thank the Chair for his guidance in this matter. The Deputy raised a number of issues. Regarding immigration, we all welcome the fact that so many people choose to come to Ireland and it is significant that, in recent years, Irish people who were living abroad have returned. Figures to be launched today will show that people who had to leave the country are now able to come back and get work here. That is welcome, as are those coming from a wide range of other countries and adding to the multiculturalism of our country.The Deputy asked about Travellers and it is a concern that their age profile is much younger than that of the rest of the population. Specific programmes are targeted at women's and children's health in the Traveller community and those are being extended throughout the health boards. We want to see them developed further. The birth rate in the Traveller community is higher than in other sectors of the community, which adds to their lower age profile, but the fact that they do not live as long relates to their living circumstances as well as general health issues. It is interesting to examine some of the statistics which detail where Travellers live. They show that just over 3% live in what are called communal establishments, 58.6% live in permanent accommodation, including permanent accommodation in Traveller encampments, 33.9% live in caravans and mobile homes and 7.5% did not answer the relevant questions. There is obviously much information which is useful to us in making social policy.The Deputy's other question was on housing tenure. An examination of house ownership levels over the years shows that the percentage of people renting from local authorities has gone from 9.7% in 1991 to 6.9%, while the level of house ownership in Ireland is very high compared with other countries. The census returns and statistics are extraordinarily valuable in making social policy, which is one of the reasons we have the National Statistics Board. It examines various statistics from a social perspective and not just from an economic viewpoint. The fact that we use these statistics increasingly in our policy-making is welcome.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	79	When it comes to meeting the needs of this growing, urbanised and diverse population, is an analysis being carried out of our current capacity in schools, hospitals and general medical practices to meet these changing needs? We know the population figures from the census but do we have an analysis of our capacity to meet the needs of this rapidly changing population? Housing is another aspect of this question.Perhaps the Minister of State forgot to mention that, in the census, it is clear that the population of the greater Dublin area is declining rather than growing. Perhaps she might comment on this, especially in light of the Government's announcement of a wide-ranging decentralisation programme which would have a major impact on Dublin city and the greater Dublin area. Perhaps she could indicate whether a statistical analysis has been carried out on the impact on an area of declining population of removing such a huge section of population in terms of jobs and facilities. Moving at least 10,000 jobs – with another 1,500 jobs to be announced – could have a destabilising effect on the capital city. Has any statistical analysis been done to back up that decision in terms of its impact on the city and county of Dublin?There has been a remarkable decline in our fertility rate which is plummeting and is now one of the lowest in Europe. Has any assessment of why this is happening been carried out? Is it the lack of child care or the difficulties young parents have in meeting the needs of their children, such as the pressure on them to meet exorbitant mortgage payments? Is this a matter of concern to the Government? Have ways of encouraging fertility been examined, as has been done in other countries? In Italy grants are now being given to those who have a second baby. Will we reach that point at some stage in future to ensure we have a balanced population? Is the Government not conscious of the fact that its policies impact directly on potential families and restrict the country's potential to have a truly balanced population?I warmly welcome the fact that we now have information on the Travelling community in the census, which is long overdue. In assessing the accurate picture of nomadism, our population is relatively small in comparison with other European countries, but it is important to have a true picture of nomadism. What are the Minister of State's views on whether there is further detailed information on people living in houses or permanent accommodation who still consider themselves nomadic and who act in a nomadic way at different times of the year? We are all aware of illegal encampments—

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Is an analytical understanding of the movement of Travellers at different times of the year reflected in the report?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The level of information given by the census tells us more than the population figures in each area. It also tells us the age range, the language spoken, the education needs and employment levels in each area. That in itself is useful information for Departments in determining what schools, hospitals and so on are needed. That is why the Department of the Taoiseach, the National Statistics Board and other groups are constantly examining social and economic policy and that information is used to determine what services and facilities are required throughout the State.The proportion of the population that lives in our capital city is much greater than in any other European capital and the percentage has increased exponentially. This figure should be considered in the context of the distance people must travel to work. The census contains charts, which highlight that people travel long distances to Dublin every morning to work and that is one good reason for decentralisation. Many people work in the city but live outside it and they would welcome the opportunity to work closer to where they live. That would also relieve the pressure on the Dublin area. Information about the number of people who must travel 20 miles or more to work is provided in the census and that is valuable in the context of decentralisation.One of the main reasons for the decreasing birth rate is that people are waiting until later in life to start families. Many young women have good career prospects and prefer to leave it until later. In addition, the marriage pattern is changing. Fewer people are getting married and those who get married are doing so later. There are other issues but the CSO has not specifically studied the marriage rate. The issue of child care was not raised in the census, although a number of lobby groups asked that it should be included in future censuses. That would provide useful information.This census for the first time sought information on Travellers. A new question was included and valuable information was provided. However, the census only informs us about where people were on a particular night. On the night the census was taken, County Longford had the highest proportion of Travellers at 1.8%, followed by Galway city at 1.6%, Galway county at 1.4% and Offaly at 1%. Counties Kildare, Cork and Waterford had the lowest proportion of Travellers. There is no information on how nomadic they are. However, this information can be built on for the future.

I appreciate that the Minister of State is trying to present the figures in the most upbeat way possible, but is it not the case that the CSO figures for the first quarter indicate that the number of Irish people travelling overseas has grown by 5.4% to 939,000 and that Irish tourists continue to spend more than inbound tourists –€749 million as compared to €722 million, respectively? That being so, in addition to the similar trend whereby Ireland slipped from ninth to 14th place in the Guardian-Observertravel awards on the basis of European destinations, and Dublin plummeted from 39th to 59th place as the most popular overseas city, does that not indicate a worrying trend in terms of Ireland being seen as a very high cost destination? Does it not also indicate that Irish people regard the high level of costs in Ireland as a reason for holidaying abroad? Does the Minister of State agree that this points to the need for the Government to take these figures very seriously and to take account of the fall in tourism figures for activities such as walking and hiking, which have declined, over the past ten years, from 322,000 to the current level of 241,000?

Due to the fact that they are quite separate, they are being answered separately.The figures I gave the Deputy are the last complete figures we have for 2002. He referred to figures for the second quarter of this year, which we have, indicating that, between April and June of this year, the number of Irish visits abroad was 1.323 million – an increase of 9.5% on the corresponding period last year. The number of Irish people travelling abroad on holidays is constantly growing, as is the amount of money being spent. From April to June, the net outflow was €18 million. Obviously, we are very conscious of the fact that people are travelling abroad. However, we are equally conscious of the fact that people are coming to visit this country, which I will deal with in the next question.

In the case of cross-channel travel for the third quarter of 2003, 957,000 people travelled by air and 539,000 by sea. The rest came from continental Europe or via transatlantic routes. Both of those figures were substantially higher than in the other direction. For example, the transatlantic figure was 202,000, as compared to cross-channel air travel at 957,000. Those figures are available in the tourism and travel bulletin from the CSO for the third quarter, which I can make available to the Deputy.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	113	With regard to incoming tourism, has the census evaluated the reason for the fall-off in the number of people coming specifically for walking and hiking holidays? There is a need to assess that aspect. Did the CSO investigate the reason the figures have fallen over the last ten years, from 322,000 to 241,000 in 2001? Despite that, walking tours are still worth over €144 million to the economy – more than earnings from golf, angling and cycling holidays, for example. Does the Minister of State agree there is a need to ask that question and has she any answers in that regard? Have there been any references to the change in the REP scheme, which has seen an end to the payment given to farmers to allow public access to farmland over the last two years? Will the Government consider following the approach taken by the Scottish Parliament, which has addressed this issue by preparing legislation to enable greater access to the countryside? Will the Minister of State inform the House if the CSO has looked into that situation?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The first question is in order. The second is for the line Minister.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The CSO has looked at the method of travel, reason for journey and the area of residence from which people are coming. I am aware that the tourism industry has many more details on why people are coming to visit. The Government has now spent more than ever on marketing Irish tourism with an allocation for this year of €30.4 million. There are also specific figures on sports tourism, festival and cultural events in order to market the country.The Government has also funded specific advertisements and marketing campaigns to attract the type of tourist the Deputy mentioned. For the autumn and winter marketing campaign, Tourism Ireland invested €8 million. In Germany, for example, a 50 page walking Ireland special wander magazine was printed and distributed to encourage that variety of tourist to visit.The largest factor against people travelling is not so much travelling to Ireland but travelling at all due to certain international situations. A feature now noted is that people are booking holidays later in order to travel. The Government is trying to capitalise on this. In the last number of months, overseas tourist numbers grew by over 3%. Given the international situation in the first six months of 2003, that is a positive sign. I will ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to provide more details to Deputy Sargent as to the type of marketing used for walking breaks etc. in attracting that type of visitor.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	116	Are there statistics available for people coming to Ireland for boating holidays? What has been the effect of the recent cross-Border agreement in which Waterways Ireland is now based in Enniskillen? Are there figures for before and after the agreement to see if it had an effect on the number of visitors coming for boating holidays?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I do not have that information to hand but I will check with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. It is interesting how the island of Ireland is now being marketed which is to the benefit of both North and South. Tourism Ireland's allocation is €22.8 million and it levers an additional €6.2 million from Northern Ireland. That type of cross-Border co-operation is to the benefit of the whole island.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Given that about 2 million visitors come to Ireland every year and given that it is not possible to serve a summons on anybody outside the jurisdiction who breaks the law, are there figures for visitors who were prosecuted, for say, drunk driving or other offences? These 2 million people are effectively exempt from most of our laws.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Under international recommendations, profits attributable to foreign direct investors are represented by the debit figures for the balance of payments component direct investment income on equity. This reflects the entrepreneurial income of direct investment enterprises, which is the profits earned by these enterprises inclusive of net interest and after depreciation and corporate taxes. This income is comprised of two components – distributions to investors, that is dividends paid and branch profit remittances, and reinvested earnings.The balance of payments statistics published by the CSO include details on the outflows of direct investment income on equity. The relevant figures for the years 1998 to 2002 are shown in table 1 below.Table 1: Direct Investment Income on Equity Outflows 1998-200219981999200020012002€m€m€m€m€mDirect Investment Income on Equity14,83420,43822,29825,40731,739Of which:Dividends and Distributed Branch Profits10,43711,67711,73615,03715,251Reinvested Earnings4,3978,76210,56210,37016,488From this table it can be seen that in 1998, direct investment income on equity stood at €14,834 million and rose to €31,739 million. Of this dividends and distributed profits rose from €10,437 million in 1998 to €15,251 in 2002. Reinvested earnings rose from €4,397 million in 1998 to €16,488 million in 2002.In line with international standards, royalty payments are treated as a service expenditure rather than as an income flow as was formerly the case. These payments along with other service flows are also recorded in the balance of payments statistics. Table 2 below shows the royalty outflows from Ireland for the years 1998 to 2002.Table 2: Royalty Payments Abroad 1998-200219981999200020012002€m€m€m€m€mRoyalties5,4666,8079,05110,57810,991This table shows that in 1998, royalty payments rose from €5,466 million to €10,991 million. These figures cover payments overseas by both foreign-owned enterprises operating in Ireland as well as those made by indigenous enterprises. It is not possible to distinguish the payments made by foreign-owned operations, but it is likely that they cover a very large proportion of the total.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Approximately €43,000 million in total between the dividends, branch profit repatriation and royalties is the total outflow in the economy as per the 2002 statistics. I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate that is a substantial figure. Are these statistics broken down into sectoral areas, such as multinational manufacturing companies, the Financial Services Centre, pharmaceutical and IT companies? In particular, are the figures for royalties broken down for dealers and providers of petroleum products and services, such as the oil companies. Does the Minister of State have statistics on the difference between our recorded GDP and recorded GNP? Is a correlation made for the difference between those two figures as it is high, compared to other jurisdictions? Is that impact taken into consideration? Are there statistics on how many claims have been made by companies based in other jurisdictions, particularly the United States, Germany and the Netherlands, for the repatriation of profits? Does the Minister of State have figures for settlements made by the Revenue Commissioners for such profits repatriated out of this country, which may attract lower tax rates in this country than they do in their home jurisdictions?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Deputy drew attention to the combined figure of the outflows, the direct investment income on equity and the royalties. It is equally significant to look at the reinvested earnings, which in 1998 amounted to €4.379 billion and this has now increased to €16.488 billion. The figures for merchandise and services are broken down into transport, tourism and travel, communications, insurance, financial services, computer services etc. I will make available to the Deputy the table on balance of payments current account and IIP.

Many of these groups are increasingly stuck and are unable to move out of their poverty. This House must debate the failure of Government policy in this area.

For instance in Vote 19, the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the main subheads are commissions and special inquiries, criminal legal aid and the Criminal Assets Bureau. In view of the work being undertaken by, for example, the CAB would it not be important for the House to be informed as to what moneys from the surplus appropriations-in-aid are being channelled into facilities and resources? What are the commissions and special inquiries in question?

I am asking whether a specific item is included in the €65 million allocation I am requested to approve.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Perhaps the Deputy will listen for one second. At this point in time we are debating whether Nos. 14, 15 and 15a be agreed without debate. A brief comment from the Deputy is acceptable, but we cannot have a debate on any Estimate. If that were the case, every Member would feel he or she could debate anything arising from the Estimates.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	169	If any Member so chose, I would not object.If whoever is operating the microphones would afford me the chance to continue by switching mine back on, I would appreciate it. The co-ordination between the Chair and other aspects of the House is unbelievable at times.Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will also rule my next comment out of order. Provision of €62.5 million is made under Vote 33 – Health and Children. Does this include provision for the self-assessed performance payments to chief executive officers and other senior managerial staff in the health services?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	170	We cannot debate this.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The Deputy should show some respect for the Chair.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I must put the question.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	177	This item is to be taken without debate. Deputies will have an opportunity to provide their judgment on it shortly.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	178	The proposal for No. 15 states the committee is to report back to Dáil Éireann within three months on specific elements. I have just outlined what happens when committees report back to the House. Will this Chamber have the opportunity to discuss fully and debate the report of the committee on the Barron report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The Estimates have all been discussed in committee and are now back.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Are there reports from the committees?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I understand parties have received the reports. I have details of the main specifics. The Department of Health and Children Vote report discusses the general medical scheme, dental treatment and the SARS outbreak. The report on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform Vote refers to the International Monitoring Commission, the Criminal Assets Bureau, to which Deputy Kenny referred, criminal legal aid and commissions and special inquiries. I am not certain what those special inquiries are. I can check to see whether they are tribunals of inquiry or not.The Vote for higher education is reduced by €12 million. The Residential Institutions Redress Board is also covered. We are switching savings to areas in which there are shortfalls. One such area was student grants, a second was the civil redress board and a third was the European Social Fund allocation, which was the highest amount at €17 million.The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights is meeting in private session at 2 p.m. today to decide how and when to put the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings into the public domain. I thank Mr. Justice Barron and his group on behalf of the Government and the House for their extensive work. I have no doubt the report will be debated in the House in the new year. In the meantime, it would be wise to debate the matter at the committee and for everybody to read Mr. Justice Barron's long report. While it is obviously a matter for the committee, I understand it intends to publish the report this afternoon.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 14, 15 and 15a without debate, agreed to? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 4 agreed to?
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	183	This proposal will guillotine debate on the Social Welfare Bill. The proposed allocation of time will provide the Labour Party with three speaking slots. Many Labour Members, as well as Deputies from other parties on this side of the House, wish to speak on the Bill, in which there is wide interest. The 20 minute speaking slots will allow each speaker 75 seconds to discuss each cut in the social welfare code. The House has a duty to provide proper scrutiny and accountability in respect of this type of Bill. We should not simply provide enough time for soundbites on a Bill of this nature. My party opposes the guillotine.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	184	While I acknowledge the widespread interest in the Bill's contents and the need to allow more people to contribute to the debate, a motion has been tabled to the effect that Second Stage should not be read. If there is a vote on the Second Reading of the Bill at 7 p.m., which is likely, a division will eat into Private Members' time. I would like the Tánaiste and the Chief Whip to assure me that the full 90 minutes of Private Members' time will directly follow a division.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	185	Like other Deputies, I object to the guillotine to be applied to the Social Welfare Bill, which is an important matter at this time. The Bill follows both the savage social welfare cutbacks which were imposed before the budget and the measures contained in the budget itself. The Government's proposal means that just two of my colleagues will be able to intervene in the debate and will have to do so in a limited manner. This is not adequate. My party objects to this proposition and refuses to approve it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I must put the question.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	188	There is no provision in Standing Orders to address the matter.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I am not in a position to accede to the Deputy's request. We have already agreed that the House will sit until 10.30 p.m. A substantial number of amendments have been tabled on Report Stage of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. Any extra time allocated for Private Members' time would eat into that.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I cite the precedent set last week during Private Members' time. After the Government mixed up its times, it reordered business the following day. I ask that the same precedent be followed today.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	191	That is only fair.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	194	On a point of order, I support Deputy Boyle's position. We have established a precedent whereby provision for extra time is made where a division erodes Private Members' time, especially when the House is sitting outside normal sitting hours.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The Government could arrange a vote every Wednesday.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	196	This is very bad.

Agreed.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I realise this is a little tenuous, but there is a Bill to deal with diplomatic immunity and diplomatic relations on the Order Paper. Could some opportunity be found before we go into the recess to make a statement on, or inform the House of, the situation regarding an Irish citizen in Iran who has been kidnapped, apparently for ransom? Some opportunity should be found to address the matter in the House.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I suggest that the Deputy find another way of raising the matter.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I tabled a special notice question yesterday. The issue should be addressed in the House.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	204	It is good to see the Christmas spirit breaking out. I would like to ask the Tánaiste about the health service executive announced by the Minister, which appears not even to have met yet. What is happening on the reforms in the health service? Is the Tánaiste able to tell us when the health service executive will be put on a statutory footing and when it will meet?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The Minister has already said the legislation will take effect from January 2005.

It relates to the Prison Service Bill. Will the Bill be delayed because people are being moved from Clondalkin to Longford?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	209	There is no time to make a statement. We will get an answer from the Tánaiste on the Prison Service Bill.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I share a constituency with Deputy Gogarty, and it is good that we are decentralising the Prison Service from Clondalkin. It is not possible to state when we will have the Bill.

The Chair is obliged to implement Standing Order 26 and does not have a choice on the matter. It is a matter for the Dáil reform committee to change the Standing Order if that is its desire.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I mentioned last night that one of the priorities of the Government had been to focus social welfare increases on the elderly. I referred to the increase in old age pensions and the pre-1953 provision.Another target area of the Government is the support it provides for families. The support it has provided through child benefit has been extremely important. Child benefit rates will increase by €6 per month for the first and second children and €8 for third and subsequent children. Those increases have been priorities for the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration and mean that, following budget 2004, child benefit will now be payable at a rate of €131.60 for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third and subsequent children. This is important support for families.I welcome the support given by the family income supplement. The improvement in the thresholds has been important and will provide additional support for families. Every year I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the child dependant allowance has, yet again, not been increased. It is an area in which we are remiss by not making supports available to that area of the social welfare code.The support for family resource centres, the work of some I am aware of, has been beneficial and I welcome the allocation of €1.17 million in the budget for these centres as well as the support for the MABS of €1.01 million. Comhairle has been doing good work – perhaps in some ways doing us out of a job, although that is probably no harm. People can now go to an independent, objective group to get advice on their entitlements. While the Opposition can rant and complain about what the Government has done, the provisions in the Bill and the budget will make a significant improvement in the lives of those who are primarily dependent on social welfare provision. Some of the ESRI research which was published today verifies that.

It demonstrates a strategy for the future in terms of social welfare and those in receipt of the various benefits included in the Bill and operated by the Department. The Minister's performance since the budget was announced has been excellent in view of the Opposition coming forward with criticism of her work. I also compliment the Department officials.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	277	It is about money.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	278	She performed extremely well on the programme and I wish her well in her Department. If there is any Department that deserves credit, it is the Department of Social and Family Affairs because of its proactive approach to dealing with issues raised with it. Regardless of whether it is in reply to parliamentary questions or letters from Deputies, or queries from members of the public, the response time is extremely efficient. The details supplied in replies to parliamentary questions or queries from consumers are excellent. Other Departments could learn a great deal from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.I encourage the Minister to continue to explore ways of getting the message directly to those who benefit in some way from the Department's services. This is an excellent way to do business. It allows Members to escape from the parish pump aspect of their work and, as per the wishes of members of the public, focus on the legislative aspect.There are a number of issues within the Department which need to be addressed. The first of these is the appeals system. I compliment the Department, and I do not want what I am about to say to appear negative, but the matter I wish to raise needs to be addressed. Appeals mechanisms exist in respect of most of the benefit schemes but the system by which these are administered is inefficient. Where a claim is made and it is stopped or an appeal commenced, the manner in which the process thereafter is conducted leaves much to be desired. The system should be more efficient and it should not be necessary to have a number of appeals in respect of one applicant. The consultants' reports regarding some aspects of the appeals system should be considered and taken on board.I have been approached by a number of constituents who were called to appeal hearings, who were only seen for two or three minutes or asked questions which did not relate to the benefit they were receiving or their condition, and were then asked to leave. These people cannot understand how someone can make an assessment of their condition or position based on that sort of interview process. People who are elderly or infirm find it extremely difficult to deal with the appeals system. That system should be assessed in the context of its efficiency and the methodologies applied by those who are involved in administering it. If this was done, the Department would save money and would be able to deal more efficiently with members of the public.With regard to the increases that have been provided, it is difficult to understand that, while social welfare benefits can be increased each year – the Government is to be complimented on the substantial year-on-year increases people have received since 1997 – when recipients are assessed in terms of their local authority rents, these increases are clawed back from them. In recent years local authorities have become particularly mean in terms of the way they deal with rent assessments. They have taken more money in differential rents from people who perhaps had not been assessed for a number of years, who were then assessed and found that all the increases they had received were taken from them. The rent charged to the people to whom I refer has been increased to a level beyond that which they can afford. When they are obliged to make their case to their local authorities, these people must go to extreme ends to prove that they are enduring hardship. I know many proud, elderly people who find it difficult to make a case, particularly in light of the approach taken by local authorities.Some arrangement must be made between the Department and local authorities to ensure that fair play is achieved. Local authorities must strike fair rents but I do not believe that the way they do so is correct. Many elderly people and other individuals who are in receipt of benefits cannot afford to pay the rents being charged by their local authorities. They have come to me in large numbers to complain. I ask that the Department liaise more closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to develop a fairer mechanism to deal, in particular, with the elderly. Policies are poverty-proofed and they must also be proofed to take account of the elderly. If there should be any bias in Government policy, it should be towards the elderly. The Minister has been proactive in this area. However, her Department could deal with it in a constructive and fair way with local government to ensure fairer play for the elderly.Every year local authorities engage in arguments about the payment of refuse collection charges. People in my constituency are being asked to pay in excess of €400 by Kilkenny County Council. The elderly continually make the simple and accurate case that they do not produce enough waste to warrant putting out their bins and that each week they put out plastic bags that are only half full of rubbish. However, they are being asked to pay a substantial amount out of their incomes to cover refuse charges. Some local authorities have introduced tag-a-bag schemes – Kilkenny Borough Council will do this in the current year – under which elderly people can fill bags with rubbish, put them out when they like and are only charged €5. This drastically reduces the amount elderly people are obliged to pay in refuse charges. All local authorities should introduce schemes of this sort.The Department of Social and Family Affairs can provide a lead in terms of how the elderly should be treated by encouraging the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure, by regulation if necessary, that refuse collection rates throughout the country are structured in such a way that the elderly and those on long-term benefits are given reductions – every euro taken from these people in charges has a major effect on their living standards and their ability to meet their needs. People are entitled to claim back refuse collection charges on their taxes, but a recent report indicates that they do not do so. Those who are on benefit cannot do so because they do not pay tax. We must ensure that reductions are factored in which will cater for the elderly and the vulnerable. If we are correct in our dealings with those who are dispossessed or marginalised, it will be a sign that our society is truly maturing. We should consider this issue in the latter context. However, I accept that the co-operation of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is required and I encourage the Minister to seek it.I compliment MABS, which is an extremely good organisation, on its work. The work the service does in my constituency is outstanding. It has taken individual cases and structured the outgoings in terms of families' incomes. It enjoys a huge success rate. The Minister, within her Department, has set aside €1.1 million for MABS this year. We should provide whatever increased financial support we can to MABS to allow it to extend its service.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance have, in the Social Welfare Bill and the budget, thrown away an opportunity at a time of prosperity to reform the tax and social welfare system significantly. Their failure to reform tax and social welfare to benefit people on low income will cost the economy and employers dearly. It will also cost the economy in terms of opportunity. The budget for 2004 is a recipe for the return of the black economy which plagued us during the 1970s and 1980s. It is a landmark in the return of tax and social welfare traps for those on the lowest incomes.The Minister for Social and Family Affairs and her colleague, the Minister for Finance, have authorised and endorsed five traps which will be cruel barriers to families on low incomes. The first is the PRSI trap where a person earning more than €287 a week, not a significant wage, immediately finds himself or herself having to pay PRSI at 4% on income above €127. The second is the health levy trap where a person earning more than €356 a week will have to pay a health levy of 2% with no tangible return for the individual, many of whom would like to know where the money is going. The third is the medical card trap. Failure to increase the threshold for medical cards means people on low incomes no longer qualify for a medical card. Workers with an asthmatic child will have to choose between earning extra income and attending their family doctor. The cost of attending a doctor in the Dublin area plus the cost of the medicine prescribed often comes to €70 which, for a low income family, could be up to 30% of their week's income. That is a shame.The fourth is the rent allowance versus the family income supplement trap. The Minister speaks a great deal about FIS but does little to reform it.

They will have to pay tax at 42% plus, 4% PRSI, 2% health levy and 10.75% employers' contribution. That is an effective tax rate. It means this budget is the greatest incentive for the return of the black economy and for under-the-counter payments. Contrast that to the benefit to investors in car parks of €100,000 of tax saved per year, more than three times the average industrial wage. The Government has a policy of redistributing income upwards to the wealthy and the well-off. Once again, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has shown that it prefers to give tax breaks to the wealthy while ordinary workers and their families face stealth taxes, traps as I outlined and ever rising price increases.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The nub of the issue in this budget is, as referred to by my colleague, Deputy Burton, the growth of relative and persistent poverty despite our wealth. We are the third highest in the OECD in terms of income per head of gross domestic product, yet we are the second most unequal country in the OECD in terms of measurement. That is, essentially, what is wrong with this country and this and previous budgets.We are witnessing a growing inequality in terms of relative poverty between the better-off and the less well-off. The argument was made that the rising tide lifts all boats. It does not lift those on the rocky shore. The Bill and the budget put many people who thought they were rising with the tide back on the rocky shore.Deputy Burton referred to poverty traps. I would like to develop that point and to refer to specific areas. People hoping for the opportunity to get out of the poverty trap are being thrown back into it. That is the terrible shame of missed opportunities. The economy had begun to turn the tide long before the two parties in Government took office. The foundations for that turn were laid when the Labour Party was in Government. We share some credit in that regard.We have become a richer country; nobody denies that. However, relative poverty has increased. We have become a country more divided in prosperity. It gave us the opportunity to narrow those gaps and to rid ourselves of the type of poverty witnessed in the "Prime Time" programme shown two weeks ago on television. Young people were indulging in crime against their own communities. I have witnessed sheer poverty in my constituency. I am sure other Deputies have witnessed it in their constituencies. That is the nub of the issue and the Government must address it.The threshold for medical cards is not being increased. An increase in one's social welfare payment can result in one being denied a medical card. The suggestion is that this does not happen but, in reality, it does. The Bill provides for a 20 cent a day increase in the family allowance. That allowance would have been increased by €24 a month if the Government had honoured its commitment in this regard.Regarding the 16 savage cuts referred to by other speakers, some of them will result in people losing opportunities they might otherwise have retained. Last week, the Minister said changes were being made in the back to education allowance because people from other EU countries were sponging off our system. I tabled a parliamentary question in this regard. There are 7,498 participants in the scheme but we only have information, in terms of nationality, for 5,273 of them.Only 9% of people on the back to education allowance are from other EU states. In order to make savings in this area, the Minister is denying those without a good level of education the opportunity to get further education. It is well known in education that people move from state to state – many Irish people go outside Ireland to be educated at third level and benefit from rights in other EU states. This is a small comeback, yet the Minister has denied the unemployed and lone parents the opportunity to go back to education. Surely education is the greatest opportunity people can have to move from poverty to a decent income.The Minister previously indicated that she intended to expand the school meals programme. While it was referred to in the budget, I have not seen anything in the Bill that shows how the Minister might fulfil her commitments. This scheme is beneficial to children in poverty.There is no increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. This is something that impacts on poor families at the start of the school year when expenses are high. The level is currently €80 for primary students and €150 for second level students. To be able to meet incurred costs, it would need to be €140 for primary students and €220 for second level students. Yet again, parents are to be faced with worrying about how they will pay for the back to school needs of their children.Deputy McGuinness correctly said that local authority rents will claw back the social welfare increases but he failed to mention that increases in the cost of ESB, gas, television licences and telephone bills etc., and general increases in the cost of basic foods, will do likewise. Low income families will not benefit greatly from the miserly increases contained in the Bill.The Minister has announced changes to the rent allowance regime. I cannot understand how people will find the money for the first six months and then need the allowance after this time has elapsed. I think of people living in packed family homes where the only option is for a member of the family, such as a daughter with a child, to leave home and seek a rent allowance. How is she supposed to find the money for a deposit and then pay the large rents now common in the private sector without access to a rent allowance? Can the Minister explain this? I do not understand how people are supposed to find the money. If they have managed to scrape together the money for the first six months – in some cases they may have to borrow from illegal moneylenders – are they then to be asked why they need rent allowance if they survived without it? These are the questions people are asking, but they do not get answers because local authority accommodation is not available for many of them. They are stuck in a trap from which they do not know how to escape. People have been in tears when talking to me about some of these issues.An announcement was made that the rent allowance is to be capped. although exceptions can be made. What happens to a person on a housing list living in a private rented house but who is forced to move out as the rent is above the limit allowable based on the size of their family? They will not be able to find anything in the private sector as many landlords do not accept this allowance. I know of someone who had to move into a psychiatric hospital this week as she had been forced to move out of her house when she exceeded the limit for rent allowance. While this was not the only reason it was one of the factors. This is a real issue and the Government needs to listen to the kind of person I am talking about. It might then see that it has created problems for people who were just about managing until now. They may have been thinking about going back to education, getting a rent allowance and hoping to get a local authority house in the near future. They do not know what to do now.While the diet supplement will not be withdrawn from those already in receipt of it, families are concerned they will not get the supplement if they have a celiac or diabetic child. This may also affect those suffering from cancer and other serious illnesses, as I know of dieticians recommending high protein food for them. Surely the professional word of the dietician is enough to say that someone should have a diet supplement. Until now, people who found they were suffering from a disease would have their dietician sign their form in order to get dietary allowance. It seems from what the Minister has said that even the professional word of a dietician will no longer be enough.

There is a great deal of concern on this issue.These are the traps that politicians are hearing about from the public. In a time of plenty, the Government should identify these issues and address them to help those living in relative poverty rather than closing perceived loopholes that may be abused by only a small fraction of people. The Department should catch those that are abusing the system and prevent them from doing so. If a flood of people were to come from other EU countries and take up a large percentage of the back to education allowance, then I would accept that the Minister would have to look at the issue again. The Minister is closing opportunities for people in poverty because a small number are getting things to which they are not entitled. The attitude should be the other way around. We should be trying to take people out of poverty and bring them into opportunity. This is how problems of exclusion are addressed.There is a need to be more creative and positive in using the social welfare system. Education provides one of the biggest opportunities to allow people to take these chances. I am disappointed that the back to education allowance has been attacked in this way.Several people have referred to community employment schemes as being connected to this, even though they are not contained in the Bill. The cuts in such schemes, and the cuts contained in the Bill are combining to have an effect on disadvantaged communities, making them feel that despite all the riches available in this country, their needs are not being fulfilled. I received a letter from a nun in County Limerick asking me to vote in favour of last week's Labour Party motion on community employment schemes. The writer opens by saying that she wishes to support the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, in his efforts to secure extra funding for community employment schemes. She then outlines the positive aspects of the scheme and asks me to support Deputy Fahey's motion.

#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I compliment the Minister on a caring budget, which will give 970,000 people who claim benefit a total of €11.2 billion. Given that she, like me, is from a county where we can see the benefits increases bring to the young, old and disabled, it is fitting that she should introduce this Bill, which implements the brilliant budgetary provisions for the less well off. The people are happy with her despite the prophets of doom and gloom in the Opposition benches – I see that they have left the Chamber. People have not forgotten the paltry increases made by the Labour Party when it was last in Government as part of the rainbow coalition.I will not mention all the increases individually but I must mention the increase of €11.50 per week given to widows and widowers over 65 years of age on contributory pensions. This will bring them into line with the main pension rate. There was an anomaly in this area and I am glad the Minister has rectified it.The abolition of the supplement paid by some health boards to persons who had made arrangements for debt settlement with creditors through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service has attracted comment. I know the Minister was concerned that this supplement operated in an ad hocmanner in some health boards only, and no matter how good the intention behind it, she could allow it to operate, in effect, as a supplement delivered to creditors. It is certainly the case that people need assistance to get out of debt. The abolition of the MABS supplement makes a clear statement that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is not the most appropriate vehicle of delivery of this support. I am happy the Minister regards MABS as the best vehicle and it is telling that she increased funding for the service by €960,000 over and above the increase in the Estimates. This means the total allocation to the MABS will be over €1.5 million in excess of the 2003 allocation.The previous Minister established the Family Support Agency to support families, promote continuity and stability in family life, prevent marital breakdown and foster a supportive community environment for families at local level. The Minister has allocated additional funding of €1.69 million to the agency to establish new family mediation service offices in the northwest and midland regions. This is in pursuance of the Government's long-standing commitment to establish a nation-wide family mediation service. We have this service in Mayo and I am familiar with its tremendous work. I compliment the Minister on extending it.Additional moneys have also been allocated to the agency to provide additional funding to organisations providing marriage and family counselling services to facilitate the provision of an accessible nation-wide counselling service provided by voluntary and community organisations. Moreover, funding has been provided to expand the family resource centre programme towards the Government target of 100 centres throughout the country and roll out an evaluation model for family resource centres.The Minister has done a lot in this budget and I have no doubt that when we leave Government in 2007 she will be regarded as having been one of the most successful Ministers for Social and Family Affairs.

#OllieWilkinsonFF	unknown-#OllieWilkinsonFF-party	unknown-#OllieWilkinsonFF-dob	unknown-#OllieWilkinsonFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I, too, am delighted to have the chance to say a few words on the budget. There is no doubt that the increases in social welfare in the budget are deeply appreciated across the country. I listened with amazement to the statements made a few moments ago by the Labour Party Deputies and am appalled at the negativity coming from that quarter. One would think Ireland was a Third World country rather than one with a proud position in Europe, which it has.Deputy Burton stated poverty was the cause of crime. We have seen recently that some of the major crime bosses in Ireland are anything but poor. The amount of wealth they possess is unbelievable.The social welfare improvements in the budget will cost €630 million for a full year. This contrasts starkly with the equivalent provision in the budget of the rainbow Government in 1997. Labour Party Deputies quoted figures from 2001. Let us go back a little further to 1997, when €273 million was spent. It is pointless to try make a case that circumstances have not improved because there have been amazing improvements. As a result, increases for those dependent on social welfare are payable more than five months earlier than when the rainbow Government was in power. For every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2004, almost €1 will go to social welfare recipients.An estimated 970,000 people are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year. This is an amazing sum to try find in Ireland and it is a great credit to the Minister that she has managed to obtain so much and distribute it as fairly as she has done.I remember well the dole queues in my area of west Waterford prior to 1997. Furthermore, I remember being asked to see if I could get a shelter erected along the main street to protect those queuing for social welfare payments. Today there are no queues. I will not say that the office outside which people were queuing is redundant, but it is gratifying to see the changes that have been made.The number of people at work in Ireland has increased to almost 1.8 million. Well over 95% of all eligible working people have jobs. While other figures will be quoted and while other comparisons will be made, this figure is important. It is wonderful to consider that the young can complete their education and be guaranteed a job in Ireland given that only a short ago, unemployment rates stood at between 10% and 15%.I am delighted with the budget and its increases, and I am particularly pleased that old age pensioners are being looked after and respected. They built this country and reared their families in difficult times with very little luxury or grandeur. Today, in a more affluent Ireland, it is a good sign that the Government is looking after them.I appreciate the scale of child benefit increases under Fianna Fáil in Government. It is worth emphasising that when Fianna Fáil returned to Government in 1997, child benefit was payable at the rate of €38.09 per month for the first and second children, and at €49 for the third and subsequent children. The priority Fianna Fáil has attached to child benefit means that, following budget 2004, it will be payable at the rates of €130 per month for the first and second children and at €165 per month for the third and subsequent children. That is a tremendous improvement.Fianna Fáil does not have great experience of being in Opposition but I understand what the Opposition must do. Trying to give the impression that there has not been a dramatic improvement and that the Government is not spreading money as best it can is quite wrong. I compliment the Minister and I agree with what my colleagues have said. I am delighted the underprivileged, and old age pensioners in particular, are being looked after so well.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I commend the Minister on securing such an increase in her budget for 2004. As Minister in one of the Departments which is obliged to look after the less well off in society she has proved herself more than capable of fighting her corner in Cabinet. At a time of year when the finances look a little fraught, I commend her on securing the Christmas bonuses at a level which every social welfare recipient will be proud of. On top of that, she secured improvements in this year's budget to the tune of €630 million, an increase of over €100 million on last year's budget increases.At a time when the Government is spending over €11 billion per year on social welfare, there is an onus on the Minister and her Department to ensure the taxpayer, who is paying for all of this, is getting value for money. The Minister and her officials should look at social welfare schemes with a view to refocusing, updating and, where necessary, reforming them. Schemes were introduced in the early to mid-1980s, when we had unemployment levels of 15% to 16%, with the long-term unemployed in mind. Now we have unemployment levels of 4.3% to 4.4% and we should focus our social welfare schemes on the basis of those levels. In doing so, various Ministers of Social Welfare have succeeded in refocusing and remoulding schemes for social welfare recipients.This Government more than any other is a caring Government and it realises the difficulties social welfare recipients face, particularly the elderly, widows, widowers and dependants of single parent families. It is not easy to have a growing economy in which there seems to be a lot of wealth when there is also a section of society which is totally dependent on the State for weekly payments.The €630 million found by the Government for social welfare increases will be put to good use. However, we have an obligation to our entire society to ensure every opportunity is given to those individuals and families who are unfortunately not unable to support themselves to the level they would like. We have an obligation to continue to support them in any way possible.The family income supplement threshold has been increased by €28 per week and that is very welcome, as it will help those on lower incomes. Thankfully we have far fewer people totally dependent on social welfare payments now than in the past 20 years, with significant progress being made in this regard. The increases granted to all social welfare recipients are very positive and the Government's commitment to ensuring that payments of €200 per week will be guaranteed in three years' time is well on the way to being secured.Budget changes in 2002 meant that all social welfare recipients would receive their payments on 1 January, which was a very positive move. Years ago, when the Minister for Finance announced social welfare increases, there was a feeling among recipients that while that was great, they would not see those increases until March or April, with some increases not being introduced until July. Now when social welfare recipients hear the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement they are pleased that the increases being announced are effective almost immediately. The 1 January payment date announced for this year was good for all recipients.The Minister can be proud of her achievements to date, particularly on behalf of large families with schoolgoing children. Until now they have felt the brunt of price increases, which have been a problem with higher inflation due to our improved economic circumstances. The real increases these families will see will assist them in their daily lives. The Minister could look at school meals, though Governments have been reluctant to focus too much attention on this area, as there are schoolchildren who are falling through the net when it comes to nutrition. They are not getting proper meals during the day because while they are getting lunch money. They are having crisps, sweets and minerals and they are not having balanced meals. The Minister may look at this in the future.The disabled person's grant should also be examined. This grant was very successful when it was first introduced and has become very popular but the difficulty is that there is insufficient funding available for it. I accept that part of the difficulty is that local authorities are not providing sufficient funding for this in their estimates and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must provide matching funds. In many cases local authorities, for one reason or another, are reluctant to put the required amount of funding into this area. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has some responsibility for this area and perhaps something could be done in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.A big difficulty for local authorities is the provision of sufficient housing for those on our housing lists. Those lists are growing because of the high cost of new houses and because local authorities are not in a position to supply the amount of housing necessary to clear the housing lists. Another problem is that local authorities must often provide two houses for families. The social climate is changing and unfortunately we have many more family separations than previously. We now have a situation where some children of large families stay with the father and some with the mother. Local authorities are now obliged in many cases to provide a second home for a single family. This is unfortunate. While blame cannot be apportioned in many cases, it is also unfortunate for other families on the waiting lists who cannot be rehoused by their local authority.I commend the Minister on her work and on how strongly she defends her position when challenged.

While conditions have improved for many people, one factor remains the same. Hundreds of thousands of people on the margins of our society are still subject to the daily grind of trying to survive on low incomes, whether that is through social welfare or appalling wages doled out by many employers.Much has been made of the increases granted to social welfare recipients. I refer to the one parent family allowance. A young mother and child are in receipt of €144 per week and will receive an increase of €10 per week in the new year. Yesterday, all Members received a form to claim their overnight allowance.

Our overnight allowance has almost the same value as the allowance for a single mother with one child. How can a Government or system justify that? The old age non-contributory pension will also increase by €10 per week. Most Members will be inundated with telephone calls from pensioners because local authorities will increase rents, which will eat into their increase.Something else remains unchanged in that right wing parties, which are upright and strict in the manner in which they regulate the incomes of working class people, are as generous and accommodating to their wealthy friends as they were in the good old days of the 1980s. We were reminded of them on Monday when former Minister Ray Burke resurfaced in regard to his activities on their behalf while he was a member of a previous Fianna Fáil Government. It should not be forgotten that he has applied for free legal aid.

Most people fell for this and voted for the three parties that oversaw the cutbacks in the 1980s without knowing that, while they were counting each penny, practically every member of what we might be termed "the misruling class" was committing tax fraud on a massive scale.While people were dying because of the lack of hospital places, the great and the good were transfering hundreds of millions of pounds into illegal offshore bank accounts. However, they were not content with this and those who were part of the golden circle also enriched themselves through land speculation. These people now wring their hands and wonder why large parts of Dublin and other major urban areas are afflicted by major social problems. One of the reasons is that when many of the sprawling housing estates of Dublin were under construction the only consideration was who owned the land. Proper roads, public transport and other amenities were of no consequence compared to the most important issue, namely, who was prepared to hand over the brown paper bags.Land was not the only commodity those in power sold at the expense of the people they were supposed to represent. Our natural resources were handed over to multinationals with no benefit accruing to the State or its citizens. That demands as much explanation as the issues before the tribunals. Who decided that the massive potential wealth that lay beneath the Irish Sea should have been given away and why did they do so? Perhaps there is a completely innocent explanation or perhaps Ray Burke was caught on a day he was in a generous mood.

Minor changes in social welfare or cutbacks such as that applied to the back to education grant are justified in the name of preventing fraud, while the abuses I mentioned have been tolerated for decades and the same people are still given favoured treatment by their friends in power.Anyone who doubts this need only consider the recent handout given to the Punchestown event centre. This should be contrasted with the miserly attitude displayed by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to clubs seeking small amounts under the sports capital grant programme. Clubs in Tralee, for example, are attempting to provide vital amenities for young people in areas designated under the RAPID programme. The three most populated parts of Tralee contain working class estates. They are the Shanakill-Monavalley-Rathoonane area, which comprises more than 300 houses and in which most of the population is aged under 35; the Spa Road-Balloonagh estate, another massive housing estate; and the Mitchels' area. None of the clubs in these areas received a copper under the sports capital grant programme while golf clubs, rowing clubs and so forth were awarded generous grants.It would be better to spend the money allocated for the Punchestown event centre on providing facilities that will give young people with an opportunity to develop their talents and personalities, rather than as a gift to those who do not need it. The same people lecture working class people about not helping themselves but they are only too happy, as always, to take whatever they can in hand outs and tax breaks.As other Members have pointed out, most of those in receipt of social welfare are not part of the labour force. It is not an issue that they should be supported by the rest of us, except among the more extreme elements of the right. Others receive social welfare because they are unemployed. In most cases this is temporary but, nonetheless, people are entitled to adequate provision until they find work because they do not become unemployed of their own accord.

If we have failed in terms of the monetary benefit to social welfare recipients and those on the threshold of receiving benefits, we have failed utterly to address honestly the issues that affect the less well off in society. During the year, there are many debates on important social issues such as crime, education and health. These social and economic areas of Government do not come under the Minister's control but, nevertheless, they are important.Three significant reports on the health service have been produced by Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly and health is probably the most frequently debated issue in the House. While the debates highlight issues, nothing has happened. Perhaps we can look forward to changes in the health service in 2004.Great play has been made on the increases in social welfare benefits but the medical card issue will not go away. I am surprised the Government has no great interest in tackling this issue. At the height of the Celtic tiger boom, 34% of the population had a medical card. If the over 70s are excluded, approximately 26% of the population is entitled to a medical card this year. A medical card is vital as it covers an individual's GP fees, medication costs and hospital care. It is vitally important to those on the threshold of social welfare benefits. A number of social welfare recipients may exceed the limit for eligibility for a medical card following the budget increases. That is a greater issue than the granting of increases of €5 or €10 per week.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Over the past number of years, the Government has considered carefully the whole area of child care. The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In that context, it has been decided that, as a matter of policy, child benefit will be the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status.In line with this policy approach, the Government commenced a major initiative to substantially increase the rates of child benefit. In 2001, the rate for the first and second child was increased by almost €32 per month and by €38 per month for the third and subsequent children. This represented an increase of over 50% on the rates prevailing in 2000. Similar monetary increases were provided in 2002. Further increases were implemented in 2003 and in my recent budget I announced additional increases of €6 and €8 per month, respectively, in 2004, which are approximately double the projected inflation rate for next year. All this means that, since 1997, the child benefit rates have increased by over 230%, compared to a projected increase in inflation of only 28% over the period 1997 to 2004.My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy on child care The supply of formal child care places is being supported through a programme of investment under the national development plan equal opportunities child care programme, with funding of almost €437 million being provided. The purpose of this capital and staffing support funding is to provide almost 27,000 new child care places and to support existing places. I am satisfied the Government is providing substantial support to parents to assist them in meeting child care costs and also acting to increase the overall supply of child care places.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Is the Minister living in a very different area from the one in which I live? I know of parents who go out to work on the basis of an income of approximately €500 per week. Having paid for their child care, their tax and their share of the mortgage, they are left with approximately €70. That provides no incentive. I know it is the Minister's wish that people should have the choice of going out to work. However, if one is paying €200 per week for child care, which is the current rate, one would need a pre-tax income of €19,000 to afford that.Against that level of costs, the Minister has said he will give a child benefit of €30 and mortgage relief, which is currently only €10 per week. Does he regard that as a realistic level of support to families who are going through their very difficult formative years? Will he accept that we need to offer more financial support to those families and to develop a proper child care infrastructure suited to a modern economy which is now one of the richest in Europe? Does he agree that we are failing either to make it affordable or to develop the necessary supply network?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Prior to the budget of 2001, all those matters were considered at length by the Government over the preceding three years. In particular, that included tax incentives, allowances and benefits in a wide variety of areas. The debate went hither and thither and the Government ultimately decided to follow the universal child benefit approach, while also increasing child care places. After considerable debate over the years preceding that decision and having considered all relevant factors, the Government took the view that the route I have just outlined was the most equitable one. That is the reason we announced the considerable increases in child benefit payments at that stage.As I pointed out to the Deputy, child benefit will have increased by over 230% from 1997 to 2004, as against a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 27%. That is a fairly dramatic increase for that period. At the same time, in the equal opportunities area of the last development programme, we decided to make money available to increase child care places. Other changes in the tax code have also helped. The matter was fully considered by the Government and it decided to go down the universal child benefit route.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18532	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Will the Minister shed some light on those recent figures because under freedom of information legislation, we will not now be able to see the debate that took place on the matter? Will the Minister agree with me that all the research in this area has shown that the zero to five years old age bracket is the most difficult for a family? In that period costs are at their highest, children are least able to provide for themselves, there is no primary school support, no capitation and no structured support from the State in the area of child care. Will the Minister set out why children in those early years, and their families who are paying expensive mortgages, are not justified in getting additional support?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	346	There was a considerable debate that ranged over wide areas in the three years leading up to that decision. The Deputy will recall there was also a debate on the tax proposal in a particular budget that brought into play the issue of people who make the lifestyle choice not to get paid employment and stay at home. It was decided that the best route was universal child benefit. Universal child benefit with increases is more expensive than the alternatives. It was more expensive than the taxation route because that would have only benefited those in paid employment. Instead, the Government chose the most expensive route. There was a system of universal child benefit and for the reasons outlined at that time, it was chosen.

The purpose of these meetings is to discuss issues concerning possible tax evasion involving the use of offshore accounts in subsidiaries of financial institutions and possible co-operation by the institutions with Revenue inquiries into this matter. To date, meetings have been held with five institutions and more are planned. It is expected that meetings will have taken place with all relevant institutions before the year end.

Is he aware of statements published recently by the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Sean FitzPatrick, in which he called on the banking sector to hold meetings with the Revenue Commissioners. He also claimed that banks were slow in admitting to DIRT liability and that it is like letting lawyers negotiate on behalf of the church. Is the Minister confident that all of the tax evaded will be recovered? The Minister is not clear if these meetings between the Revenue Commissioners and the banks are on a one-to-one or collective basis. The Minister mentioned five banks in his reply. How many times did the Revenue Commissioners resort to court orders under the powers they have to access information on these accounts? Given this statement by the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank, have the Revenue Commissioners received all the information requested from that particular bank? Is the Minister determined that all tax due will be recovered and that these negotiations will not result in some form of trade-off such as an amnesty for some of the banks or accounts involved?

Operational matters between the Revenue Commissioners and individual clients are solely a matter for them. I am aware that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the powers available to them are sufficient, particularly those granted to them under the Finance Act 1999.In three particular incidents with other financial institutions with subsidiary operations, the Revenue Commissioners met with them. Arising from that, the individual institutions wrote to their clients and the matter was dealt with on that basis. The collection of tax revenue proceeds apace.

On the last occasion I submitted a parliamentary question, the figure for Bank of Ireland Jersey accounts was €120 million for approximately 250 deposit holders. Will the Minister give the figures for the tax revenue collected so far from these banks, collectively or individually, in the Isle of Man? Have the Revenue Commissioners resorted to their powers to get court orders or are the banks coming forward with voluntary disclosure of information? Is the matter simply still a negotiating game between the Revenue Commissioners and the banks? Will the Minister agree it is important for the banks, where there has been significant offshore tax evasion, to support their customers and look at their own activities in facilitating people to evade tax by depositing money offshore?

The offshore assets group of the Revenue Commissioners is inquiring into the activities of the subsidiary operations of three Irish financial institutions. To date, the money collected is in excess of €125 million, which is made up of tax interest and penalties from persons holding funds offshore. The Revenue Commissioners have had meetings with five other financial institutions and more are planned before the end of the year. Matters will proceed from there.As to the other three financial institutions, the offshore assets group has dealt with them on a voluntary basis. I understand there has been no reason to resort to the powers vested in the Revenue Commissioners, as full co-operation has been afforded.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.I refer the Deputies to the summary of the 2004 budget measures which sets out the wide range of factors taken into account in selecting Departments and agencies for decentralisation and locations for the new decentralised offices. I am determined that action is taken immediately to start implementing the decentralisation programme.I have appointed an implementation committee to drive the process forward and a joint Department of Finance and Office of Public Works unit is being established to support the implementation committee and to liaise with Departments involved. The committee has been asked to provide a detailed implementation plan by the end of March 2004. The chairman of the committee will report to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation, which comprises the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.Each Minister is expected to take responsibility for that part of the programme which relates to his or her Department, including the agencies which come within his or her remit. In order to ensure that the programme can proceed without delay, I have provided an additional €20 million in my Department's Vote to meet any up-front investment required in 2004. Any capital funding requirements for future years will be dealt with within the overall five-year capital allocation framework announced in the budget. However, the costs of new accommodation in the regions can be minimised by vacating existing leased or State-owned property. The overall objective will be to ensure that property being acquired at regional level is matched over time in cost terms by disposal of property held in the Dublin region.As the programme will operate on a voluntary basis, there will be no question of paying removal or relocation expenses or redundancy payments. Some additional costs are likely to arise under headings such as travel and subsistence, staff training and technology. However, the decentralisation programme can also be expected to generate cost savings due to reduced absenteeism, reduced staff turnover and generally increased productivity. The wider economic benefits, the better use of regional infrastructure and reduced demand on infrastructure in Dublin also need to be taken into account.The Government had to take account of and balance a wide range of factors in selecting suitable locations for the new decentralisation programme which I announced on budget day. One of these was the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy. Some 2,650 jobs of the 9,000 jobs in respect of which decisions have already been made are moving to gateways and hubs identified in the national spatial strategy. With six of the hubs identified under the national spatial strategy benefiting from the new decentralisation programme and two of the remainder already having decentralised offices, the hubs are offered the opportunity to build on the key role envisaged for them under the national spatial strategy.The strategy also envisaged that county towns and other medium-sized towns, especially those which are strategically placed in a regional context, would have roles to play in acting as "local capitals", developing their service functions and providing opportunities for a diversifying employment base and productivity growth, both in the towns and in related smaller towns, villages and rural areas. Almost all the locations included in the programme are explicitly mentioned in section 4 of the national spatial strategy which outlines how each region will participate in the strategy. The relocation of public service employment to towns such as these underpins the important role, which many of them must continue to play into the future.

What was the extent of the consultation within the Civil Service to which the Minister referred on that occasion? Does he recognise that much surprise and puzzlement has been expressed by many civil servants at the announcement, timing and extent of the decentralisation proposed? Did the consultation involve the proposed location of the various Departments and agencies?Given that this is a voluntary decentralisation for civil and public servants, was an extensive survey carried out among those concerned to ascertain how many would be willing to move? If not, how can the Minister propose to carry out this project, including moving whole Departments, within three years if he does not have the exact figures of how many will volunteer to relocate? What other formula, if any, was used for the selection of locations, especially given that many of the designated hub towns, despite the Minister's response, were ignored or given quite derisory numbers of employees for those sections of Departments they are to receive.

Would the Minister be prepared to acknowledge that Monaghan town is an ideal location for information technology sections of many Departments, specifically the IT section in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which employs 225 people? The county already hosts two of the pertinent elements from that Department and has a well developed IT sector and a strongly supportive local authority seeking to develop in that way and also on a cross-Border basis.

The Secretaries General met and wrote a report. We received submissions on behalf of every town and village in the country from local authorities and chambers of commerce. I heard concerns from Deputies and Senators from all parties over a long period. We then made the decision.While it is not unusual for politicians to want to have their cake and eat it, in this case it is true of others as well. For four years we were criticised for making no decision and we are now criticised for making the decision. This is not confined to Members of these Houses. Some sections of the media seem to want to have their cake and eat it and seem to be more concerned that they did not know about it.My colleague and friend Deputy Durkan could not escape chuckling when Deputy Ó Caoláin asked why we did not consult other people before the decision. Can Deputies imagine what would have happened if certain people had known this was about to take place? Can Deputies imagine the goings-on among Deputies, Senators, local authorities and chambers of commerce? The great example of my colleague from Laoighis-Offaly would be in the halfpenny place and this would have happened throughout the country.

Those who have been in Government, such as Deputy Richard Bruton and Deputy Durkan, know what would have happened then. We had four years to consider everything and then we decided.Ireland is a small country. This is not in the same category as putting a man on the moon, the invention of the wheel or conquering the North Pole. In my budget speech last week, I said this would help change the formulation of policy in years ahead by getting away from a Dublin mindset.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18532	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	368	It will change to the Parlon mindset.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	369	In the past week we have seen a considerable degree of the Dublin mindset suggesting it would not be possible to run the country from outside Dublin. This shows considerable arrogance to the people. The real Dublin people seem to have less difficulty with decentralisation than those who came to Dublin 25 or 30 years ago and decided to settle here, including those eminent in certain parts of the media. They obviously do not go home that often or, if they do, they do not know how Ireland has changed in the past ten to 15 years. Ireland will be well able to handle this.We expect multinationals with offices of hundreds or thousands of employees and sales greater then Ireland's gross national product to locate here and be able to conduct their operations from California to Hong Kong, yet we cannot expect this to be done by an Irish organisation. At a press conference last week, I said Ireland was such a small place that I would expect Tiger Woods to go around it in about 67 shots on a reasonably good day. This will bring balanced regional development and will work well.As Deputy Ó Caoláin correctly noted, the documentation contains information that 835 information technology jobs were withheld in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners, the Local Government Services Board and the Department of Finance. In order to allow the committee to decide what best to do, it has been proposed that all of these jobs should be placed in one centre of excellence and made secure. The tax collection and delivery of services systems are even more important than people as they are critical to the entire State. The first action of the commission will be to make suggestions in this area. I will bear in mind the Deputy's comments on the place of which he has reminded me.

I thought it would be the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, as he is the one who seems to have delivered. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, deliberated for a great deal of time, but when Deputy Parlon appeared everything was sorted out and put right.On a serious note, the Minister for Finance failed to respond to the question I put to him on the gross costs of property acquisition and other matters. Why did he not respond? In the preamble to the spatial strategy, the Taoiseach said he sought balanced regional development and a better spread of jobs. He went on to say the Government would ensure development occurred as set out in the spatial strategy. However, the Minister's decentralisation programme provides for jobs in only 12 of the 22 gateway and hub towns mentioned in the strategy. That represents about 55%. The number of jobs provided for the towns the Government said should be developed amount to less than 19% of all the jobs involved.

A question which has often been posed relates to the criteria to be used. I have consistently said there was no one set of criteria and that no town would be excluded by a particular methodology. No particular reasons were set out according to which any other town would be included. I have said that over a period of four years during which time hundreds of parliamentary questions on the matter have been put down. I cannot count the number of times the Minister of State has responded to questions on this matter on the Adjournment. When the spatial strategy was launched, the Government stated that decentralisation would not involve gateways and hubs alone.I acknowledge that there is a particular level of innocence in the parts of Mayo from which Deputy Rabbitte comes. Yesterday, the Deputy asked the Taoiseach to provide a league table. How would we ever have dealt with decentralisation had I been asked to initiate a consultation process to provide a league table of towns. This process has been difficult enough. Of the jobs allocated last week, about 2,650 have gone to gateway and hub towns. There are already about 2,700 civil servants in decentralised offices in these towns. Nowhere in the spatial strategy does it say that only gateways and hubs would be eligible for decentralised offices.A question was raised yesterday about a conflict of interest in terms of Deputy Parlon and the code of conduct. The Minister of State could not possibly have breached the code of conduct as he had no hand, act or part in the process of decision making on decentralisation.

The Office of Public Works pays about €100 million in rent annually for properties in which offices of State reside. The office owns some buildings, but not the majority. It will be possible to make some savings in that regard. As my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, announced last week, it is not expected that the €20 million which has been set aside will be used this year as that is the up-front fund for capital costs.

An issue which has not been raised before involves the army of ancillary workers employed in Dublin in the various Departments which are now up for transfer. What consideration has been given to the employment of ushers, porters and cleaners who are not civil and public servants? They number in the hundreds across Departments. What message do the Minister for Finance and his Cabinet colleagues have about the future employment of this army of ancillary workers?What is the position in respect of people who harboured an ambition to return to their home counties as civil and public servants but whose Departments are to be transferred to places at an even greater remove than Dublin from their original homes? Does the Minister anticipate a significant increase in transfer requests at all levels within Departments? Has he put in place a transfer arrangement to accommodate what I suspect will be a large number of people?
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I have the thin end of the wedge here. Some time ago, the finance committee received a presentation from the decentralisation unit of the Minister's Department. The committee was told the unit had made a presentation to the Minister outlining its recommendations. Can the Minister tell the House if he accepted the recommendations set out in that presentation? Will the Minister outline what changes, if any, were made to them? If changes were made, why did the Minister move away from the original recommendations?I have a particular interest in the fact that the headquarters of the Department of Education and Science is due to transfer to Mullingar. Are there problems with the listed building on Marlborough Street in which the Department is currently housed? There is also a gaelscoil on the site. Will the transfer of the headquarters to Mullingar be delayed as a consequence of the two matters I have mentioned?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	405	Deputy Ó Caoláin has asked a good question. It was announced last week that 10,300 public servants, approximately 7,000 of whom are civil servants, will be involved in the decentralisation programme. There are approximately 17,000 civil servants in Dublin at present, of whom approximately 10,000 will remain. One of the reasons the Government has taken this decision is evident when one examines a map of Ireland. Large clusters of civil servants are to be found throughout the country. People who decide that they do not want to move to the location to which the Department in which they work is to be decentralised may decide to move to another area where public sector jobs are to be found. Such people will be able to swap Departments, just as people swapped during the previous decentralisation programmes. It will be far easier to organise such swaps during this programme.One of the reasons we have decided to pursue such a large programme is to provide promotion opportunities to civil servants. It is not fair to send a small division away as an executive officer in such a decentralised division will probably remain at that level for 20 years or more. It will be possible to move within one's Department under the proposed programme, perhaps as far as Secretary General level. Civil servants in decentralised Departments will be close to their colleagues. Deputies are aware that it is easier to drive 15 miles to a country town than it is to Dublin. That is one of the reasons for pursuing this type of programme.I would like to speak about the ancillary services provided by non-established, or industrial, civil servants. There will continue to be a large number of public servants in Dublin. A large number of offices will remain in the city. I have pointed out on a number of occasions that this is a voluntary programme so there will be no effect in that regard.In response to Deputy Paul McGrath's question, matters relating to headquarters or offices in other parts of the country are strictly governed by the normal procedures of the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works will undertake its normal tendering procedures and will make decisions without an input from me. The Office of Public Works will make decisions as it has always done.A presentation made to a joint committee has been mentioned. All representations made in recent years were taken into account, as they have always been. I am sure Deputies are aware that a most unusual thing happened in the end – politicians made a decision.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the information requested, which I will outline, is rounded to the nearest thousand. In 1999-2000, there were 543,000 higher rate taxpayers, comprising 32.6% of the total number of income earners. In 2000-01, there were 540,000 higher rate taxpayers, comprising 30.6% of the total number of income earners. In 2001, the short tax year, there were 516,000 higher rate taxpayers, comprising 28.3% of the total number of income earners. In 2002, there were 517,000 higher rate taxpayers, comprising 27.9% of the total number of income earners. In 2003, there were 570,000 higher rate taxpayers, comprising 30.5% of the total number of income earners. In 2004, it is estimated that there will be 632,000 higher rate taxpayers, comprising 33.4% of the total number of income earners. It should be noted that a married couple jointly assessed is counted as one tax unit.The number of people exempt from tax increased from 459,000 to 669,000, or from 27.5% to 35.3% of income earners, between 1999 and 2003. Relating the numbers in each group to income earners gives a more balanced and meaningful figure as it takes account of all those on the tax file and makes clear that assessing the proportion of income earners on the higher rate must take account of the policy goal of increasing the numbers on low pay exempt from tax.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.What matters to people is the net effect of tax changes on their take-home pay. Everybody in the PAYE sector will see their take-home pay rise as a result of this budget. Under the system of tax credits, the only way to move people off the top rate of tax is to widen the bands. Indexation in line with the CPI, which some people had called for in advance of the budget, would have delivered some widening. However, most categories of PAYE taxpayer have benefited to a greater extent than would have been the case had bands and credits been indexed by the expected rise in inflation for 2004 over 2003. Indexation of all bands and credits would have cost €214 million in a full year. The full year cost of the budget income tax package is €287 million, which is €73 million more than €214 million. The budget package delivers further progress on the key Government priority of moving towards exempting the minimum wage from taxation and focuses resources on those at the lower end of the income scale.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	416	Will the Minister agree that the provisions of the budget will mean that over 33% of all workers will pay the higher rate of tax next year? This is a clear consequence of the figures he has read out. Some 52% of people who pay tax will do so at the top rate of 42% next year. Such people will also have to pay PRSI of 4% and a health levy of 2%. Their employers will pay PRSI of 10.75% on incomes up to about €42,000. The Minister and his friends in the Progressive Democrats Party have claimed that this is a low-tax economy, but the statistics I have outlined demonstrate that is not true.The Minister has put in place the largest stealth tax of all by failing to index tax bands. The effective marginal rate of tax for 52% of Irish taxpayers is unbelievably high by European standards. Does the Minister share the Tánaiste's concern that the Government has got it wrong in this budget by introducing a very high effective marginal rate of tax? Does he share the view of various employers' associations that the Minister's failure to index tax bands represents an open invitation for the return of the black economy and under-the-counter payments? If a single person on a modest income of approximately €30,000 works a significant amount of overtime, he or she will face a marginal tax rate of 48% on extra earnings and the employer will face a further 10.75% in PRSI. Will the Minister predict the impact on individual employees and employers of his invitation to return to the black economy?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Not for the first time, I do not accept what Deputy Burton has said on this matter. I remind her that 35% of income earners will be exempt from tax, 32% will pay tax at the standard rate and 33% will pay tax at the higher rate. The Deputy is making a mockery of this matter. If it is not the case that she does not understand this area, I must conclude that she is playing a statistical game. The more people who are exempt from the tax code, the more people who will pay tax at the standard or higher rate. The number of persons who are exempt from paying tax – those who pay no tax – has increased from 380,400 to 668,700 since I became Minister for Finance. This represents an increase of over 75%.Deputy Burton would like to interpret these statistics in a peculiar manner. Let us imagine that all bar 100 of the 1.8 million taxpayers were exempt from tax. Let us suppose that I had been so successful in recent years that I could afford to release everybody, except for 100 persons, from the tax net. If 95 of the 100 people paying tax did so at the higher rate and two did so at the standard rate, Deputy Burton would argue that 95% of taxpayers were paying tax at the higher rate. This is an example of the nonsense she has spoken in respect of this matter. I notice that the leader of her party has been fooled into examining this issue in the same manner. At least Deputy Richard Bruton knows that the approach is nonsense since the change in the tax system. Perhaps the tax credit system is not understood by sections of the Labour Party, although they may be deliberately misconstruing it. Since we adopted the tax credit system, the only way to keep people out of the higher band is to widen the band – there is no other way of doing it. It is totally different from the old tax allowance system.I remind Deputy Burton that commentators from the EU, the IMF and the OECD have demonstrated beyond doubt that Ireland has the lowest tax take from workers of any OECD or EU country. We are far ahead of everybody else as a result of the changes I have made since 1997. I also remind Deputy Burton that the Labour Party opposed every reduction in the top rate of tax. It opposed the reductions from 48% to 46%, to 44% and to 42%. I would welcome any decision by the Labour Party to no longer favour tax increases. I remind Labour Members once more that their party opposed tax reductions tooth and nail.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I remind the Minister for Finance that the manifestos of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised that just 20% of taxpayers would pay tax at the highest rate. It is another broken promise. The Government has drifted from its manifesto promise by 13 points. It is no wonder the Tánaiste is worried.Regarding the traps that the Minister set, he boasted of about 90% of people on low incomes being taken out of the tax net. However, the minimum wage will go up next February to €7 an hour so someone earning €280 a week, if he or she does ten hours' overtime at €10 an hour, will be caught in the Minister's PRSI trap. Should such people's weekly income go up to €356, which is not large, they will be caught in the health levy trap. What is more, their employers will be caught for 10.75%. Why is the Minister not concerned that his tax policy, the stealth tax that he has imposed in this budget, is the biggest rip-off since his predecessor, Mr. Haughey, in the 1970s and 1980s essentially gave carte blanche to the black economy in this country?

The latest CSO figures show that import prices for the first eight months of this year have fallen by 4.6% in comparison with the same period last year. That fall in the price of imports has a positive effect on Irish inflation, as it causes a reduction in the price of goods and services.The price of exports, which has no direct impact on inflation, has fallen by 6% for the first eight months of this year in comparison with the same period last year. Inflation has fallen from an annual high of 5.1% in February to 2.3% in October, its lowest level in four years. That is as a result of the sustained strength of the euro and other favourable developments, including falling import prices and mortgage interest rates, and easing services sector inflation. My Department forecast in the budget, published last week, that inflation would average 3.5% this year, falling to 2.5% in 2004.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18532	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Does the Minister agree there is something radically wrong if import and export prices, which are essentially those of traded goods, are falling, according to his figures, by 5% while at the same time the prices of goods in the shops are rising? Is that not an indication that someone is taking a very substantial cut out of that extra margin? Are the Minister and his regulators not participating in the dual world when people trying to trade in the real world of external trade are taking cuts of 5%, or 8% in some cases? The utilities and the companies the Minister controls, including the ESB and An Post, have sought average increases of 20% in the past 12 months. Is the Government not living in an entirely unrealistic world regarding the pricing strategy that the Minister is pursuing while those competing in a tough world have to accept serious cuts in the price they are getting? Does he agree that people are getting fed up with the rip-off and stealth tax approach that has become so much a feature of the past two years?

Most of our inflation is caused by outside factors such as the price of oil, the value of the currency and related matters. Service sector inflation has been higher in Ireland for several years, but it is now falling. It was down to 3.3% in October from 6.5% in February this year. Service sector inflation is on the way down. We calculate that the impact of the budget on the consumer price index will be about 0.4% next year. Inflation will be about 2.5%. I know that the Deputy, being Opposition spokesperson on finance, must make the best case he can. Part of that has been about stealth taxes and the cost of living. However, it raises a very fundamental question to which he would not subscribe if he were on this side of the House. We have taken the public utilities to which he refers, such as the ESB, An Post and CIE, away from the direct control of line Departments over the past decade or more, and they must put forward increases to pay their way.

There is therefore no consistency in saying that those organisations should be free of Government control and then saying that they should be back within it. That does not add up.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Regarding the price inflation experienced by small firms, particularly in the service sector, does the Minister not accept that utility costs, especially in the context of his increase in the base rate of VAT last year from 12.5% to 13.5%, are one of the reasons that so many small service firms in this country are finding it almost impossible to survive? The tax increases from the Minister's failure to index tax bands have made matters even worse for such small firms. What, if any, response does the Minister have to the burden on small, indigenous firms, particularly service firms?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The Deputy will have to give me some book to show how a failure to index tax bands has an impact on inflation. I would be interested to see it. We calculated that last year's VAT increase added about 0.79% to the consumer price index. Deputy Richard Bruton and others made the case on the other utilities, and I have replied to that. Public utilities must pay their way. Governments have made mistakes with them in recent years by not allowing them to have increases. The result was that when one had to have an increase, it was much more. A more rational way of doing things is to allow a steady increase every year in line with costs rather than putting off the evil day for whatever reason and having a big gazump in prices, be they CIE fares, ESB bills or whatever. A more rational way is to plan one's business. Businesses plan their pricing structures based on recovering their costs, and public utilities should do the same.

Is he satisfied that it is being assessed here in the correct manner, or could it similarly be examined and a better way found of assessing the underlying rate of inflation?

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	442	No, the Deputy is mistaken. Europe, for example, uses what is called the harmonised index. Differences between that and the Irish CPI relate mainly to mortgage interest not being included in the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP. The United Kingdom can also give a harmonised index. At the moment, the HICP in Europe is forecast at about 2%. We expect to be down to about 2.3% by the end of 2004. We can give people the harmonised rate every month, but the headline rate is always the CPI. One can also have the CPI with or without cigarettes, mortgages or anything one likes. What the UK is doing relates to the rate it gives the central bank, which is to keep inflation at about 2.5%, the retail price index, RPIX, rate including certain items and excluding others. Gordon Brown has been signalling for the past few days that the UK will use the HICP rate all the time. The CSO gives that rate for us every month. There is no difference in the methodology for deciding these rates, it is simply a matter of which one people wish to use.As I have said, cigarettes are a great example in the case of Ireland. One can see the consumer price index figure without cigarettes or alcohol for any week or month. However, this is to compare like with like. The basis of the methodology used to arrive at the figure has not been changed, rather what the figure is compared with. We hope to get our HICP rate down to the European average of approximately 2%.

While acknowledging arguments for and against it, what is the Minister's view on the continuing inclusion of tobacco products in the listing which is used in the calculation of inflation figures?
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The Department of Finance has no role in this regard. It is a matter for the Central Statistics Office which applies international comparisons. Every five years, the CSO carries out a major household survey of the patterns of people's spending on drink, cigarettes, chocolates, cinema-going, mortgages and so on. The last such survey was carried out in 2001 and the CSO reset the basis of its calculations to ascertain, for instance, whether people were spending more or less on drink. When the CSO carries out its hundreds of surveys each month, it records the prices of goods in different categories. This is a statistical application. It has nothing to do with the Department of Finance.The percentage of the population who smoke is now approximately 24%, down from approximately 32% a decade ago. This fact is reflected in the CSO's statistical analysis. The household survey is carried out every five years to record people's spending habits. I know a survey was carried out in 1996 and I think the last one was in 2001. Once the survey has been done, the basket of goods reflects such changes.An argument has been made by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, about when tobacco should be included. I effected a significant increase in tobacco prices some years ago and gave most of the money to the Department of Health and Children that year, which many people thought a good idea. However, when it came to negotiating wages last year, no one suggested that we should deal with the CPI figure without including tobacco, including the media.Although it is bad for people to smoke and drink, when one examines spending habits in totality, the CSO correctly identifies that these are the things people spend their money on and that should be reflected in the CPI. There is a logic to that.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18532	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	For the Minister to blame external factors such as oil is nonsensical. He quoted figures which indicated that import prices have fallen 5% in the past 12 months.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I did not say that. Whether inflation was rising or falling, I have always said that most of the inflation in Ireland is caused by external influences.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18532	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I strongly contest that statement. Is the Minister aware that, according to the CSO's figures in October, 100% of our inflation rate of 2.3% on that date came from the Government, either through direct and indirect taxes or from the various utilities under the Government's charge? Does the Minister agree that only monopolies owned by the State can charge 30% price increases in the current climate? Food manufacturers are taking a 4% cut, other manufacturing industries are taking a 9% cut and makers of capital goods in Ireland are taking an 11% cut. Despite this, the Minister suggests that it is good that the State monopolies can charge 20% and more. It is not great if one is in an industry trying to survive or one is working to pay one's mortgage and State enterprises are getting away with this.The Minister's own anti-inflation strategy refers to the Government having regard to the inflation target in setting policy for those services in which there is effective State control of prices. The Minister and his regulators control these and are not applying anything like the pressures suffered by people in the private sector by ordinary workers and their companies.

However, the public utilities, which he referred to as monopolies, have to recover their costs.

I come to this argument from a certain viewpoint, which is perhaps similar to that of the Deputy in regard to public monopolies but different from the position of Deputy Burton and her party. How we structure public utilities is a separate question. While we remove them from the direct control of Departments, they should be in a position to formulate their own pricing structures. Whether they are run efficiently is a different matter.The main determinants of inflation are outside factors. I said that when inflation was falling and rising. The Deputy is correct that the price of traded goods internationally has not risen in recent years. The factory gate prices will remain low for a number of reasons, including competition from eastern Europe and China, and there will be no increase. Therefore, we must be as competitive as possible. Moreover, the area of competitiveness needs closer and further examination.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I remind the Deputy of what precisely I said on the subject in my 2003 budget speech. I stated that: "the Government has asked the relevant Departments to advance the plans for a general carbon energy tax, with a view to introducing this from the end of 2004". Given the many implications of such a tax, both environmental and economic, I said that there would be full consultations with interested parties on the design of the tax.As the Deputy will be aware, I subsequently published a carbon energy tax consultation paper on 31 July of this year which was designed to facilitate discussions on the introduction and design of the tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received by 30 September 2003. Relevant Oireachtas joint committees also considered the paper.To date, 116 submissions have been received and the views in the submissions are divided in support of or concerned about the implications of such a tax. The submissions raised diverse concerns such as competitiveness, the impact on employment, the less well-off and rural areas, cross-Border aspects, the scope of the tax, the link with emissions trading, the role of negotiated agreements and alternative energy, the need for revenue recycling and how that should be applied. I propose to publish these submissions on my Department's website in the new year. The consultation process will inform the development of proposals for further consideration by the Government.

The Minister referred to it in his 1997 budget, went into greater detail about it in his 1998 budget and has referred to it in every budget since then. Last year, the Minister stated that he had a view to introducing the tax in 2004.

The Minister was clear in his statements that the introduction of this tax could be used to reduce tax in other areas such as labour. He asked for the submissions on 31 July and received them by 30 September. This is an ongoing consultation process which has taken eight years and precedes the Minister in office. The Minister neither likes nor wants this tax. That he did not include one reference to it in his budget speech last week indicates to many on this side of the House that he does not want to introduce this tax.

We published our own documents on the matter, which will be considered further by the Government. It will be looked at in the coming months and we will publish the submissions we received. We will then make a decision. However, it is not, contrary to what the Deputy appears to be indicating, a case of giving a simple yes or no answer. It would be great if Ministers for Finance could make decisions on that basis. However, this is a complicated area in respect of which there are far-reaching implications for Irish individuals and businesses.

I ask the Minister to engage with us on this serious matter.What is the Minister's view on the effectiveness of the carbon tax? The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that while we are 20% over target, the implementation of a carbon tax will only reduce greenhouse gases by 1.4%. It will, therefore, make only a small dent in the problem. What is the Minister's view on the position of the US which, effectively, has opted out of Kyoto? How will this impact on the operation in Ireland of a carbon tax and how can we mitigate against it? What is the Minister's opinion on giving large, free rations to big energy users while, under many of the proposals, small businesses will be obliged to pay the full carbon tax? Is such a position equitable? I desire some serious discussion on these issues.

The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seems to be of the opinion that it is important to adhere to our Kyoto commitments. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment seems broadly opposed to Kyoto and is taking the US line. The Minister has just stated that he is involved in consultations but he said the same thing in respect of decentralisation, a matter which he proceeded to ignore until earlier today when he indicated his pride about the new programme.Has a risk profile been carried out regarding the impact on our economy if we do not respect some of our obligations? Has the Minister received the submission of the Combat Poverty Agency regarding the impact of such a tax, unless it was very well structured, on poor and low income families which use certain types of fuel, particularly coal and briquettes, and which would be heavily penalised under any move to reduce emissions? What is the Minister's current thinking on this matter and does he have a coherent policy in respect of it?

Sadly there is still huge scope for improvement in all other services that disproportionately affect the less well off in society. I refer here to issues relating to crime, education and the health services.Many of the issues raised by previous speakers, including disability grants, the rise in the family break-ups and the increase in the number of single parent families, have already been discussed in detail. Does the Minister have any plans to establish a national pension type fund that will protect the future pensions of public servants and help us deal with the major social changes we are expecting to take place? We are aware that the money spent on these type of services will increase in the future.On occasion, some Members take the opportunity to castigate their fellow Deputies on the remuneration they receive for their work in the Oireachtas. Other Members, Deputy Conor Lenihan in particular, took the opportunity, during the debate on the Hanly report, to criticise the medical profession. Even the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has decided to criticise GPs and the fees they charge. The health service has been well and truly debated in the House in recent years and three reports on it have been completed. However, it would be apt to consider commissioning Hanly type reports into the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science rather than engaging in the sort of Mickey Mouse type of childish antics that often passes for debate in this House.I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the Courts Service, the way the courts operate, the fact that some barristers have been paid over £1 million for less than two years work, and issues relating to Garda manpower. There is more scope for a Hanly type report into the workings of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform than there was in respect of the Department of Health and Children.There is no disputing the value, in monetary terms, of education. Equally, there is no disputing the positive cost benefits education brings to society. We must acknowledge the legacy of Donogh O'Malley who was Minister for Education in the 1960s. We have all benefited from his work. Ireland might not be what it is today had it not been for the huge investment in education from the early 1960s onwards. Education is a great way to break out of any poverty trap and we are denying the next generation this opportunity because we are not making the same investment, on a continuous basis, in the educational services.The health service appears to be incredibly well scrutinised from the point of view of value for money and that of its management structures. It would be interesting to see what would happen if this level of scrutiny was applied to other Departments. The Comptroller and Auditor General is charged with seeking out waste in Government spending, but we should consider how the services to which I refer, which cost so much, are established.The Bill does not contain any dramatic changes. The increases for social welfare recipients do not warrant the massive debate that has taken place. The majority of people, whether in receipt of disability allowance or old age pension will receive between €135 and €200 per week. The amounts given are disgracefully low for a Government which exists in this high conspicuous consumption era.I ask the Government to consider reorganising its services in 2004. If it will not borrow more money it should, during the remainder of its time in office, try to provide those on social welfare with a fair chance. This Bill is nothing much to talk about.

He is obviously keen to hear it and does not wish to miss a single word. I am deeply honoured. I regret the Minister for Finance had to leave following the Minister of State's rapid arrival. God knows he needs a few ideas following the budget. Other than the "out of the magic hat" local election decentralisation programme, the budget, in terms of social welfare and so on, was bereft of radical ideas. Perhaps the Minister of State will impart to the Minister for Finance some of what I have to say today.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I will pass a copy of my contribution to him. In the limited time available to me I wish to address two issues, basic income and the move towards a basic income type social welfare structure, and child benefit allowances as outlined in the recent budget. The Minister of State will be aware that a cornerstone policy ambition of my party since its foundation has been that we move away from a social welfare system which discourages people from returning to the workforce and classifies sections of our society as recipients of welfare on an almost charitable basis. We should establish a system that recognises the rights of all citizens and, as a wealthy State, provide a basic income, leaving people free to use their creative instinct, to find employment and to provide for their families. It is only through moving towards that type of philosophy in our system that we will eradicate some of the real causes of poverty which are often based on subtle and psychological conditions established by the social welfare benefits we receive.I am disappointed the Minister failed to take an opportunity to do so in this budget. We have the finance to do it and should take the opportunity to move in that direction. My party's proposal for a movement in that direction involves the establishment of a refundable tax credit system. It is a system the Government will, eventually, have to consider introducing. I asked the Minister why it was not done in this budget when so little else was being done. He obviously did nothing more in the three months prior to the budget than consider budgetary decisions in regard to Knock, Cavan and so on. He could have spent that time examining the possibility of introducing a refundable tax system by, first, giving the 10% of workers on the minimum wage who continue to pay tax a full refund of tax credit which they are not using. He could then have moved in the next budget to allow that refundable tax credit to replace social welfare benefits, thereby merging the tax credit and social welfare systems.In that way, all people would be treated equally and we would be creating a culture which enables people to seek legitimate employment. Such people would be in receipt of refundable tax credits and anything else they did would be fully taxable thereby creating an equitable and open system. I deeply regret the Minister for Finance, in introducing the budget, failed to move in that direction. Such a move would have been seen by all parties as a move in the right direction.One could argue that increases in child benefit in recent years have, to a certain extent, resulted in a small step towards a basic income type payment where every adult and child in the State is treated equally. I welcome that approach. The increases were smaller than promised by Government but at least they are moving in the right direction. What is inequitable is that increases continue to be paid on an across-the-board basis. I earn a very high income, yet I receive the same child benefit increases as someone on a low income to whom such an increase makes a substantial difference. I would argue that further increases in child benefit be paid by way of a taxable parenting allowance rather than in direct increases in child benefit which are paid to the son or daughter of Michael Smurfit in the same way as they are paid to those on low incomes. We should continue to increase child benefit, but it is important we target such payments at those on low incomes and not at those who do not have a desperate need for it.We are moving away from a graded tax system based on income, property or wealth to a system of regressive indirect tax, not only in terms of VAT but across the board in other charges. It is time we adjusted our system and recognised our duty to support those on low incomes. However, we should not do so in a charitable way or in a way that would restrict people to poverty, rather we should try to liberate them to become more productive and creative.

I also welcome the budget. I appreciate the Opposition is doing its best to muster up opposition to what has been a successful budget. However, Deputies, particularly members of the Fine Gael Party, are not unified in their objections to decentralisation. The Leader of that party has taken one line, the Front Bench spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has taken a different line in saying that the Government is denuding Dublin, and Deputy John Bruton said it was ridiculous to move Departments and heads of Departments out of Dublin. Yet, these Deputies consider it all right for someone like myself to travel up here from Mayo to debate a matter in this House. While the Opposition are at odds, we on this side of the House are completely at one.

We all know they are all over the place. I thought they would have had the good grace to welcome the massive investment being made in the social welfare system in 2004. Some €11.2 billion will be spent in this area next year, an increase of €750 million on 2003 figures, representing a 7% increase, which is way ahead of the predicted rate of inflation of 2.5% in 2004. This investment will affect 970,000 people claiming social welfare benefits in 2004. The budget and social welfare provisions will impact on two out of every five people in this Sate. Most people, if not all, will be better off as a result of the changes in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill.I would like to refer to some of the changes that have taken place since this Government came to office. There have been many conflicting stories in Members' contributions on where we now stand and how that compares with 1997 when the Government took office. The number of people in employment has increased to almost 1.8 million. Unemployment has fallen from 10% to 4.3%. It is significant that 41,000 taxpayers have been taken out of the tax net this year alone. This is greater than the overall number taken out of the tax net in the three years the Opposition was in government.Social welfare spending has increased massively, from €5.74 billion in 1997 to €11.26 billion in 2004. The 2004 spend is almost twice that of 1997 and is well above the rate of inflation. Social welfare benefits have increased in real terms. This was one of the objectives held by the Minister for Finance and it has been achieved. We have seen new social welfare benefits, such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grants and respite care grants, being introduced and enhanced.We want to continue in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the State pension to €200 by 2007. We are well on our way to achieving this. Looking at the levels of increase given by Opposition parties when they were in office, I listened with incredulity to their complaints about the current levels of increase.

However, sometimes one can learn lessons from the past and we learned many lessons in the shape of the derisory payments given to social welfare recipients by the parties now in opposition.I want to look at the area of child benefit, which has been one of the main priorities of the Government. In 1997, the weekly payment for the first and second child was €38.10, it is now €131.60. It is a massive increase.

The Opposition's track record on school building was appalling during its term of office, not to mention its level of investment in the hospital programme, which does not compare with what the Government has done.The average yearly increase we have given since 1997 is 13.36% compared with an average increase of 4.16% when the Opposition was in government. Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned that this was applied evenly and equally to all parents.

The manner in which the Government has decided to increase child benefit has positively touched the vast majority of parents. The message from the recipients of these payments is that they are happy with how the Government has tackled this issue as it was ignored for many years. While I would like to have seen an even greater increase this year, we must recognise that the growth of our economy has slowed and that all such payment increases must be ultimately paid for by the taxpayer. Any time we introduce a measure designed to increase revenue to enable us to do more, the Opposition objects to it. The Opposition cannot have its bread buttered on both sides.

All that I ask is that when the Government introduces a positive programme, the Opposition would welcome it. This Bill clearly is part of this positive programme. The Opposition should also welcome decentralisation and recognise that the country is made up of many regions. The world does not begin and end in Dublin. This is something Fine Gael should know all about given its performance in Dublin in the last election.

I find it entertaining, particularly as the figures on their side do not stack up. If I was currently in opposition and had the track record Opposition Members have, I would probably heckle Government spokespersons too.I return to the issue of contributory and non-contributory old age pensions. I welcome the €10 increase which is well in excess of our 2.5% inflation rate. It is in line with our target of €200 per week by 2007. The previous programme for Government promised to bring the pension to €127 per week and it was achieved. I have every confidence that the €200 target is realistic. Only an uncaring Government would not take the time and resources to invest in our elderly people who have served us so well in the past. I am delighted the investment we have made in our elderly people has been warmly received by them. Supporters of other political parties are always grateful that when we are in government, we are able to announce such healthy increases in the pension. I sincerely hope this will be a trend that we continue. I particularly welcome the increase in the widow's pension as it was badly needed and attention was drawn to it in successive budget speeches.I heard other Members talking about the number of people who have been caught in the poverty trap. According to the ESRI, the overall level of consistent poverty in 1998 stood at 8.2%. This has been reduced by over one third to 5.2% in 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available. I listened earlier to Members talking about poverty – I am particularly thinking of the Labour Party and the contribution of Deputy O'Sullivan – and how the levels have increased. This is incorrect. While we all recognise there is much more work to be done, the figures show that consistent poverty levels have decreased.I welcome increases in payments to the long-term unemployed and those in receipt of unemployment and disability benefits. Those increases are all approximately €10 and well ahead of inflation. The average percentage increases by the Government is over 9% compared with a derisory 2.9% when the Opposition was in government. These are the facts and they plainly speak for themselves.I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, on tackling areas where she felt reform was necessary. I particularly congratulate her on the additional funding for the money advice bureaux. I know this scheme operates successfully within County Mayo. The Minister felt the supplement given to MABS was not being used evenly throughout the health board areas and needed reform. I welcome her allocation of €960,000 to MABS to provide its essential services. The level of referrals to it makes it clear that it has been a great success story. It is a great service and any enhancement of that service is to be welcomed.The Minister has also made certain changes in the rent supplement regime. There has been much misinformation, as often happens in such matters. Rent supplements were intended to meet a person's long-term housing need. While the scheme was not supposed to be a housing programme, it became one over the years. I welcome the Minister's clarification on this matter because it received considerable media comment. It is to be available to those with housing needs whose safety or well-being is at risk. It will continue to be available to such people. Those with disabilities, the elderly and those experiencing severe social problems will all be able to avail of rent supplement.The changes in this measure will not affect those on local authority waiting lists. The original purpose of rent supplement was to cater for those with genuine housing needs. In every county we have hundreds of those—

Deputy Durkan seizes on issues such as this, which he believes might generate a little media interest but, in effect, he is spreading much misinformation and scaring many genuine people who are availing of rent supplement. If this is the purpose of his information, fair enough, but I believe it is mischievous and wrong. We should ascertain the facts as they genuinely apply.

Given that he has interrupted with inaccurate information, I must reiterate that this measure will not affect those on local authority waiting lists for houses, even if they have been renting for less than six months. Those who are homeless, as defined in the Housing Act, will not be affected either. Those who have been tenants for six months will not be affected, nor will those currently in receipt of rent supplement. We are all aware of isolated hardship cases in our constituencies. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has said very sensibly that full and sympathetic consideration will be given to the needs of such people. This will be done in co-operation with the housing authority. This is to be welcomed.Many of the supplements that have been available through the Department of Social and Family Affairs have not been reviewed. This may have been because of a cowardly reluctance to review them on the part of the Opposition when it was in Government for fear anyone would say something.

The Minister has taken a very brave stance and has decided to spend it where the Government believes it is most wanted. If this involves the reform of some schemes and supplements that might not have been used over the years for the purposes for which they were originally intended, so be it because it is wise. I welcome the Minister's bravery in this regard. It is not always easy to adopt such an approach. It would be very easy to go along with the usual budget increases and be praised by everybody for doing so.Spending in the order of €11.2 billion on social welfare is a record by anyone's reckoning and in terms of the overall spend by the Government. It represents a huge percentage of the resources available to the Government for 2004. It is important that these resources will be targeted where they are most needed. Old age pensioners, those in receipt of child benefit, widows and carers have all received very substantial increases.We are one and a half years into a five year programme. What we set out in our programme for Government was our ambition over a five year period. It was never our intention that the full programme would be rolled out in a year and a half. Given the very positive nature of the increases this year, I look forward, over the next three budgets and the three social welfare Bills that will follow them, to the achievement of the objectives of the programme. I commend the Bill to the House and commend the Minister.

One can only imagine the Cabinet meetings when the Estimates were being compiled and thereafter. Everybody must have sat around waiting for inspiration.

Decentralisation became the flavour of the budget and the Social Welfare Bill and will become the flavour of every other Bill that is likely to pass in the House in the next 12 months.Into the arena then rode the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, on his bucking bronco and he seized the opportunity to claim full responsibility for decentralisation.

Numerically challenged as we are, we have worked it out, and it amounts to 8 cent per hour. This does not give much recognition to the children of this country. This is at a time when child care costs are at a premium and every mother in the country is forced to work to pay a mortgage.

The widows and single parents of Ireland must go out to work and they must pay for their children's care in crèches or playschools. What recognition do they receive from the Government? Absolutely zilch. I cannot understand how the Government can be so uncaring. Surely someone told it there was a group of people which is deserving of its help and which has been ignored for the past three to four years. Surely someone would have said to the Government at some time: "Guys and gals, would you ever have a look at this situation?"  It is now generally recognised that the family is a very important feature of our society.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	600	That goes for both sides. The Minister for Finance missed a golden opportunity in the budget to do a lot for everybody, but he ended up doing nothing for anybody. The Social Welfare Bill makes a number of changes announced in the budget. It is the first of two Social Welfare Bills and contains some provisions that relate to the cutbacks announced in the Estimates published on 13 November, which of course were the real budget. The end result will be that the poverty gap will widen, with the poor still having to wait for their fair share. As my colleague Deputy Ring said last night, CORI estimates that since the Government came to power in 1997, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened by €294 per week.In making these calculations CORI included pay increases and tax reductions as well as social welfare increases. It also included the impact of the new Government savings scheme which many have had to leave, though it suits those who are better off. However, it is beyond the reach of Ireland's poorest people. Over 70,000 households are living in consistent poverty, according to the Combat Poverty Agency, and they do not have the basic necessities such as food, clothes and heating.The recent child benefit increases in the budget include a €6 increase to €131.60 for the first and second child and an €8 increase to €165.30 for the third child and subsequent children. The Government has committed to increasing child benefit rates to €149.90 and €185.40 in this budget and the next budget, leaving gaps of €18.30 and €20.10 to be filled.The real value of this increase can be judged after taking into account the effects of inflation. According to the budget this will be approximately 2.5% in 2004 and if one looks at the rates for the first and second child, inflation erodes €3.14 of the monthly increase and the real increase is therefore €2.86 per month. This equals 66 cent a week or 10 cent a day. Is the Government living in the real world where families have to pay for the daily increases in foodstuffs, fuel and many other necessary commodities?Many Deputies have mentioned the child dependant allowance, which has been frozen since 1994. The Social Welfare Bill has included a provision whereby a spouse or partner of the claimant of child dependant allowance earning over €300 per week will no longer be entitled to the allowance. This effectively gets rid of the half payment of the child dependant allowance for families on low incomes.I was disappointed by the lack of an increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance which amounts to €80 per annum for a child aged under 12 and €150 for a child over 12. This will result in a 2.5% reduction in real terms in 2004. All of us are aware of how costly it is to clothe children on their return to school given that the cost of uniforms, footwear and school books has increased substantially in recent years. I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ring, that the guidelines for the scheme are too rigid and, thus, hundreds of families which badly need such assistance do not qualify for the scheme.With regard to unemployment benefit, the Bill makes provision that, in cases where a person claiming benefit has 260 social insurance contributions, that is, five years, the maximum number of days for payment will reduce from 390 days to 312. In other words, the payment period will reduce from 15 to 12 months. This could affect a number of women who have taken time off to rear children.I refer to the retirement and old age pensions. Age Action Ireland, which represents our elderly, called the social welfare increases disappointing. It stated: "At a time when the percentage of people over 65 living below the 60% of income poverty line has increased from 24.2% in 1997 to 43.3% in 2000, €10 will do little to tackle the plight of our poorer older people". Deputy Cooper-Flynn referred to the Government's target on old age pensions, which is to achieve a rate of €200 per week. However, this was promised by the Government parties in 1997 but they are a long way from meeting that.Many elderly people have difficulty living on their weekly pension. Many pensioners who have applied for window and door replacements under the housing aid for the elderly scheme call to my constituency office. Local authorities do not have money to fund the scheme and many pensioners are left without replacement windows and doors because they cannot afford them.

Every Member attended the launch of the association's pre-budget submission in Buswells Hotel. Only 20,538 people were eligible for the carer's allowance in 2002. However, the association estimates that 170,000 carers are looking after relatives and neighbours.Despite the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs that the means test should be abolished, this was not officially recognised in the budget or the Estimates. Instead, the weekly income disregard was increased by only €40 per week for a single person and €80 per week for couples. This means income disregards will be €250 for a single person and €500 for a couple. These increases will result in only a small number of extra claimants for the carer's allowance. The changes of which the Minister is so proud will be of no use to the vast majority of carers who provide a valuable service without recognition or gratification from the State.I am glad to have had the opportunity to contribute. The famous Fianna Fáil slogan, "A lot done, more to do", is still in fashion but the Government has done a lot of people.

I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on the excellent funding she has obtained for her Department and the substantial increase that will be provided for social services in the coming year. Deputy Durkan was a helpful Minister of State at the then Department of Social Welfare in the mid-1990s, but in that role he vigorously defended miserable increases granted by the rainbow Government. Earlier he misrepresented the record.

Child benefit will be payable in 2004 at a rate of €131.60 per month for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third and subsequent children. These are increases implemented by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	623	Fine Gael called for decentralisation but opposes it now. The Deputy should be ashamed of himself for opposing decentralisation given that his county is a beneficiary. I hope that is reported in The Clare Champion next week.The considerable increases in the rates of payment to our pensioners in recent years have been welcome. To a great extent, that is the age group which built the foundations of the success we now enjoy. Prior to the 1997 election, the Fianna Fáil Party quite rightly identified the need to give pensioners a better income as a major priority. All of those commitments have been honoured in full. Over the next three and a half years, I look forward to this Government giving further increases to our elderly. I welcome the fact that the largest ever social welfare funding will be provided for 2004, at a level of €11,262 million for 970,000 claimants. Overall, 1.5 million people will benefit from the allocations.I wish to refer to one or two small issues. I would like the Department to review the entitlements of people who are in receipt of British or US pensions following their return home, whose sole income consists of such a pension. They should qualify automatically for the various allowances. Members such as the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Ellis and I who represent Border constituencies, will be aware of the heavy levels of emigration which those areas suffered over the years. Many people return to live in their home areas when they reach pensionable age. Their sole income consists of a pension from Britain or the US and, in some cases, they are deprived of the relevant allowances because they are above the basic qualification level for an Irish pension by a very small margin. I ask the Department to review that situation.There appears to be an unduly clinical attitude to the assessment of income and calculation of the exchange rate between sterling and the euro. As a result of sterling and euro fluctuations, a person's British pension could be below our comparable in a particular week. However, depending on fluctuations within the following few weeks, they may not get the benefit of a top-up from our Department of Social and Family Affairs. That area should be streamlined. Instead of sometimes adopting a very clinical attitude when dealing with currency differentials, a practical approach should be taken. Department officials at local level should be enabled to take such a practical approach, in terms of giving people who are on the borderline of entitlement to an Irish pension the opportunity to avail of the schemes which are available to those who qualify for Irish pensions.I congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, on bringing forward a progressive and positive programme for 2004. From my contact with pensioners and people who are entitled to child benefit, I know they are very pleased with the real increase in the level of payments for the coming year. I am glad to support this legislation.
#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I join with Deputy Brendan Smith and others in welcoming the Social Welfare Bill 2003 to give effect to elements of the 2004 budget. The Bill makes a very substantial contribution to the position of people who depend on welfare as their main income. I wish to express my sincere thanks to the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance and to the Government, for supporting the decentralisation of a section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to Carrick-on-Shannon. That will be of enormous benefit and shows the Government's commitment to decentralisation. The location of that unit in the north-west, together with existing units of the same Department in Longford, Sligo and Letterkenny, will provide promotional opportunities within that area for those who re-locate as part of the decentralisation process.There is a very substantial increase in this year's budgetary provision for social welfare payments. In 1997, the figure was €273 million, as compared to the current level of €630 million. That is a dramatic increase in anybody's understanding. The number of people depending on social welfare is also relevant. In 1997, the unemployment rate was 10%. It is now 4.3%, indicating that an additional 5.7% of people are now at work in this country and making their contribution to the overall tax take of the State, including PRSI and PAYE. Furthermore, the Government has decided to continue to increase the welfare budget, rather than decreasing it in proportion to the reduction in the number of people depending on it. That is worth bearing in mind.An estimated 970,000 people, on average, are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments of various kinds. Almost 1,500,000 people will benefit, directly or indirectly, from such payments, including dependants. While there is generally a sympathetic attitude towards the elderly, this Government has ensured that they have been looked after. In 1997, the weekly old age contributory pension was €99.10. Today, it is €167.30 as a result of the budget increases. That represents an increase of almost €68 – a very significant improvement over a six-year period.This year's increase of €10 in the rate of social welfare payments is a significant milestone in terms of the Government's commitment to bring the old age pension to €200 within its lifetime. It shows commitment by the Government to fulfilling its promises. It fulfilled and even surpassed the promises it made in 1997, including the increase in the old age pension to £100 or €127. I have no doubt that if our economy continues to improve as it has over the past 12 to 18 months, we will have no problem in ensuring, within the lifetime of this Government, that the old age pension will be well in excess of the promised figure of €200.With regard to the other increases which will come into operation as a result of the recent budget, child benefit has been increased by €6 for the first and second child and €8 for the third.

However, we have a mutual understanding that if he remains silent, I will probably leave him alone.

However, his senior Minister in the then rainbow Government was not very helpful to social welfare recipients, in terms of the amounts of money he gave them.

#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	638	As far as this debate is concerned, regardless of interruptions, we have to understand that there are people in receipt of social welfare payments who have no other income – it is their main source of income. Those people must be helped. By giving an increase of €10 to old age pensioners, we ensure that their lifestyle is maintained ahead of inflation. That is important. It is also important that social welfare recipients know that other available benefits in kind are not under threat.Carers have been mentioned on numerous occasions in this debate. All Members understand that carers give an enormous commitment in looking after family members and ensuring they do not end up in residential care. This is a saving for the State. However, there is a need to examine the payment rates to carers. There has been a significant increase in the income limits. However, it should be more available in order to allow people to remain in their communities, rather than going into care. The only means by which this can be done is through a person giving up employment to become a full-time carer. This is a category that is entitled to sympathetic consideration for funding.With unemployment reduced to 4.3%, Government action is proving that it is prepared to invest in helping people out of the social welfare system and back into the employment market. However, there is a section of the unemployed that still finds it difficult to get employment. The scheme being introduced by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, for people and small farmers in rural areas will be of enormous benefit to them and their communities.According to the ESRI, the overall level of consistent poverty has dropped from 8.2% in 1998 to 5.2% in 2001 to 4.8% in 2003. If such progress can be made for the next five years in tackling poverty, we will have come a long way. Father Sean Healy and others will say that we are widening the gap between rich and poor. However, if there were not so many people at work, the amount allocated to social welfare could not continue. People do not realise that if the same amount were allocated, it would be spread among a larger number of recipients. The drop in the unemployment rate has been important in ensuring that social welfare payments can be increased to a level people expect.If we contrast the percentage increases this year to those in 1997, the old age contributory pension has increased by 68.8%. The old age non-contributory pension has increased by 79%, the long-term unemployment assistance rate by 57.3%, short-term unemployment assistance by 62.3%, unemployment and disability benefit by 57.2%. Child benefit payments have risen by 245.4%, child carer's allowance by 55.9% and carer's allowance for those over 66 years by 76.2%. The Government has narrowed the gap between the widow's pensions and other pensions by increasing it by 55.4%. This is important because all Members will accept that widows suffered because of the way the social welfare system was structured in the past. Hopefully, during the lifetime of this Government, the widow's pension will be on a par with the non-contributory old age pension. There have been significant increases in the family income supplement thresholds by €28 and a €7 increase in the minimum payment for respite care grants to €835 per annum from June 2004.The biggest change in social welfare payments is that the benefits are payable at the beginning of the year. For too long, social welfare increases were given but not applied until June, July and even August of the following year. In some cases, they were only paid for three months of the year.Budget day was a great day with regard to decentralisation. The Social Welfare Bill 2003 is only the icing on the cake.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	641	This country is one of the richest in the world. For the past seven years, phenomenal growth in the economy has been reached. We have witnessed money thrown around like confetti as if there were no tomorrow, in many cases for specific political gain. Choices were made which provided more than generous tax breaks for the wealthy. The introduction of the SSIA scheme for people who never demanded such a generous scheme will cost up to €5 billion and was never part of an election promise. It is in this context that we must assess the detail of this Bill, the budget and the Book of Estimates.I acknowledge the general increase of €10 a week to social welfare recipients in the budget and provided for in the Social Welfare Bill 2003. However, up to 1 million people who rely entirely on welfare payments still find it difficult to live and bring their families up in dignity. The budget increases are the only ones they receive in the year, while having to endure the continuous introduction of stealth taxes. ESB charges have risen by nearly 27% since the Government came into power. The TV licence has risen by €43 to €150. Eircom bills, stamp prices, transportation costs and gas bills have all increased. These all affect low-earners much more than those with means.

#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The Government entered into the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, and undertook to achieve a rate of social welfare payment of €150 per week in 2002 terms for the lowest rate of payment by budget 2007. To meet that target payment, it will have to rise by nearly €50 for each of the next three budgets. The Labour Party will pursue this issue vigorously to ensure that at least this Government promise is carried out.A budget cannot be considered in isolation, particularly in an election year. That applies this year as the Book of Estimates, containing 16 savage cuts, will have implications for thousands of families. Lest the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan and the Government backbenchers lose the run of themselves, it is widely acknowledged that the 2003 social welfare increases were an insult to the poorest. A person on the lowest rate of payment on unemployment assistance will receive a real increase this year of 30 cent per week. An unemployed couple with one child are 25 cent per week better off this year. This is some commitment to the less well-off in our society.It is important to assess the policy direction of Government in eliminating poverty and to the concept of equality which is enshrined in the Constitution. I compliment the various groups working to enhance the quality of life of the disadvantaged, and acknowledge their helpful submissions to us and to Government.There is a very interesting chart in the CORI justice commission's analysis of the budget, which outlines how much people's take home income has increased under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments since 1997. Following seven budgets a single person's real increase is about €50 which is about €7 per year. The choices made by the Government are shown in that a couple with one earner who brings in €50,000 got an increase of nearly €310 in those seven budgets. Couples with two earners who bring in €75,000 between them got an increase of €543.Given the Government's policy of individualisation, it has decided on a particular direction for tax, but for social welfare it has disregarded the concept of individualisation when it suits. Section 12 proposes to amend the supplementary welfare allowance scheme by providing that rent and mortgage interest payments will not be made where the spouse or partner of a claimant is in full-time employment.At the moment a community welfare officer has discretion in the case of a person in low-income employment of €14,000 to €17,000 with a wife at home looking after the children. Such a couple cannot get local authority housing, but might be on a housing list. If their rent is excessive they can put a case to a community welfare officer. If the wife or spouse can get supplementary welfare or rent supplement to help them pay for the cost of the house, the husband can remain in employment.When the new regulation comes in community welfare officers will be prohibited from giving such a person rent supplement because the spouse is working. The net effect is that a couple trying their best to remain in a working environment and look after their family have no alternative. They are faced with either the loss of the roof over their heads or the loss of a job, and many of them will reluctantly choose the house and give up employment. The Government claims to aspire to get people into employment, yet it introduces legislation that discriminates against people who have a right to work and have a home of their own.My colleague, Deputy McManus, will deal with the cuts in some detail. The cuts are draconian in their effect on people's quality of life. In her speech the Minister said rent supplement would continue to be available to those on the housing list. I am delighted she listened to the Labour Party in agreeing to this. While this is acceptable if there is uniformity in the application of the policy throughout the country, the Estimates and the budget are bad for people in need. It will be up to the Labour Party when it next gets into Government to row back the vicious cuts.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I need to set the record straight. Deputy Ellis spoke about unemployment levels. The quarterly national household survey revealed today that the unemployment rate has gone up from 4.4% to 5.2% in the third quarter of 2003.This debate is taking place on a day when a major new ESRI report shows definitively that not only is Ireland a deeply divided country in terms of poverty and wealth but that the gap is getting wider. People on low incomes are getting poorer relative to those on high incomes. A very clear picture is painted. Despite the economic boom and its potential to create a more equal society the proportion of people in relative income poverty has more than doubled since 1994.This is not happening as a result of an act of God or nature. Growing inequality in our society is the direct result of a systematic policy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to marginalise further persons and communities who do not carry political clout.The author of the ESRI report, Christopher Whelan, has pointed out that welfare increases are well behind increases in real incomes and that significant groups are drifting from what would be considered a reasonable standard of living. He stated that to participate in society without shame and with dignity requires higher incomes. Not being able to do so leads to a day-to-day life of economic brinkmanship, financial strain and psychological distress. In particular, single mothers and older people are at risk, as are people suffering from illness and disability. It is the job of the Government to address the needs of these vulnerable groups. This is what being in power should be all about. However, the Government has no intention of tackling inequality.Deputy Ned O'Keeffe has said this is the most right-wing Government this country ever had and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, is determined to prove him right. While she can bluster her way through questions about the savage 16 cutbacks, she cannot avoid responsibility for the hardship these cuts will cause. While the Minister savages the poor, her Government continues to safeguard tax breaks for the wealthy, and the chasm between the two widens.A community so divided is not a healthy community, nor is it a safe one. The health status of our society depends on narrowing that gap. Tackling the causes of crime must be fundamental to any initiative against crime today, and this means tackling the causes of disadvantage. We know from international experience that socio-economic factors are major determinants of the health status of an individual. What is remarkable and unique about the two-tier nature of the Irish health service is that it militates directly against those most in need of health care and in favour of the better off who generally suffer less ill health.This inequity has been exacerbated by a Government policy on health that ensures that fewer people in our population than ever before are eligible for medical cards. Excluding the wealthier over 70s, the number of income-related medical card holders has dropped to an all-time low of 27.7% from the 38% who were covered in the early 1970s when the scheme was introduced and when this country was considerably less well-off than it is now.The low income ceiling for medical card cover can only be described as criminal. Despite this, the Government has refused point blank to ease the hardship imposed by the onerous income limits. For a single person aged up to 66 years, the allowable income per week is €138. For a married couple, it is €200. It costs between €30 and €45 to visit a family doctor and up to €78 a month to pay for medications. At the previous general election, Fianna Fáil promised that 200,000 new medical cards would be issued. The record shows that, far from receiving medical cards, people are losing them when they experience a slight rise in income.Outside the House, the Minister for Health and Children stated that the increases in social welfare payments announced in the budget would not affect medical card eligibility. There is nothing in the Social Welfare Bill to indicate that this is anything other than another hollow Fianna Fáil promise. I would like clarification of the protections these people are to be afforded. It is an important issue. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs must spell out how social welfare recipients and minimum wage earners will be able to hold on to their precious medical cards when their incomes creep over the limit.I take this opportunity to nail the lie that no crèches will close. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs attempted to peddle this line on "Morning Ireland" but her contention simply does not stand up to scrutiny. In my constituency, two crèches are threatened with closure in the new year. Of these, one is part of a vocational training opportunities scheme programme which provides people with a second chance to receive an education while the other is part of a programme specifically designed to provide for teenage mothers and their babies. The latter programme was established to create training, education and employment possibilities for young mothers. It is not possible to conceive of a more valuable and cost-effective initiative, yet Government cutbacks will starve this essential service out of existence.I also take this opportunity to condemn the Minister for her callous disregard of the people who care for the elderly, sick and disabled. Carers save the State a fortune by providing high-quality, loving care. They have received shabby treatment in the budget. Under the able chairmanship of Deputy Penrose, the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs produced an excellent report on the position of full-time carers. There is a wide consensus which supports putting more resources into home care.The committee's report pinpointed various problems and loopholes in respect of carers which must be addressed. The committee's direct and pointed recommendations include a grant of 50% of the carer's allowance to persons in receipt of widow's or widower's payment, a waiver of the 15 month restriction where a person gives up a job to provide care, and payment of the respite care grant to any carer regardless of which social welfare payment the carer is in receipt. The committee also recommended the provision through the travel pass scheme of a subsidised private taxi payment to rural dwelling carers who cannot access public transport. In particular, the committee recommended the integration of health and social services delivery to ensure that health and social services work together in a manner which fully recognises carers as key partners in the provision of care.All too often, an integrated approach is lacking and people suffer as a consequence. The recommendations of the joint committee were produced across party lines. While any improvement is welcome, it is terribly disappointing to discover that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, failed to understand and appreciate the value of carers. If we lose their contributions, we will have to pay considerable amounts of money to replace the valuable work they do.Simple measures could have been introduced which would have had a transforming effect on the lives of carers and those dependent on them for care. Despite their potential cost effectiveness, they are not being provided. It is a terrible pity that, instead of making the kinds of changes which could end the marginalisation of many, a budget has been introduced which shores up inequality and cuts social provision. The budget demonstrates a lack of imagination and understanding about what it means to be poor and dependent. It is blinkered to real needs and challenges to which the Government is immune and from which it is disconnected.
#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	646	When the rainbow coalition was in power, it spent its time pontificating about social justice. It did nothing positive to alleviate poverty and its related problems. Pensioners received minimal increases over the coalition's three budgets. Former Members of that Government choose to forget these facts. Critics of this budget must be reminded of their own sad social welfare record. To find a contrast, one needs only to look at the record of the current Government. It has reduced our unemployment level to half the EU average which has enabled it to fund major improvements in social welfare and to tackle poverty. Fianna Fáil has introduced the most generous social welfare improvements since the foundation of this State.Despite increasing pressure on the national economy, the Government has once again delivered substantial budget increases to the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. Its performance in this area is unmatched. Social welfare expenditure in 2004 will amount to €11.3 billion. Social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost €630 million, which is €100 million more than last year. These figures stand in stark comparison to the €273 million allocated in this portfolio by the rainbow coalition in 1997. Expenditure in 2004 will be roughly two and a half times greater than the level set by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.The Government has ensured that people with disability will enjoy the dignified standard of living to which they are entitled. In 1997, the rainbow coalition paid those on disability benefit the equivalent of a mere €85.73 per week. This represented a derisory increase of €3.81 over three budgets. Since 1997, disability benefit has been increased by €49.07 and now stands at €134.80. On top of the Estimate allocation, a further €25 million has been allocated to support persons with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities. These figures speak for themselves.The Government has greatly improved the living standards of older people in society. When Members on the Opposition benches were last in office, increases in old age pensions ran substantially below the rate of inflation. This year, the old age contributory pension has been increased by 6.4%. The budget provides for a €10 per week increase in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions. In 2004, the old age contributory pension will stand at €167.30 per week. This measure goes a long way to ensuring the Government will reach its target on pensions of more than €200 per week before the end of its term in office. The pension rate is well ahead of inflation and represents a real improvement for older people.Opposition parties say we have done nothing about child poverty. I take this opportunity to set the record straight. During our period in office, we have more than trebled the child benefit payment rates, a record of which the Opposition cannot boast. Between 1997 and 2001, there was a 58% decrease in the rate of consistent poverty numbers among children. The rate has fallen steadily from 15.3% under the rainbow coalition in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available. Unprecedented increases in child benefit since we returned to Government in 1997 have also played a significant role in the reduction of child poverty. Following this budget, increases in child benefit given by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will mean the child benefit rate will be €131.60 for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third and any subsequent child.Opposition comments describing Government neglect of the poor are simply untrue. Old age pensions have increased by well over two thirds, disability benefits have increased substantially and child benefits have increased by a significant 350%. These are the facts and nobody can dispute them.Labour Party speakers like to quote statements we were reported to have made during the election campaign of 2002. They conveniently forget, however, that they promised during their campaign to raid the fund we put in place to guarantee future pensions. The Labour Party did not say where it would get the money needed to pay for pensions. It should volunteer that information during the debate on this Bill as it owes an explanation to taxpayers who are funding social welfare payments. Does the Labour Party propose to increase personal taxation? We should hear from them now. It is of interest to those who are nearing pension age that the Labour Party wants to abolish the National Pensions Reserve Fund, established by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The fund will be self-funding for some pensions by 2020.I would like to speak about those who helped to build this country when they were younger. Such people deserve the full financial support the country can afford at this time. The fact that older people will receive increases that are three times the rate of inflation is welcomed across the country. I was at a Christmas party for senior citizens in Cork last Sunday.

#NoelOFlynn	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-party	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-dob	unknown-#NoelOFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Such people, who are found throughout the country, spend a great deal of time caring for older people in their communities. The Government accepts that it has to care for them financially and to put in place provisions to that end in the budget. I may speak again about older people, who have a special place in my heart at this time of the year and at all times of the year, if time permits.The phrase "dancing on the head of a pin" is not used enough. It describes the approach to life that prevents a person from seeing the big picture. The phrase comes to mind when one listens to the ridiculous statements coming from the other side of the House. The annual report of the Combat Poverty Agency states that the best of the two ways out of poverty is employment. The other way out of poverty is increased social welfare payments.The Social Welfare Bill proves that the Government is delivering social welfare payments. The social welfare measures in the budget for 2004 will accrue mostly to those at the lower end of the income distribution scale. Such people would experience a significant deterioration in their income without such measures. The most significant net income gains will be enjoyed by those on the lowest incomes. Much smaller gains will accrue to those in middle to high income brackets. The budget announced last week is highly progressive. Those who depend on social welfare will receive the greatest gains from it. It ensures that the lowest income groups will gain progressively from welfare payments to a greater extent than higher income groups, which will contribute progressively more to the cost of public service provision. The overall distributional effect is similar to that in budget 2003, but there will be a greater impact this year as a consequence of the increased payments across the different sectors.The Conference of Religious of Ireland is not well-known for supporting the decisions of this or previous Governments. In its critique of last week's budget, however, CORI said:We acknowledge the social welfare increases were well ahead of what pundits had forecast. We also acknowledge the Minister's statement that he will implement the social welfare commitments contained in Sustaining Progress.According to a recent ESRI report, consistent poverty has been reduced significantly from 14.5% in 1994 to 4.9% in 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available. Long-term unemployment, which is one of the greatest causes of poverty, has decreased from over 5% in 1997 to approximately 1.5% today. One cannot deny that progress has been made in alleviating poverty.It is clear that we have delivered on our promise to increase social welfare payments. Despite the fact that it is the best way out of poverty, it is not well recognised that employment creation is the other way out of poverty. Fianna Fáil has undeniably delivered in this regard since it returned to Government in 1997. One should not forget that the national debt has almost been halved since 1997. Ireland has the second lowest debt in the European Union. Its debt repayments are at their lowest level since the early 1980s. When debt servicing costs, which are a factor in public expenditure across the EU, are excluded, Irish public expenditure is 43.7%, which is close to the EU average of 44.3%. Ireland's level of public expenditure is remarkably high, especially when one considers our low levels of national debt and unemployment.Certain Deputies on the Opposition side would love to see increases in corporation tax and PAYE. As revenue is required to fund social spending, should we not set tax rates to maximise revenue, which is what the Government has done since 1997? Reductions in income tax between 1997 and 2002 have resulted in an increase in receipts of 41%. Reductions in corporation tax in the same period have resulted in an increase in receipts of 93%. We reduced corporation tax to promote enterprise. The level of unemployment is half what it was in 1997. If we allow for recent increases in the unemployment rate, it is a resilient performance for a small, open economy during an international downturn.We must be competitive in a real way if we are to create and keep employment in Ireland. Low corporation tax provides a competitive edge on other countries which are looking for foreign direct investment. We need to make the best use of our advantages. An increase in corporation tax would jeopardise our success in creating jobs. It would risk a return to the dark days of the 1980s when many of my generation were forced to emigrate. Our unemployment rate is half the eurozone average. The fact that we do not have to spend as much of our resources on supporting those without jobs as we did ten years ago is a consequence of our success.Social welfare expenditure has increased despite the decrease in unemployment. Although the unemployment rate has halved from over 10% in 1997 to under 5% today, we have increased social welfare expenditure by over €4 billion since 1997, to over €11.4 billion today. The Government has acted positively to help those on lower pay. It introduced the minimum wage, which will increase by 10% next year. An extra 41,000 people will be taken out of the tax net in 2004, meaning that 35% of those on the tax record will not pay tax.The Opposition's withering comments about the Government's neglect of the poor in Ireland are simply untrue. This is demonstrated by an examination of the increases in social welfare payments. In our efforts to tackle poverty, old age pensions have increased by well over two thirds. Child benefit is up more than 300%. I must keep saying that, and I hope that other members of the Government parties will keep saying it, since it does not seem to be getting through to the other side of the House. The revenues to fund those increases have been generated by a low-tax, competitive and enterprising economy. Increasing taxes would jeopardise jobs and the revenues necessary for the social provision that we all want for all sectors of the community unable to care for themselves.I will return to the issue of the elderly. This is the time of year when we see advertisements for Christmas gifts for children. They started at the end of August. We were talking about advertising in the House last night, wasting a great deal of time on a Bill which there was no need to introduce. Those three hours of Opposition time could have been used for more productive gain than what we had to endure last night, especially with the BCI already introducing the code, moving it forward and, shortly, publishing it.There has been a strong media campaign by advertisers for some time. We are all made aware of those coming festivities at an earlier date every year. The lead-in period seems to extend every year. Thoughts of the Christmas season and anticipation of the joy and happiness it brings to us all are with us at this time of year, and it would be nice if we used the extended run-in time to give more intense focus to our thoughts on a sector of society that needs our increased care and support at this time.I refer, of course, to the elderly who live alone and may not have any living relatives. I think of the elderly who may have lost contact with their sons or daughters through family circumstances. I think of them alone with their thoughts on Christmas Day. Memories of the past in remembrance of loved ones long gone will come to their minds. The joy and the happiness they see around them will remind them of olden days and better times. Christmas to them can be a very sad time. We have been and are supporting the elderly by giving them increases, but it is not enough. We must give more to the elderly. We must all give more time to them and spend longer looking after them. That is why I praised the voluntary sector for the work that it is doing.We should stay in touch with the elderly in our locality and in the extended community, not only at Christmas but throughout the 12 months of the year. I believe that we owe a debt to those people who worked so hard to build up this country over the last few decades. It will not be long for us. If we all live for another decade or 15 years, some of us will be in that category ourselves. We will be seeking support and comfort from people of a different generation. While we are getting on with our busy lives up here, my message for those who care for the elderly, and those who forget to do so, is that they should please give them the gift of their time this Christmas, even if that means only calling in to see them, spending some time with them and seeing that they have enough food on the table and if there is anything they can do to support them. I am almost 100% sure in saying that a lonely older person would prefer someone's time to the significant increases we will give them from 1 January.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	662	As two of my party colleagues, Deputies Crowe and Ferris, have already spoken comprehensively on this Bill, I wish to concentrate primarily on changes regarding the rent supplement. The attack on the rent supplement whereby applicants must have been renting for at least six months is scandalous and reprehensible. It will have dreadful consequences for many people. The Government has chosen to attack rent allowance for the second consecutive year, following last year's unreasonable cap on rent allowance at €107. While the rent supplement scheme is flawed and does not represent a preferable method of assisting people in housing, in the absence of housing reform it fulfils a necessary function which enables many people who would otherwise become homeless to remain in private rented accommodation. Rent supplement is necessary because the Government continues to fail to fund social housing adequately and has failed to cap rents in the private rented sector.It is not good enough for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to attempt to rebut criticism of that callous change by stating that rent supplement is not a housing measure. It clearly is a housing measure, and I can refer to a Minister in support of my claim. Speaking in this House recently in defence of the Government's policy on housing, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, stated:The general strategy for realising this aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves with the aid of the fiscal incentives available and that those unable to do so from their own resources have access to social housing or to income support to secure and to retain private housing.Who is correct? Those two Ministers are clearly at odds. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, claimed that rent supplement formed part of the Government's effort to address the housing needs of the less well-off. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, on the other hand, claims that is not the case. Such lack of co-ordination and failure to accept responsibility shows a very slipshod attitude towards the housing needs of citizens of the State.A significant number of non-governmental organisations working with the homeless – those experiencing housing difficulty, the elderly, young people and refugees – have come out in opposition to the move, among them are Threshold, the Simon Communities of Ireland, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, the Irish Refugee Council, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, Age Action, the Children's Rights Alliance, Women's Aid, the One Parent Exchange Network, and Cherish, the National Association of Single Parent Families. All claimed that the Department's new restriction is unnecessary and only serves to highlight the lack of joined-up thinking characterising social housing policy.It is unacceptable that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, showed no regard for the consequences of the change for people at risk of becoming homeless. It contradicts the Government's stated aim of preventing homelessness. Many people will not be able to meet the six-month condition. They include refugees, those who become unemployed within six months of moving into private rented accommodation, women who become lone parents and move out of overcrowded accommodation in the family home, and those who become separated and have to move out.No evidence has been put forward to show the necessity of this change, and it appears from the disagreement between the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that there has been no cross-departmental consultation on its impact or implementation. As far as the Government was concerned, it was merely a fiscal action implemented at the stroke of a pen without any regard for the consequences for those whom it will affect most.The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has suggested that the change will help people trapped in private rented accommodation who will be eligible for social housing, as local authorities do not treat people receiving rent supplement as a priority. That argument essentially amounts to pushing people out onto the streets and telling them that it is for their own good because, if they are homeless, the local authority will accommodate them much more quickly. Members should think about that for a moment. Are we supposed to take that argument seriously? If local authorities do not house people who ought to be eligible for social housing, it is because the Government has failed to meet its own social housing investment targets. An example of that can be seen in the way successive Governments have ignored the Kenny report on dealing with the housing issue since as far back as 1973. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs must accept that, until the Government ensures that local authorities are given the resources necessary to house all those eligible and in need of social housing, rent supplement will continue to have a role in enabling people to house themselves. I urge the Minister to reverse the changes regarding the six-month condition. I urge the removal of the €107 cap on rent allowance, which is causing severe hardship, because little rental accommodation is available which costs less than that.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	663	This Bill does not deserve a Second Reading because it provides for the implementation of social welfare cutbacks which will undoubtedly cause serious hardship for people on meagre incomes. These cutbacks have been rightly condemned by many groups which work with the homeless, special child care projects and marginalised people. I listened to the IMPACT representative on "Morning Ireland" this morning and he suggested some of these cutbacks have more to do with administrative convenience and interdepartmental squabbling than anything else. If that is the case, it is a deplorable state of affairs. On the same programme, the Minister seemed to unwittingly confirm this by passing the buck in regard to responsibility for new applicants for rent supplement to the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities. She seemed to deny the reality that there is already a huge housing crisis with long waiting lists and no housing capacity to provide for the needs of those homeless people, hundreds and thousands of whom linger in hostels, bed and breakfast accommodation and shop doorways on the streets of our capital city. The Government cannot provide for these people let alone the many applicants who will come forward for rent supplement through no fault of their own.I agree with the IMPACT representative that this will be devastating, in particular for many young vulnerable homeless people. To refuse rent supplements without putting in place alternative housing measures demonstrates a disgraceful lack of social responsibility. This is also the case in regard to the Minister's removal of crèche supplements with a casual comment that no crèche will close and that direct funding of crèches is preferable, despite the fact that child care supplements are paid out only after careful assessment of individual exceptional needs. This particular cutback means the Government is now targeting toddlers and denying children in the most deprived circumstances a place in a crèche, without providing genuine alternative funding.In that context, I refer to the statement of the Dublin city child care committee, which expressed its deep concern and anger at the decision to withdraw child care payments through the supplementary welfare scheme. It goes on to state that children whose parents are dependent on social welfare find themselves deprived of access to places in crèches, nurseries and play groups. These services are among the first lines of support for children who are at risk of problems such as addiction, early school leaving, anti-social behaviour and criminal activity. It points out that the report, Investing in Parenthood 2002, highlights that early childhood intervention is vital to reduce the risk of these problems. The Dublin city child care committee urgently seeks a meeting with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to defer actions which will further marginalise the most vulnerable children in society. I hope the Minister responds positively to that request and to the wishes of that organisation and defers or eliminates these cutbacks.Yesterday, I attended the presentation of certificates by the Lourdes youth and community services project, which is a valuable and worthwhile project in the north inner city. Certificates were presented to successful trainees and some of the young single parents who spoke having received them pointed out that without child care supplements, they would not have been in a position to attend courses to better themselves. These parents and the community projects which provide such valuable services to disadvantaged communities will suffer as a result of these cuts.As Deputy Morgan pointed out, the cuts in rent supplement have been roundly condemned by every organisation representing the homeless. They state that they will exacerbate the already unacceptable levels of homelessness. Since these cutbacks will particularly target young single people, we will see more young people in blankets in doorways on the main streets of Dublin and other towns and cities. The cutbacks will drive more young people into the despair which puts them at the mercy of drug dealers, leading to the spectacle of people living on the streets, which is already a black mark and a blight on Ireland and the Government. It is disgraceful that this cutback should be introduced and it will add to this already serious problem.While I have always been appalled at the incredible amounts of money which end up in the pockets of landlords who exploit the homeless and at the lack of accommodation, the real fault lies at the feet of the Government for failing to use the billions of euro of Celtic tiger surpluses to provide sufficient social and affordable housing. If that had been done, the money would have been put to a more meaningful use and the rent supplement would not be necessary on the same scale.This is increasingly becoming an unequal and divided society. I understand Ireland now has the greatest social inequality of any EU country, with an ever-increasing gap between the affluent and those on the margins. In deference to my colleague, Deputy Sargent, I will conclude.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	664	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis na Teachtaí Gregory agus Morgan as a gcuid ama a roinnt.I pay tribute to Mr. Noel Cleere of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul whose death was reported today at 65 years of age. He was a man who we might have expected to benefit from some of the care which the organisation has given to so many in their older years. It is a tragedy that a man like this is no longer with us. He was an example to many in this society in respect of the spirit which should prevail, particularly at Christmas. It is difficult for his family and we extend our sympathy to them.As Mr. Cleere would have often said, it is unacceptable to live in a society in which the poor are always being told to wait, that they will get their reward in due course and that they must accept things as they are. The reality is we live in an unequal society and the Social Welfare Bill 2003 does no more than tinker with that inequality. It provides a complex matrix of shifting and cross-referenced figures about which one would need to be well-fed and rested to come to terms with, even on a good day. The complexity of the social welfare system which is part of Government policy in this and other countries is but one good reason the Green Party argues for the introduction of a guaranteed basic income.The Government has nodded in the direction of acknowledging the benefits of this from time to time in discussions and by way of introducing a Green Paper, etc. However, the Government must firm up its policy in this area. The fact that such an income would be universal and not taxed gives it a particular appeal for those who have felt marginalised. These individuals would receive the same payments as others, although the rich would not benefit because the tax system would be adapted to take them into account. Such an income could be seen as a basis of citizenship and a dividend in the country. Everyone would be in a position to declare themselves equal in terms of citizenship. We could then work on the position vis-à-vis their incomes.At this point it is worth engaging in a comparison between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Agriculture and Food. The latter has been coming to terms with the phenomenon of decoupling. To some extent there has been a period of empowerment in that people involved in agriculture have come to realise that they will receive a payment but that it will not be conditional on production. The Department of Social and Family Affairs must learn, to a certain degree, from the phenomenon of decoupling and its effect on the agricultural community. Although the Minister may state with some fanfare that, in 2004, unemployment assistance will rise from €124.80 to €134.80, people remain unable to break away from the social welfare system for fear of losing a payment here or there, being left in a poverty trap or falling between stools. As a result, the potential and incentive to empower people is lost. When people fall upon hard times, they become disempowered.If the Government is even to reach the target of €150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest rates of social welfare by 2007 in the national anti-poverty strategy review, a much higher level of increase in unemployment assistance will be required. We estimate that an increase of €14 in 2005, €16 in 2006 and perhaps €17 or €19 in 2007 will be needed. The cost of living is rising more quickly than that.There is a need to address the widening gap highlighted by the Conference of Religious in Ireland, which has stated that, since coming to power in 1997, the Government has widened the rich-poor gap by €294 per week or €15,341 per year. In making these calculations, CORI has included both pay increases and tax reductions as well as social welfare increases. It has also included the impact of the new savings scheme which better-off people can access but which is beyond the reach of Ireland's poorest people. That is a terrible indictment of the Government. The problem, which is worsening all the time, must be addressed.As the Government effectively depends on unemployment to keep down wages, it must be honest and state that it is probably more afraid of Honduras and other countries with low wage economies than it is of the Opposition in this House. At Christmas time, we are all aware of the exploitation of workers who create products for the consumer society in the West and who are paid €4 for a 12 hour day. These people are now losing out to those in other countries who are paid as little as €1 per day.Although the Government boasts that Ireland has the most globalised economy in the world, it must be borne in mind that this is also a curse because it makes it difficult for us to become self-reliant in any area other than, perhaps, that of beef production. That is the reality with which we are faced. It is not adequate to refer to a few euro being saved here and there. What we need to do is address fundamentally the widening gap between rich and poor and consider how we can become more self-reliant when global conditions make it difficult for us to get by.

#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	667	I welcome the increase in social welfare under this year's budget. It will cost an additional €630 million in a full year and is an increase of €100 million on last year. This means that social welfare spending has increased from €5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected €11.26 billion in 2004. For every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2004, €1 will go towards social welfare. Two out of every five people will benefit from these social welfare payments.The increase of €10 in all weekly social welfare payments is well ahead of the rate of inflation and represents an increase ranging from 6% to 8% which, in the case of the lowest payments, is more than three times the expected rate of inflation of 2.5% in 2004. The increase of €11.50 per week for widows and widowers aged 65 and over and in receipt of contributory pensions is welcome, as are the €6 and €8 increases in child benefit, which will take effect in 2004, and the €28 per week increase in the family income supplement threshold. I also welcome the €100 increase in the respite care grant. This will give someone caring for one person €835, or €1,670 to someone caring for more than one person.I welcome the increase in the weekly income disregard for the carer's allowance of €40 for single people and €80 for couples. This means that the first €250 of a single person's income and the first €500 of those of married couples will be disregarded. That is a large increase. When the carer's allowance was first introduced, I had to inform most people attending my clinic that they would not qualify. In recent years, however, I have been able to inform the majority that they qualify.I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs which recently launched a report which calls for no means test on the carer's allowance. Everyone is aware that this will cost money and take time to achieve. However, I welcome the move towards achieving it.I also support home-based subvention which was not introduced in this budget but which we hope will be put in place in future. This subvention would give people the choice to remain in their own homes. At present, financial considerations encourage people to enter nursing homes. I have nothing against such homes but everybody should have the choice to remain at home for as long as possible. If home-based subventions were introduced, they would level the playing field.Since the Government took office, the number of people at work has increased to approximately 1.8 million and the rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.3%. In addition, the number of lower-paid people removed from the tax net has increased. In 2004, 35% of all those on tax records will not pay tax.All the Government's budgets have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of older people in society in terms of their pensions. In the 1997 election campaign we promised to increase old age pensions to at least €137 or £100 during the Government's term of office. We delivered on this commitment. In the 2002 campaign we promised to increase the State pension to €200 per week and we will deliver on this commitment during the current term of office. The budget for 2004 has put us well on track to deliver as it provides for a €10 increase in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions. It is worth emphasising that when this Government was returned to office in June 1997 child benefit was payable at the rate of €39.09 per month for the first and second child and €49.52 for the third child and subsequent children. The priority attached by the Government to increasing child benefit means child benefit will now be payable at the rate of €131.60 for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third child and subsequent children, an increase of three and a half times the amount it was when the Government took office.Many people who will receive increases in their social welfare payments are in receipt of differential rents from local authorities. Perhaps the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Social and Family Affairs will ensure there is no increase in local authority rents. It is not fair to give increases on one hand and take them away with the other.I compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who has shown, in this Bill, that she is a caring Minister.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	668	I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who is, as Deputy Callanan rightly said, a caring Minister. We are lucky to have had, during the past six and a half years, two excellent Ministers dealing with social welfare. The former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, excelled in that area during the Government's previous term in office.I also compliment the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kirk, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on securing the offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs for Drogheda. My constituency is located two miles from Drogheda and the people of Meath welcome the location of these offices in Drogheda. Deputy Kirk and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources are to be complimented on their achievements in that regard.The social welfare improvements in this year's budget will cost €630 million in a full year, a massive increase of €100 million on last year. This nails the lie that has been peddled about social welfare cutbacks. The €630 million figure for this year stands in stark comparison to €273 million in the rainbow Government's last budget in 1997. It means social welfare expenditure in 2004 will be almost two and a half times the level set by Labour and Fine Gael when last in government. Furthermore, as a result of changes made in the 2002 budget, all social welfare weekly increases will be paid with effect from 1 January. As a result, increases for those dependent on social welfare are payable more than five months earlier than when Fine Gael and Labour were in government. An estimated 970,000 people are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year and almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, or two out of every five people in the State will benefit from these payments.The increase of €10 in all weekly social welfare payments is well ahead of the rate of inflation. It represents an increase from 6% to 8% which, in respect of the lowest payments, is more than three times the expected rate of inflation of 2.5% in 2004. The number of people in employment has increased to almost 1.8 million; unemployment rates have fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.3%; the number of low paid removed from the tax net has increased and in 2004 35% of all those on the tax record will pay no tax; social welfare spending has increased from €5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected €11.26 billion in 2004, almost double the rate of inflation; payment rates for recipients and their families have been considerably improved in real terms; substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented; and new social welfare benefits such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grant and the respite care grant have been introduced and enhanced.In the budget, personal rates for disability-unemployment benefit have been increased by €10 to €134.80. In their final budget the rainbow parties increased this by a mere €3.81 to €85.73. Other key positive measures in the budget include an increase of €28 in the threshold for family income supplement and a €7 increase in the minimum payment; an increase in the respite care grant to €835 per annum from June 2004; and an increase in the widowed parent grant to €2,700 from budget day.The overall level of consistent poverty in 1998 was, according to the ESRI, 8.2%. This level has been reduced by more than one third to 5.2% by 2001, the latest year for which figures are available. All budgets introduced by this Government have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of elderly people in our society in terms of pensions. At the 1997 election, the Government promised to increase old age pensions to at least €127 – £100 per week – during its term in office, and it delivered on this commitment. At the 2002 election, the Government promised to increase the State pension to €200 per week during its term in office and it will deliver on and exceed this commitment.The budget puts us well on track to deliver. It provides for a €10 per week increase in the full personal rate of old age and related pensions. People with selective political memories should not be allowed to forget that in the three budgets introduced by the rainbow Government, the then Labour Party Minister for Finance gave pensioners a total average increase of €2.95. In contrast, the average increase to pensioners under this budget stands at a massive €9.75. In percentage terms, the old age contributory pension increased by less than 10% during the rainbow Government's time in office while this Government has increased the amount by well over two thirds. The figures speak for themselves. In monetary terms, the statistics are even more stark. The effect of the increases under Fianna Fáil is that the rate of old age contributory pension will now stand at €167.30 per week. This is a monumental increase on the €99 per week which was the payable rate on the day the champions of social justice in Fine Gael and Labour left office. The increases in pensions this year are real and well ahead of inflation. Our critics on the Opposition benches should explain the reason old age pension increases were below the rate of inflation when they were last in office.The widow's contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit increased by €11.50 per week. In its last budget, the rainbow Government increased this by a miserable €3.81. In this budget, all other personal weekly rates increased by €10 per week. The budget provides for a special increase of €16.10 in the invalidity pension qualified adult allowance rate where the qualified adult is aged 66 or over.Building on the massive increases we have devoted to child benefit, this year we are providing an additional €81.88 million in a full year to further increase this vital support. Child benefit rates will increase by €6 per month for the first and second child and by €8 per month for the third child and subsequent children. To appreciate the scale of child benefit increases under Fianna Fáil-led Governments, it is worth emphasising that when we returned to government in June 1997, child benefit was payable at a rate of €38 per month for the first and second child and at €49.52 for the third child and subsequent children. The priority the Fianna Fáil-led Governments have attached to child benefit means that following the budget, child benefit will be payable at a rate of €131.60 for the first and second child, and €165.30 for the third child and subsequent children. This means that the rate of child benefit payment has increased by three and a half times the figure it was on the day we took over from the rainbow Government.Over 41,000 taxpayers will be removed from the tax net next year. In comparison, 38,000 taxpayers were removed from the tax net as a result of the measures introduced in the budgets of the rainbow Government. This means Fianna Fáil has removed more people from the tax net in one year than the rainbow Government did in its three budgets. The scale of this achievement is further enhanced when one considers this has been done in the midst of the greatest global downturn in 20 years.Tax reductions of €300 million have been outlined in this budget and build on the €5 billion in taxpayers' money we have put back in Irish workers' pockets over the past six years. This means we have provided €3.8 billion more in tax reductions than the previous Government. To keep the income tax burden low, especially for the lower paid, this budget increases the employee tax credit by €240 to €1,040 per annum. This will continue to ensure that tax is not payable on 90% of the minimum wage. The budget also increases the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over by €500 for single persons and €1,000 for married persons, bringing them to €15,500 for single persons and €31,000 for married persons.

He referred to home help and the good the Government has done in this area. I received a letter from a constituent today on the subject of home help. The letter opens with the following: "I am writing to you to highlight a situation in east Galway which is dreadful, mean, uncaring and horrible."  The daughter-in-law of an 87 year old woman who lives alone wrote the letter. The old woman has had an hour of home help on five mornings a week since her son's death in the late 1970s, but the service has been withdrawn. The letter concludes with the writer asking that the service be restored before it is too late. When one is 87 years old, one would want to quickly get whatever is coming one's way. Is this an example of a caring Government or a caring Minister? There are huge gaps in the system.A cancer sufferer telephoned me recently and told me that although she was slightly over the limit for a medical card last year, the health board was in a position to grant her a card on medical grounds. This discretion has been taken from health boards this year and the card was removed. Are these the actions of a caring Government? Where are all the millions involved? Irrespective of how the figures are massaged, the Government will not be able to convince those concerned that this State is good for them. These problems must be solved and they are replicated a thousand times throughout the country.The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, may have a smile on his face as we discuss this matter because he is at an altogether different level. He would not be concerned about the type of people we are discussing. However, the trouble is that many more in Government are not concerned about them either. I assure him that the day will come when the smile will be wiped off his face.

Will the Minister state how this integrates with the farm assist and the community employment schemes that have machinery in place? Hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money was spent on training the supervisors of CE schemes, some of whom will now receive redundancy payments. Will there have to be a new training scheme for them? I sincerely hope that the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, is not reinventing the wheel and that there is not a competition between him and his neighbour, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to see who will deliver. I only hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs can put some sense into their heads to prevent this.

When one addresses this Bill one must consider the Estimates. The most important issue, which may not have been discussed that much in the House, is the decision on the money advice and budgeting service supplement. That was the craziest decision ever made. The money advice and budgeting service is one of the most successful services in the country. It operates in my home town and, on several occasions, I have sent people in financial difficulties to avail of its services. It provides a wonderful service to everybody.The positive effect of the supplement is to break the cycle of poverty. It is a targeted, short-term payment which is reviewed regularly and hence does not become part of income. It is a planned method of payment in partnership with people in debt. Many have huge financial debts and the supplement might not seem much to them, but it certainly has a great effect.The supplement can be positively linked to outcome measures. Expenditure on the supplement is not excessive, and it helps people to pay their rent. The effect of the withdrawal of the supplement will be that clients will remain trapped in debt. They can be very much affected both physically and psychologically and may live in fear of receiving bills or letters from sheriffs or solicitors. The withdrawal of the supplement may result in the affected parties and their families living in fear.If people in such financial difficulties receive no advice, they tend to go to moneylenders. Repayments on €500 borrowed from moneylenders over one year would amount to €750. The repayments on the same sum borrowed from the credit union would amount to €520. With the help of the credit unions and the money advice and budgeting service, those in financial difficulties are steered in the right direction. The withdrawal of the supplement is a dreadful mistake. I could quote examples of several people in my constituency who have been affected.The Minister is not the kind of person who likes to make such a cutback and I beg of her not to make it. Not only does it affect those who have borrowed from financial institutions but also those who pay rent to local authorities. The supplement is money well spent and its maintenance could result in training and assisting people.There has been much debate about medical cards. Before the previous general election, we were promised a huge increase in the number of medical cards, to which people looked forward. In the past two years, the numbers entitled to medical card were reduced by more than 30,000, and a further reduction is expected on foot of two recent Government announcements. This is deplorable. Medical cards must be reviewed every year and this costs the taxpayer a huge amount of money. There is no need for this because cardholders have long-term illnesses. There is a cogent argument to be made for giving them a medical card for life.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I want to make some important points on the social welfare system and the changes that must be made thereto. I am delighted there has been a significant and welcome drop in the level of poverty, as measured by different independent groups. We must now deal with those on the lowest income in society, that is, the lowest social welfare benefit. Experts say we should link future social welfare increases not to the level of inflation, but to the average industrial wage or take-home pay. That would be significant because while poverty has reduced in absolute terms, the gap between those even on average incomes and those on the lowest incomes has increased.The pressures on children are not solved by the budgetary provision of a miserable €6 per month increase in child benefit for the first and second child. The pressures of society and the cost of living is remarkably high for children and teenagers. For example, if a child wants a pair of shoes they must be the trademarked shoes, Adidas and so on, rather than shoes from Dunnes Stores. There are significant pressures on families which did not exist before and an opportunity to give greater support to families and children was sadly missed in the budget.It is also important that lone parents of one or two children should be attracted to part-time employment. That encouragement existed heretofore and the opportunity for single mothers to take up part-time employment while getting full social welfare benefits was very constructive. It brought people out of the poverty trap and got them involved in jobs in their community. It also gave them the self-esteem and status to which they were entitled. It is unacceptable that the Minister is now cutting back on those benefits. It is a retrograde step.Deputy Ring has asked what will happen to those on rent allowance. I do not have a problem with a review of the rent allowance system – nobody could have – but greater account should be taken of single people living at home, particularly those in their late teens and early 20s. They are assessed on their parents' means and receive a very small amount in unemployment assistance, perhaps €10 per week. Pressure is put on them to go out into the community in order to get rent allowance and full unemployment assistance. That gets them out of home and into a community where they may not be ready to live, with consequent problems in apartments all over the country. Young people are living outside the family home with no income support and they are costing the State money. It would be far better if the State made it more attractive for those in that category to get full unemployment assistance at home, which would be socially progressive.The Minister has erred greatly when it comes to people seeking rent allowance, particularly the single parents of one or two children, who now have to rent for six months before getting it. This is an impossibility. It is a hoop through which they cannot go and there is no logical justification for it. It will mean that those on reduced incomes who cannot get rent allowance will have to go back to the rat-infested hovels of our towns and cities because it is cheaper. That will be the only accommodation they can afford and there will be a consequent negative impact on their health and the health of their children. The Minister must think again. The community welfare officers and other bodies have made a strong case for her to row back on these rules. They strike at the heart of poverty by making people poorer and their health worse as a result of living in poor conditions. Their children will also suffer greatly.The system contains an ambiguity in the way it deals with someone in full time education who is living at home. If the person's family receives the fuel allowance that will continue until the student is 22, but the allowance is lost after that. This was recently brought to my attention and I asked the Department for the relevant statistics. Hundreds of people come into this category because if they are over 22 years of age they are deemed to be adults. However, they are totally dependent and are generally deemed to be the spouse of the person concerned. If that were changed it would be socially just and progressive.An bhfuil mórán ama fágtha?

We may have scored the odd political point but despite differences within the body politic most people are speaking from the heart and on behalf of their constituents. All of us would like to see the eradication of poverty as our goal as legislators and public representatives. I am sorry Deputy O'Dowd has left the Chamber. I was going to tell him I was looking forward to moving to his constituency with the decentralisation of my Department. I am sure he and the Acting Chairman will look forward to it—

I am assured by my colleagues that there will be no problem with the welcome.Deputy Connaughton raised the new rural initiative scheme, which is not necessarily reflected in the legislation but is important to all rural Deputies. The Deputy had some specific questions on its modus operandi but it is being proposed by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I am in discussions with the Minister at present to facilitate the introduction of the scheme as close as possible to the beginning of the year. We will not be looking at additionality in training or supervision and we are looking at reflecting specific needs of those who, in the main, are on farm assist. There will be further opportunities to discuss implementation of the scheme. It has been very creative and will support those in rural Ireland who have had difficulty obtaining meaningful employment, particularly because of their geographical location.A number of speakers took a roundabout view of some of my proposals on unemployment. Deputy McManus said I was incorrect to state the unemployment rate is 4.9%. She said it is 5.5% but she did not complete the sentence I uttered, which concluded that the rate is seasonally adjusted to 4.9%, which is the correct figure to use. It is grand to utter half a sentence but it must be completed to give an accurate overview.There was fair and unfair criticism of the adequacy of the increases. Most Members appreciated the €10 per week increase for pensioners and the minimum rate of increase on all maximum personal weekly payment rates was welcomed. The increases provided for in the legislation demonstrate my commitment and that of my Department to ensuring our customers will receive adequate support when they need it.Much reference was made to the inadequacy of child benefit. Deputy Ring took the opportunity to get on his high horse, as he normally does on these occasions. I will outline the facts. Child benefit has increased from €38.09 per month for the first and second child—

In 2003, it is €131.60 per month for the first and second child and €165.30 for the third and subsequent children. That is a significant investment.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	717	The family income supplement threshold has been increased and this is more than beneficial. I will correct another inaccuracy in this regard. FIS will be disregarded when claimants apply for rent supplement. This change is one of a number of cushioning measures I have introduced which are more supportive of people on low incomes. FIS will be disregarded similar to child benefit.The school meals scheme is not covered by the legislation. However, I will provide €1 million next year in addition to the €2 million I provided this year and I have carried out a review of the scheme. School meals were only available to children in our cities. That has been changed and schools were invited to make applications in consultation with the Department of Education and Science to my Department to provide school meals through a breakfast club, lunch club or after school club. A number of schools applied but I am disappointed that not many have done so. I will again publicise the availability of the scheme.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	718	Will the Minister include a photograph?

All educationalists indicate breakfast is the most important meal and the scheme addresses educational disadvantage. I have witnessed the administration of these schemes through schools and clubs and it is has been beneficial. The scheme had not been reviewed for more than 80 years. A report was published last year and I progressed its recommendations by providing additional funding this year. I hope Members will advise school authorities of the availability of the scheme and the absolute necessity to ensure children have an adequate meal.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	724	There have been ongoing discussions over the past number of years about child dependant allowances, which provide disincentives. The Department examined CDAs in 1994 and because social welfare recipients lost their CDAs when they entered employment, they created a disincentive. The rate of the allowances was also too high. Income support for families with children comprises an amalgam of child benefit and CDAs. This has increased by almost three and a half times the rate of inflation. It is good policy not to touch CDAs because of the universality of child benefit and the amalgam of both payments is more supportive and constructive.My argument will stand up when the child benefit strategy is completed and the issue of child poverty is examined. A special initiative will be taken under the partnership agreement to examine the second tier of income supports for children in low income families. I agree with the ESRI that they should be studied and evaluated. Since the publication of recent reports, it has been agreed the child poverty special initiative under Sustaining Progress will examine the merger of FIS and CDAs into one payment that might be paid to low income families, irrespective of their employment status. This issue will be addressed in the arrangements under the special initiative.A number of Members stated schemes are not re-evaluated and reviewed. Deputy Ring is not enamoured by all the reviews conducted by the Department but they are beneficial because anomalies are examined as well as changes in circumstances, employment trends and lifestyle habits. I intend to proceed with the special initiative to examine improved ways to support children in low income families.Many Members referred to carers. The chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs stated he was disappointed, following the publication of the extensive study conducted by his committee, that I did not implement many of its recommendations. I thank the committee for its work. It reached a pragmatic decision and put forward fine proposals. Unfortunately, they were not costed.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	725	The committee is leaving that to the Minister.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	726	I am determined to work with the committee and other Members to support carers. Carer's allowance and carer's benefit provide recognition of the people who care and they are not payments for caring. No Government in the world could pay a person to care for another but it is a recognition and support. The Government has a target on that basis to increase the income disregard to a certain level. I have almost achieved that target in two years and the income disregard has been beneficial. We can have academic discussions on whether carer's allowance should be means-tested.I am of the view that the removal of means tests can lead to resources being allocated where they are not necessarily required. I believe an increase in the threshold is much more beneficial. However, I have increased the income threshold this year and we will discuss the carers' situation in due course – it is outside the specific ambit of this Bill. In my view, the additional €10 to carers, the increase of €100 in the respite care grant and the substantial increase in the disregards by this Government, will benefit 24,300 carers in 2004.With regard to the recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs, many of those proposals can be incorporated within the deliberations and discussions on implementation of support and financing for long-term care. I hope the committee will put forward its proposals arising from the consultation I will initiate shortly and I look forward to hearing what people have to say in that regard. Following publication of the report and subsequent consultations, we will have to look at particular types of structures with regard to the modus operandifor delivery of long-term care as between my Department and the Department of Health and Children.There is a view, which has my personal support, in favour of the subvention of home support. People in the pilot programmes have indicated to me and, no doubt, to other Members, that they were more than happy with their situation, particularly in terms of living at home for as long as possible.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	728	The pilot area projects which operated in my health board area, but not that of Deputy Stagg, indicated quite clearly that the amalgam of all of those services is important. However, there is also an important question as to how it will be paid for. It is a long-term issue, as in the case of pensions. We have to look at a number of methodologies in preparing for a more elderly population in future years. Those demographics will underline the need for long-term care.I assure the Chairman of the joint committee that the proposals and recommendations from his committee will be considered. I look forward to further consultation and deliberations. Following the consultations, I hope a working group will be set up in mid-2004 to look at the full implementation of proposals to fund long-term care.Many speakers in this debate referred to the work of the St. Vincent de Paul society. I wish to express my sympathy to the family of the late Noel Clear, former national president of the society, who made an invaluable contribution to the society and the vulnerable people it assists. We learned of his death on Monday last. I also express my sympathy to the members of the society.A number of press releases issued by the St. Vincent de Paul society have signalled a significant increase in the number of people making contact with it. The Government is committed to addressing this issue and that is reflected in our approach under the national anti-poverty strategy which was published in 2002 and our national action plan for social inclusion which was submitted to the EU in July of this year. There are very ambitious targets included, not only on income support but also encompassing a range of policy areas which impact on poverty, social exclusion, education, health, employment, housing and accommodation.The targets in my Department are €150 for the lowest social welfare rate in 2002 terms and an increase in pensions to €200 by 2007. Those are the policies being pursued by the Government. It is my view that the proposals are realistic. I intend to pursue the provision of supports for the less well-off in the context of a €630 million budget package this year. I appreciate that Opposition Members do not like being reminded of how much has been invested in my Department over the last number of years. Perhaps it would be unfair to go back as far as 1994, when the figure was €199 million.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	780	Children are surrounded by advertising. On television, in magazines, at the movies, on-line and on billboards children are encouraged to consume and consume they do. Not only do children influence the purchases their parents make, they spend a great deal of their own money from allowances and part-time jobs on the latest fashions, the coolest new video games and their favourite snacks. This is no doubt music to advertisers' ears. After all, they advertise in the hope of being able to shape desires, influence preferences, change buying habits and create brand loyalty.One wonders if advertisers are aware that their advertisements have an impact on the health of children. Research exists in key areas which links advertisements to serious health concerns regarding children. From smoking to body image, there is strong evidence that advertising influences children's habits and attitudes. It is estimated the average child in the USA sees more than 20,000 commercials every year which is at least 55 per day. Children spend a daily average of four hours and 40 minutes in front of a screen of some kind. Of this, two and a half hours are spent watching television. In the USA, 47% of children have a television set in their bedroom.At six months, the age at which they are imitating simple sounds such as "Mama", babies are forming mental images of corporate logos and mascots. According to recent marketing industry studies, a person's brand loyalty may begin as early as two years old. I was amazed when a colleague told me recently that her year old child recognised the McDonald's logo. At three years of age and before they can read, one in five American children is already making specific requests for brand-name products. Experts say a lifetime customer may be worth $100,000 to a retailer which makes cradle-to-grave marketing strategies valuable.I commend the Minister, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources all of whom are well aware of the problem and working together to address it. I request all parties to be patient to get this right.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	781	The Minister has taken steps to address this matter through the implementation of the Broadcasting Act 2001. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has investigated advertising and brought forward proposals. It has sought and received submissions from the public. It is ingenuous of the Green Party to bring forward its Bill when it knows the Minister has done a great deal of work in this area already. The results of this work will be apparent in the near future.There are many forms of advertising besides broadcast advertising. Toy stores put colourful catalogues through letterboxes and large companies place full-page advertisements in newspapers. Children read these assiduously. They will be taken to the bedroom and studied long after the television is switched off. Should there not be legislation to address this issue? Those advertisements put tremendous pressure on parents, especially at this time of the year.The preparation of a children's advertising code was deemed the first important step to be undertaken by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The Broadcasting Act 2001 recognised the importance of advertising directed at children and introduced for the first time the concept of a separate children's advertising code. The BCI is required to prioritise the development of the code, which will result in a set of regulations to guide advertisers and broadcasters. The commencement of this process represents the first major initiative of the BCI in the area of programming and advertising standards. Interest in the code has gone far beyond those in the advertising and broadcasting sectors.The pressure placed on parents to purchase designer brands, toy advertising and the link between advertising and alcohol consumption by young people, have been popular media themes over the last few years. Strong arguments have been presented on each of these issues by interests on both sides of the debate. The advertising in question should not be broadcast when young children are watching television. There is little point in banning advertising on RTE and TV3 when British-based stations can beam in what they like. We cannot govern what Mr. Rupert Murdoch advertises as his channels do not broadcast from within our jurisdiction.The Swedish Government has gone all the way and banned advertising aimed at those under 12 years. The Swedes must now deal with the problem of stations being established on satellite platforms with the specific intent of beaming into their country. These satellite broadcasters use station platforms which are subject to regulation in the UK where no similar restriction on advertising to children exists.We should not forget that children are interested in Playstations and DVDs as well as in watching television. These interests also lead to obesity. Allowing children to sit around all day, eating crisps, drinking pop and pushing buttons is bad for them. The problem is not the drawing up of new rules, it is making them stick. If children migrate to satellite stations, the national regulations will be ineffective. This is what makes the implementation of the European Union's Television Without Frontiers Directive so important. I commend the Minister on the work he has done.

It is nice that Deputy Sargent has stayed in the House to listen attentively to the points being made. I compliment my colleagues, Deputies Kelly and Carty, for sharing time with me this evening. The Deputies know a great deal about this problem, particularly as it relates to rural Ireland. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who has excelled in his time as a Member of this House.

The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, considers the reform of children's advertising to be a real priority. He directed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to undertake a comprehensive review of the issues for that reason. One of his first acts when he assumed responsibility for this area was to direct the BCI to introduce new codes on children's advertising.Sweden, which is the only EU member state to have banned advertisements aimed at those under the age of 12, has to deal with problems posed by satellite television stations established with the specific intent of beaming into that country. The stations use satellite platforms that are subject to regulations in the UK, where no restrictions on advertising aimed at children exist. The Sky television channels, for example, are available throughout Europe. We all know that the problem in this area is not drawing up new rules, but making them stick. The regulation of the EU Television Without Frontiers Directive is important because national regulations will be ineffective if children migrate to satellite stations.Many studies have shown that children under the age of eight cannot tell the difference between a television programme and television advertising. While one could consider advertising aimed at children to be deceptive, it could also be classified as a work of genius if its content is proper and the potential purchaser at whom it is aimed is borne in mind. Television networks and producers have pointed out that children's advertising creates employment, demand and awareness. Advertising revenue across the EU has reached between €700 million and €1 billion. This income helps to maintain the level of domestic production in the EU broadcasting sector.Section 1(a) of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill outlines a raft of measures to be introduced by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland following a direction of the Minister. The introduction of these measures is feasible within existing statutory provisions. I will outline why it is more appropriate for the BCI to have complete responsibility for the introduction of all aspects of the code. Given the sensitive nature of the subject, it is appropriate that all decisions are taken by the independent body.I would like to speak about the power of television and advertising. Those familiar with the world of marketing are aware that the penetration of television advertising is much greater than that of radio, newspaper or other advertising. A figure of 70% has been cited in that regard. It is estimated that companies assign over 80% of their marketing budgets to television advertising. Many household products and goods would not be so popular with consumers if they had not had an immediate impact on television. The growth of the domestic advertising industry can be seen in this regard. This area has blossomed in recent years as a result of independent advertising productions which have been carried out by professionals who gained their expertise outside the State, mainly in the UK and, to a lesser extent, in the US. Direct advertising campaigns which have been an enormous success have created many jobs.The real concern of Deputies of all political persuasions relates to the advertising of products being beamed into the homes of boys and girls under the age of 12. I argue that we should be concerned about the impact of advertising on those under the age of 14 or 15. My worries in this regard are evident on two fronts. Parents are placed under a great deal of undue stress and unhappiness because they are unable to afford luxury items that are being beamed into their homes. As a parent, one's natural instinct is to do one's utmost for one's sons and daughters and to try to be as good as one's neighbours. I am also concerned about the advertising to children of products which are not good for their health. The House has invested a great deal of resources in the health system, through the Department of Health and Children and otherwise, in recent years.Colleagues who spoke about junk food mentioned that we need to examine the type of advertising that is good for young people. If certain forms of advertising are not good for young people, the BCI has a duty to produce a charter that includes a list of items to be considered by the national broadcasting channels and television stations. The charter will have to examine the kinds of products that are beneficial for boys and girls. I will conclude by thanking my colleagues, including the Minister of State, for giving me an opportunity to speak.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	789	I would like to thank Deputies for their contributions to this lively and interesting debate yesterday and again this evening. I am sure we will have further lively debate before 8.30 p.m. The large degree of agreement on all sides of the House has been interesting. Issues such as the protection of children and the promotion of healthy and responsible lifestyles have been discussed. All sides have shown an understanding of the real problems faced by Irish families as a consequence of advertising directed at children. An appreciation of the nature of the broadcasting industry has been demonstrated. Deputies are aware of the difficulties in putting in place effective regulations in this regard.Some contributions focused on protecting children from the damaging effects of exploitative advertising. I acknowledge the speeches made last night by Deputies Eamon Ryan, Kehoe and Enright in this regard. Deputies Kelly, Carty and Cassidy have commented on the matter this evening. Deputies do not want to see children adopting unhealthy eating habits and lifestyles, which may be promoted by advertising campaigns driven by snack food and soft drink companies. Deputies Gormley and Twomey were very clear in this regard last night. Members recognise that doing something about these problems will present serious challenges. Deputy Crowe set out some of the main issues and problems in this regard in a detailed analysis of the legislation last night.The Government has made its position clear. The Minister sees the reform of the children's advertising code as a real priority. He directed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to undertake a comprehensive review of the associated issues to that end. One of his first acts when he became Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources was to direct the BCI to introduce new codes on children's advertising. The commission is conducting a comprehensive process aimed at revising the advertising codes. The legislation under which that process is taking place requires the BCI to take account of the positions of bodies with vested interests in the welfare of children. There is a large degree of public involvement in the process of redrawing the codes. Deputies may contribute to that process and discuss the outcome that emerges.The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is the right body to carry out this process. It is doing a good job in the process so far, and I expect the outcome to be credible and command a high level of support, given the work that has gone into the development of those codes. However, it is clear from last night's debate that the problem is not only about drawing up new rules for children's advertising. Several Deputies on the other side of the House mentioned that it must also consider the knock-on economic impact on Irish broadcasters of the disappearance of revenue from those advertisements. Television networks and producers have pointed out that children's advertising creates jobs, and in the European Union revenue from the business has reached between €700 million and €1 billion. That income helps maintain the level of domestic production in the EU's broadcasting sector.Problems also arise from the fact that most of the television watched by our children is not regulated in Ireland. As children migrate to satellite stations, the national regulations banning advertisements aimed at them will be less effective. That is why the review of the EU Television Without Frontiers Directive is so important. We know that, throughout the EU, only Sweden has gone all the way in banning advertisements aimed at under-12s. The Swedes are having to deal with the problem of stations being set up on satellite platforms with the specific intent of beaming into the country. Those stations use satellite platforms subject to regulations in the UK, where no similar restriction on advertising to children exists.The arguments advanced for strict regulation of children's advertising by Deputies were clear. Children are not nearly as sophisticated as adults and need external protection. Children's demands, driven by what they see on television, put great pressure on poorer families. The advertising business drives an acquisitive "me too" culture among young people. Junk food advertisements help create unhealthy eating habits and obese young people. Most children's advertisements are a form of direct exploitation of childhood weakness.However, there is also a danger that we could fall into a cosy consensus on banning children's advertisements without looking at the offsetting factors, some of which I have mentioned. There is a clear educative as well as exploitative aspect of exposure to advertising. Dealing with advertisements is a necessary part of growing up. Some exposure to advertisements helps develop a critical approach to advertising later in life. Advertising is now so pervasive that any attempt to regulate will be offset to a degree by satellite broadcasting or more subversive means of advertising. New media, including the Internet, are beginning to play an increasingly important role in selling to children. It will be a great challenge to develop effective advertising rules which distinguish between much of what is aimed at the teen and pre-teen markets. The content of children's programmes is as damaging, in many cases, as the advertisement that precedes or follows them.We know that a ban on children's advertising, as well as being difficult to implement, would have financial implications for the broadcasting sector. I am led to believe that, on a quick calculation, the rise in the licence fee required to offset a ban on advertising to under-15s would be between €10 and €15 per year. No such relief would be available, for example, to private broadcasters. The cost is not a reason to avoid a ban. It is part of the consequences that will have to be managed if we go forward with one.We know that most adult advertisements are also a form of direct exploitation of adult weakness. We must ask whether banning children's advertising will have the long-term impact that the proponents claim. The human condition is grasping and acquisitive. Markets often work to satisfy transient, short-term needs at the expense of longer-term welfare. That applies to adults as well as children. Advertising is ultimately a tool of the market designed to address our fundamental needs and deepest insecurities. Counteracting the damaging impact of advertising on children requires education, good parenting, the ability to locate the "off" switch on the television set, and the capacity to live with one's children's disappointments, at least occasionally.Yesterday Deputy Crawford detailed the remarkable cases of families which were not poor but on reasonable incomes who were turning to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for assistance in purchasing heavily advertised products for their children. No legislation on earth will help families who cannot manage this most basic challenge to the family budget. Children of families who are not poor also need to hear the word "No" from their parents. It helps them become better teenagers and, ultimately, better adults. Well-off children who hear the word "No" from their parents tend to have a broader and more realistic view of the world. It is a world in which there is disappointment and deferred consumption or pleasure is part of their everyday experience. Many well-off children who do not hear the word "No" often enough, as we all know, grow up into spoilt and utterly unreasonable young people. Our job is to legislate for the benefit of children and not for the convenience of parents. Pestering is a part of parenting, like it or not.The Government feels it appropriate that the BCI has complete responsibility for the introduction of all aspects of the code for the following reasons. It has the power to do the work and has already been directed to do so by the Minister. It has particular knowledge and expertise in the broadcasting sector which it is applying to the task. The BCI has allocated specific resources to the task. They include the appointment of a dedicated broadcasting standards officer who is supported by the BCI's research function and a team of part-time monitors.The BCI has introduced a fully developed consultation function for the purpose of informing the content of the code. It will examine ways of maximising the acquisition of media literacy, both before and following the implementation of the children's code. It has already sought suggestions from broadcasters, advertisers and the general public. It will also explore relevant opportunities with education providers and children's interest groups. The BCI has ensured through its consultation process that all groups with an interest in the welfare of children are included in every step of the process. It is envisaged that contact with the relevant groups will be maintained on an ongoing basis, and the BCI is committed by law to review the effectiveness of the code every three years.The Government is clear that the problem with the Bill is its timing and the fact that its passage would do nothing to move forward the children's advertising code. Last night the Minister dealt with issues surrounding amending the public service broadcasting mandate on a piecemeal basis. As legislators we must take seriously the job of taking appropriate and adequate measures to safeguard the interests of Ireland's children. I respect the contributions made from all sides of the House to this lively debate. While not accepting the Bill, I must say that the Green Party, by tabling it, has created a welcome level of debate which will be of help to the BCI when it sits down to make its final decisions. The Government has already addressed the issues in section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2001. Let us give the BCI the time and space to get the job done. I cannot support this Bill.

I warmly welcome the legislation which our colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has put before the House. I am among those who generally feel that advertising, even to adults, often has a very destructive impact on community and public culture. I am often struck by the sheer stupidity of many advertisements and the appalling repetition that we must endure, particularly of advertisements on late at night – the time when we Deputies get a chance to watch television. Advertising has a tremendous capacity to enforce stereotyping, whether of gender, age or other characteristics. The crass commercialism evident in all advertising throughout the economy applies in particular to that aimed at children. We sometimes see how hard it is to distinguish between pure advertising and the role of commercialism in sport, for example, and the recently, and rightly, criticised football and sports clubs who insist on changing shirts year after year, putting immense pressure on parents. That pester power that children have is rightly identified by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland as resulting from the significant impact on children of television advertising. It is a powerful medium. Furthermore, it is now recognised in politics that television advertising is the most powerful way in which to get a message across to adults. The literature on television advertising shows that children under six cannot distinguish between the end of a television programme and the beginning of advertisements. I welcome this Bill which seeks to amend section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2001. I particularly welcome the prohibition and restrictions on the advertising of food and beverages in which sugar, salt and fat are the principal components. This Bill is similar to one introduced by a Labour Party MP to the House of Commons a year and a half ago.The proposers of the Bill should consider amendments to the Bill in respect of the age criteria placed on the provisions. A great deal of research has been carried out on this matter and it is an area in which we should be more specific. I welcome references to improving children's media literacy, even for those under 16 years of age. The attempt to revise section 28 of the Broadcasting Act in regard to cultural diversity is a valuable addition.In typical fashion, the Minister has taken a different line tonight, but I regret that he was so mean-spirited about this Green Party-sponsored Bill. The Minister has some 26 personal advisers and has a large segment of a Department at his beck and call while Opposition Deputies are on their own trying to formulate policy with the help of the odd voluntary helper. There is no comparison between the two. The Minister should welcome the Bill and examine how it could be worked into the discussion with the BCI or simply adopt it. I have brought six or seven Bills before the House and, unfortunately, the Government tends to rebuff them. It is a pity the Minister took such a negative line on this typically valuable contribution by Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Green Party.I welcome the consultative process in regard to the BCI. On behalf of the Labour Party, I made a submission to the second part of the process and hope to make another as it develops. The impact of advertising on children, particularly in regard to food and toys, is critical. I know Deputies will expand on that. I welcome the Bill and assure it the support of the Labour Party.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	793	I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and highlight the cost of children's exposure to saturation levels of television advertising. The powerful tool we know as television advertising has been used effectively to put across many messages, including political ones. Therefore, it is not as if politicians are unaware of the influences.The audience most susceptible to television advertising is children. The clever use of attractive images and the association of those images with foods and toys is insidious and reprehensible because the controls are difficult for parents to impose on children.Yesterday, the report of the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre recorded the highlights of the consequences of bad eating habits. The epidemic of obesity which plagues the country is a consequence of poor eating and nutritional habits over many years. In many ways, Ireland is exceptionally lucky in that we refer regularly to our clean, green image and healthy nutritious food, and yet the themes of most advertisements used to promote foods revolve around four main food items, namely, cereals which are high in sugar, soft fizzy drinks, confectionery and savoury snacks. Where are the corresponding attractive advertisements for young viewers promoting fruit and vegetables? They are very thin on the ground. Such foods may not be so alluring to the young gourmet but at least their promotion should be done with the young audience in mind.It is ironic that, at a time when consumption of fruit and vegetables is inadequate for 30% of the population, there is a proposal to combine Bord Bia and Bord Glas. Surely the need is to strengthen the production and promotion of fruit and vegetables by enhancing the role of Bord Glas, rather than diminishing it.High salt, fat and sugar content are the cornerstones of the junk food which is promoted to children during daytime programmes. The people promoting such foods are well aware of the consequences of all of these food ingredients. Cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, high cholesterol and psychological disorders have all been documented. The evidence is well-established and there is no argument about it. However, it seems the people promoting it have little or no concern for the consequences of those promotional practices. The large food companies which promote these foods to children should wake up and be responsible. Sooner or later, the fat epidemic will be challenged. In the US, a number of class actions are in hand, the outcomes of which will be interesting. It will be particularly interesting for the fast food industry here.A recent report by the Food Standards Agency in the UK stated that there was a clear link between television viewing, diet, obesity and cholesterol levels. One study showed that the more advertisements were viewed, the more snacks and calories were consumed. It is also the case that the advertised diets were less healthy than those recommended by nutritionists. The plague of overweight and obesity must be tackled in a structured and integrated manner. Overweight and obese children are not only a consequence of advertising, although it is difficult to separate the various factors which play a role and identify the importance of each one.This debate relates to communicating a message to a very receptive audience. Is it not equally important that the message be communicated in a positive way by other Departments such as the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Arts, Sport and Tourism and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources? All have an important part to play in disseminating the positive messages of healthy eating. The absence of that good and useful information is as important as the negative message which is positively promoted now.I call on the Minister to initiate an interdepartmental group to examine the value of the messages or absence of them which are available to children. The group should link in with the major stakeholders – the food producers, manufacturers, retailers, the hospitality industry, teachers and parents. A great deal of lip-service has been paid to the promotion of healthy eating and good dietary habits for which the health promotion board of the Department of Health and Children is responsible. However, yesterday's report on the overweight and obesity problem highlights the need for much greater penetration of the market with positive messages. The general public is often unaware of the significance of the small print which tells them of the fat content or the meaning of the number of calories in the product. It may be time for advertising of another sort, namely, warnings on some foods that they contain more than a specified amount of fat, the information about which is in large print and, for example, advises the consumer that it exceeds the recommended daily intake and provides information on that recommended daily intake.We must cut down on the advertising of junk foods, increase the quantity and quality of information on healthy foods and provide more facilities for sports and so on. The further irony of the advertising business is that there is also an obsession with promoting diets. On the one hand there is a junk food problem and on the other is the problem in regard to the promotion of diets. Every zany diet has been promoted and advertised. I support Deputy Broughan's point that the time has come to include media studies in all school programmes, incorporating the importance of advertising.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	794	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Eamon Ryan and the Green Party for bringing it forward since it has been a useful discussion. I welcome the fact that the Minister and Minister of State have made the effort to come to the House and listen to what the Opposition is saying. Unfortunately, they have decided to reject the strategy towards helping to address the problem, as outlined by Deputy Eamon Ryan, which Fine Gael is happy to support on this occasion.If amendments need to be introduced to change the wording of the draft amending Bill, that is fine, but to reject it outright is a mistake. The purpose of this draft amendment legislation is aimed at strengthening the ability of the Minister to give policy direction to the BCI and perhaps in future to the BAI on the important issue of regulating advertising outputs and their impact on children. It also requires the BCI to take into account the welfare and physical health of children when preparing a code of advertising standards. The Bill aims to amend the Broadcasting Act 2001.I welcome the work the BCI is doing at present in terms of developing a children's code of advertising, which is long overdue. There has been considerable consultation with the general public as well as stakeholders in this regard. Everyone has had the opportunity to make a contribution and comment on the code that will be introduced in the future.Unfortunately, the Minister last evening totally rejected the Bill. This was surprising. He stated that it is unnecessary and should not be introduced before the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is created, which will probably not be for another nine months or so. I cannot understand the Minister's rationale. If one considers the logic behind it, then the work being done by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland at present should also be stalled until the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is put in place. It is nonsense to say we should not introduce legislation to give direction to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland because the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will soon come on stream.The Minister is aware that legislation will be dealt with tomorrow which, despite the arrival of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in the near future, provides for new work to be carried out by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I was surprised that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, used this nonsensical argument as his main reason for dismissing the legislation before us.Children are vulnerable and spend, on average, four hours per day watching television. There is no doubt that if advertising was not as effective as it is, it would not be so commonplace on television screens at times when children are likely to be watching. Whether it is in terms of the promotion of the latest toy, creating a new craze for Christmas and placing immense pressure on many parents to deliver, fast food or new branded products of clothing, etc., the Minister and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland have a responsibility. I do not believe we should say this is an issue for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland or the BAI, when it comes on stream, and that the Minister should not be involved.I agree with everything Deputy Upton stated in respect of obesity, which is a major concern. This is one small measure we can adopt, not to ban children's advertising but to restrict certain types of advertising at particular times of the day. This will have a positive strategic impact in respect of the over-saturation of advertising for children.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this progressive and sensible legislation, which is designed to amend the law relating to broadcasting and advertising. I commend the Green Party on introducing the Bill.The Bill is concerned with children, public health and preventing a generation from clogging up the health service in the future. It is also concerned with a vision for the future which will save lives and taxpayers' money in approximately ten years' time. When one considers the detail of the legislation, one can see that the objective is to strengthen and specify the health-related responsibilities of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in respect of its role in regulating advertising output and the impact of advertising on children. The Bill provides for the restriction of the advertising to children of particular food categories, including foodstuffs or beverages with high sugar, fat or salt contents. It also provides for restrictions on advertising targeted at children in certain age categories.Section 1 of the Bill has teeth and I strongly support it. If we do not act now, we will encounter major problems with obesity in the future. We could also face a major public health disaster. As someone who was elected on a health and disability ticket, it is my public duty to support the Bill. I challenge all Members to cross to this side of the House and support this sensible legislation.Obesity is growing at 1% per year across all groups in the population. We need to tackle the diet and lack of exercise issues which affect many people. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many voluntary and sporting groups which work with young people by coaching and training teams, ensuring they engage in physical exercise. In the Visitors Gallery this evening is a group of residents from Charlemont on Griffith Avenue in Dublin North-Central, comprising people involved in sport and friends of mine. These individuals have given many hours to training young teams. I thank and commend them for their work. The volunteers who train and coach our children are providing a valuable service for their country and for the health service of the future. It is important to recognise and acknowledge their valuable contribution. Everything I have said is relevant in terms of amending section 28(2)(c) of the Broadcasting Act which aims to promote and protect public health, including the welfare and physical health of children. That is the core issue of the Bill.The obesity rate on the north side of Dublin of 15.7% is the highest in the country. We must ask why it is illegal to sell contaminated food when society does nothing about the sale of unhealthy food. Obesity in men increased by two and a half times in the ten years between 1990 and 2000. Children between six months and five years of age who are obese have a 25% chance of becoming obese teenagers. Such teenagers are 80% more likely to become obese adults. These facts speak for themselves.I call on Deputies from all parties to support the legislation. I urge them not to blow the Bill out of the water. Those opposite should join Members on this side and do something to help our children. This is a serious national issue and this legislation has the potential to create a more healthy society. I urge all Deputies to support the Bill.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	796	I do not know why the BCI has been asked to take action in respect of this matter because it made such a mess of the situation regarding North-West Radio, the most popular radio station in the country, by removing its licence. I do not see how the BCI will do any better in terms of dealing with childhood obesity or advertising aimed at children.I support the Bill which is a good and necessary measure. As a general practitioner, I am only too aware of the ill effects of obesity. It is a fact that obese children make obese adults. As a student, I spent some time in the United States of America. I always think that we are only a few years behind that country, in which there are so many obese children and adults. We are going down the road taken by the Americans and we are catching up to them.Who is controlling whom? We seem to be completely controlled by the media and commercial forces. Whether it is Christmas, Father's Day and Mother's Day, we no longer have control of what we spend. We are mere puppets in the hands of multinationals which tell us and our children what to do and on what we should spend our money. These companies tell our children what to eat and wear and, like fools, we go along with it. We should have control because we are responsible for making laws.These companies are making the difference through the media. Advertising is a powerful force and it is working. Those who promote unhealthy foods should be made aware that they are creating major health problems. The number of people suffering diabetes type II as a result of obesity is increasing. People are becoming unhealthy at an earlier age. That should not happen.I strongly support this Bill. We need to take control in regard to food which causes bad health. Children do not know what is good for them. They are faced with advertisements for a free toy with every burger they purchase. There is no rationale behind advertising Christmas in September. People are spending money unhealthily.Parents think it is all right to fill their children with coke and crisps. However, general practitioners know that those who take in a high sugar diet suffer highs and lows in their glucose levels. That makes for an unhappy child. Children who eat nutritional foods like fruit and so on are more content. Parents wonder why their children are high – it is as a result of their glucose levels.There is an onus on society and on us, as legislators, to ensure we take steps to deal with this issue. What do children know about nutrition? What do adults without proper guidance know about it? People say we have too many laws. This is sensible and positive legislation and it is the way forward. I support the Bill.

We would be grateful for support in this regard.I ask that the Government should support this Bill, debate it and, if necessary, amend it. It is a topical issue that will not go away. As the Minister said last night, submissions are being invited on this issue. The Green Party did not bring forth this Bill because submissions on it were invited by Government. We have been speaking about such a Bill for years. We have only now had an opportunity to bring it forward because of the limitations which apply to a Technical Group wishing to introduce legislation.I would like to speak about advertising in terms of education, which is my portfolio. I also have a portfolio in the area of arts, sports and tourism. Deputy Eamon Ryan has outlined the reason we are introducing this Bill and has dealt with the issue of advertising and the BCI. Deputy Sargent will conclude in that regard. Deputy Cuffe has his own angle on the Bill.I would like to highlight some of the issues for schools. I do not wish to see covert advertising, such as exists in the US, becoming the norm in schools. Commercial companies in the US have exclusive contracts to sell soft drinks or food in school grounds. I would be wary about such a practice. It is not advertising in the broad sense of television, radio or billboards; it is advertising by another name. I hope that any legislation limiting advertising will cover subliminal advertising in schools.I noticed while visiting schools that pupils are not as active as before. In many cases, teachers are doing their best to encourage children to become active. Maintenance grants for sports equipment in schools in non-disadvantaged areas have been cut to €600 per annum, not a huge cost to the Exchequer. A school in a disadvantaged area receives €1,200, again a small amount which can hugely impact on whether a child gets involved in sport. Such regressive fiscal policies will lead to even more difficulties in the longer term.To prove my point, I will highlight some issues regarding spending on sport versus tackling the health crisis and social deprivation. I am tying sports and schools together because it is in schools that one can best organise physical activity for young children. We know the local GAA clubs and so on are involved in extracurricular activities but it is important that we reach children in school. Sport and physical activity are linked to health. I will not go into that, given the limited amount of time available to me.Regular physical activity reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by 50%. Sport programmes – I have said this before at conventions – have an impact on youth at risk because they are recognised as a support for personal development. Taking Canada as an example, a six year study in Quebec showed that children who participated in five hours of sport per week achieved higher marks than those who did not participate. Youth smoking and physical activity are also linked. In 80% of cases Canadians aged 24 who were active had never smoked. There was a 17.3% reduction in crime in communities with a sports programme and a 10% increase in communities without such an initiative. The study also showed that 92% of girls active in sports were less likely to use drugs and 80% were less likely to have an unwanted pregnancy. In Canada, it is estimated – these are the only figures publicly available – that it costs one hundred times more to incarcerate a young person than it does to provide recreational programmes. I have raised this matter with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in the context of the need for an audit of sports facilities. That still has not been done.A pilot study initiated a couple of years ago by the National Coaching and Training Centre in co-operation with the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU discovered that there are proportionately fewer children participating in external sports at primary level than at post-primary level. It shows that substance abuse and obesity have increased at all age levels and that only 20% of primary and 35% of post-primary schools have a written policy on sport. While most post-primary schools had qualified physical education teachers, only 20% of primary schools had such teachers.Something readily noticeable in schools is tuck shops. Cans of coke carry advertising, as do posters. I ask that the Government limit all forms of advertising, be they overt as in television and radio advertising or subliminal by way of contracts in schools.I commend the Bill and compliment Deputy Eamon Ryan on the work he has done on it.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	800	Advertising works; children are vulnerable. The Minister has a duty to protect children, their innocence, their hearts and their minds. That does not mean we should cosset, pamper or blinker them. It means we should cherish, nurture and safeguard them.In 1932, an American psychologist named Edward Tolman said: "Give me a child from any background and I will turn him into anything you want, a scientist, a politician or even a criminal."  Those words ring true today. Advertising is aimed at young people and gives advertisers the ability to change a child. The Minister is obliged to protect children.Children are an ideal target because they are avid television viewers. The methods of Edward Tolman are being used today, most noticeably by the big name brands and by advertising agencies that use television to turn children into consumers. Many countries have put limits on advertising aimed at younger people. Quebec has banned print and broadcast advertising aimed at children under 13 years of age. Luxembourg and Belgium prohibit it before and after children's programmes, while in Italy some children's programmes cannot be interrupted by commercials. An agreement between the Danish Government and the television networks restricts advertising aimed at children. As recently as last week, the British culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, called on the television regulator, Ofcom, to revise the inadequate code in advertising.We need a curb on junk food advertisements in order to combat child obesity. Ireland does not even have an ombudsman for children, let alone legislation to protect them from the worst of targeted marketing. Governments should give leadership and it is not enough for the Government to wipe its hands of this and leave it to the broadcasting commission. Nor is it enough for the Government to wipe its hands of its responsibility to the vulnerable in society. The Minister should lead and regulate in the public interest.The clearest example of this is the Swedish model. Sweden is an open society by any international standard where the freedom to receive and disseminate information ranks high. While Sweden has sometimes been criticised for being too open, restrictions have been put in place in recent years. Since 1991, there has been a ban on television advertising aimed at children under the age of 12. Almost all types of advertising directly before, in the middle of or after children's programmes are not allowed under this legislation. It does not deal simply with children's products such as toys, it also looks at the entire food issue. Decisive criteria are used to ensure there is no overt or covert messages aimed at children. We all remember the words of the Pokémon cartoon, "gotta catch them all" which delivered a strong message to children, even in the middle of programming. This is controlled in Sweden and we need similar controls in Ireland. In introducing this Bill, the Green Party has been accused of creating a nanny state. If this nanny is the Swedish model, we would be more than happy for her to play a role in safeguarding our children.As we take over the Presidency of the EU, the directive on television without frontiers is important. It is not good enough on the eve of taking over the Presidency that we would leave it to a semi-State agency to take responsibility for advertising and children. The Minister should put forward a vision of what we want to achieve and protect our children from the undue influence of advertising. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, should know something about the food industry, as he was recently the Minister of State with responsibility for food. He should take a lead in this regard. Almost half of advertising aimed at children relates to food and four out of five of those advertisements are for sugary cereals, soft drinks, fast food or salty snacks. We could play a part in combating obesity by introducing legislation in this instance.Patterns of consumption, attitudes and values are established early in life. Children and young people have become an attractive target group for commercial interests. Advertising works and it is all the more important for the Government to lead by regulating this industry when it affects those in vulnerable age groups.

I especially want to thank Deputy Eamon Ryan who has put so much work into this as our party spokesperson. Being a father of four young children, the Deputy understands this issue well.The matter of obesity and the related issues of chronic heart disease, cancer and diabetes are set to trigger soaring costs for this State. We cannot avoid debating this issue and it must be addressed. The health cost of this is estimated to be more than €5 billion per annum by 2010. That is not to mention the pain and grief that will befall people along the way. My uncle passed on to me a great love of nature and hill walking. While he is not an old man, a lifetime of dietary problems has caught up with him and his is now wheelchair bound. He contracted diabetes and has had both legs and a number of fingers amputated. Huge problems exist for people who have been victim of the inaction of previous Governments in tackling the problem of obesity and the associated problems of advertising unsuitable food to children.The Minister must accept that a problem exists and should not wait for the BCI to be formed. This legislation attempts to address the lack of rules on advertising where footballers, pop stars and cartoons are used to sell junk food to young children. This issue is such a matter of life and death, pain and huge expense, that it would be irresponsible for us not to introduce this legislation and seek to give the BCI political guidance and leadership.Deputy Eamon Ryan has acknowledged the work of the commission and we are not trying to outdo it or eclipse its efforts. In the last Dáil, Deputy Gormley and me concentrated on a number of areas, one of which was energy. We tabled an amendment to the electricity regulation Bill that said the regulator should have regard for environmental criteria in electricity generation. The wind energy industry is benefiting as a result. This issue is similar and I urge the Minister of State to accept the legislation on that basis.I acknowledge that the contribution of the Minister of State was much more constructive than that of the Minister. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was so mean-minded that he decried my party for introducing this legislation. We have been dealing with this matter for years. We raised the matter in The Irish Times on 22 July. Deputy Eamon Ryan carried out a survey of 200 television advertisements and found that 56% of those were for food and sugar products. We have introduced this legislation in the knowledge that Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU for the next six months. We recognise that the television without frontiers directive will be debated and we will have a chance to influence EU advertising regulation. The Green Party recognises that advertisements come from other jurisdictions and this must be addressed.We must act in the next six months and the BCI will not come into operation until after this. We do not have time to wait for the BCI. Other countries recognise this problem and have taken action. The Minister of State may know it is predicted that one in three people born in the US in 2000 will contract type 2 diabetes. This Government has a choice. It can sit on its hands waiting for the BCI and pretend it is not the Government, or it can act and this straightforward and short Bill would serve to amend the legislation and give the BCI clear political leadership. The choice lies with the Government. All Members on this side of the House support this legislation. If the Government blocks it, on its own head be it. Those children will not be able to walk up any stairs when they are adults. Action needs to be taken now and the Minister should support the Bill.

In page 6, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:"4.–(1) Subject to subsection (2), unless a person is a qualified person he or she shall not–(a) describe himself or herself as an accountant, or(b) so hold himself or herself out so as to indicate, or be reasonably understood to indicate that he or she is an accountant.(2) Subsection (1) shall not prevent any person who is–(a) a turf accountant, or(b) a legal cost accountant, or(c) within a category of persons prescribed by regulations made by the Minister describing himself or herself as, or holding himself or herself out to be, a turf accountant, a legal cost accountant, or within the category of persons so prescribed.(3) In this section ‘qualified person' means a person who is–(a) a member of a prescribed accountancy body who is entitled, by virtue of the Constitution or bye-laws of that prescribed accountancy body, to call himself or herself an accountant,(b) qualified in accordance with section 187 of the Companies Act 1990 to be an auditor of a company or a public auditor of industrial and provident society or a friendly society,(c) within a category of persons prescribed by regulations made by the Supervisory Authority as being entitled to use the name accountant, or(d) otherwise certified by the Supervisory Authority as being a suitable person to use the name ‘accountant'.”.We discussed the amendment on Committee Stage. The object is to ensure the public is properly protected by making sure all persons acting as accountants fall with the scope of the legislation and the purview of the supervisory authority that will be established upon enactment of the legislation. That was the intention of the review group on auditing whose report is the genesis of the legislation. Only members of recognised or prescribed professional bodies will be subject to the supervisory authority under the Bill. I am anxious that those who hold themselves to be accountants and do accountancy work should also be subject to the controls that will be put in place, otherwise a difference will be created between various categories of people who do similar work, while those who have a professional qualification or who are members of a professional body will be disadvantaged.

Deputies Howlin, Hogan and Murphy have put down amendments Nos. 1 and 2 with regard to providing legal protection for the term "accountant".

I will ask the authority to ensure that this study will not extend over an unduly long period. In this context, I take the opportunity, once again, to exhort members of recognised bodies to emphasise their membership of these bodies on all appropriate occasions, as well as the protection which that affords to their clients. Recognised bodies could usefully promote themselves in a similar way. In these circumstances, I am sure Deputies will understand that I cannot accept the amendment at this time.

I believe he sees and accepts the logic of the case we made coherently and well on Committee Stage. Many of the contributions on Second Stage also dealt with this matter. There is a requirement in the basic statute for a definition of "accountant" so that the supervisory authority we are now establishing will have application across all who hold themselves as accountants. The problem with asking the new authority to look at the definition subsequent to the enactment of this legislation is that it cannot enact or amend this legislation.This is an issue to which we will have to return. It is disappointing that, in the considerable intervening time during which the Bill went through its various Stages in the Seanad and this House, the Minister of State has not had some discussions, even on a preliminary basis, on a proposed amendment. That would enable us to deal with the matter now, so that it could be enshrined in the basic statute.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	823	Yes. I will speak on each of them separately. My amendment No. 5 relates to an issue I dealt with on Committee Stage. As a matter of general principle, I thought I had convinced the Minister of State – indeed, he indicated he would give serious consideration to this matter on the basis that the chief executive officer should not be on the board of a company as that blurs the necessary division of responsibilities. I have tabled similar amendments to a number of Bills to the effect that a chief executive should not be a voting member of the board. The board should make policy and the chief executive, although attending board meetings, is separate from the policy-making role. It is a matter of good governance. I would hope that, on mature reflection, so to speak, the Minister of State might accept that view.Amendment No. 6 seeks to delete the figure "3" and insert the figure "5". The purpose is to increase the number of accountants on the board as it is inadequate to provide for only three out of the 14 members. While it would be important to ensure that it is not a matter of self regulation, we need to consider the appropriate number of accountants to give the board the necessary professional accounting overview. The number proposed in the Bill is too few. The overall number will depend on whether the amendment with reference to the chief executive is accepted and whether the chief executive happens to be an accountant. For that reason, I would have preferred to deal separately with those issues.Amendment No. 7 proposes to delete sections 3 and 4. Those provisions prohibit more than four members of the board from being members of accountancy bodies. That is wrong in principle and can only guarantee that the supervisory authority would lack the necessary relevant knowledge of the subject matter of their responsibilities, which could be very complicated in processing some complaints. It is a matter of teasing out the question as to the right number to give the proper balance to the supervisory authority. I would have thought the numbers I am suggesting would improve the Bill. I would like to hear the considered opinion of the Minister of State.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	824	Amendment No. 3 provides for inclusion of the Institute of Directors as a designated body. As I said on Committee Stage, in the context of my re-examination of the composition of the board of the supervisory authority, I looked very closely at the list of designated bodies at section 6, because each of those bodies has the right to nominate a person as a director to the board. I added the Law Society of Ireland to the list on Committee Stage in the Seanad. I am happy with the list of designated bodies provided for at section 6. Their nominees to the authority should bring a balanced and appropriate range of expertise to that body.Turning to amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7, as I already said on Committee Stage, I deliberated at some length and with considerable care as to the appropriate composition of the board before altering the permissible level of representation by accountants. The purpose of the formula I designed is to achieve what I believe is a fair, realistic and equitable balance in terms of overall representation on the board. I am still of that view. The number of directors can be altered by means of ministerial regulation under section 46 (1), as a consequence of changes made with regard to prescribed or designated bodies.Specifically on amendment No. 5, I have reflected on the question raised by Deputy Howlin, which would have the effect of debarring the chief executive officer from being a director of the supervisory authority. From a general corporate governance aspect, it is normal in companies to have executives who are also members of the board of directors. This is especially the case where chief executive officers are concerned.The main area of concern is where all the power in a company is vested in the chairperson who is also the chief executive, which is not considered conducive to good corporate governance practice. That is not the position in the case of the new statutory authority. Accordingly, I am satisfied with this section as it is worded.With regard to Deputy Howlin's comments on expertise, sub-committees can be set up to deal with specific issues and the executive can hire or put in place persons with expertise if necessary. Though the board may not fully comprise experts, it will have access to people with expertise. From the foregoing, the Deputies will understand that I am not prepared to take the amendments on board.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I am dismayed that the Minister of State has changed his mind on this issue of the chief executive since the discussions I had with him on the last occasion.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	826	I never committed myself to anything such as that. I explained I would consider it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	827	I understood it was more than that. The empire strikes back. What is the optimum number of accountants the Minister of State considers should be on the board and how will he achieve that?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	828	The maximum will be five accountants. Three would be from the accountancy bodies, one from the designated bodies and the chief executive, who in many cases would be an accountant, could be the fifth member.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	829	That means that there will four, with the potential of five if the chief executive is an accountant. I will not quibble with that as it is better than the original proposal. However, the chief executive should not necessarily be an accountant. Five accountants would be the correct proportion. However, I am not going to win the argument.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 11, line 39, after "subsection (2)(b)” to insert “, and a statement of those reasons shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas”.The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that when a member of the supervisory authority is removed, as is authorised under the section, the Minister must formally notify the Dáil and the Seanad of the reasons for the removal. In an era of transparency and accountability, nothing less would be expected. I do not see any difficulty in accepting that amendment.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The nominees of designated bodies, not of the Minister, are appointed by the Minister to be the directors of the supervisory authority. It is possible that the reasons a person is removed from a directorship could be personal and private. Accordingly, I am reluctant to impose an obligation on the Minister in all instances to have to disclose reasons to both Houses of the Oireachtas. If there is a particular concern about the removal of a director at a point in time, a Deputy can submit a parliamentary question on the matter. The relevant Oireachtas committee can also ask the chief executive and the chairperson to account for the reasons for the removal.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	832	I hope the Minister of State is indicating that he will accept another amendment that will allow the chief executive to comment on Government policy. There is no other basis on which the chief executive could give the information that the Minister of State has stated to an Oireachtas committee. We will wait with anticipation to see whether his goodwill extends to that.There is no logical reason a simple explanation cannot be given to the House for the removal of a member of the supervisory authority. If there were personal reasons, a statement to that effect would suffice. It should be a matter of principle and openness that business is done in an open way. There should not be State secrets and exceptions. It also should not be incumbent on a Member to table a parliamentary question to ascertain such information. The more we make this House relevant to the functioning of all agencies we establish under legislation, the better it will be.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 17, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:"(5) A disclosure pursuant to subsection (2) or section 19(1) or a decision pursuant to subsection (4) shall be notified to the Standards in Public Offices Commission and shall be made available publicly by the Standards in Public Offices Commission.".The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that declarations of interest are available to the members of the public. I am sure, a Cheann Comhairle, you are familiar with the workings of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Commission. It is now normal under these structures to ensure that declarations of interest are made public and that conflicts of interests are publicly discernible.This is a matter of the openness flowing through public administration since the enactment of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 and other legislation, including the Freedom of Information Act 1997. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment in the spirit it was tabled to allow for openness. I do not believe it would harm any potential member of the supervisory authority if their declarations of interest were made public.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	834	The Deputy's amendment stipulates that material interests arising in sections 18 and 19 be notified to the Standards in Public Office Commission and be made available publicly by that body. On Committee Stage, my response to this amendment was that it is not appropriate that these items of information be included in this legislation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	835	Why not?

This amendment also attempts to commit the commission to making this information available which is inappropriate for this Bill. For these reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	837	That is an extraordinary response from the Minister of State. He has basically told the House that it is a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission, of which the Ceann Comhairle is a member, to determine the law and what should and should not be disclosed to members of the public. I am sure if you were free to say so, a Cheann Comhairle, you would agree with me. It is not for the Standards in Public Office Commission but for the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine what is declared and the manner in which it should be disclosed to members of the public. It is a peculiar suggestion of the Minister of State that it is not a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas to make such decisions but rather the Standards in Public Office Commission.Does the Minister of State—
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	838	It should be an amendment to the Standards in Public Office Commission Act 2001 and not to this Bill.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	839	That is not what the Minister of State said. He said it was a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	840	The amendment is not appropriate for this Bill.

If that is what he is suggesting, it is an amazing assertion. I reject the notion that it is a matter for the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. The spirit of it should now be a matter of routine analysis in legislation as gender proofing is a matter of routine. We once said we needed special legislation to prevent discrimination against women. It is a matter of routine that there is such gender proofing in all legislation. We would not expect overarching legislation to give these rights to women. In a similar vein, if we are serious about ethics and standards, this concept should pervade all legislation enacted by these Houses.

In page 20, to delete lines 43 to 47.This amendment was also discussed on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to remove the gag that is proposed in this legislation on the chief executive and chairperson of the supervisory authority. Under the Bill, neither of these two individuals can comment on Government policy if called to do so before a committee of the House. I regard this as inappropriate.The Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business today dealt with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill. I tabled a similar amendment concerning the supervisory authority being established under that Bill. During that debate, the Tánaiste accepted that similar amendment. She said it was her Department's policy not to have such a gag. I assume the Tánaiste sets policy in her Department and therefore the Minister of State should accept this almost identical amendment to this Bill.

The Tánaiste explicitly stated today that it would be her policy and that of her Department not to have provisions of this nature. For this reason she agreed with my amendment to remove the provision from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill. Either it is the policy of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or it is not. Is the Minister of State in a position to overrule the Tánaiste on this matter? I would be happy to adjourn the House for five minutes to allow the Minister of State to take advice from the Tánaiste.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I will try to address the key issue involved. Unfortunately I will be unable to deal with each of the amendments, as I cannot track them all. I have a view on this, which I discussed with the Tánaiste before the Bill was introduced. The model for addressing complaints proposed in the legislation is that a complaint be initially processed through one of the three professional accountancy bodies. These bodies are to make arrangements to process a complaint according to their own standing orders, subject to regulations to be determined by the new supervisory authority we are establishing.We do not know how long this will take. The most recent case took a very long time and involved a very expensive process. The Bill suggests that the new supervisory authority, if it is minded so to do, can set that aside and start again. While I disagree with this model, it is the one we have and there is no point, therefore, in my trying to dismantle it by tabling amendments because I lost the argument and do not have the votes on this side of the House to convince the Minister of State that it is a cumbersome model. However he must be faithful to this model in enacting legislation.Amendment No. 11 would establish that the appropriate place for a preliminary examination is within the body and there should be a facility laid out in statute outlining how a complaint should be processed. While a formal inquiry under section 23 might be necessary, there should be some sifting in advance of that. This seems a reasonable approach. We debated this principle at length on Committee Stage. The section should specifically refer to due process. There can be no objection to enshrining a procedure that is in accordance with due process and natural justice. We should lay out the procedure in the basic statute.This is basically what is at issue in this series of amendments which seeks to lay out the model the Government has accepted from the advisory group it established to deal with complaints. It should be explicit, fair, transparent and laid out. Otherwise, as Deputy Hogan forcibly argued on Committee Stage, the supervisory authority might be the first port of call and might be overwhelmed by representations bypassing the preliminary sifting we seek. This is at the core of the proposals of the Minister of State. If he is faithful to his model, he must lay out the procedures that are fair and appropriate under this. Otherwise he must abandon his model because the recipe within the proposal before the House will ensure the supervisory authority will collapse under the weight of its own complaints.I appeal to the Minister to revisit this matter. I hope he has had a chance to reflect on the arguments made on Committee Stage and thought of an answer to the very clear case being made on this side of the House.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	861	I am slightly confused by the way in which the amendments are grouped. A great many issues arise in respect of the amendments under discussion which relate to principles of natural justice. For this reason, Fine Gael has insisted that the amendments should be made to the Bill. It has been brought to our attention that amendment No. 20 raises the issue of permission to copy documents rather than merely to inspect them. It is felt that this could lead to problems.Generally, the Fine Gael amendments seek to ensure that people have the right to be represented, to defend themselves and to know what accusations are being made against them. All rights regarded as proper to natural justice and the right of people to defend themselves have been incorporated in the amendments. For that reason, we are anxious to see them made.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	862	Deputies Hogan and Howlin have tabled a significant number of amendments which repeat amendments tabled and discussed on Committee Stage. They propose the introduction of significant procedures and practices in respect of the manner in which the supervisory authority conducts investigations, inquiries or reviews under sections 23, 24 and 25.Having reflected on the concerns voiced by the Deputies on Committee Stage, I considered it appropriate to bring forward a number of amendments in my own name. These are being discussed as part of this grouping. The most significant amendment is amendment No. 47 which proposes the insertion of a new section 28. Subsection (4) of the new section will require the supervisory authority to make regulations in respect of the procedures to be followed in the conduct of inquiries under section 23, investigations under section 24 and reviews under section 25. Thus, there will be a statutory obligation to prepare a modus operandi for conducting inquiries, investigations and reviews under the relevant sections.Subsection (2) of the new section will provide that a witness before the authority shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court. Subsection (3) of the new section seeks to protect persons against having to disclose any information they would be entitled to refuse to produce on the grounds of legal professional privilege. The subsection also prevents the authority inspecting or copying any document containing such information.Amendment No. 46 is consequential on the introduction of the new section 28. Amendment No. 56 is designed to provide the same protection against having to disclose information or produce documents in circumstances where legal professional privilege arises. Amendment No. 48 will insert a new subsection (3) into the existing section 28. The subsection will make provisions in respect of the manner in which the court can deal with an application from the supervisory authority under section 23 for permission to conduct an investigation under section 24. The subsection specifically provides that the court may set aside any pre-existing decision of a prescribed accountancy body relating to the matter.Amendments Nos. 13 and 16 are consequential amendments which are being discussed as part of this group for the simple reason that Opposition amendments are proposed to the subsections to which they are being made. Naturally, I will move my amendments while opposing the relevant Opposition amendments. Amendments Nos. 23 and 26 are consequential amendments which arise from changes I am proposing today or issues of clarity.I am satisfied that my amendments constitute an appropriate response to the concerns and views expressed by Deputies Hogan and Howlin. In the circumstances, I am unwilling to accept any of the amendments in this grouping which they have tabled.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	863	I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is beginning to address the issues. However, his is a lazy man's way of doing so. He is providing an enabling provision for regulations which we have not seen. I would like to see the regulations. The House should know what procedures will be involved to ensure they are fair and comply with the principles on which our amendments are based.A complicated series of amendments have been grouped, some of which we have just received. We are considering them to discover the extent to which they address the concerns behind the Opposition amendments.The purpose of amendment No. 21 is to ensure that all disciplinary decisions of the supervisory authority are published. Can the Minister of State guarantee that this will be the case? Since such a provision is made in respect of solicitors, why should one not also be made in respect of accountants? Amendment No. 31 seeks to provide a new subsection (3) to allow the supervisory authority to refer any question as to a possible breach of the prescribed accountancy body's standards by a member to the prescribed accountancy body concerned for investigation by it. Will a provision of this sort be encompassed in the regulations?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	864	We do not know. The Bill will stand as it is published and the regulations will be drawn up by the supervisory authority.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	865	That is the whole point. We are buying a pig in a poke. The Opposition has set out a procedure which we suggest would be fair and appropriate. The Minister of State has listened to our arguments and agreed that such a procedure should be introduced. However, he says it should be determined by the supervisory authority and implemented by way of regulation. We have no idea what the authority's procedure will be. In essence, the Minister of State is asking us to buy a pig in a poke. Can the Minister of State answer my questions?

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	875	It is not usual to be provided with the regulations before the primary legislation is enacted.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	876	It is good of the experienced Minister for Defence to help.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	877	As Deputy Howlin is well aware having been in the position himself, a right to judicial review is available at all times.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	878	That is a very important right.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	879	It is normal for the statutory body to set this up.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	880	I have availed of the right myself.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	884	As no other Member is offering, Deputy Howlin should make his final contribution on the grouping.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	885	How many amendments are we dealing with?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I have not counted them.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	887	I have not counted them either. There are a great many. The notion that they can be addressed in three interjections is farcical.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	888	That is the ruling.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	889	The ruling is that I can object to the grouping.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	890	I understand the grouping was agreed before I came to the Chamber.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	891	To return to the debate, the principle is quite clear. There should be fair procedure in terms of complaints.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	892	I should point out that the Deputy may speak for as long as he likes as he is replying to the debate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	893	Thank you.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	894	There is no limit.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	895	That is a dangerous thing to tell me.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	896	He will speak all night. I have no problem with that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	897	I am sure the Minister of State does not. This is the net issue. Although there are other issues I would like to discuss, this is the core issue for me. The procedures should be clear. This is a fundamental issue of natural justice. There should be a clear procedure and people should know how it will be followed. There should be an initial clearing house for complaints. It could act as a procedure to deal with vexatious complaints. We should be certain that complaints will be dealt with in the first instance by professional bodies. This is the Minister of State's model, not mine.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	898	That is why we have introduced this amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	899	To enable that to be done by a regulation that we have no sight of—
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	900	The regulations will be set out so that people will see the situation. We took the Deputy's advice on board and introduced this amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	901	I appreciate that. I am sure the Minister of State is being disorderly by speaking before I have finished my final contribution on this amendment.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	902	The Deputy is inviting my contributions.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	903	The Minister of State is welcome.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	904	I will have to desist.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	905	We cannot resume the Committee Stage debate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	906	May I ask a final question? I appreciate that I will not get anywhere with it. The amendments tabled by Deputy Hogan and I set out a procedure which is intended to be part of the primary legislation. The procedure is fair and meets the test of natural justice. If the amendments are accepted, it will be compulsory for people to follow the procedure. The findings will be published and that will be that. The Minister of State has said he is addressing Deputy Hogan's concerns and mine by allowing regulations to be introduced. What sort of regulations are planned, in terms of the authority of the House? Will the regulations be laid before it? Will they be statutory regulations? Will they capable of being struck down by the House?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	907	They are subject to a judicial review. I am afraid I am being disorderly by answering the Deputy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	908	The fact that the Minister of State is being disorderly shows how farcical this is. He said that this matter will be subject to a judicial review, but that will do nothing other than to determine whether the regulations are in accordance with law. Policy and law are determined by the House. If we do not like the regulations, the Minister of State says that they will not come back to us. If we do not like the procedures adopted by the Minister of State, we will not have any say in them. I wish to confirm to the Minister of State that the vagueness of this will put at risk the functioning of the supervisory authority. It will attract people towards making the authority the first port of complaint. There is every danger that the supervisory authority will collapse under the weight of the complaints with which it will have to deal.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	909	I do not accept that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	910	The cost of processing a single complaint is up to €3 million. The Minister is providing little more than one third of that amount to allow the supervisory authority to function. He is providing for the demise of the authority as part of the Bill. He is asking us to buy a pig in a poke.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	911	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 21, lines 30 and 31, to delete ", (c) or (d)” and substitute “or (c)”.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	912	Amendment No. 14 in the name of the Minister arises out of committee proceedings. Amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, 29 and 30 are related. Amendment No. 29 is an alternative to Amendment No. 30. It is proposed to take Amendments Nos. 14, 17 to 19, inclusive, 29 and 30 together by agreement.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	913	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 21, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"(4) If, at any time before completing an enquiry under this section into a matter relating to a member of a prescribed accountancy body, the Supervisory Authority forms the opinion that it is appropriate or in the public interest that the matter be investigated under section 24, the Authority may apply to the High Court for permission to investigate the matter under that section.”.I am proposing several related amendments, and I would like to explain what they are intended to do. The first and most significant of those is amendment No. 14, which inserts a new subsection (4) into section 23. Deputies will recall that, by virtue of amendments which I tabled on Committee Stage, the supervisory authority would have been prevented from undertaking an investigation under section 23 where the same matter had already been the subject of an investigation under section 24 and vice versa. On reflection, I am of the view that an absolute prohibition as just described is not warranted. For instance, it could result in the authority undertaking investigations under section 24 which could and should be undertaken under the powers contained in section 23, just so that they would not be denied the right to proceed under section 24.The insertion of the new subsection will allow the supervisory authority to apply to the court to change to an investigation under section 24, and I am satisfied that that will give greater flexibility to the authority while, at the same time, ensuring that the interests of the other parties can be protected by the court. Amendment No. 29 substitutes a new subsection (2) in section 24. That is a section that I had already amended on Committee Stage. The additional element now included is the reference to the ability of the supervisory authority to conduct an investigation under section 24 into a matter that has been examined under section 23, where the High Court grants such permission on the application of the authority.Amendment No. 19 provides that any suspension of an existing decision only operates from the time the court delivers its judgment. Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are consequential on the earlier amendment inserting a new subsection (4). I have retained the flexibility for the supervisory authority to undertake an investigation under section 24, where the authority considers it appropriate or where it is in the public interest and, accordingly, I am not prepared to accept Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 30.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	914	I will not oppose the Minister of State's amendments because he has made a logical case for them.Amendment No. 30 in my name, which we debated on Committee Stage, underlines that I am unclear about the meaning of section 24(2)(a) which, as it stands, states that: “in the Authority's opinion, it is appropriate or in the public interest to undertake the investigation”. My amendment seeks to delete “appropriate or” because I cannot see how it could be appropriate if it is not in the public interest, which was my argument on Committee Stage. I am sure the Minister of State has had a chance to reflect on that and can explain the options. How could it ever be appropriate if it was not in the public interest to have such an investigation?In so far as I have had a chance to follow the Minister of State's amendments since they were circulated, they seem to improve the Bill.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	915	We have already discussed the issue of "appropriate or in the public interest". If something is in the public interest, some person might challenge whether it is actually in the public interest, whereas the authority could decide on something it considers as being appropriate. Therefore, it is different from not necessarily being in the public interest and we feel both should be included in the section.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	916	I do not see how "in the public interest" is subject to challenge, as the Minister of State suggests, and the word "appropriate" is not. Either phrase is subject to challenge but that is not the point. How could it ever be appropriate if it was not in the public interest? Why do we have the word "or" in this context?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	917	We wanted the authority to have flexibility in order that it would not be tied to matters in the public interest. The authority has the flexibility to go one way or the other.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	918	That is typical Fianna Fáil.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	919	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 21, line 32, before "the" where it firstly occurs to insert "completing".
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	920	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 21, lines 45 and 46, to delete "decides to direct a prescribed accountancy body under subsection (4)(b)” and substitute “applies under this section to the High Court for permission to investigate under section 24 any matter relating to a member of a prescribed accountancy body or decides to direct a prescribed accountancy body”.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	921	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 22, line 1, after "investigation" where it secondly occurs to insert "under this section".
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	922	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 22, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:"(a) in the case of an application to the High Court for permission to investigate a matter, any decision of that body relating to the matter is suspended if and as soon as the body is notified by the Supervisory Authority that permission has been granted under section 28(3);”.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	923	I move amendment No. 23:
In page 22, lines 17 and 18, to delete "the decision of the Supervisory Authority" and substitute "a decision made by the Supervisory Authority under subsection (4)”.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	924	I move amendment No. 26:
In page 22, line 23, after "matter" to insert "under subsection (4)(b)”.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	925	I move amendment No. 29:
In page 23, to delete lines 7 to 13 and substitute the following:"(2) If, in the Supervisory Authority's opinion, it is appropriate or in the public interest to undertake an investigation into a possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body's standards by a member, the Authority may do so–(a) following a complaint, or(b) on its own initiative,but no investigation may be undertaken into a matter that is or has been the subject of an enquiry under section 23 relating to that member except with the permission of the High Court granted on application under section 23(4).”.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	926	I move amendment No. 31:
In page 23, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:"(3) The Supervisory Authority may refer any question as to a possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body's standards by a member to the prescribed accountancy body concerned for investigation by it.".
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	927	I move amendment No. 33:
In page 23, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"(4) The Supervisory Authority upon receipt of a complaint against a member and before conducting an investigation under this section, shall–(a) provide the member with particulars of the matter in relation to which an investigation is contemplated, and(b) give the member the opportunity to make representations in connection therewith to the Supervisory Authority.(5) Where the Supervisory Authority proceeds with an investigation pursuant to this section, a member concerned shall be afforded the opportunity to–(a) attend and be heard at a formal hearing before the Supervisory Authority,(b) be represented before the Supervisory Authority by solicitor or counsel,(c) adduce documentary evidence,(d) cross-examine witnesses giving evidence against the person,(e) call witnesses on his/her own behalf,(f) make such submissions as he/she wishes to make to the Supervisory Authority.”.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	928	I move amendment No. 35:
In page 23, line 26, after "oath" to insert "or affirmation".Are we taking amendments Nos. 35 and 36 together?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	929	The Deputy may if he wishes to.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	930	I suggest we do. The Minister of State may recall he gave me a legal view on Committee Stage on this matter and undertook to check it again in the light of information I had. The purpose of these amendments is to give the supervisory authority an express power to administer affirmations. The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that it was unnecessary.While it is true that the Interpretation Act 1937 states that an oath includes a reference to an affirmation, where a person is entitled by law to give an affirmation, I am advised there must be a pre-existing entitlement. The only relevant entitlement is the Oaths Act 1888 which applies only to the legal definition of proceedings. I am further advised that it is unclear whether proceedings under the 1888 Act could encompass administrative proceedings of the kind contemplated by the supervisory authority in this legislation. Therefore, I am advised that this amendment is necessary.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	931	I am advised that paragraph 20 of the Schedule to the Interpretation Act 1937 adequately covers the Deputy's concerns. This Bill forms part of the corpus of company law and as such there is a need to ensure a uniformity of terms with those employed in that existing body of legislation. The usage we have adopted here achieves this objective. If, however, I was to make the amendment proposed by Deputy Howlin, it would have the result that in some places in the corpus of company law oaths and affirmations would appear whereas in others only the existing reference to an oath would appear. This would give rise to the kinds of doubts about which the Deputy expressed concern. I am not prepared to accept the amendment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	932	I raised this point on Committee Stage and I would have expected that the Minister of State would have responded to the legal position I outlined. Did the Minister of State seek legal advice subsequent to Committee Stage? Will he read into the record the written advice of the Attorney General in respect of the encompassing of proceedings under the Oaths Act 1888 and the position vis-à-vis the type of proceedings envisaged under the supervisory authority, which would be different from those before a court which would be encompassed by other company law? Is the amendment unnecessary? Will the Minister of State read into the record the advice he received following Committee Stage from the Attorney General?
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	933	Advice was received from the Parliamentary Counsel and I read it into the record earlier.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	934	The Minister of State did not address the issue.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	935	We were advised to proceed in the manner in which we have already. The company law review group is preparing the new company legislation. We will ask it to review this issue and we will keep the Deputy advised of how matters proceed.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	936	The only justification the Minister of State has put forward for rejecting the amendment is consistency in the Companies Acts. Those Acts are very different from the legislation before us and many of the proceedings under them would be taken in the courts. We are discussing administrative proceedings before a supervisory authority.My advice, from a normally sound source, is that the wording used in the Bill is infirm and that the issue has not been addressed.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	937	We received advice from the Parliamentary Counsel. I do not know the identity of the Deputy's adviser. We stand by the advice we received.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	938	I would like to hear that advice. The only justification the Minister of State provided for not accepting the amendment is for reasons of consistency. Will he answer the question I posed? Does the Interpretation Act 1937, which states that an oath includes reference to an affirmation, encompass the proceedings that are envisaged under the supervisory authority? It is a simple question.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	939	We received advice from the Parliamentary Counsel and the advisory section of the Attorney General's office which indicated that there is a need to ensure a uniformity of terms. That is what we have done in this instance.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	940	How can the Parliamentary Counsel review the legal position outlined by Deputy Howlin? The Minister of State's offer to keep Deputy Howlin informed of the counsel's deliberations will not have much effect because I presume the Bill will already have been enacted. How can such advice be of any value in that instance?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	941	The Minister of State has spoken twice and I can only call on Deputy Howlin to reply to the debate.

That argument was the same as that which he has just placed on record. He has not addressed the issue of whether this provision is infirm. He merely stated that the advice he received is that it must be consistent with the Companies Acts. However, that is not the question. If the Minister of State has received advice since Committee Stage that the amendment is unnecessary, will he read it into the record and indicate how the Interpretation Act 1937 will apply to proceedings envisaged under the Bill? I have no doubt that he has checked the position.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	950	I move amendment No. 37:
In page 24, line 6, after "other" where it firstly occurs to insert "ancillary or consequential".I am optimistic that these amendments will be accepted. As indicated from the advice I received, this section is of dubious constitutionality. It is not appropriate for the supervisory authority to simply give a certificate to the High Court on foot of which the court might punish a person who is not co-operating with it. Subsection (6)(c) is particularly wide and might be thought to include a power to send a person to prison until he or she co-operates. This would clearly be unconstitutional because it runs contrary to the right in the Constitution to a trial by jury. Accordingly, I am advised that only an ancillary or consequential order under that paragraph could be constitutional. The amendment is required to save the Bill from a constitutional challenge.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	951	I am prepared to accept the Deputy's amendments.

In page 28, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:28.–(1) The Supervisory Authority may for the purposes of exercising its functions under section 23 or24 conduct an oral hearing in accordance with regulations made under subsection (4) of this section.(2) A witness before the Supervisory Authority is entitled to the same immunities and privileges as a witness before the High Court.(3) Nothing in section 23, 24 or 25 compels the disclosure by any person of any information that the person would be entitled to refuse to produce on the grounds of legal professional privilege or authorises the inspection or copying of any document containing such information that is in the person's possession.(4) The Supervisory Authority shall make regulations respecting the procedures to be followed in conducting enquiries under section 23, investigations under section 24 and reviews under section 25.”.

In page 28, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:"(3) On application under section 23(4)for an order granting permission for an investigation under section 24 into a possible breach of a prescribed accountancy body's rules by a member, the Court may–(a) grant or refuse to grant permission, and(b) make any ancillary or consequential order it thinks fit, including, if permission is granted, an order setting aside any decision of the body relating to the member.”.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	956	I move amendment No. 49:
In page 30, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:"(i) a committee of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas;".The purpose of this amendment is to enable the supervisory authority to disclose information to the Oireachtas. It would be an absurdity if it could disclose information to the bodies listed in section 30 and not specifically state "a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas."  No doubt the Minister of State will tell us, as he did on Committee Stage, that this is already encompassed. As we are listing all the bodies to which information can be disclosed it is appropriate that we give the proper status and authority to committees of this House. That would not damage the Bill.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	957	Would the Deputy prefer to hear the long or the short reply?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	968	The Minister of State should allow Deputy Howlin to continue without interruption.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	969	The Minister of State would do well to read the amendment. It seeks to insert that a committee, not a particular committee, of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas be included in the list. The name of the committee is encompassed in the wording used and would not require any statutory change. Will the Minister of State accept the amendment?

In page 30, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"(5) Reference to this section is deemed to be inserted in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997.".This amendment seeks to insert a new subsection which provides that reference to section 30 is deemed to be inserted in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997. There was resistance on the part of the Minister of State to establish rights under the Ethics in Public Office Act without reference to it. I have no doubt he will accept that the proper way to deal with this would be to amend the Third Schedule of the Freedom of Information Act to include the new authority.The amendment seeks to facilitate the application of FOI to the supervisory authority. If we are speaking about an open and transparent system and as, incrementally, more bodies are being encompassed by FOI, I would like to hear a coherent reason the Minister of State cannot accept the amendment.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	973	Amendment No. 50 would, if accepted, constitute a new subsection (5) to section 30. The effect of the amendment would be to insert this section in the Third Schedule to the Freedom of Information Act 1997. As I explained on Committee Stage, legal advice obtained during the drafting of the Bill was to the effect that the question of the application of the Freedom of Information Act was one which procedurally fell to be addressed once the Bill is enacted.Accordingly, I am minded to adhere to the legal advice in this instance. It also appears acceptance of the amendment would result in implications for the confidentiality of the information referred to in this section. In the circumstances, I cannot accept it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	974	I have heard it all now. The advice is that we should insert this when the Bill is enacted. That is new. How will it be done? How will we include it in the terms of the Freedom of Information Act once the Bill is passed? Will it require new legislation? The Minister of State's reply beggars belief. We are either in favour of the Freedom of Information Act applying to the supervisory authority or we are not. If we are, we should make the change now and not wait for future legislation. It is a little like St. Augustine, we will be good but not yet.The Minister of State said it would not be appropriate to release certain information. That happens all the time in terms of applications. They are detailed in the FOI. The exceptions and exemptions made by the Freedom of Information Officer are subject to appeal to the Freedom of Information Commissioner. The procedures are set out in the 1997 Act to meet the difficulties to which the Minister of State has alluded. If he is serious about applying the FOI to the supervisory authority – and he has given no reason for not doing so – then he should do so now.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	975	I understand the Minister for Finance, by way of regulation, makes changes to the FOI and it is through that procedure the FOI would apply to this legislation.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	976	I move amendment No. 51:

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	977	I move amendment No. 52:
In page 32, line 13, to delete "Neither the Supervisory Authority nor any" and substitute "No".Under the section, no damages may be obtainable against the supervisory authority or anyone acting on its behalf for any illegal activity except where the illegal activity is carried on in bad faith. It is reasonable to exempt individuals who make mistakes. They should not be held personally liable but why should not the authority and its corporate entity be liable to pay damages to a person injured by it through inadvertence or ineptitude? There is no reason the authority should be exempted from damages in this extraordinary manner.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	978	The amendment seeks the deletion of the words "Neither the Supervisory Authority nor any" at section 32(1). The effect would be to remove the supervisory authority as a corporate entity from exemption from liability for damages for anything purported to be done or admitted to be done by the authority or a person on its behalf. I attach great importance to exemption from liability in the case of the supervisory authority as a corporate entity. This is the basis on which the legislation has been prepared. There are a significant number of precedents in comparable cases.

Labhair mé leis an Aire Stáit i Roinn an Taoisigh faoi seo agus is léir go bhfuil an ceart agam ó thaobh líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge ón daonáireamh.Bhí tagairt ón Aire Stáit nach bhfuil an Béarla in uachtar i Málta mar atá sa tír seo. Ní fíor sin. Trí Bhéarla a dhéantar idirbheartaíocht ar son na tíre sin, tá sí an-chosúil le hÉirinn mar sin. Ar an 1 Bealtaine 2004, beidh 21 teanga conartha ann, an Ghaeilge ina measc. Beidh 20 teanga oifigiúil ann agus tá sé aisteach go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar eisceacht ansin. Ní bheidh an Ghaeilge ina teanga oifigiúil go fóill.Cén fáth go bhfuil sé tábhachtach? Mar theanga oifigiúil, is cinnte go gcuirfeadh sí le fostaíocht sa tír seo do Ghaeilgeoirí. Níl aon dabht go bhfuil aitheantas don Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil an-thábhachtach in iarratas poist mar aistritheoir nó mar rúnaí san Aontas Eorpach. Mar atá sé, caithfidh duine ón dtír seo teanga breise a fháil chomh maith leis an Ghaeilge chun go mbeidh sé in ann post a fháil san AE. Cuirfidh sé turasóireacht sa tír mar bíonn suim ag cuairteoirí i dteangacha tíortha éagsúla. Cuirfidh sé le meas ag muintir na hEorpa ar chultúr na hÉireann. Beidh taithí ag daoine i bParlaimint na hEorpa bheith ag éisteacht le daoine ag labhairt na Gaeilge agus an cluasán á chaitheamh acu. Cuirfidh sé le tuairimíocht daltaí scoile atá ar nós anois gur cuma leo faoin Ghaeilge mar ní fheiceann siad deis fostaíochta asti. Chuirfeadh sé le cothrom na Féinne ó thaobh reachtaíochta na tíre seo ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúil.Tá sé tábhachtach gur féidir seo a dhéanamh nuair a thiocfaidh na tíortha nua isteach agus nuair a bheidh liosta de na teangacha oifigiúla ag méadú. Níl le déanamh ach Rialachán 1/1958 ón gComhairle a leasú agus an Ghaeilge a chur isteach chomh maith leis na teangacha eile. In Airteagail 4 agus 5, in ionad na bhfocal "san 11 teanga", cuirfear "sa 12 teanga". Ní morán é agus ní fheicimse tír ar bith a chuirfeadh inár gcoinne. Beidh siad ag fáiltiú tíortha móra agus ag glacadh le héagsúlacht teangacha agus bheadh ár dteanga náisiúnta féin ina measc. Ba bhreá liom go mbeidh an tAire in ann a rá liom anocht go mbeidh an Rialtas ag cur leasaithe mar sin os comhair an Aontais nuair a bheidh deis aige.

Tá a fhios agam dáiríreacht an Teachta maidir le cúrsaí na Gaeilge agus a sheasmhacht ar son na Gaeilge.Ba mhaith liom a dheimhniú don Teach gurb é beartas an Rialtais go fóill é go ndéanfaí monatóireacht ar fhorbairtí le go mbainfeadh sé leas as aon deis chuí a thiocfadh anios chun stádais na Gaeilge a ardú san Aontas Eorpach.Is í litir ar 23 Iúil 1971 a sheol Aire Gnóthai Eachtracha na linne chuig Uachtarán na Comhairle Eorpaí, agus inar sonraíodh dearcadh an Rialtais, mar aon le freagra an Chomhphobail don litir sin, a bhfaightear sa chonradh aontaithe é; a cinntíodh stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpach. Bheadh ábhar an dréacht-chonradh bunreachta, atá faoi bhráid na Comhdhála Idir-Rialtasaí, ag coinneáil go hiomlán leis an stádas seo.Ag eascairt as seo, tá stádas "teanga chonartha" ag an nGaeilge san Aontas Eorpach. Tá an scéal amhlaidh de bhrí go bhfuil na conarthaí as Gaeilge agus go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar cheann de na teangacha ina bhfuil an téacs údarach. Foilsítear gach conradh i nGaeilge, mar aon leis na teangacha eile, agus mar a dúirt me thuas, tá an stádas céanna ag an téacs inti is atá ag na teangacha eile.Socraíonn Airteagal 2.0 de Chonradh an Chomhphobail Eorpaigh ar réimeas teangacha an Aontais ó thaobh teangacha de. Ordaíonn an t-airteagal go "mbeidh na rialacha a rialaíonn teangacha institiúidí an Chomhphobail, gan dochar do na foralácha i rialacha nósanna imeachta na Cúirte Breithiúnais, socraithe ag an gComhairle ag gníomhú d'aontoil". Bunaítear le Rialachán 1/1958, ar bhonn an airteagail sin, teangacha oifigiúla agus teangacha oibre de chuid an Aontais, nach n-áirítear an Ghaeilge ina measc.Maidir le gnéithe teangeolaíochta de chuid mhéadú an Aontais, mhol an Coimisiún Eorpach sna hidirbheartaíochtaí ar mhéadú go ndéanfaí teanga oifigiúil agus teanga oibre as gach aon teanga náisiúnta de chuid na ndeich dtír aontacha. Aontaíodh ar an méid sin sna hidirbheartaíochtaí ar aontú. Dá bhrí sin, ar 1 Bealtaine seo chugainn tabharfar aitheantas mar theanga oifigiúil agus mar theanga oibre do naoi dteanga sa bhreis de réir téarmaí Rialachán na Comhairle 1/1958. Níltear ag súil go gcuirfidh an méadu isteach no amach ar stádas na Gaeilge san Aontas.

De bharr fáthanna praiticiúla éagsúla, tá na ballstáit i mbun bhreithniú ar roinnt chur chuige i leith reachtáil cruinnithe sa todhchaí. Ina measc seo atá togra amháin ina reachtálfaí níos mó chruinnithe ghrúpai oibre sa Bhruiséil gan aon soláthar ateangaireachta a bheith ar fáil iontu.Nior thángathas ar chomhaontú go fóill maidir leis an mbealach is fearr le dul ar aghaidh, ach glactar go forleathan gur gá le roinnt athruithe sa chóras mar atá sé faoi láthair má tá sá le feidhmiú ar an mbealach is fearr agus is féidir. Tá spéis mhór ag Uachtaránacht na hÉireann chun réitigh cothroim a bheith ann in am tráthúil don mhéadú i mí na Bealtaine.Ba cheart dom a rá, áfach, go leanfar ar aghaidh ag soláthar seirbhíse iomláine ateangaireachta ag gach cruinniú ag an leibhéal polaitiúil, agus nach bhfuil aon mholadh ann go n-athrófaí é sin.

I mí Bhealtaine na bliana 2002, le linn na n-idirbheartaíochtaí ar aontú, mhol an Coimisiún aitheantas a thabhairt don Mháltais mar theanga bharántúil sna conarthaí agus mar theanga oifigiúil oibre de chuid institiúidi an AE. Mhol an Coimisiún é sin i leith na Máltaise ar an mbonn, i measc eile, go mbaintear leas as an Máltais i ngach aon institiúid Mháltach, arna áireamh sa Phairlimint, sa Rialtas agus sna cúirteanna, agus le haghaidh cuspóirí eile riaracháin. Mhol an Coimisiún é freisin ar an mbonn gurb í an Mháltais máthairtheanga phobal uile Mhálta.Mar a dúirt me ní ba thúisce, leanann an Rialtas air ag baint leasa as gach aon deis chuí a thagann anios chun stádais na Gaeilge san AE a ardú. Is cuimhin leis an Teach seo gur dheimhnigh conradh Amstardaim an ceart a bhí ag saoránaigh an Aontais comhfhreagras a dhéanamh le haon cheann de na hinstitiúidí in aon cheann de na teangacha conartha. Ina theannta sin, moltar i ndearbhúchán a glacadh le conradh Nice go dtabharfaí freagra ar aon chomhfhreagras den sórt sin laistigh d'achar réasúnta ama. Chinntigh ionadaithe na hÉireann ag an gCoinbhinsiún Eorpach, a rinne an idirbheartaíocht ar an ndréacht-chonradh bunreachta, go gcoinneófaí na cearta sin. Lena chois sin, agus de bharr iarratais ón ár leith, ullmhaíodh leagan Gaeilge den ndréacht-chonradh bunreachta freisin, conradh a aontaíodh air ag an gCoinbhinsiún Eorpach.Bainfidh laithreán Gréasáin na hUachtaránachta leas cuimsitheach as an nGaeilge mar chuid de fheachtas nios leithne chun stádais na Gaeilge a ardú i gcomhthéacs an AE; agus i gcaitheamh na hUachtaránachta, bainfidh an Rialtas leas as deiseanna cuí chun na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn.

Like most rural schools, it serves as a focal point in the community. My problem is that the staffing arrangements for the school year are determined by the enrolment number on 30 September of the previous year. In this case, the enrolment number on 30 September 2003 will count.Knocknagrave national school had ten pupils on 30 September 2003 and there were a further three admissions in October. If the rule is to be interpreted strictly, the school will lose a teacher in September 2004. This would send out a negative signal and might be a mortal blow to the school. It would be devastating in that the principal would have to shoulder the entire responsibility for pupil enrolment from September next, almost reducing her to a nanny teaching eight classes.Primary principals are already severely overworked with administrative responsibilities. Many principals are purely administrative in the bigger schools which have what are known as walking principals. Teaching principals in schools such as Knocknagrave have the additional burden of teaching classes as well as managing day-to-day administrative affairs and other duties. They have no secretaries and also have extra burdens such as caretaking, light repair work and maintaining school records and returns to the Department.There are normally four classes in a two-teacher school and each teacher takes two classes, with a separate teaching programme for each. However, in a one-teacher school, eight classes would have to be taught simultaneously by the principal, which is not good practice, to say the least.On 1 September next year Knocknagrave school will have 17 pupils. This is significant in itself. The school experienced a small dip in numbers but it now seems as if there will be two or three admissions per year. This will increase the number of pupils above 17. One unique feature of the school is that it has a pre-school facility or playschool.In 2001 a €200,000 refurbishment programme was completed at the school. On the 9 o'clock news this evening I heard a representative from the national school in Gortahork speak of the closure of that school because of its state of repair and a problem with rats. One also hears of ceilings caving in. However, Knocknagrave is a fantastic school in a brilliant state of repair. It would be a pity to waste its resources.The Department's strict interpretation of the rules leaves little room for flexibility and makes little or no provision for borderline cases. In fact, the appeals procedure in the Department has a poor success rate of only 4%. I am trying to persuade the Minister to address the issue instead of having to go through the appeals procedure.The school has a fantastic community spirit in terms of erecting fences, painting, etc. When I visited it, a teacher was teaching French. The pupils tried to address me in French and I suppose I was in the fortunate position of having to reply in French. This is a pilot project in a rural school and to remove its teacher would rip its heart out. We should seriously consider revising the rigid rules so the school will continue in good working order.The school, like any other, has pupils with remedial difficulties, and some of the children need one-to-one tuition. The school is also considering night classes, which would be of major assistance to the surrounding community.If a larger school with six teachers were to lose one teacher it would not have the same impact as a similar loss on a two-teacher school. Knocknagrave school is facing a loss of 50% of its teaching capability, which would knock the heart out of the school.

In 1997 one needed double the amount of children now required to keep two teachers in a school. Amazing progress has been made on this issue, as I know from having been very involved with it with the then Minister, Deputy Martin. If Deputy Connolly believes there is a problem today, he should have seen what the problem was like in 1997.The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. This process works to the benefit of the majority of primary schools and there are no plans to change the process. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department of Education and Science to all primary school boards of management. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their schools in a school year. The staffing schedule for the 2003-04 school year is outlined in the Department's circular 9/03, which issued to all primary schools in February 2003 and which is available on the Department's website.The agreement referred to above can only be deviated from when a school – referred to as a developing school – experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. Rapid growth is defined as an increase in enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 25 pupils. The increase is 30 pupils for schools with an enrolment of 299 pupils or more, but this is not relevant in this case. In addition to the enrolment there is a stipulated excess of five pupils – ten pupils for larger schools – on the appointment figure.An independent appeals board on the mainstream staffing of primary schools was established in August, 2002 and commenced operation at the beginning of the 2002-03 school year. The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals, under certain criteria, against the mainstream staffing schedule as issued to schools. One of the main criteria for appeal states that where the board is satisfied on verifiable evidence that the required pupil numbers were enrolled in September or October but, due to circumstances outside the control of the school, were not enrolled on 30 September. However, for staffing purposes, a pupil can be included in the enrolment of only one school in any school year. The appeal board allows for equitable and transparent treatment of all primary schools and its decision is final. It is not open to the Minister for Education and Science or his Department to interfere in this process.The allocation of additional teaching posts in recent years for improvements in the staffing schedule and for children with special needs, together with a decline in enrolments, has helped to ensure that the overall pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has improved substantially. This includes a decrease in the overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2002-03 school year.The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment on 30 September 2002 of 12 pupils, which warranted a staffing for the 2003-04 school year of a principal and one mainstream class teacher. The school also has the service of a learning support teacher and a resource teacher. I understand that the enrolment at the school on 30 September last was ten pupils, which under the present staffing schedule would warrant the appointment of one teacher to the school.Once the discussions on the staffing schedule for the coming school year are concluded, the schedule will be set out in a circular that will issue to all primary school boards of management in 2004.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	990	It is almost exactly two months since Deputy McGinley and I found ourselves in this situation regarding another school in Donegal. Last October parents from Loch an Iúir national school withdrew their children from classes in protest at the unsafe conditions in which their children were forced to attend school.Today the parents of 119 pupils at Gortahork national school have found themselves in the same situation. They have been forced into this action because of the extreme situation they find themselves in. The local Sinn Féin representative for the area, Mr. Pearse Doherty, brought the matter to my attention early last week. There are differences, of course. In Loch an Iúir, the health problem was dangerously high radon gas levels, while in Gortahork raw sewage and rats are the problems. A meeting of the parents took place on Monday night and they reluctantly decided to take this action as a way of highlighting the unacceptable conditions in the school.Children from the ages of four and five upwards are expected to use a playground that overflows with raw, untreated sewage at high tide. The sewage has resulted in high levels of e.coli being detected in the playground and because of the position and layout of the playground, the sewage does not flow back, but remains in the playground, preventing access to the playground for children.With sewage comes rats, a number of which have been detected within the school grounds. Parents are legally obliged to send their children to school and so parents, by law, must send their children to a rat-infested, sewage-swamped environment. Despite the best efforts of teachers and management, there is nothing they can do without resources and so parents have been forced to take direct action. I applaud them for their courage and their determination in standing up for their children and their rights. It is a move born of frustration with the Government's policy on school building, a frustration shared by parents across the State.When I raised the plight of Gortahork national school with the Minister for Education and Science last year he stated that health and safety issues at the school are a matter for the management authorities of the school. The escalation in the seriousness of the problem, as demonstrated by the decision of the parents to withdraw their children, underlines the fact that the management authorities do not have the ability or resources to deal with these issues.The Government cannot be allowed to wash its hands of schools like Gortahork national school, abandoning it to its own devices. In his response to a question I put to him the Minister stated: "It is not a matter for my Department to provide funding from the annual allocation for primary buildings for works external to the site of a primary school."  Does the Department of Education and Science seriously consider a school's playground to be external to the site of the school?Aside from these chronic health and safety issues, the school building itself dates back to 1927 and suffers from severe structural problems, lacking any kind of canteen facilities. Initially built for 30 pupils, it now has over four times that number and the principal's office comprises a telephone on a window ledge.At what point does the Government stop abdicating its responsibility to the pupils and teachers of the school? When is the Government going to deliver a safe, comfortable environment for students to learn in and teachers to teach in? Will the Minister in his response explain why a rat-infested, structurally inadequate school with a severe sewage problem is not a priority for repair? I cannot understand that system. There is no point in using the money provided by the Department to kill rats when the sewage problem will attract them anyway.The situation is not eased by the fact that the Gortahork sewerage scheme was not included for upgrading in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's water services investment programme last year and I join my colleagues in the constituency in calling on the Government to prioritise investment there to deal with the serious effluent problem in coastal waters.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	991	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht na deise a thabhairt dom an cás fíor-speisialta seo a thógáil ar an Athló sa Dáil tráthnóna inniu.This is not the first Adjournment debate on the critical situation in Gortahork national school. The last Adjournment debate was in February 2002, almost two years ago and on that occasion the Minister informed me that conditions in Gortahork were, in his opinion, far less than satisfactory and that the board of management was asked to engage an architect to conduct a feasibility study as to the best solution for the school.Two years have now elapsed and nothing has happened, which has left everyone utterly frustrated, provoking the parents into taking the unprecedented step of withdrawing their children from the school this afternoon. That decision was not easily made.The original school was built in 1929 for 30 pupils, as Deputy Crowe said. Today there are 119 pupils and five teachers in the school. One could say the school is located between the devil and the deep blue sea. At the front is the busy N56, with which the Minister is probably familiar. It is a very dangerous road and is a continuous hazard to pupils entering and leaving the school. However, the most serious hazard is at the rear of the school – the Gortahork Estuary. During spring tides the schoolyard and play area are flooded and there is a high level of e.coli contamination in the water. The presence of e.coli in those waters has been independently verified by Aqualab, an independent monitoring company, and it is disturbingly in excess of EU safety levels. After every flood tide the yard and playground must be disinfected. Anyone can recognise that this poses a definite health hazard for both pupils and teachers. Some of the classrooms are infested by rats which could possibly be carriers of e.coli.The school is on the INTO's list of substandard buildings and the only long-term solution to the problem is a new school. The present facilities are completely inadequate to meet the needs and requirements of effectively teaching the modern curriculum. A site is available in the area through the good offices of Údarás na Gaeltachta, but everyone is frustrated at the delaying tactics of the Department. What we need in Gortahork is an immediate decision to provide a new school on the available site so that the best education possible is provided to the pupils who are attending the school. Tá súil agam go dtuigeann an tAire gur scoil Gaeltachta í scoil Gort a' Chorice sa cheantar Gaeltachta is treise i dTír Conaill. Tá sé scanallach go raibh ar na tuismitheoirí inniu a chuid daltaí a tharraingt amach ón scoil. Ní dhéanann tuismitheoirí cinneadh den chineál sin muna bhfuil brú uafásach orthu agus sin a tharla i nGort a' Choirce.Níl an scoil oiriúnach do riachtanais oideachais an lae inniu agus sé an t-aon freagra ar an cheist seo ná scoil úr do Ghort a' Choirce. Tógadh an scoil atá ann anois do 30 dalta agus tá 130 ann i láthair na huaire. Tá siad ag brath ar seomraí réimhdhéanta agus níl sin inghlactha. Nuair a bhí seo sa Dáil agam dha bhliain ó shin ar an Athló, bhí dóchas againn go raibh rud éigin cinnte, dearfa le tarlú ach níor tharla sé.Is trua nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta féin anseo ach tá Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta anseo agus tá eolas aige ar an cheantar agus suim aige an fhadhb a réitiú. Iarraim air mo thuairimí agus tuairimí an Teachta Crowe a chur in iúl don Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta agus tá súil agam go mbeidh na páistí ar ais sa scoil chomh luath agus is féidir.Sula rachaidh siad ar ais go dtí an scoil, an undertaking must be given that alternative accommodation will be provided for the children until the new school is built. There is alternative accommodation in the area. Such accommodation was provided for Loughanure national school a few weeks ago. The situation is as critical at Gortahork national school. Iarraim ar an Aire a dhícheall a dhéanamh an cheist seo réiteach.

Cuimsíonn an tuairisc seo láthair na scoile agus beidh tionchar aige sin ar an gcinneadh a thógfar sa bhfad-téarma. Leanfaidh an Roinn leis ag déanamh plé leis an bhord bainistíochta ó thaobh na ceiste seo.Is léir go bhfuil an fhadhb tarraingte ag an dabhach séarachais poiblí atá in aice leis an scoil agus nach féidir seo a réiteach go héascaí. Tá an Roinn sásta idirghabháil a dhéanamh le patrún na scoile agus an bord bainistíochta le socrú fad-téarmach a fháil maidir le sealúchas feiliúnach don scoil.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	993	In my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 3 and oral Questions Nos. 10, 11, 76 and 82 of 6 November last, I set out in some detail the broadly positive assessment of the NDP by the ESRI. Key conclusions in the ESRI evaluation are: the NDP strategy remains valid; the NDP has made significant progress towards attaining its objectives; the plan is having a sustainable positive economic effect with expenditure adding a permanent increase of 3% to GNP and an overall rate of return of 14% for 2000-2003 is being achieved on investment; infrastructural investment should remain a core priority for Government investment.In the Estimates published on 13 November 2003 and the budget on 3 December, I have taken a number of steps which are consistent with the ESRI evaluation. I have provided €5.6 billion for infrastructure investment in 2004, the highest ever in the history of the State, an amount close to 5% of GNP, double the European average.In my Budget Statement, I announced a major change in the financial treatment of capital spending. Building on the successful rolling investment programme or financial envelope in place for public transport I extended this approach through the introduction of five-year multi-annual envelopes for all investment areas. The envelopes include a commitment to keep the level of capital investment at close to 5% of GNP during 2004-2008, a total investment of €33.6 billion during the period.In implementing the new envelope system I intend, with effect from financial year 2004, to allow Departments to carry over to the following year any unspent Exchequer capital allocations, up to a maximum of 10% of each annual capital subhead. The introduction of multi-annual capital envelopes was recommended by the ESRI in their mid term evaluation of the NDP. It ensures that infrastructure investment will remain a priority for the Government to end 2006 and beyond. The global amount and sectoral allocation of the envelopes is also broadly in line with the ESRI recommendations.

By mid-century, this is projected to grow to some 2.5% of GNP. The package of public service pension reforms outlined in my Budget Statement to the House on 3 December 2003 is estimated to generate annual savings of €300 million, in current terms, in about 30-40 years time with some savings being realised earlier than this.

These are spread throughout the country with the main concentration in the Dublin area. The properties comprise 400,000 square metres of space and are occupied by a range of Departments, offices and agencies.The annual cost for these leased properties is approximately €97 million. In general, the unexpired period left on each lease can vary from less than one year up to 20 years or more. In many instances, the leases provide for break periods which allow for their early termination, subject to appropriate notice being supplied by the party wishing to exit from the lease.Where early surrender of a lease is required outside of a break period, the matter has to be negotiated by the parties concerned. The extent to which penalties might apply depends on a number of factors. These include: the specific terms of the lease; the willingness of the landlord to accept the surrender of the lease; the length of the unexpired period on the lease; the alternative letting options open to the landlord; whether the landlord might have plans to redevelop the premises; whether the Office of Public Works can arrange for the sub-letting of the premises to other tenants or for disposal by assignment. The Office of Public Works's approach is to secure the best outcome from the State's viewpoint, in any negotiations on surrender of leases. The objective in all such cases is to minimise the impact of any penalties that might arise.As regards the specific property and lease details sought by the Deputy, the Commissioners have informed me that these are not all readily available. The Office of Public Works, however, is actively compiling the necessary details in the format sought and a full report will be issued to the Deputy as soon as possible.

However, it is hard to predict with a high degree of confidence what will be the effects. The consequences of a smoking ban on tax revenues are thus difficult to estimate. Substantive research in this area is restricted to a small number of countries where such bans already exist.

I have already appointed an implementation committee to drive the process forward and a joint Department of Finance-OPW unit is being established to support it and to liaise with Departments. The committee has been asked to provide a detailed implementation plan by the end of March 2004.The chairman of the committee will report to the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation, which comprises the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister for Finance and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Furthermore, every Minister is expected to take responsibility for that part of the programme which relates to his-her Department, including the agencies which come within his-her remit.

Patent income is aggregated in the Revenue Commissioners' records with other forms of income and could not be distinguished without conducting an extensive investigation of those records.There are difficulties in providing costs for some reliefs mainly due to the simplification of the tax returns process and the resulting aggregated nature of the information gathered. My Department is working closely with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to consider mechanisms to enhance the level of information captured in respect of tax reliefs to facilitate work on evaluation and review. In addressing this requirement, I am, of course, conscious of the need to balance the needs of the Exchequer with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden on taxpayers in general and on the business community.

All cases received from that time would be dealt with immediately while cases received prior to April 2002 would be processed alongside current cases. At that stage, the commissioner envisaged that the arrears cases would be dealt with over a three year period. I understand that this arrangement worked quite well initially but has now been affected by a significant increase in new review applications being received in the course of this year, 2003, and the office is now reconsidering its targets in relation to clearing arrears cases. The commissioner's office is currently preparing a statement of strategy for the three year period 2004-2006 in which it will develop new business plans to address, inter alia, the issue of the backlog of pre-April 2002 cases.The rate of completion of reviews has been increased significantly this year, by about 32% by comparison with 2002. However, because of a substantial increase in the level of review applications this year, the number of cases on hands has increased. At the end of November 2003 there were 870 cases on hands in the office of the Information Commissioner that had been accepted for review compared with 611 such cases at the end of November 2002.As the commissioner is dealing with reviews in two streams, current cases as well as older cases, any average figure would need to be treated with caution. Figures are not currently available for the average time taken to conclude reviews. However, she hopes to give fuller details of completion timetables in her annual report for 2003.

This will be one of the largest events to take place in Ireland in the course of the Irish Presidency of the EU of January to June 2004.Some 300 delegates and about 400 media representatives are expected to attend. The national delegations will come from the 15 current member states and from the ten acceding countries, making a total of 25. Each country's delegation will be led by its Minister for Finance and Governor of its Central Bank. A number of Commissioners and heads of EU institutions and their officials also will attend. The ten acceding countries will become member states of the EU on 1 May 2004 with the completion of the enlargement process in their case.It will be appreciated that hosting a meeting of this size, with the attendant security costs, is unavoidably expensive. However, this expense has to be viewed against a background where this country is proud to be holding the Presidency of the EU and is determined to make a success of every aspect of that Presidency.The estimated gross cost of hosting the event, taking all elements, including security and communications, into account, could be of the order of €750,000. Of that cost the rental of the Punchestown facilities will cost €60,000. The net cost of the event to the State will be significantly less than the foregoing on foot of sponsorship from the private sector.I should also mention that in relation to the costs of the EU Presidency the State will benefit from the proceeds of issue by our Central Bank of a special collectors' coin. With regard to the employment of consultancy expertise in association with the event, it will be appreciated that organising and servicing an event of this magnitude makes significant extra demands on my Department. The expertise is mainly to ensure comprehensive and well informed coverage of the event and of the progress of the Irish economy, in the foreign media especially. The expertise is also being engaged to provide support for the programme management of the event.All of the standard procurement procedures regarding seeking of tenders and assessment of tenders were observed in making the appointment. A final price is being negotiated with the successful applicant at present. I am satisfied that this consultancy will represent good value for money.

The report from my own Department was submitted on 24 October, along with further supplementary information which was sought by the group and forwarded to them on 24 November.The Civil Service performance verification group has been examining these progress reports, as well as a report on the Civil Service sector as a whole, with a view to deciding in relation to each organisation and grade under its remit whether the level of progress achieved warrants payment of the general round and benchmarking increases due on 1 January 2004. I expect that my Department will be informed shortly of the group's decisions.Responsibility for providing information on the verification process in the other sectors of the public service rests with my colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Children; Education and Science; and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

Since then the group has been examining this matter generally and currently has three financial institutions under inquiry in relation to the offshore activities of their subsidiaries.Arising from these inquiries and other voluntary disclosures, the Revenue Commissioners have to date collected in excess of €125 million from persons holding funds offshore. This amount has been paid by 325 taxpayers. It is not possible for the commissioners to establish the amount held abroad by Irish residents as the funds held in offshore jurisdictions by financial institutions, including subsidiaries of Irish financial institutions, are obtained from a wide variety of sources.The commissioners will be inquiring into all Irish financial institutions which have or have had subsidiaries operating in offshore jurisdictions with a view to establishing the identity of Irish residents holding funds in these jurisdictions. These inquiries, while seeking to establish the identity of Irish residents holding offshore accounts, will also deal with the institutions' compliance with general tax law and with their obligations under the Finance Acts 1992 and 1995 to report to Revenue where they facilitated the opening of an offshore account or the sale of a material interest in an offshore fund.The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has recently stated before the Committee of Public Accounts that Revenue will seek to pursue the issue of aiding and abetting tax evasion where evidence emerges that this occurred. The commissioners are also committed to including aiding and abetting as a feature in all future prosecution programmes.

This relief applied when CGT rates were much higher. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement.The abolition of this relief is in accordance with the overall tax policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. Reliefs and allowances made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above. As the Deputy will be aware, the CGT rate was halved from 40% to 20% in the 1998 budget.The most logical time to tax capital gains is when they are realised and this change has brought CGT into line with other tax areas. Section 67 of the Finance Act 2003 gave legislative effect to the abolition of this relief and I have no plans to re-introduce it for any sector including the agricultural industry.

I understand that 254 individuals came forward and made voluntary disclosures and that, to date, payments totalling in excess of €102 million have been received. Revenue now intend to pursue vigorously those individuals who failed to come forward, using all powers available to them. Criminal prosecution will be considered in these cases subject to obtaining the relevant evidence. It is clear from some of the disclosures to date that the offshore trusts were used to facilitate tax evasion.

It is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. If the current average monthly payment based on subscriptions to the scheme to 31 October 2003 continues for the full year, the annual cost in 2003 would be about €530 million. This, however, is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be different than that, if account holders change their monthly contributions. The total gross cost over the period of the scheme will be reduced by the exit tax to be received at the end.I would like to point out that the special savings incentive account scheme was designed to be available to as many people as possible. Its success is reflected in the 1.17 million people who have opened an account. The minimum contribution was set at €12.50 per month, which is approximately €3 per week, in the hope that this would encourage widespread participation in the scheme, including social welfare payment recipients and those on limited incomes.Based on the analysis of the 2002 returns, the proportion of investors saving at the maximum level was 38% and the proportion at the minimum level was 2%. The monthly subscription levels at 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 are as follows:

Countering tax evasion in the shadow economy is a major focus of every tax administration in the developed world including Ireland. The primary focus of revenue administration as set out in the Revenue Commissioners' statement of strategy 2003-05 is on improving compliance and maximising revenue collection. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has recently established a new organisational structure that is focused on the needs and risks in its customer base. Through its new structures, Revenue will better target potential areas of fraud and evasion and effectively deploy its resources to address these areas. Revenue is in the process of deploying advanced risk assessment and case targeting tools to ensure that its audit and investigation resources are deployed where they are most needed.In addition, the hidden economy monitoring group has been in existence for a number of years under the terms of the national agreements between Government and the social partners and it continues to meet as appropriate to monitor developments and review the effectiveness of measures to combat tax evasion and social welfare fraud. I have asked the Revenue Commissioners to bring the claim of the chairman of ISME to the attention of the group at its next meeting in January.

Among the priorities in the programme will be: preparation of ECOFIN's input to the Lisbon process and to the spring European Council to discuss that process, including the preparation of the ECOFIN presidency's key issues paper; examination of member states' stability and convergence programmes under the Stability and Growth Pact; integration of the ten acceding countries into the EU's economic policy co-ordination and Lisbon processes; preliminary consideration of the post-2006 financial perspectives that determine the EU budget for the period 2007-13, and of future regional policy in the EU; and pushing forward with legislation in financial services and other sectors; certain other areas – most notably the initiative for growth proposed by the Italian Presidency of the second half of 2003 and economic-financial issues arising at the intergovernmental conference – will continue as appropriate. I have held extensive consultations in the EU on the programme and have every confidence that the ECOFIN Council, in the period of the Irish Presidency, will make very substantial progress in pushing forward with this ambitious programme of work.

To date, Revenue has collected €48.52 million in tax, interest and penalties as a result of the investigations. This is made up of €43.76 million, paid in relation to 284 settled cases and €4.76 million in respect of payments on account, in cases still under investigation. I understand that 110 cases were finalised with no additional liability arising and that 58 cases are progressing towards finality. Of these, six involve relatively small sums and are unlikely to involve significant liability. Three cases were prosecuted this year with fines being imposed in two of them and a suspended sentence imposed in the other. The individuals concerned have also settled their tax affairs and paid the outstanding tax, together with interest and penalties. A further case is currently under investigation with a view to prosecution.Aggregate results of the ongoing investigations have been published each year since 1998 in the annual reports of the Revenue Commissioners. Individual details of settlements have also been published where the provisions of section 1086 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applied.

This is staffed by two principal officers, one who is an actuary, six assistant principals, two higher executive officers, two executive officers and three clerical officers. This unit is additional to the Pay Master General's Office, pensions, which issues pension payments to retired civil servants. Accordingly, in view of the considerable support that is currently provided to Departments in this regard and to the Government's policy on the reduction of numbers in the public service, I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to establish a stand alone actuarial unit at the present time.

On foot of that review and having considered the many pre-budget submissions which were made to me, I made a number of announcements regarding various tax reliefs in my budget statement last week. These included the extension of the film relief to end 2008 with an increase in the amount per film that can be raised under the relief to €15 million. There was also an extension to the termination date for the other schemes to 31 July 2006 in order to relieve pressure on construction resources to meet the December 2004 deadline and allow for an orderly winding down of these schemes. In line with my position on targeted reliefs, I also extended in budget 2004 the business expansion scheme and the associated seed capital scheme for a further three years to 31 December 2006. It must be accepted that, of their nature, tax reliefs even where they can be justified for good public policy purposes will reduce the tax bill of those in the higher income bracket.

In these extreme cases the houses had been damaged beyond the reasonable costs of repair or had suffered long-term flooding – a minimum of three weeks. The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 December 1998. All available funding has now been expended or is committed and there are no plans to implement a further home relocation scheme.

The investigation has essentially two elements. There are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits. Revenue has advised that the review team has enquired into 289 cases to date and 55 of these cases have concluded settlements with Revenue. The 289 cases, taking account of spouses and connected companies, consist of 300 names. The 289 cases are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors' report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed on the authorised officer's report. A total of 211 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and four cases with insufficient identity information.The investigation includes examining the tax position of disclosed entities and accumulating and assembling information on other connected entities. The number of connected entities in relation to cases under investigation is now nearly 700. To date a total of €26.10 million has been received, mostly by way of payments on account, in respect of 77 cases. This is made up of:

In particular, it was considered at the time of the 1997 Revenue Commissioners' report on the effective tax rates for high earning individuals based on the tax years 1993-94 and 1994-95 but the conclusion at that time was that the problem would not justify such a global approach and that such an approach would be likely to encourage tax planning rather than discourage it. The issue was also reconsidered more recently including in the context of this year's budget.

As the Deputy will appreciate, negotiations have only commenced and so it is not possible to comment on the likely outcome at this stage. The Revenue Commissioners hope that a further round of negotiations will take place in the new year but no date has yet been fixed.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1022	The euro is trading higher against the US dollar and sterling than at any time since it was introduced in January 2002. The appreciation of the euro affects the economy in a number of different ways.The main negative effect of a stronger euro is to make Irish exports less competitive on world markets. This occurs as exports to non-euro areas become relatively more expensive, while at the same time imports from these areas become relatively less expensive. Also, firms competing with US and UK firms in markets outside the euro zone will experience competitiveness problems. The reduced competitiveness of the euro area lessens demand for Irish goods and services.A significant proportion of Ireland's trade is with non-EU countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. The recent rise in the euro against sterling and the dollar must be a cause for concern. In my Budget Statement I specifically highlighted Ireland's vulnerability to sharp falls in the US dollar exchange rate against the euro. That is why competitiveness is a priority for the Government. We must remain vigilant to the risks to our competitiveness, such as wage and price inflation. If not, jobs will be at risk. On the positive side, a stronger euro lowers inflation by reducing import prices and reduces oil prices, as oil is invoiced in US dollars.

I am also planning to revise the guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital projects. These are all designed to address cost overruns on projects, enhance the quality of project management and appraisal, including the conduct of more rigorous cost benefit analysis, and to promote better value for money generally.The NDP/CSF evaluation unit has been engaging with my Department on ongoing work on the revision of the capital appraisal guidelines. The unit is an independent evaluation unit which is co-financed by the Exchequer and the EU and has responsibility under the direction of the technical assistance monitoring committee for evaluation of the NDP operational programmes and related issues. In this regard it has engaged in, or overseen, a number of evaluations since the commencement of the NDP, including the evaluation of investment in key capital programmes such as the road network, and in public transport.The key responsibility for the evaluation, planning and execution of capital projects rests with line Departments and the relevant implementing agencies. I will, however, keep the ESRI recommendation under review especially in the light of the ongoing work programme of the NDP/CSF evaluation unit.

The NPRF was established in April 2001 with the objective of meeting as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 until at least 2055. I have no plans to alter the basic levels at which contributions are made to the NPRF.As explained in answers to other parliamentary questions on the fund, I am committed to the investment mandate of the fund as set out in section 19 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. This provides that, in investing fund moneys, the commission shall seek to optimise total financial return provided the level of risk is acceptable to the commission. Therefore, the commission is required to adopt a standard commercial investment policy and it does not have discretion to choose not to invest in particular sectors or companies for anything other than commercial reasons. Accordingly, there is nothing to prevent the commissioners from investing in projects in Ireland should they be satisfied that such investments are likely to yield a commercial return.

The Revenue Commissioners inform me that because of changes to the computer register made in October to facilitate Revenue's new regional structure, it is not possible as yet to give complete figures for October. Those shown represent activity up to 24 October 2003. They do not take account of a project to audit returns received in respect of the recipients of share options. A total of 4,022 of such audits were carried out in 2002, resulting in a total audit figure for 2002 of 15,951. A total of 1,054 of such audits were completed in 2003. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no decline in its normal audit activity during 2003.

The exceptions are re-insurance, voluntary health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance.The purpose of the non-life levy is to broaden the stamp duty base. It is a significant source of revenue to the Exchequer and is modest compared with that in other EU member states, where it is generally levied at a significantly higher rate than in Ireland, typically between 9% and 15%. I have no plans to abolish this levy, which yielded about €87 million in 2002.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has responsibility for the insurance industry. On 25 October 2002, she announced a programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in the Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of interrelated measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market and to reduce costs all round.

However, it has not been possible to schedule a second round of negotiations in December but it is hoped that these negotiations will take place early in the New Year.Section 69 of the Finance Act 2003 contains an amendment to Irish domestic law which imposes a charge to capital gains tax on an individual in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years. I announced this anti-avoidance measure in budget 2003 on 4 December 2002 with effect from that date.

In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. Generally speaking, the basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons. The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit. I have no plans to change the arrangements in that regard.I might point out that in budget 2000 I initiated the process of band widening with a view to establishing progressively a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. When this process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band.As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was examined comprehensively in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999 and the report is available from the Government Publications Sale Office. The group was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.The working group acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, and while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at the present time.The treatment of married and cohabiting couples under the social welfare code is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

The principles governing rent schemes were set out broadly as follows: the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households; allowances should be made for dependent children including those under 21 years of age in full-time education; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household; provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship; and appropriate local factors should be taken into account, including the costs of the maintenance and management of the stock of rented dwellings and the adequacy of the rental income to meet such costs.Within the broad principles outlined above, authorities have discretion as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of rents and how to deal with hardship cases, poverty traps and any other anomalies that arise in individual cases.By definition, local authority rents should reflect ability to pay. They bear no relation to economic rents in the private sector. Based on the most recent returns from local authorities the average weekly rent in 2002 was €29.62 per week.

Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by the Finance Act 1999. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders is the principal basis for identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme in 2001. This inquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 18 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 26 financial institutions. No further applications for such orders are pending in regard to the bogus non-resident account inquiries.A large volume of information has been reported to Revenue under the High Court orders and inquiry work in relation to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. Further general issues of inquiry letters were made in January, May, July, September and October 2003. These general inquiry letter issues relate to 76,000 non-resident accounts that had Irish addresses connected to them. To date 149,000 inquiry letters have been issued to taxpayers in respect of these non-resident accounts. The final general inquiry letter issue is scheduled to take place in January 2004.

Since publication of the commision's report in January 2001, there have been extensive discussions with the unions on this whole issue. In September 2001, the Government accepted the thrust of the commission's recommendations and established, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the PPF, a working group to advise on implementation. The working group comprised representatives of the public service unions and relevant Government Departments and reported recently. Parallel working groups with the same remit as the main working group were also set up in the case of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. Several additional meetings were held with individual unions and associations to discuss specific commission recommendations.I would also point out that it is intended that the public service unions will be fully informed about implementation of the reforms in advance of their introduction on 1 April 2004.

The Central Statistics Office estimates that the actual effect was something in the order of 1%. This small difference is accounted for by the difficulties in estimating the impact on the consumer price index of the 1% increase in the lower rate of VAT.At the time of the budget last year, we projected the average annual inflation rate, inclusive of these changes, would be 4.8%. The actual outturn is now projected to be 3.5%.In budget 2004, we estimate that the effect of the changes in indirect tax will add less than 0.4% to the consumer price index. The CSO has indicated that they are in agreement with this estimation.

This consultation paper was designed to facilitate discussions on the introduction and design of the carbon energy tax while recognising that there are divergent views on the issue. The paper gives a concise overview of the issues relevant to consideration of the proposal including revenue recycling or "tax neutrality". Submissions in response to the paper were invited from interested parties to be received in this Department by 30 September 2003, but extra time has been given where requested by organisations to complete their submissions. To date, 116 submissions have been received by my Department in response to the carbon taxation consultation paper.

All relevant issues will be taken into account in the consideration of the proposal.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1047	The provisional market value of the fund at 18 July 2003, the latest date for which figures have been published by the commission, was €8,392 million. At this date a total of €8,715 million had been placed in the fund from the Exchequer. This represented a return for 2003 of 5.2% and a reduction in the loss of capital to the fund from €737 million at end 2002 to €323 million. This capital loss is a net figure which takes account of investment income in both the temporary holding fund and the fund itself, and also of gains in the bond portion of the fund offset by declines in the value of equities. As the fund will not make significant disbursements for over 30 years it is the long-term return on its assets that is most relevant. Short-term losses or gains, which may never be realised, must be seen in this light.One of the key principles underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is the fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement investment strategy. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 and the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on a long-term allocation of 80% equities and 20% bonds.These features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day to day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from the year 2025 until at least 2055, is to be achieved.Consistent with the philosophy underpinning the fund, I do not regularly ask the commission for detailed reports on short-term investment returns. The fund's investment strategy is a matter for the commission and I have no say in it. Regular discussions between me and the commission on its investment strategies would seriously interfere with the long-term focus.In its statutory annual report to the Minister for Finance, the commission is specifically required to include information on the investment strategy followed, a report on the investment return achieved by the fund and a valuation of the net assets of the fund at year end. These requirements are designed to ensure that detailed information concerning the fund is made available to the public at the appropriate time. The commission's report for 2002 was published on 23 July 2003.This report includes on page 24 a table setting out in money terms the fund's position to end-December 2002 as follows:

A number of taxes could apply, especially in the case of a new house. Additionally, the rate of payable stamp duty will depend on the profile of the purchaser whether first-time buyer, owner-occupier or investor.In the case of the sale of a new house or apartment to a purchaser, VAT applies at the reduced rate of 13.5% both on its construction and on the site, where these are connected contracts and is included in the final price of the property to the purchaser. No VAT applies in respect of the purchase of a second hand house.In the case of stamp duty, there is no stamp duty on the purchase of new residential property for owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, where the dwelling is not greater than 125 sq. m. If a new dwelling is greater than this size, stamp duty is charged on the site value or on one quarter of the full house value, whichever is the greater, in the case of owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, at the relevant rates.With regard to the transfer of a second hand property, first-time buyers are exempt from stamp duty on properties costing up to €190,500 and can avail of a significantly reduced rate of stamp duty on a property costing up to €381,000.In addition to VAT and stamp duty, tax receipts in the form of income tax or corporation tax would arise on any tax adjusted profits made by the builder in the case of a new house. PAYE and PRSI also apply in the case of employees involved in the construction of the house. Where the builder purchased the site from a landowner, both capital gains tax and stamp duty would also normally apply.

In pursuit of these inquiries Revenue has, in two instances, obtained High Court orders under powers introduced by the Finance Act 1999. This has resulted in a significant amount of information being provided to date. In the third instance, the institution is co-operating and the matter of seeking High Court orders has not arisen. The commissioners expect that they will be instituting inquiries into subsidiaries of other financial institutions in the coming months.The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners recently initiated a series of high level meetings with certain financial institutions. The purpose of these meetings is to discuss issues concerning possible tax evasion involving the use of offshore accounts in subsidiaries of financial institutions and possible co-operation by the institutions with Revenue inquiries into this matter.

Prior to this, the rules were based on a mixture of statutory provisions, old case law and Revenue administrative practice, which was an unsatisfactory situation. The new residence rules set out in the 1994 Finance Act both simplified and clarified the area and were generally welcomed.Section 69 of the Finance Act 2003 contains an amendment to domestic law which imposes a charge to capital gains tax on an individual in respect of a deemed disposal of certain assets on the last day of the last year of assessment for which the individual is taxable in the State, prior to becoming taxable elsewhere, where the individual disposes of these assets while resident outside the State and returns to the State within five years.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1051	In July 2002 a high level group of independent experts was invited by the EU Commission President, Romano Prodi, to analyse the consequences of the two strategic economic goals set by the European Union for the decade ending in 2010: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy with sustainable economic growth and greater social cohesion, the so-called "Lisbon Agenda"; and to make a success of the pending enlargement by rapidly raising living standards in the new member states. The group was chaired by Andre Sapir, a Brussels-based academic who is also a policy adviser to the Commission.The group's report, published last July, puts forward an agenda focusing on where EU policies and their economic management can make the greatest contribution to achieving the declared objectives of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, continuing price stability and greater economic and social cohesion in the enlarged EU. Two key issues of concern for Ireland are the proposals regarding a sharp reduction in EU agricultural expenditure and the relative weight of national contributions to the EU budget, which should be reduced in favour of revenue sources with a clear EU dimension.The most direct implication of the Sapir report for Ireland is to reduce and reformulate the assistance available from the CAP. A mid-term review of the CAP was agreed last June. This agreement runs to 2013. The negotiations were tough for all concerned. It does not make sense to reopen this agreement. The CAP should give stability and predictability to farmers. Farmers are entitled to expect that the agreements reached on the CAP and the funding necessary to sustain it should be incorporated in the EU's planning for the post-2006 period.Ireland is totally supportive of the main agenda for making the EU the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world. Both in our role as President of the EU and as a member state participating in the debate about future EU financing, Ireland will support an agenda for competitiveness and economic dynamism. We will also give a constructive hearing to Commission proposals which progress this agenda without prejudicing agreed EU policies.The reference to the EU being funded by more distinctive EU revenues may reflect Commission wishes to have a more independent and visible EU revenue. Intensive discussions are taking place in the Commission with regard to post-2006 EU financing and we expect the Commission to publish its proposals in January. We will examine its proposals when they come out. We will not know until then whether the ideas of the Sapir report will be reflected in the Commission's proposals. While we will judge the Commission's proposals by reference to agreed EU policies and their impact on Ireland, it is my view that the current EU own resources system works well. It has always delivered the resources necessary to finance agreed Union expenditure and member states' contributions broadly reflect their ability to pay. We do not need a more complicated system to fund the EU or direct EU resources and taxes.

However, given the scale of outturn cost on public capital projects against original estimates there is a need to strengthen the procurement process. I, therefore, intend to bring proposals to Government in the new year to put in place more cost effective arrangements for the procurement of publicly funded construction projects and related professional services.The proposals for construction contracts will include a more optimal distribution of risk between contracting authorities and contractors, with the objective being to adopt best private sector practice where appropriate. One example would be the "design, build and transfer" approach. This will involve changes to the standard forms of construction contracts or, where appropriate, the development of new forms of construction contracts.As I mentioned in my budget speech, I intend to change the current procedure for hiring consultants on publicly funded construction projects. In many cases at present, the greater the out-turn cost the greater the consultants' fees. This is no longer appropriate. Where traditional construction contracts are in use, competitive tendering will become the norm for the selection and engagement of these consultants. The overall objective will be to introduce greater pricing certainty into public capital projects and significantly reduce cost over-runs in future years.

With regard to large capital programmes, responsibility for individual projects, is therefore, generally delegated to the relevant Department.The role of my Department is to set out a clear framework on the management of capital investment. Departments are expected in managing capital projects to comply with my Department's guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector. These guidelines provide for a four stage process appraisal, preliminary and detailed, planning, implementation and post project review. The appraisal stage aims to provide a basis for a decision on whether to approve a project in principle. This stage includes an assessment of uncertainty and risk.Second, the planning stage involves the establishment of a project management structure, preparation of a design brief, detailed planning and design of the project and a review of costings. If changes are proposed to the project during the planning stage, the guidelines make it clear that the cost implications should be fully appraised and the approval of the sanctioning authority sought before proceeding. On receipt of a tender price and other relevant information, the case for proceeding with the proposal is again subject to review. Where it is proposed, following such reappraisal, to proceed with a project at a price higher than that originally proposed, a decision will again be required by the sanctioning authority to proceed.

The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003 implements recommendation 4 that there be a proper balance between prudential concerns and the direct interests of motor insurance policyholders. Section 26 of the Act provides that the new Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority is required to promote the best interests of users of financial services in a way that is consistent with the orderly and proper functioning of financial markets and the orderly and prudent supervision of providers of those services.I expect to publish a second Bill this week that will provide for a statutory financial services ombudsman whose mandate will include complaints about insurance. This will implement MIAB recommendation 27. As regards MIAB recommendation 58, the stamp duty on certain non-life insurance policies is a significant source of general revenue to the Exchequer and, as I stated in response to previous parliamentary questions, I have no plans to abolish or ring-fence this duty.

The PPF provided for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes, ALMPs, to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. Indecon international economic consultants were commissioned by my Department on behalf of the standing committee to facilitate a rigorous assessment of the overall effectiveness of existing programmes, and to help inform the deliberations of the standing committee. The consultants' report was finalised and brought to the standing committee in November 2002. The standing committee is due to complete its work on the overall appraisal of ALMPs very shortly. The FÁS review of CE and the job initiative programme is also nearing completion and will be published. The reports in question will be published upon completion of the review process.

The report confirms the importance of the food and drinks industry to our economy in terms of employment, exports and consumer spending. Its analysis of food prices and related matters is a valuable contribution to our understanding of many issues in that area. The report will be taken into consideration by me and by my Department in ongoing policy work, particularly in relation to competition and consumer policy and to competitiveness issues generally.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1065	During 2000, 2001 and 2002, my Department spent a total of €9,693,395 on consultancies. For the Deputy's benefit, a comprehensive list of the consultants engaged, including details relating to the purpose of the consultancy, and the expenditure on each consultancy are set out in the accompanying table.My Department continues to seek greater efficiencies, effectiveness and value for money in the administration of its financial resources. My Department's requirements for consultancy arise only where appropriate skills, knowledge or expertise are not available within the Department, or where a particular need arises that cannot be addressed within the resources available. When it becomes necessary to engage consultants, Government tendering procedures are followed, which ensures that contracts are awarded to the most suitable and cost effective tenderer. Where possible, my Department utilises the expertise available in other Departments and offices, such as obtaining legal advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in preference to engaging external consultants.A feature of the Department's procedures for approving funding for consultancies under the consultancy subhead – subhead A07 – is that before any funding is approved by the management board, the section requesting such funding must make a strong business case, outlining the anticipated benefits, the value-added nature of the consultancy, and the argument for engaging outside consultants in preference to undertaking the work using the internal resources of the section.

This existing co-operative framework can be used effectively and efficiently to deal with job losses and job creation in the area. Accordingly, the establishment of a task force would not achieve this objective with any greater effect.FÁS has already contacted the company and offered to make available its full range of services, including training, job placement and other services.

The Competition Authority has embarked on a comprehensive study of the medical, legal and construction professions. The authority is examining eight individual professions in the following order: engineers, architects, dentists, veterinary surgeons, barristers, solicitors, optometrists and medical practitioners. The study of each profession strongly focuses on entry barriers and restrictive practices.To date the authority has published consultation documents on entry into the engineering and architect professions and it is expected that reports will be published throughout 2004. I await the findings of the authority on the legal profession.
Question No. 106 answered with Question No. 104.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1072	I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 to 110, inclusive, together.The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps provides the search and rescue service off the north west coast. Since late September, there has been an unusually high incidence of sick leave among the Air Corps rearcrew, including winchmen and winch operators.As service continuity within the north west search and rescue service operation could not be guaranteed with the existing rearcrews, the GOC of the Air Corps posted 13 of the 17 personnel to other duties. The four remaining crew were due to return to duty, but three opted to transfer out of search and rescue. The reasons, therefore, are a matter for the individual crewmen. The remaining crewman, a search and rescue instructor, serves on the search and rescue roster in Sligo on the S61.The Air Corps is committed to providing safe working conditions for all its personnel, entailing the use of best practice and the optimum equipment for all missions and tasks. The winchman in question is qualified for search and rescue and was undertaking conversion training on a new aircraft type. I am advised that this conversion training does not require the presence of a search and rescue instructor on the target deck.All operational search and rescue winchcrew are trained in accordance with best practice and have the requisite skills necessary to undertake the duties of a full service search and rescue operation. There is one full winchcrew operating out of Sligo. Within the AirCorps, there are two fully trained search and rescue instructors and the Air Corps is also looking at all other available options to support the training and development of staff, so as to return to full service as quickly as possible.

Staff or staff representatives were not consulted in advance of that decision. However, all staff and their unions and associations will be fully consulted in regard to implementation of the decision.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1076	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decision on decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance in his recent Budget Statement provides for the transfer of my Department's Dublin based Civil Service staff to Newbridge and the transfer of Defence Forces Headquarters staff to the Curragh. A wide range of factors were taken into account and balanced in selecting locations, including the need to achieve a fit with the national spatial strategy, in terms of the gateways, hubs and their respective catchment areas, the location of existing decentralised offices, the desirability of clustering a Department's decentralised units within a region, the importance of respecting the scale and character of locations in terms of their capacity to absorb the number of new jobs involved and the existence of good transport links – by road, rail and air – and the general infrastructure capacity in the areas selected.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1077	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decision on decentralisation announced by the Minister for Finance in his recent Budget Statement provides for the transfer of all my Department's Dublin based Civil Service staff, numbering some 200 personnel in all grades up to and including Secretary General, to Newbridge, County Kildare. An amount of €16,389,000 was provided in respect of salary costs in my Department's Estimates for 2003, approximately half of which would relate to Dublin based staff. My Department has had no discussions to date with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Departments, concerning the extent, cost or availability of office accommodation in Newbridge.

Processing of this claim is suspended pending the completion of investigations into identification and registration issues in relation to bovine animals on the holding of the applicant. My Department has written to the person named in connection with this matter and awaits his reply.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1081	The person named applied for premium on four animals under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. The application was lodged on 23 July 2003. The closing date for receipt of applications was 27 June 2003. However, farmers could continue to apply, under penalty, up to 22 July 2003. According to the terms and conditions of the scheme any application received after the closing date, 27 June 2003 but before 23 July 2003 shall be reduced by a cumulative 1% for each working day the application is late. If any application is received on or after 23 July 2003, no premium grants claimed thereon shall be paid.The herdowner has been informed that as his application was submitted on 23 July that no grants are payable. He has also been advised that if he wished to appeal this decision he could do so by writing to the district livestock office of my Department. No further correspondence has been received from him to date regarding this matter.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1082	I am very conscious of the important role co-operatives outlets have played for many years in servicing the needs of farmers, including the sale of certain categories of animal medicines. However, because licences in respect of animal vaccines, which had been granted under the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932, no longer met current scientific or EU legislative requirements, it was necessary to review all such licences on an individual basis. Under the review, which has been ongoing since 1999, the Irish Medicines Board carries out the detailed examination of application dossiers submitted by sponsoring companies under the headings of quality, safety and efficacy. On this basis, the board makes a recommendation to me for a final decision on the grant or otherwise of a licence and on the conditions, including route of supply, accompanying such licence.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1083	The EU school milk scheme has been operated by my Department since 1982. The scheme provides for the payment of aid on the sale of milk and milk products supplied to all nursery, primary and secondary school children. The objective of the scheme is to promote and encourage milk consumption among school-going children.Participation in the scheme is open to all schools. Approximately 2,500 schools participate in the scheme annually covering over 90,000 pupils or 20% of the school-going population. Under the scheme, school pupils are entitled to receive a carton of milk at a maximum price of 15 cent per pupil per day. The subsidy payable represents about half this price.The scheme is largely funded by the EU with provision for Exchequer contribution. Total expenditure averages €1.3 million, depending on uptake in any one year, of which the Exchequer contribution amounts to €350,000.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1087	I refer the Deputy to my Budget Statement to the House on 3 December 2003 in which I announced the Government's decision to implement the bulk of the recommendations of the commission on public service pensions, including those affecting the retirement age of new entrants to the public service. The commission noted that because the overall demographic situation in Ireland is more favourable than other countries, this country would be in a better position than others to cope with the consequences of ageing for some time. Ireland currently has the lowest proportion of older people in the EU. It is expected that our proportion of older people will remain at much the same level for the immediate future but is projected to increase steeply by mid-century.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1088	The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be representing Ireland at the Intergovernmental Conference. However, I can indicate to the Deputy the current position.At the moment, the annual EU budget is effectively divided into two substantial sections; first, compulsory expenditure, that is, CAP guarantee expenditure; second, non-compulsory expenditure, this includes the allocations for Structural Funds, EU internal policies and EU external policies. The allocations for compulsory expenditure are decided by Council acting on a proposal from the Commission, after the European Parliament has been consulted. The allocations for noncompulsory expenditure are effectively subject to the final decision of the Parliament.The European Convention's recommended text for a European constitution proposes the effective abolition of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure in the annual budgetary procedure. While the draft constitution still requires that provision be made for legally compulsory expenditure, the Convention text in effect proposes that Parliament has the final say on the whole annual EU budget.There is a broad view, which I share, among Finance Ministers that it would be more reasonable and appropriate that a more equal balance be struck between the roles of Council and Parliament. They considered that Council and Parliament should have co-equal decision-making powers on the annual budget. In the eventuality of Parliament and Council being unable to reach agreement on a particular budget item, the lower amount of expenditure of the relevant budget item proposed by either Council or Parliament would prevail. Furthermore, if the amount in the previous year's budget were higher than the lowest amount for the relevant budget item proposed by either Parliament or Council, it would prevail.

In order to provide an incentive to save for this period, a 25% top up on savings is provided by the Government. This is equivalent to giving a tax credit at the standard rate of income tax in respect of the amount saved. This is legislated for in section 848D of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.Issues related to means testing for higher education grants are a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.

This is essential if we are to maintain the Irish economy's competitive position, to enable it to provide the resources to fund good public services and deliver real increases in social welfare benefits. The Government targets which involve significant public expenditure and the timescale for achieving the targets must have regard to this overriding policy objective. The Government announced a major programme to increase significantly the rates of child benefit in budget 2001. In framing each successive budget, however, the Government has had to take account of the prevailing economic circumstances while remaining committed to its specific policy objectives. Although it has not yet fully achieved its child benefit target, the Government has delivered over 80% of the programme at this stage. In light of the overall policy framework and the substantial increases already delivered, I do not accept that the commitments given on child benefit in budgets 2001 and 2002 can be regarded as factually incorrect.

The term "qualifying trade" is defined in the legislation governing the scheme. It includes a trade consisting of the manufacture of goods within the meaning of Part 14 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The relevant provision in part 14 is section 443(6)(a)(i), which states that goods which result from processes consisting principally of activities including cutting and packaging cannot be regarded as manufactured goods for the purposes of the Taxes Acts. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the company in question is engaged in an activity which is not regarded as the manufacture of goods within the meaning of the Taxes Acts and accordingly, it is not carrying on a qualifying trade for the purposes of the seed capital scheme. A range of issues regarding eligibility for the scheme have been raised with me. I will examine them in the context of the forthcoming finance Bill.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1103	The Minister of Finance is responsible for the development of the legal framework for most of the regulation of the financial services sector carried out by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of credit institutions is a matter for the authority after the legislative framework has been put in place. The authority has independent statutory responsibility for regulating and supervising credit institutions so that their financial stability is maintained and shareholder and depositor funds are protected.Primary responsibility for managing a bank and preventing fraud lies with the management of the institution in question. No regulatory authority can put in place a supervisory regime to ensure that a financial institution can never be a victim of fraudulent activity within the entity concerned. I am satisfied that we have a solid legislative framework for banking supervision, however. The creation of a single financial services regulator in the form of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority provides an effective organisational structure for enforcement of that framework. The IFSRA came into formal existence in May 2003. The Central Bank of Ireland was the independent statutory authority for banking supervision at the time of the events in Allfirst. Deputies will recall that the primary regulators of Allfirst's activities were the US Federal Reserve Bank and the banking regulator of Maryland.Deputies will also recall that when I became aware in February 2002 of the events at AIB's then US subsidiary, Allfirst, the Central Bank was asked to provide a report on the completion of its investigations as to whether it considered that changes to legislative provisions governing banking supervision might be required. The Central Bank reported that there was no evidence that the Irish legislative framework contributed in any way to the losses at Allfirst. It stated that it already had sufficient powers to work with the US regulators. Accordingly, the bank did not consider it necessary to recommend any changes in legislation in the area of supervision.

When the report of this investigation is available, the Office of Public Works will consider what assistance can be given to the county council. I presume the other areas referred to by the Deputy are Straffan and Ardclough. In both cases, Kildare County Council has submitted information on flooding to the Office of Public Works. The problem at Straffan relates to surface water drainage. The proposed works are a matter for the county council, therefore. In the case of Ardclough, Kildare County Council was advised that the report did not contain sufficient detail to permit a full assessment of the problem or potential solutions and no commitment to funding could be given by Office of Public Works.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1105	I am not clear whether the Deputy is referring to specific taxation dossiers or to proposed changes to treaty provisions. Ireland's strategy in respect of treaty provisions on taxation at meetings of the Council of Ministers is clear. We have always supported the principle of decision making by unanimity in taxation matters. We are firmly opposed to a move to qualified majority voting for decision making in taxation matters. Taxation remains a key issue for Ireland in the context of the negotiations under way at the Intergovernmental Conference on a new EU constitutional treaty. We will continue to oppose any move from unanimity in taxation matters. Ireland's strategy on specific taxation proposals at meetings of the Council of Ministers depends on the particular proposal, as well as on an assessment of its benefits and disadvantages. A number of dossiers will arise in the direct and indirect tax area in the context of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the EU.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1106	I am satisfied that good progress is being made on the implementation of Sustaining Progress. Two detailed progress reports have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. A basic objective of the recent budget is to secure competitiveness by keeping inflation low. Global competition is exerting downward pressure on prices and incomes. As an open economy, we are more exposed than most. We face intensifying competition for international investment and the jobs that go with it. We need to ensure that we limit wage increases to those set out in Sustaining Progress. We also need to ensure that we can get our costs and prices back into line with the rest of the EU.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1107	I assume the Deputy is referring to the implementation of the national development plan infrastructure programme via the plan's economic and social infrastructure operational programme. The ESRI's mid-term review of the development plan stated that significant progress has been made towards the plan's objectives of continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth and consolidating and improving economic competitiveness. The expenditure of over €10 billion in the first three years of the programme has exceeded the financial projections by 6%. Significant projects have been completed, are under way or are in planning in key areas such as transport, environmental services, social housing, health and education.It is estimated that the cost of completing the infrastructure elements of the national development plan will be significantly greater than originally envisaged. This is as a consequence of a variety of factors, including construction industry inflation, higher land costs and initial under-estimation. Although the targeted physical output will not be achieved by the end of 2006, there will be a major enhancement of the State's economic and social infrastructure by that date. The multi-annual capital envelopes 2004-08 which I announced on budget day will enable substantial funding of the national development plan to continue until the end of 2006. The envelopes will ensure that investment in infrastructure will remain a priority beyond this period.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1108	Our economic record far outshines that of our main European partners. Ireland's gross domestic product grew by an average of 9% between 1997 and 2002, compared to an average of about 2.5% in the Union as a whole. We expect that Ireland will outperform the EU average again in 2003. It is estimated that there will be GDP growth of 2.2%, compared with just 0.4% for the Union as a whole. Securing the competitiveness which has been so instrumental to our economic development, thereby safeguarding jobs, is a key priority for the Government. The recent strengthening of the euro and its negative impact on our competitiveness further emphasises the need to keep domestic costs down.Competition for international projects across all sectors is increasing. In that regard, it is vital that our ability to compete on the international stage is maintained and enhanced. Irish tax policy must have regard to international developments. Any obstacles to our competitive position need to be identified and addressed. The capital gains tax exemption which I announced in budget 2004 will remove what international businesses regard as an incentive to locate their headquarters or holding companies elsewhere. Increased research and development activities can help embed existing firms activities in Ireland as well as develop additional high quality employment. The research and development tax credits, which I also introduced in budget 2004, can be an effective instrument for increasing research and development.If we are to safeguard competitiveness, it is essential that we bring our inflation rate down to that prevailing in our major trading partners as soon as possible. The recent budget will help keep inflation low. The Government made a commitment in Sustaining Progress to working with the social partners to exert downward pressure on inflation. Inflation has fallen from 5.1% in January to 2.3% in October, its lowest level in four years. This is a very welcome development. If we continue to work together in partnership, I am confident that we will address the issue of domestic price pressures in the economy to bring inflation down even further. The implementation of the moderate pay arrangements set out under Sustaining Progress is vital in this context. Keeping public expenditure on target will be important if our inflation rate is to be moderate. I have put in place management and control mechanisms to this end.

I have received the report of the group and it is being considered. Any recommendations contained in the report in respect of medical criteria and other conditions of the scheme will receive full consideration. The report is a substantive one and needs to be studied carefully. I envisage that the report will be made available publicly after it has been completed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1112	As the Deputy will be aware, the proposed draft constitutional treaty for the European Union contains extensive proposals in the area of justice and home affairs. These include provisions in the areas of asylum, immigration and border controls, judicial co-operation in civil matters, judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation. In approaching these articles, the Government has stressed its continuing commitment to co-operation among member states in the fight against crime, especially cross-border crime. It has also sought to ensure that the treaty's contents respect the diversity and distinctiveness of the different legal traditions and systems that apply across the Union, particularly Ireland's common law tradition. It is important that the right balance is achieved. The Government has tabled a number of amendments to that end, which can be consulted on my Department's website, www.irlgov.ie/iveagh, at the convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. The amendments seek unanimity for decision making under a number of articles, including those relating to substantive and procedural criminal law. We have also made a number of technical and drafting amendments aimed at improving and clarifying the text.The Presidency has brought forward a number of helpful proposals responding to the concerns raised by Ireland and a number of other member states. The proposals in the area of criminal law stress the need for differences between legal systems, particularly between the common law and other systems, to be taken into account. They introduce a new provision which would allow a member state to refer a matter to the European Council if it considers that a proposed measure impinges on a fundamental aspect of its legal system. The new proposals are welcome and are under active consideration.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1113	I have attached, for the Deputy's information, details of consultants paid from both Vote 38, foreign affairs, and Vote 39, international co-operation.My Department commissions consultancies where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available in house and, particularly in the case of the development co-operation Ireland, or DCI, programme, where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. DCI consultancies cover a wide range of sectors, including HIV/AIDS, education, health and rural development.Under Vote 38, 94% of expenditure on consultancies for 2002 related to the upgrading of the Department's information technology infrastructure at headquarters and our missions abroad and the automated passport production system. The latter is essential to meet future demands for passports in an efficient and effective manner and to comply with new international security regulations for passports. Once those projects are complete, it is expected that engagement of consultants will be significantly reduced.An outsourcing specialist was recruited last year to oversee the commissioning of consultancies under Vote 39. Since then, procedures and systems have been reviewed and strengthened to ensure that maximum value for money is achieved.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1114	I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 to 165, inclusive, together.In December, 1999 the Minister for Finance announced in his 2000 budget speech that the Government intended to proceed with a new, more radical programme of decentralisation, involving up to 10,000 civil and public servants. That intention was also signalled in the agreed programme for Government for 2002 to 2007, where it was stated that "We will move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies taking into account the National Spatial Strategy".Since his original announcement, the Minister for Finance and his Department have had extensive consultations about the issue with interested parties, including other Departments, civil service staff unions and associations and the strategic management initiative, or SMI, implementation group of Secretaries General. The Minister for Finance also received submissions, representations and enquiries from or on behalf of a large number of centres throughout the country seeking to be included in the new programme.Arising from that process, the Minister for Finance, on 3 December last, sought and received Government approval for the new programme of decentralisation, the details of which he later announced in Dáil Éireann during his 2004 budget speech. Under the programme, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs will be transferred to Limerick. No new legislation or legislative amendments are required. Details of the directorate's staffing and payroll costs are given in the table below.In approving the decentralisation programme, the Government decided that it would be put in place over the next three years, overseen by a special Cabinet sub-committee comprising the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Ministers for Finance and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and that decentralisation would be on a voluntary basis and without the payment of relocation expenses. The Government also approved the establishment of an implementation committee charged with developing a detailed implementation plan and associated communications strategy. The Minister for Finance announced the membership of the committee on 4 December. The committee will be chaired by Mr. Phil Flynn. The other members are Mr. Dermot Quigley, former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Jane Williams, managing director, Sia Group, Mr. Fred Devlin, chartered surveyor, Mr. Eddie Sullivan, Secretary General, PSMD, Department of Finance, and Mr. Seán Benton, chairman, Office of Public Works.

In the first instance any such proposal must have the approval of the patron, and clarification in that regard has been sought. In addition, the proposal must also be examined in the context of existing provision and the likely impact such a change might have on other schools in the area. The agreement of schools in the area is also desirable.When the relevant information is examined, a decision will be made on the proposal and notified to the relevant parties.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1126	Since the original announcement in December 1999, the Department of Finance has received submissions, representations and enquiries on behalf of more than 130 centres throughout the country seeking to be included in the new programme of decentralisation. The Government had to take account of, and balance, a wide range of factors in selecting suitable locations for the new decentralised offices: it is not as simple as listing off a set of qualifying criteria against which the merits of the various towns could be measured. However, I refer the Deputy to page B.25 of the summary of 2004 budget measures which describes the main factors taken into account by the Government in reaching its decision.

No decision has been taken as to which functions or sections will be located in Mullingar and Athlone.The estimated annual payroll cost for the Dublin based staff would be in the order of €14.5 million. Staffing and payroll costs for the bodies under the aegis of the Department which have been included in the programme of decentralisation will be provided directly to the Deputy.The provision of office accommodation is a matter for the Office of Public Works. Suitable accommodation, within Office of Public Works accommodation norms, will be provided for the staff in question.

This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for 2003-04 for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of "top-up" grant for those who are most disadvantaged.The package includes significant increases in the reckonable income limits and in the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education. The increases range from 9.5% to 16.3%, well above the reference increase in the average industrial wage.A decision on the reckonable income limits to apply in respect of the grant schemes for 2004-05 will not be taken until 2004.

In the context of the 2004 Estimates, I recently announced a further improvement in the per capita grant to €274 per pupil, as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. This increase will bring the grant to €312 in the case of disadvantaged schools.

Section 8 of these guidelines contains details of the sanitary facilities to be provided in new school buildings.In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate safeguards in place.Individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. It is open to school management authorities or individuals to make direct contact with the Health and Safety Authority in relation to matters of concern to them and my Department would not necessarily be aware of such communications. Where they are issued, notifications from the Health and Safety Authority are sent to the management authorities of schools, in the first instance.Primary schools are given an annual allocation of €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure.

This includes all consultancies undertaken by the communications, energy and broadcasting functions which transferred to my Department with effect from 18 June 2002.The engagement by my Department of external consultants is generally confined to circumstances where specialised knowledge or expertise, which is not available in the Department or elsewhere in the civil or public service, is required for a temporary period; a need for objectivity and-or independence is deemed essential; a consultancy study is required by an external body ie. the European Union; a specialist study-project must be completed within a very short time scale; while the specialised knowledge or expertise may be available within the Department, performing the task "in house" would involve a prohibitive opportunity cost and-or would be impractical, for example, if staff engaged on other essential duties would have to be diverted.In order to control and minimise expenditure on consultancy my Department's policy is to use and develop its own management skills and services as far as possible and to make every effort to avail of particular skills and experiences which other parts of the public sector may possess. All proposed consultancies are examined in detail and require the specific and prior approval of senior management.Finally, my Department has in the last year also established an evaluation unit which over coming years will provide a cost effective alternative to the engagement of consultancy expertise for the purposes of policy, programme and value for money evaluations, cost benefit analysis and risk assessment.Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources Consultancy Expenditure 2000-2002

Following that announcement, there was extensive consultation with interested parties including officials of the former Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, staff unions and the strategic management initiative implementation group of Secretaries General.The detailed programme which the Minister for Finance announced in the 2004 Budget Statement sets out the next phase in the delivery of the Government's decentralisation strategy. The Minister for Finance met bilaterally with individual Ministers and Secretaries General in advance of budget day to brief them on the scope of the specific decentralisation proposals affecting their Departments and Agencies. At this meeting, the Secretary General of my Department was briefed in respect of the proposed decentralisation of my Department to Killarney and with regard to the three State agencies under the aegis of my Department which are also being decentralised. In turn, the Secretary General briefed the staff, staff representatives and the chief executive officers of the agencies, that is, the Irish Sports Council, the Arts Council and Fáilte Ireland.

With regard to the overall project development, my Department is advised that construction of phase 1 of the new development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital is now complete with the exception of some snagging work which is being carried out by the contractors. This major development is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board, through the sale of surplus lands, and my Department. The projected full project cost is €101.4 million. This includes an amount of €5 million approved earlier this year to facilitate refurbishment works at the hospital which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.My Department has been advised by the ERHA of recent progress in commissioning the new facilities, including for example, the transfer of the coronary care and cardiac unit, the therapeutic psychiatry of old age day hospital and the rheumatology service to the new building. The further commissioning of this development will need to be considered by the ERHA and the Northern Area Health Board having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2004.

The board included a proposal to develop a 50-bed community nursing unit in Tralee as part of its development plan 2000-2006, which was submitted to my Department.A project team was established in May 2001 to progress this development. The project team has identified the preferred site for this development on land attached to Tralee General Hospital. The selected site is a three acre site, accessible from the Killerisk Road, which will allow for the community nursing unit to be developed independently from the general hospital campus.

Even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines a medical card may be awarded if a chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances justify it. All persons may apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide them for themselves or their dependants without hardship.

I indicated at that time my acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan and Monaghan hospital group. I have also accepted that additional services can be developed at the hospital to the benefit of the local community. In particular, I welcomed the proposals in the report aimed at strengthening the management capacity of the hospital within the Cavan and Monaghan group. The central involvement of consultant staff within this new structure is a significant development which should enhance the ability of the group to deliver high quality services.Mr. Bonner recognised in his report that the pattern of acute hospital service delivery is changing world-wide and that Monaghan General Hospital's best guarantee for the future is to participate in and accept those changes which will ensure its future viability. In that context, the report's recommendations on the range and configuration of acute services, including maternity services, to be delivered within the Cavan and Monaghan hospital group are appropriate for consideration by the North-Eastern Health Board.The recently published national task force on medical staffing report or the Hanly report will further inform decisions in that regard. The task force was asked to make recommendations about how to best organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European working time directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the forum on medical manpower.In accordance with the recommendations in the Bonner report, I am making additional capital funding available to the North-Eastern Health Board under the national development plan. In that context, the board has been asked to identify urgent capital needs at Monaghan General Hospital in areas such as refurbishment, fire precaution and other health and safety measures and my Department expects proposals from the board in that regard shortly.

This is also available at www.budget.gov.ie/2004/budmeasu04.aspA wide range of factors was taken into account and balanced against each other in selecting the areas for decentralisation and in determining the new locations. While consultations to date on decentralisation have been of a general nature, I am now establishing a specific group, chaired by an assistant secretary within my Department and including representatives of each unit or agency involved, to implement this decision. Many of the detailed questions raised by the Deputy will fall to that group to consider and address in partnership with those involved. However, by way of illustration, the breakdown of grades in the road haulage division of the Department is as follows:

The review included an assessment of a number of rail proposals, many of which were received as part of the public consultation process.Two rail proposals linking Navan with Dublin were considered – Navan to Drogheda which would link to the Belfast line and a direct link to Connolly Station in Dublin. Following the analysis, neither of the two proposals was considered suitable for inclusion in the recommended investment strategy of the SRR. However, the SRR recognises that circumstances can change and that in certain circumstances it may be appropriate to consider such proposals again.In addition, the SRR recommended that new rail proposals, such as a Navan rail link, must have appropriate and complementary land use, settlement and economic strategies that would provide the economic, social and commercial rationale for the project in place before the viability of any proposal could be assessed. At present, such strategies are not in place locally to support such a rail link. The challenge now lies with the regional and local authorities to develop the business case for new rail proposals, such as the Navan rail link, by bringing forward appropriate strategies which support and complement such proposals.As regards a passenger rail link from Navan to Kingscourt, that was not among the proposals assessed by the SRR consultants. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that the development of such a service is not among the company's current priorities.

It identified provocation, legitimate defence, manslaughter, including corporate manslaughter, causation and proper limits of exculpation. In October 2003 two further consultation papers entitled Corporate Killing and Homicide and the Plea of Provocation were published.I await the completion of the commission's work and the publication of its final report before coming to any decisions on the need for legislative changes.

The application was refused because it had not been established, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa. In particular, it was felt that the applicant had not displayed sufficient evidence of her obligations to return home following her proposed visit. It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal of the visa by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1183	Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, statutory responsibility for the operation of the planning code, that is, the processing of planning applications, is vested in each planning authority, with full responsibility for deciding appeals vested in An Bord Pleanála. Local authorities are independent statutory bodies and, while they operate within a framework of legislation and statutory regulations, they are not subject as a general rule to direction or sanction by the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in specific matters.However, where complaints are made to my Department regarding failure to meet statutory requirements the matter is normally brought to the attention of management at local level. In addition, my Department is also working with planning authorities through the formal consultation mechanism established with the City and County Managers Association with a view to improving their performance on planning matters. My Department is also currently reviewing the operation of planning regulations to ensure that they achieve their aim of improving the efficiency of the planning system.

All of the functions of my Department which operate from Dublin, with the exception of Met Éireann and local Dublin services, are included in the proposals. Arising from the announcement by the Minister for Finance, my Department has held meetings of its partnership committee and departmental council.At present, my Department has approximately 2,266 staff, of whom 904 are in industrial grades deployed at various locations around the country. A considerable number of the remaining staff already work outside Dublin in existing decentralised locations and on field duties. The payroll cost of the non-industrial staff of my Department is €61,109,000 in 2003.Approximately 880 staff, including 800 industrial workers, will be transferred to the Office of Public Works in the new year as part of the transfer of certain operational aspects of heritage management to that body. The National Building Agency and the Local Government Computer Services Board are also included in the decentralisation proposals. Staff numbers for these bodies are 55 and 112.5 respectively, while payroll costs in 2003 are €2,950,000 and €4,093,563 respectively.My Department will fully participate in the central implementation arrangements and has already begun to establish an internal implementation team. Issues relating to accommodation and, if necessary, legislation will be addressed through this process.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1186	Section 33 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that regulations regarding applications for permission may be made requiring, inter alia, that planning authorities must notify prescribed bodies of the receipt of certain classes of development. Article 28 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 lists the bodies prescribed for this purpose, which would include An Taisce.An Taisce is not consulted on all planning applications. The organisation is given notice of planning applications only in circumstances where it appears to the planning authority that the proposed development might impact on matters such as areas of special amenity, protected structures, national monuments and nature conservation. The current list of bodies prescribed for the purposes of planning applications was set out in the 2001 regulations and is kept under review.

This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once off costs of purchase and/or installation of small scale physical security equipment, such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks, security lighting and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist. Where socially monitored alarms previous installed under this scheme are broken, a limited amount of funding is available towards the cost of replacement. The grant will vary in the light of individual circumstances and needs and takes account of the overall demands that must be met. In general, grants will cover 90% of the cost. The maximum level of funding available to any one organisation may not exceed €300,000.The scheme was advertised in both local and national newspapers the week beginning 4 August, with a closing date of 17 September 2003. A sum of €3.4 million has been allocated to the scheme this year.There is no record of any application received from the organisation mentioned in the Deputy's question. Should the group have any queries about applying under next year's scheme, it should contact the voluntary and community services section of my Department. I intend to advertise the scheme earlier next year, most likely in the first quarter.Applications for funding under the 2003 scheme are currently under consideration. I hope to announce details of the grants awarded under the scheme shortly.

The numbers of contracts awarded to companies to undertake consultancies in those years are 16 in 2000, 32 in 2001 and 30 in 2002.Expenditure on consultancy fluctuates from year to year depending on the number and timing of the projects that are being undertaken at any time. The bulk of these consultancies relates to IT related projects undertaken by my Department. My Department is a major user of information and communications technology and, on an ongoing basis, has a range of projects and initiatives under way to update and improve aspects of the system and the technology underpinning it.Every effort is made to ensure that there is minimum recourse to the use of consultants. However, due to the complexity and scale of the projects in which the Department has been engaged, including projects with a cross-departmental dimension, the use of significant levels of consultancy has been unavoidable.

It is intended that a significant proportion of the programme will be completed over the next three years. The details of the decentralisation programme for my Department and the agencies under its aegis, as announced in the budget, are as follows:
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1197	The proposed decentralisation of my Department, as announced by the Minster for Finance in his Budget Statement on Wednesday, 3 December 2003, will not require any amendments to social welfare legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1198	On 26 October, I announced that the Christmas bonus for 2003 will again be paid at a rate equivalent to 100% of the person's normal weekly payment, with a minimum payment of €30. The cost of this measure is estimated to be €115.63 million. Payment of the bonus has been made during the past week and it is estimated that it has benefited 1.23 million persons, comprising 805,000 recipients and an estimated 421,000 dependants.The bonus was paid, as in previous years, to recipients of all long-term social welfare payments, including retirement and old age pensioners, widow's, widower's and one-parent families, carer's allowance, invalidity pension and disability allowance recipients, persons in receipt of farm assist and employment support payments.The focus of the Christmas bonus has always been on long-term welfare payment recipients, who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the long-term. Recipients of short-term payments such as maternity benefit, carer's benefit or disability benefit do not qualify for the Christmas bonus. It is open to persons who have been in receipt of disability benefit for at least one year to be assessed for entitlement to invalidity pension. The Christmas bonus is applicable to invalidity pension.There are no plans to extend entitlement to the bonus payment to the short-term schemes and any such extension could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved.

Half rate CDA may also be paid in respect of a child in certain circumstances, for example, where both of the child's parents are receiving a social welfare payment or where one parent has earnings over a prescribed amount.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1200	The objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to meet immediate, short-term income maintenance needs. The crèche supplements which have been provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme were intended to be a short-term income support for the parents of children who were referred to child care for medical, family support or child protection reasons by the health board public health nurses or social workers. However, in many cases, the supplements in question have been in payment for long durations and for reasons which are outside the scope of the original intention of the scheme.The bulk of the funding for the crèches in question comes from the health board. The board has confirmed that it is examining the financial support it provides and will seek whatever additional funding is deemed necessary within its child care and family support budget for 2004. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for child care supports, is also considering the scope it may have to provide support to the crèches in question. My Department is monitoring the situation and, in the meantime, the board has confirmed that the crèches will not close as a result of the withdrawal of supplementary welfare allowance crèche supplements.
