          <p eId="para_8">Apologies have been received from Deputies Stanley, Sherlock and McAuliffe. The meeting is straddling other business so there may be others unable to attend. We are joined remotely by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee. I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode, or switched off.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Today we begin the first of a two-day engagement with officials from the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service. Before us today, from the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation account 2019, is Vote 24 - Justice and Equality. </p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Tomorrow we will address Vote 21 – Prisons, and from the Comptroller and Auditor General Report on the Accounts of the Public Service 2019, chapter 7 – catering and ancillary services in prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> To assist us in our examination of the Department’s Vote today, and with regard to public health guidelines, we are joined in person by the following officials from the Department of Justice: Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General, Ms Martina Colville, assistant secretary, and Mr. Seamus Clifford, principal officer. We are also joined remotely by Ms Oonagh Buckley, deputy Secretary General, Mr. Doncha O’Sullivan, assistant secretary, and Mr. David Delaney, deputy head of immigration service delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> We are also joined remotely by Liam Gleeson from the justice Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> I welcome everyone to the meeting and thank them and the staff in the Department for the briefing material they have prepared for the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other person in their evidence. Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. </p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I also ask that members and witnesses remove their masks when speaking to ensure they can be heard, and that when members are leaving and taking their seats, they sanitise their area.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">The 2019 appropriation account for Vote 24 records gross expenditure of €540 million. This was an increase of €84 million, or nearly 19%, on the prior year.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The expenditure was distributed across five programmes. These are defined in terms of strategic objectives, such as: a safe and secure Ireland; and access to justice for all. Within the programmes, in addition to provision for standard administration functions, there are funding lines for key schemes and services operated directly as part of the Department, such as the Probation Service, the Immigration and Naturalisation Service and the Forensic Science Laboratory. Funding is also provided for a number of State bodies that have a separate statutory existence, that operate under the aegis of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The largest expenditure programme relates to the range of services that together aim to provide an efficient, responsive and fair immigration asylum and citizenship system. In 2019, the total spend for that programme was €223 million. This was up almost €62 million, or 38%, year-on-year. The largest component of this spending related to the cost of accommodation for asylum seekers, which totalled just under €130 million in 2019. The Department has attributed the 66% increase year-on-year in the spending on such accommodation to an increase in the numbers of asylum seekers accommodated, and to significantly greater reliance on more expensive emergency accommodation arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Members may wish to note that responsibility for asylum seekers’ accommodation, along with a number of other subheads, has now been transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Processing of asylum applications remains the responsibility of the Department of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account. However, I drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial control relating to material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules that occurred in respect of contracts that operated in 2019.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">Before I ask for her opening statement, I would like to congratulate Ms McPhillips on her appointment as Secretary General of the Department. While she attended meetings of the previous committee, I understand this is her first appearance as Accounting Officer, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to wish you every success in the role.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Can we have your opening statement please?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee on the 2019 appropriation account for the justice and equality Vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The Department’s Vote covers a wide remit, encompassing both the criminal justice and civil pillars, and a very broad range of offices and agencies across the justice sector. In all, there are approximately 60 individual subheads across five expenditure programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> In 2019, the Department completed the largest restructuring in our 100-year history. This transformation programme reshaped the organisation to more effectively deliver our strategic objectives; improve transparency and accountability; and create efficiencies through clearly defined roles and responsibilities. This represented a step-change in how a Department is structured and operates, and turned the traditional Civil Service model on its head.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> In the traditional model, the Department was structured by subject matter relating to different parts of the justice and equality sectors. Staff worked across a wide range of activities, continually prioritising a competing variety of tasks, with differing levels of complexity, importance and urgency. The transformation programme moved us from this conventional subject-based model, for instance, policing or immigration, to a functional model where we deal with policy and legislation, facilitating the development of specialisation and expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> While the formal restructuring element of the transformation programme was concluded in 2019, additional work continues to support and leverage the full value of our new structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">A subgroup of the management board is developing initiatives to further develop our organisational culture in support of our vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland. We also reviewed the Department’s ICT infrastructure and capacity to deliver digital services. Work is under way to implement a new ICT strategy, with digital reform set to be a key priority in our forthcoming strategy statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The transformation programme has sought to rebuild the Department to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. This year’s global pandemic has provided a significant test of this new structure. Overall, our functional model has enabled us not only to react but also to respond dynamically to the crisis. Although some service delivery areas have been quite severely impacted, our teams have a more focused remit and despite this unprecedented crisis, our functional structure has provided the capacity to retain a focus on long-term issues. We have been able to refrain from diverting entire teams to crisis response and instead have been able to preserve that focus and keep work going on longer-term issues through our dedicated strategic policy units.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Our legislation functions have been agile in supporting Government to develop and progress proposals. Since the outset of the crisis, our governance functions have played a central role in facilitating and driving collaboration and cohesion between the key agencies in the justice sector, while our operations units supported the establishment of crisis response teams in our key service delivery areas. Our unique transparency function has co-ordinated and managed an unprecedented demand for information throughout the crisis for all our stakeholders and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Regarding the transfer of functions, as the Vice Chairman referenced and as members are aware, the Government established a new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which required a transfer of functions order and the transfer of functions such as disability, equality, migrant integration, international protection accommodation, which is known as direct provision, and the Irish Refugee Protection Programme. This necessitated approximately 95 colleagues transferring, along with their work, to the newly created Department with effect from 14 October last. A relatively small number of issues relating to youth justice transferred in our direction and are now managed by our criminal policy function. This work mainly relates to the bail supervision scheme, which provides courts with an alternative to remanding a child in detention; a research partnership with the school of law, University of Limerick, which is aimed at the development of effective youth offender programmes; as well as a project under the Dormant Accounts Fund, building on the Greentown report which is developing interventions to protect children from the malign influence of criminal networks.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> As members will be aware, there are a large number of agencies under the overall remit, some of which are funded from this Vote. I refer in particular to Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, which had a significant underspend in 2019 relating to the long planned new purpose-built laboratory. I am glad to report that construction started on that building in March and it is well under way, despite the impact of the pandemic on construction activities in the earlier part of the year. This new laboratory will provide FSI with a modern, state-of-the art facility, supporting the highest standards for evidence processing, analysis and storage. The aim is to have a forensic facility meeting all standards for the avoidance of contamination and the recovery, identification and interpretation of trace forensic evidence, including DNA. This represents a significant and important investment in the criminal justice system. The new building is expected to be completed in the summer of 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I will also mention the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB. While expenditure incurred for the bureau is reflected in the Vote, at €9.860 million in 2019, the other side of the equation is not apparent from the account as the moneys collected go directly to the Exchequer. The money returned to the State as a result of CAB actions was in excess of €3.9 million in 2019, which includes €1.6 million returned under the proceeds of crime legislation, just over €2 million collected under Revenue legislation, and €300,000 recovered in social welfare overpayments. The bulk of these actions related to the proceeds of drug trafficking, followed by fraud and theft.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> In addition, the value of assets frozen during the year was €64.9 million, which is a very significant figure, compared with €8.4 million in 2018. That increase is due in the main to a significant seizure of cryptocurrency to the value of €53 million. There were 326 individual assets frozen, including financial assets, property, vehicles and jewellery. In all, CAB brought 31 new proceeds of crime proceedings before the High Court in 2019, the largest number of new cases commenced by the bureau in a single year. At an international level, CAB has maintained strong links and continues to liaise with law enforcement and judicial authorities throughout Europe and worldwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> The work of the Legal Aid Board is also funded from this Vote. The board operates a total of 30 full-time and 12 part-time offices. It employs approximately 420 staff and provides services both via directly employed solicitors and panels of private practitioners who are engaged to provide services such as Abhaile and to service District Court family law matters. The board also provides free family mediation services in 16 family mediation offices, some of which are co-located with their law centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> In the context of the pandemic and the need to prioritise services and safety for our most vulnerable citizens, the Department developed an inter-agency action plan to help support people at increased risk of domestic abuse during this period. Members will have heard about the Garda Operation Faoiseamh, most recently this morning. This was supported by priority measures across the entire system, including by the Legal Aid Board and the Courts Service, for domestic abuse, sexual assault and child protection cases. The Legal Aid Board help line is helping to deliver prompt legal advice and legal representation in court. I will leave it at that, although I am happy to go into further detail if members wish me to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">If I could come in on that, the Deputy's figure of around €15,000 would be broadly accurate based on the daily rate the Secretary General quoted. On the breakdown in terms of what we spent on accommodation and providing food and the like, effectively it is an all-in day rate to provide those services, full stop. We would not break it down by those categorisations and we would not be able to get those figures, unfortunately. That is because that is the way the contract is negotiated; it is an all-in figure for an overall service as such.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">If I might come in to assist my colleague, because we are simply paying for a managed service, the State-owned facilities come in at less than €20 per head per night - €19.50 is the figure I have in my head. I am talking about 2019. Regarding the older facilities where they were providing the full service but not providing access to independent living and to the better services required under the McMahon standards, we are averaging at around €35 per head per night. Obviously, with the introduction of the McMahon standards and because we were procuring accommodation in the middle of a very tight accommodation market, the prices did go up and so the figure quoted by Mr. Delaney of €45 per head per night is roughly the figure we were achieving in our contractual negotiations around the new procured properties with higher standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">They also required capital works to bring them in line with what was necessary under the proposals of Mr. Justice McMahon.</p>

The other standard inspection is carried out by an independent inspection company. They do a thorough inspection of all the standards. We also invite residents to report any issues they may have regarding food or difficulties with the local manager. Of course, they also have access to the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.

We can send another official to check that whatever is imperfect, such as a problem with showers, for example, is remedied. Ultimately, if the issue is not resolved for some time, we will end the contract. That is the biggest issue. That would only be done after we had worked hard with the operator to ensure it brings standards up to speed because, particularly in 2019, we needed to ensure we had as many beds as possible available to us in order that we were not putting people into hotels as an alternative.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">I was delighted to hear that construction of the new Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, laboratory is proceeding. What is the timescale for it to be completed and fully operational?</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> I understand that tied into that is a proposal relating to, for instance, unidentified human remains. There is no central database within the Department or the forensic science area in that regard. In other words, if remains are found in Cork, the information stays in Cork. If remains are found in Dublin, the information remains in Dublin. Are there proposals to incorporate such a central database into the new development of the FSI laboratory?</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> On the issue of asylum and those coming here to seek asylum, this will continue to be an issue with which we must deal. Has a plan been made by the Department in the past ten or 12 years in respect of the purchase of permanent support locations rather than locations being rented? Is there a proposal relating to capital expenditure in this area? Why has such a strategy not been adopted at any stage in recent years? This is not an issue that will change. We need to have a more permanent structure in place for dealing with it. </p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I refer to an issue relating to the €53 million of frozen assets.

          <p eId="para_75"> On the Deputy's point regarding unidentified remains, obviously this is a very difficult issue for the families involved. The DNA database that the FSI operates has made significant strides in this regard in recent years. Unidentified remains are now routinely examined for DNA and those records are retained in the DNA database at the FSI laboratory. On National Missing Persons Day, the FSI routinely invites families to come forward and give samples of their DNA such that if it is possible to make a match in the future, that is done.</p>

I am not quite sure what it is like elsewhere but I know CAB is still the envy of many other countries as to how it operates. One of the reasons is because it is not a criminal but a civil process. One has to take a great deal of care and ensure there is sufficient room for people to challenge it. That is what keeps it strong and upheld.

          <p eId="para_99">When we call it emergency accommodation, what we are talking about is hotel rooms. It is not dissimilar to the way in which people who are homeless and who are Irish natives are accommodated. We have been consistent on the record saying it is a suboptimal approach to the housing of asylum seekers. However much one might criticise direct provision centres proper, they have facilities provided in them and they are a much better set-up in terms of people's capacities. Then, as we had to do for all of 2019, we had to rent hotel rooms and put people in them when they arrived in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> In terms of evaluation, they were procured under an expressions of interest process. The accommodation was assessed based on various norms. The persons running them would have had to meet requirements like having tax clearance and so forth. It was never the intention that they were going to be run like direct provision centres. It was only ever that we were effectively renting rooms in hotels. That is what emergency accommodation is.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">In some cases I understand there is a third party, a cog in the wheel between the Department and the hotels. Is it individuals or companies that the Department would work with on a contract basis to find suitable accommodation?</p>

          <p eId="para_104">Some of this predates my time in the Department, so I am reading on the basis of what was done. In essence what happened was that in September 2018, we got to the point of running out of accommodation in formal centres. There were a few instances where some people could not be accommodated which was not appropriate or in compliance with our obligations. At that point, I understand the Department approached the Dublin Region Homeless Executive which had used the services of a company in the previous summer. That company was suggested by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive as a suitable way of trying to find accommodation in short order.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">No. Subsequently, I believe other companies were used. I would not have all of that information before me, primarily because responsibility for this area has largely moved on to our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We could, if the Deputy wishes, source the names of those companies and come back to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">That would be useful. Ms Buckley mentioned that this was primarily hotel accommodation. Is it not fair to say that in some cases it involves dwellings, for want of a better term, in remote areas? In other words, houses would be used for the purposes of emergency accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I congratulate Ms McPhillips on her appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> The main role of the Probation Service is to protect the public and create safer communities by helping offenders to desist from committing more crime. In that, it is trying to reduce reoffending and manage offenders' safety in the community by reintegrating prisoners after release while providing an effective and efficient value for money service. What portion of the €41 million budget in the Probation Service involves an restorative justice approach?</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I cannot answer that off the top of my head but I can get an answer for the Deputy. A number of particular restorative justice projects are funded from the Probation Service. A significant proportion of the budget, around €16 million, goes to fund grant-aid bodies which provide services. Some of these are traditional bodies such as addiction services and so forth. There is a long list of them which I can provide to the Deputy. To some degree, some of that would be in the restorative line.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">The courts, in particular, with respect to more minor offences that would attract a lower sentencing rate generally would refer an offender like that to the Probation Service for assessment as to whether the person was suitable for a community service order and depending on how that assessment went the court would decide to assign it.

I note Ms McPhillips in her opening remarks stated that the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, had collected €1.6 million under the proceeds or crime legislation and €2 million in Revenue seizures, and assets of €64.9 million were frozen in 2019, €53 million from crypto-currency, compared to €8.4 million in 2018. Have there been specific new targets from CAB from 2018 to 2019? It appears all these figures have increased. Ms McPhillips might give the committee more information on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I thank the witnesses for taking time out to be here with us. Regarding legal aid, expenditure in 2019 was in the region of €68 million. It is a demand-led scheme. The fees and expenses due to legal practitioners are in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme under the Criminal Justice Act. The Judiciary is responsible for granting legal aid. What controls has the Department over the expenditure of legal aid and custody issues? If it is a demand-led scheme, who is responsible for its oversight?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">The way it works is that if a person appears in court tomorrow morning and is granted legal aid by the judge, the staff in the court office will sign off on that. Those claims will go to our accounts branch in Killarney for payment. There is a check in the court office and in Killarney. The other check on it is that often they are mirrored by the payments the Director of Public Prosecutions makes, so we match those up to make sure those are in line as well and, obviously, there is auditing form time to time.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Up to a certain point, we investigate them internally. Our internal audit unit set up a special process in 2015 to deal with these, and we put it in internal audit because it has a certain independence from the Department. This enabled it to follow issues through even where a finding was not made. If it found things that needed to be picked up on, it followed them through in its audit. Since 2017 or thereabouts, we have referred them for external assessment to give us that arm's length from the Department.</p>

I do not think this was what was envisaged under the Act. Obviously, the ideal is that we do not reach a protected disclosure process at all because employees feel empowered to speak up, make their views known and raise concerns within the organisation.

          <p eId="para_205">I can give the Vice Chairman the costs. Regarding the numbers, one thread that does run through it is that we tend to get a lot of issues relating to other Departments, so when they are assessed, they are not actually protected disclosures for the Department of Justice. It is just that the title of the Department almost attracts people to write to us raising their issues, so we would refer those to the appropriate body.

          <p eId="para_220">I want to return to the expenditure on direct provision. When we learn of problems in this area very often it emerges in the public arena or people make contact with us. We saw some very unsatisfactory cases this year, with one group of people having to move from one hotel to another owing to a Covid issue. These people were moved from a hotel in Dublin to a hotel in Kerry and there followed quite a large outbreak of the virus which drew attention to the facilities in this area. Another situation that emerged was also very unsatisfactory. </p>
          <p eId="para_221"> This committee monitors value for money. The Comptroller and Auditor General has done a paper for the committee on how we define value for money, which is more than just about the financial in that it is about good outcomes as well. Sometimes it is very difficult to figure out why something is so unsatisfactory. One situation emerged that was very unsatisfactory in terms of the length of time it took to be resolved. It is okay saying that people can engage with the ombudsman and so on but that takes time and people are living their lives, perhaps, in very overcrowded facilities. In some situations, there was no door on a room and, as such, no privacy. All of this information was in the public arena earlier this year. I do not understand why that took so long to resolve.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">In March, we had to move very quickly to procure over 800 beds in order that people could be separated because of the issues raised by the Deputy. We were very concerned in terms of Covid to ensure that people were distanced to the greatest extent possible. We had to procure 850 new temporary beds for direct provision in the space of weeks in March. Very good work was done in that regard. The proof of the pudding is that people were kept safe. While some people did obviously, unfortunately, get sick from time to time, nobody got very seriously ill.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">Yes, but that is what the work being done was trying to avoid and, largely, it did. In terms of the overall population, the number was small but very unfortunate for the people who got sick. The objective was to try to prevent spread and, by and large, that worked fairly well, especially with co-operation from our colleagues in public health.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">The issue was less than a miscommunication. The rules in place in the HSE at that time concerning who needed to be communicated with if there was a positive case did not include the people who were residents in that particular hotel, which was, in fact, an emergency centre, because they were not close contacts of the person who was the positive case. The HSE has consistently said in the hearings that there would not have been any circumstances in which it would have been felt necessary to communicate that information to the Department of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> As the Secretary General said, we are no longer responsible for this area but up to the point for which we were responsible for it, we worked extremely closely with the HSE, the Department of Health and public health colleagues in the context of the Catherine Day proposals and the development of the White Paper, which is now being led by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in terms of how to improve, among other things, the health services being offered to asylum seekers.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">It was planned from August. It was agreed at NPHET's request that the HSE would do a round of serial testing, bearing in mind that in any case where there were suspected cases or positive cases there would have been extensive testing in individual centres. In terms of serial testing across the direct provision system, that was organised over the space of a few weeks. We had to co-operate very closely with the HSE to get it done. It raised technical issues for the HSE that were difficult. It was rolled out very intensively. There were very limited positive results from it. Many thousands of people were tested as part of that serial testing but the rates found were not sufficient and the HSE subsequently recommended to NPHET, and it was agreed, that it would not be an exercise that would be repeated.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">I will take this question. Early in the pandemic, the Department of Justice made a decision that we would reduce occupancy of rooms to no more than three non-family members. In the majority of cases, it was down to two following on from the extra capacity that had been brought on board. However, all of those data have now been transferred to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We can ask it to come back with an estimate of how many rooms still have three non-related persons living in them. It may have a difficulty providing that information because the numbers ebb and flow all of the time. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth provided us with global numbers in preparation for this meeting, which have change significantly over the last three weeks in terms of people in emergency centres and people in other centres and so forth. What is provided will be snapshot but we will ask for it to be provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">Someone sees the advertisement in the paper and says he or she will source 40 beds in rural Ireland for the Department. Does the Department then agree a price with the person? Does it say it will pay a certain amount? Is it accommodation dependent?</p>

          <p eId="para_268">In order for us to enter into contractual negotiations of that nature, the property would need to have been sourced and inspected to make sure it met the standards we needed, even for emergency accommodation. At that juncture, negotiations would be entered. The two variables are the price per day and the length of the contract. Many of the contracts would be much shorter term than the standard contracts that are done under the regional procurement exercise we spoke of earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">This is the bit I do not understand. The Department inspects the property and ensures that it is suitable, and the hotel - if we assume it is an hotel - gets a fixed price, but then we decide to pay somebody else in between another couple of pounds along the way. It is more than a couple of pounds, however; in fact, we are talking about tens of thousands of euro. What is the need for that intermediary?</p>

          <p eId="para_270">In general terms, the intermediary would often be running the centre as well. They would source the accommodation and then manage the surrounding facilities that we require, such as the food, the Wi-Fi and all the other bits and pieces that are a necessary part of the provision in the centre. What we can do is get our colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to explain the purpose and use of those intermediaries, and how they go about it. We can supply that to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">I can almost accept the principle of engaging somebody who, apparently, knows what he or she is doing in terms of managing property and dealing with many people. That was the scenario, yet we found out that even the basic human right to get an education was not factored in. In one instance, children went for months without any education. In another, after the Department had gone through this professional body, the residents were lumped onto a bus and taken from one end of the county to the other for a weekend to facilitate a wedding. I would have thought that if we were spending this amount of money on a professional service, the minimum the Department would ensure is that those basic mistakes could not be made. If someone was acting as an intermediary and earning substantial money, there should be a reasonable standard to which he or she is expected to adhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">We have put quite a lot of work into this in recent years. We have set up a dedicated funds unit and gathered up grant schemes and projects from various units throughout the Department. They have now been centralised in one unit with that objective in mind.

          <p eId="para_323">Somewhat oddly, it is within the Department's Vote. Expenditure is very small at the moment. It was only set up in December 2019. It did not draw down its full funding in that year. It will spend slightly more in 2020. As it gets up and running over the next few years we may consider separating it, but at the moment it is so small that it does not warrant a separate Vote.</p>

For example, let us take the work on domestic abuse during the pandemic, where the Department led work across the agencies but also within the Department itself. That was a multi-functional team drawn from policy, transparency, and our law side and they worked together with the agencies to put together the work on domestic abuse. It worked very much with the NGO sector in bringing forward the awareness campaign. That was done in weeks.

In a situation where there is genuine urgency in a procurement, we would regard that as compliant once the urgency is demonstrated.

          <p eId="para_381">I think if Twitter was reflecting a view and we were not aware of it, the Deputy would probably be asking me questions about that. We have to live in the 21st century, so we do.</p>

          <p eId="para_382">I find it strange because the Department does not need Twitter to tell officials the views of many people in respect of the direct provision system. They have heard the views at numerous committees in the House and from the floor of the Dáil. There is a well-established public position relating to the utilisation of private companies to provide accommodation to the most vulnerable people who happen to be in our country. There are certainly areas where every Department would probably benefit from hearing messages on social media, but the message has been given loud and clear from all these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> I will move on from that a little. We have an EO carrying out media monitoring and social media monitoring.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">Then why did the Department pay €32,000 up to August this year on a private company to monitor the media?</p>

          <p eId="para_386">Again, that is drawn from an Office of Government Procurement framework. That is a service provided across Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_387">The Department of Justice spent substantially more than most other Departments on that service.</p>

          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_388">I do not know whether that is the case but I can check it - that is no problem. I do not think it could be more than other Departments.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">The Vice Chairman will confirm that parliamentary questions she and I submitted across all Departments showed that the Department of Justice is among the highest in respect of expenditure by Departments on media monitoring.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_332">
          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">If I could, perhaps I will correct myself. Our media read-out is probably far greater than most Departments. We have many topics that are of interest to the public and there is a great deal in the newspapers every day about them. I imagine that is where it comes from.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_333">
          <from> Vice Chairman<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_391">I wish to refer to training and development and incidental expenses. There is a reference to contracted services and an additional €2 million in expenditure. Is that for one particular company? Is that across a range of different services?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_334">
          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2020-12-09T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_392">Under contract services there is a figure of €2 million for external services. The largest user of that within the Department, as my colleague said earlier, is internal audit. That figure was €1.7 million. The funds administration unit that I mentioned expended €678,000. The companies that received those payments were under contract. KOSI Corporation received €956,000 and Ernst and Young received €681,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">One point raised earlier related to people who were refused entry. If there is no immediate flight available, they are held in prisons. There was a high-profile case at the weekend. Does the Department look at the cost of this, apart from the human cost to individuals? I understand the young woman was ten days, if not two weeks, in the Dóchas Centre. Obviously, there is a cost associated with that. I understand that the cost of flights is borne by the carrier. I found that out today and it came as a surprise. Is that calculated? Is it simply part of the Prison Service?</p>

          <p eId="para_399">Many people who arrive do not arrive from the EU. The Department maintains they are arriving from outside the EU. Many countries outside the EU will not have direct flights into the country. I presume they come through another country.</p>

Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefing provided for today's meeting? Agreed. At tomorrow's meeting we will examine matters relating to the Irish Prison Service.</p>
